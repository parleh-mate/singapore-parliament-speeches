<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed</b> asked the Prime Minister if he

will   give  more  details  on  the  bilateral  trade  financing

guarantee  scheme that he has offered to assist  the  Indonesian

Government to overcome the currency and economic crisis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Prime Minister how soon can

the  proposed US$3 billion bilateral trade financing scheme  for

Indonesia be implemented and whether the details of the proposed

scheme  can  be given to businessmen early to prepare themselves

to resume trade with their counterparts in Indonesia quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may I have your permission to take Questions 1 and 2 together as

they are both related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Thank you. The Singapore Government

originally  proposed  a  Multilateral  Trade  Finance  Guarantee

Scheme  to  help  resolve the trade finance  problems  faced  by

Indonesian   firms.    However,   the   G7   countries,    whose

participation  is  vital  since they  are  the  largest  trading

partners   of  Indonesia,  prefer  their  own  bilateral   trade

financing schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28th February 1998, then Minister for Finance Mar'ie

Muhammad asked our Finance Minister Richard Hu to have Singapore

launch  the Multilateral Trade Finance Guarantee scheme  on  our

own.   On  2nd March 1998, then Minister for Trade and  Industry

Tunky  Ariwibowo  repeated  the request  to  our  Ambassador  in

Jakarta,  Edward Lee.  On 20th March, in Jakarta,  the  Minister

for  Trade and Industry Muhammad Hasan made the same request  to

Ambassador Lee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to these requests, Singapore decided to launch

a  Singapore-Indonesia Bilateral Trade Finance Guarantee  (BTFG)

Scheme.   I  wrote to President Soeharto on 31st March informing

him   of  Singapore's  decision  to  establish  the  BTFG  after

Indonesia and the IMF have reached an agreement on their  latest

round  of negotiations.  He called me up in London on 2nd  April

to thank Singapore for its decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BTFG is a bilateral scheme to enhance confidence in

trade  financing transactions undertaken by banks in  Indonesia.

The  aim  is to help restore established trade between  the  two

countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore has no experience designing or operating a

government-sponsored trade finance guarantee scheme, we have  to

start cautiously and modestly.  Initially, the scheme will  only

provide  export  credit insurance for our  domestic  exports  to

Indonesia.  After we have gained experience with the scheme,  we

will  expand  it  to  cover  retained  imports  from  Indonesia.

Singapore will use US$3 billion out of the US$5 billion that  it

has  earlier  pledged to Indonesia for its IMF package  to  back

this facility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will eventually expand the scheme further to cover

exports through Singapore by Indonesia's trading partners who do

not  have  their  own  bilateral  export  credit  schemes.   The

remaining  US$2 billion of the US$5 billion that  Singapore  has

pledged to Indonesia will be used for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conceptually, we have the following mechanism in mind.

ECICS Credit Insurance Ltd will administer the Scheme.  ECICS is

an  unlisted public company that is in the business of  insuring

Singapore  exports against risks of non-payment.  The  Singapore

Government  will select several banks operating in Indonesia  to

be  designated  as  Trade Finance Banks (TFBs).   We  will  also

identify  a group of Singapore exporters to participate  in  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian importers will approach one of the approved TFBs

to issue a Letter of Credit for a sales transaction secured with

an   approved  Singapore  exporter.   The  TFB  will  bear   the

commercial risk on this transaction.  The Letter of Credit  will

be  presented  to  the  Singapore-based bank  of  the  Singapore

exporter.   Bank Indonesia will guarantee fully the  obligations

of   the  TFB  to  this  Singapore-based  bank.   The  Singapore

Government, in turn, counter-guarantees part of Bank Indonesia's

obligations  under  the  scheme.  The Singapore  exporters,  the

Singapore-based bank and ECICS will share in some of this  risk.

This  is necessary to ensure that each party in the scheme  does

due diligence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the TFB fails to honour its obligation on the Letter of

Credit  it has issued,  Bank Indonesia's unconditional guarantee

will apply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme will run for an initial period of two years or

until  the Indonesian trade finance cycle is restored, whichever

is  earlier.  However, the Government of Singapore reserves  the

right  to  discontinue the Scheme in the event of  a  change  in

circumstances which renders it no longer relevant or valid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Indonesian officials will meet to flesh out

the scheme soon.  I am unable to say now the exact date when the

BTFG scheme will come into operation.  We will need some time to

work  out the procedures and rules to create an effective scheme

which  will  achieve its objectives.  We are seeking  help  from

international experts.  We know its importance for Indonesia and

will endeavour to get it going as soon as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> May I ask

the  Prime Minister whether his Government is still of the  view

that  no  approval is needed from Parliament and  the  President

before  the Government embarks on this guarantee scheme  despite

the  opinion given by the Attorney-General on Article  144  when

the  Attorney-General said it did not apply to  loans  but  only

apply  to guarantees?   Would the Prime Minister explain why  he

thinks this guarantee is also not caught by Article 144?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the same question has

been  asked  several times by Mr Jeyaretnam of both  the  Deputy

Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, and both Ministers have

explained  the situation quite clearly.   I am of the view  that

the Attorney-General has advised me very well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the guarantee part, this comes under the Monetary

Authority of Singapore (MAS).  MAS will issue the guarantee  and

under the MAS Act there is provision for the Authority to do  so

without  our  having  to  come to Parliament  or  going  to  the

President.   I can assure the Member and also the other  Members

of  the  House  that we would do things in accordance  with  the

Constitution. If there is a need to come to Parliament, we  will

come to Parliament.  There is no question about that.  There  is

no difficulty in that.  If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1895</b></font><br><br>



we  have  to  seek the President's approval, we  will  seek  the

President's approval.  In this particular case, the MAS Act  has

allowed us to proceed with the scheme without our having to come

to Parliament or to seek the President's approval.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Another supplementary question for the

Prime Minister.  We have heard about the MAS Act.  But is it not

his  view and the Government's view that the Constitution is the

supreme law of the country and takes precedence over any Act?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is a lawyer. The Attorney-General is the person to answer the question. I have been

advised  by  the Attorney-General that what we do  is  perfectly

constitutional.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Has the Attorney-General now advised that

Article 144 does not apply to guarantees as well?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> He has not advised me but I have read

the  arguments between the Finance Minister and the Deputy Prime

Minister  with Mr Jeyaretnam, and that advice was given  to  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister and it is part  of  the  advice  to  the

Government.

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

(a)  whether the number of illegal immigrants arrested is on the

rise;  (b)  whether the number has reached a  level  which  will

endanger our security; and (c) whether our resources are  being

stretched in trying to put this problem under control.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  number of illegal  immigrants  arrested  in

January  1998  and February 1998 were 431 and 644  respectively.

The number for March 1998 was 2,086.  The increase in arrests is

due mainly to more intensive enforcement action by the Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cause for alarm. Police operations are aimed

at containing the illegal immigration problem to prevent it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>



from  getting  out  of  hand.  They are a warning  to  potential

illegal  immigrants that they should not come  to  Singapore  as

there is no work for them and that the Police are alert.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that more illegal immigrants are arrested does not

indicate a deterioration in the security situation in Singapore.

For  March  1998, the number of illegal immigrants arrested  for

criminal  activities  was only 32.  The security,  and  law  and

order situation in Singapore is firmly under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests of illegal immigrants demonstrate that the

Police  and  the  other  Home Team agencies  such  as  Singapore

Immigration  and Prisons are, for the present, well-equipped  to

deal with this problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, could the Minister

comment  on the adequacy of the current penalties to  deal  with

the   various   immigration  offences:    overstayers,   illegal

immigrants, syndicates who run such rings, and if they  are  not

adequate, whether he intends to revise them in the future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the current penalties for most of

the offences under the Immigration Act are adequate.  But we are

now  looking at amending some parts of it to make the  penalties

heavier  for certain types of offences, for example,  attempting

illegal  entry, abetting in bringing in illegal immigrants  into

Singapore,  and so on.  When the details are finalised,  I  will

move the amendments in this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister  if  it  is true that there have been recent  cases  in

which  we  have caught illegal immigrants actually  leaving  the

country?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, these are well publicised in the

newspapers.  It is true.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask the Minister what is the reasoning

behind  this:   why do we want to catch people who  are  already

leaving the country?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The reason is that when they come in

here illegally they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>



have  committed an offence.  If they have committed an act which

is  not lawful and when the police has received such information

they  must act.  It is only natural that they must act.  If not,

they are not doing their job.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it is comforting

to know that the situation is under control.  Would the Minister

take  the  matter  to its source where these illegal  immigrants

came  from and inform the governments and media there to  spread

the  news  of the consequences of coming here illegally?   There

are  people  who  come  here  illegally  and  get  arrested  and

sometimes  they  are not aware of the situation till  they  come

here.   I  am  asking whether the Minister will be  prepared  to

liaise with the governments concerned and the media as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, it requires more than just

government  effort  to tell these people who  come  from  China,

India,  Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Philippines,  Thailand,

Indonesia   all  the countries around us  that they  should  not

come here illegally.  I am sure the embassies here also do their

job.   They  know that our Police are taking enforcement  action

against  people  who had come in illegally or overstayed  beyond

the validity of their social visit passes.  They report back  to

their  governments and they could also help us by telling  their

people not to come here illegally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, we have already passed the message to all

these illegal immigrants and overstayers that when they go home,

please  tell their friends not to come here illegally.  We  give

them  newspaper cuttings and a lot of information, for  example,

when  they are in prison, we educate them to come here  legally,

if  they  want to, otherwise they should not try to  come  here.

The  programmes on our television are being watched in parts  of

Malaysia  and  Batam  and I am sure those who  watch  television

would also know that police enforcement action is very intensive

and they should not try to enter Singapore illegally.

<div align="center"><b>HIRING OF ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, in

the  light  of  the  number of illegal  immigrants  coming  into

Singapore, whether there has been an increase in the  number  of

employers hiring illegal workers, and, if so, whether he intends

to  amend  the  legislation to increase the penalties  for  such

employers.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my  Ministry's enforcement officers arrested 1,884 illegal

foreign  workers in 1997.  This includes 333 foreigners who  had

entered  Singapore  illegally  or  had  over-stayed  beyond  the

validity of their social visit passes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first two months of this year, an average of 234

illegal foreign workers were arrested per month compared to  the

monthly  average of 157 last year.  Out of the total 468 illegal

foreign workers arrested in January and February this year,  117

were  immigration  offenders.  The presence of  illegal  workers

creates   social  problems,  affects  our  law  and  order   and

undermines economic upgrading.  In view of the current threat of

illegal  immigration,  we will intensify our  efforts  and  work

closely  with  the  Police  to ferret out  the  illegal  foreign

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illegal foreign workers and those caught employing them

face  stiff  penalties  under the law.  They  can  be  fined  or

jailed.  Employers of more than five immigration offenders  will

be  caned.   My Ministry prosecuted 540 employers for  employing

illegal  foreign  workers  in 1997.   While  the  Employment  of

Foreign  Workers Act provides for mandatory imprisonment  for  a

second  offence, my Ministry has sought deterrent  sentences  on

some  first-time offenders.  This had resulted in  three  first-time  offenders  being sent to jail in 1997.  The  maximum  jail

sentence  meted  out  was  100  weeks  to  a  proprietor  of   a

construction  company  which  employed  more  than  100  illegal

foreign  workers.  The principal contractor of  that  particular

work  site  was  also  fined nearly $1.5 million.   Furthermore,

three   employers  of  immigration  offenders  had  been  caned.

Notwithstanding  the increase in the number of  illegal  workers

arrested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>



recently,  the  penalties  are  still  adequate.   However,   my

Ministry  will monitor the situation closely and, if  necessary,

adopt more deterrent measures to check illegal employment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> From the numbers given by the Minister,

I  get  the impression that illegal immigrant workers constitute

about one-third of illegal foreign workers.  The number seems to

be  stabilising.   So  there is no cause for  concern  that  the

economic  incentive  is  attracting people  across  our  borders

illegally  to  find jobs.  Is that a correct assessment  of  the

situation, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, while that may be so from the

figures  that  I  have just given, we should not be  complacent.

There  is  always  an incentive for some illegal  immigrants  to

sneak  into Singapore to look for employment opportunities.   We

will continue to maintain the pressure of enforcement action  at

the work sites where such illegal immigrants tend to crop up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister, Sir, whether the

Ministry  makes  any distinction between people  who  enter  the

country  illegally  to work here and those whose  stay  in  this

country  is rendered illegal by the employers terminating  their

employment  well  in  advance of the term for  which  they  were

granted work permits?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I do not see the relevance of the

point that the Member has raised.  But just to answer him, those

who  enter  the country illegally to work, of course,  face  the

penalties under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act  and  also

under  the Immigration Act.  In the case of foreigners who enter

Singapore legally to work and had their work permit cancelled by

the  employer, they are given a special pass for a short period,

during which they should make preparations to leave the country.

The  understanding with the foreign worker is that he can remain

in  Singapore so long as he holds a valid work permit.   If  his

work permit has been cancelled or revoked for other reasons,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>



then  he  must  leave the country.  We will give  them  a  short

period to make the necessary arrangements to leave the country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that these foreign

workers, especially those coming from further afield, have  paid

substantial sums to the agents on the promise that they will  be

allowed  to  work  for the number of years stated  in  the  work

permit, and suddenly after two or three months, they find  their

stay   rendered  illegal  by  the  employer  terminating   their

employment  and informing his Ministry?  Does the Ministry  make

any distinction for them?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we understand that some of the

foreign workers have to pay certain sums of money to the  agents

in   their   home  country  in  order  to  make  the   necessary

arrangements   to   come  to  work  in  Singapore.    But   such

arrangements are completely beyond the control and influence  of

my  Ministry.  The concern and arrangement of a foreign  citizen

with  a foreign agent is totally beyond our control.  For  those

who come to Singapore to work, they enter  on the condition that

they  can  only remain here so long as they have  a  valid  work

permit and so long as the employer requires their presence here.

There is no promise that they will be here for the full duration

of the two years for which we grant a work permit, because there

is  no way that my Ministry can assure every foreigner who comes

to  Singapore that his employer will have a job for him for four

years  or  six  years or whatever period of  time  that  he  has

indicated.  It is entirely up to the foreigner whether to accept

or  not  to accept the job offered by his employer in Singapore.

If,  for  whatever reason, the employer is unable to retain  the

foreigner in Singapore on a particular job that he has in  mind,

then  he has to cancel the work permit and the foreigner has  to

leave  Singapore.  This is the risk of coming here and they  are

aware of the risk.  They have to be prepared to take this risk.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, for those workers whose employment

has been prematurely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>



terminated and should they find a job within two weeks, will his

Ministry consider favourably giving them a work permit?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, our approach towards the non-traditional source workers coming here to look for work is that

they must have prior approval before they enter Singapore.   For

those  who  are here, once their work permit is terminated,  and

unless  there  are very exceptional circumstances,  they  should

leave  the  country.  What we cannot afford to have  is  a  very

large  pool of non-traditional source workers hanging around  in

Singapore  and  saying  they are looking for  work  and  seeking

extension for their immigration permits in order to remain here.

They  are dragging the process over a long period of time, which

means  that the number of such people hanging around and looking

for  jobs  will increase.  That will cause a lot of the problems

that  I have mentioned earlier on, ie, social problems, and  law

and  order  problems.  How are they going to support  themselves

when they are here looking for jobs?  What is there to guarantee

that  they will find a suitable job in two weeks?  In fact,  our

policy  has  always been that, for work permit applications,  if

you  are  a  foreign worker, you must apply for  prior  approval

before  you  come  to  Singapore.  If  you  do  not  have  prior

approval, we will not entertain any application for work  permit

in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, my question to the

Minister  is along the same line as what Mr Rai has  asked.   In

some   cases,   some  of  these  workers  have  got   sufficient

experience. They have worked in the industry for some time  but,

unfortunately,  due  to  reasons that their  companies  have  to

terminate them for whatever reasons, they are forced to go back.

But they could be valuable to other companies in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Singh, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b>My question is: will the Minister

consider  setting  up  an  agency that could  provide  placement

services for such workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, it is not easy to offer such

placement services to foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>



workers.  We have placement services to assist Singaporeans  who

have  been  retrenched  or who have lost  their  job  for  other

reasons.  In the case of non-traditional source foreign  workers

who are in Singapore, we have had, in the past, on compassionate

grounds, tried to place some of those workers who were  in  fact

asked  to leave by the employers. We found to our disappointment

that  our  efforts  were usually unsuccessful.   The  number  of

foreign workers who could be successfully placed and the  number

of  employers whom we could persuade to take up these  displaced

foreign  workers were minimal. As a result, most of the  foreign

workers  had  to  go  back.  I think we  should  stick  to  this

fundamental  policy  that they come to Singapore  to  work  with

valid  work  permits and with prior approval.  If, for  whatever

reason,  the employer is unable to keep him in employment,  then

he will have to go back.  This is the risk that some of them had

paid  money to come here and this has to be their own  look-out.

They  cannot assume that Singapore streets are paved  with  gold

and  they  can come here and just continue to have a  good  job,

earn  a high salary, and regardless of what happens, they  would

be able to remain here on various pretexts.

<div align="center"><b>UNDERGROUND WATER RESOURCES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  the  Government has made  any  study  on  the

possibility of using underground water resources in Singapore to

supplement our water supply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, Singapore's water supply comes entirely from  the

collection of surface runoffs from rainfall.  With the  help  of

experts,  PUB  has carried out geo-physical and hydro-geological

investigations  on ground water resources. The  findings  reveal

that  there  are no significant ground water sources  available,

even at relatively great depths.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is there any other

effort  that  the  Government would  put  in  to  develop  water

resources  locally, in order not to be over-dependent  on  water

supply from foreign countries?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes, Sir, we have been doing it all these

years.   Water  is  very important for  us.   So  we  have  been

developing our own water resources to the maximum.  We  are  now

looking  into  desalination  as  well,  as  Members  have   been

informed.  We are also looking into other sources of water which

are  not so usable.  They are non-potable water, but they  could

be used to supplement our sources for non-potable uses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is there any target set by the

Government in terms of self-sufficiency in water supply,  ie,  a

certain  percentage of water supply would be  developed  locally

rather  than  depending entirely or the bulk of the supply  from

foreign sources?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> PUB has been working on the basis of

about  50% from local sources.  But as demand grows, it may  not

be easy to maintain that percentage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister, in view of the

assurances   that  we  are  now  getting  from   the   Malaysian

Government,  in  particular  the  Prime  Minister  of  Malaysia,

whether  his Government intends to keep the tax on  water  as  a

permanent measure or whether the Government proposes to do  away

with it in the near future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The water taxes and the higher tariffs on

water  are very important to drive home the importance of  water

to  Singaporeans  and  that we must always  conserve  our  water

resources.  Whatever happens with our neighbours, whether we are

able to get supplies, that is still uncertain.  We must continue

to look after our own security.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that the reason for

introducing  the  tax  was this fear that Malaysia  was  perhaps

going to reduce its supply of water or even to cut it off?   Was

that  not the reason for introducing the tax?  Now that  we  are

told that there will be no such thing, what is the purpose?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> May I ask the Member whether he will just

carry on on the basis of such assurances, or should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>



we  look after our own security, not only on water, but in other

aspects?   Because water is really crucial.  You need  water  to

live on.  So we must continue to have efforts to drive home  the

message  and get people to conserve water.  The purpose  of  the

tax  is  to get people to conserve water.   It is not to address

the point whether Malaysia will cut off supply or not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying that he cannot

accept   the  assurances  given  by  the  Malaysian  government,

particularly the Prime Minister?  And secondly, is the  Minister

saying that there has been a significant drop in the consumption

of  water as a result of the tax and are there no other ways  of

getting people to reduce their consumption of water?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I am not saying that we cannot take

the  assurances of our neighbours.  But that is not  sufficient.

We  need to have firm agreements.  We need to be able to enforce

them.  If there are disputes, we need to be able to go somewhere

to  try  and  resolve  the matter.  The  impact  of  the  tariff

increases  has  been very evident.  Each time  we  increase  the

tariff,  the consumption goes down.  So we have to keep  up  the

efforts,  not  only through tax means but through educating  our

public that water is very important to us, please conserve it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  additional tax or  other  incentives  can  be

offered   to   improve   water  and  electricity   conservation,

especially by industries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, currently, there are

three incentive schemes which companies can make use of to  help

them implement water conservation measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Investment Allowance Scheme offers companies an

investment  allowance  of  up  to 50%  of  their  fixed  capital

expenditure for water conservation and recycling.  The  Resource

Productivity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>



Scheme  provides  financing  to  companies  for  automation  and

resource-saving    equipment.    The    Resource    Productivity

Feasibility  Scheme  provides a  grant  of  up  to  50%  of  the

qualifying  cost  of  engaging external consultants  to  conduct

resource productivity feasibility studies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also several existing incentive schemes which

encourage  the  adoption  of energy-efficient  technologies  and

equipment, including the Investment Allowance Scheme, the  Local

Enterprise   Technical  Assistance  Scheme  (LETAS),   and   the

accelerated depreciation scheme.  The LETAS can be used by local

enterprises  to  engage  external  expertise  to  modernise  and

upgrade  their  operations, including making them  more  energy-efficient.  The accelerated depreciation scheme has been revised

recently  to  allow companies to depreciate their  energy-saving

equipment in one year instead of three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these tax and financial incentives, companies that

want to improve their water and energy efficiencies can approach

the  Public  Utilities Board for water and  energy  audits.   An

Inter-Agency  Committee on Energy Conservation  chaired  by  the

Ministry  of National Development has also been set  up  to  co-ordinate the efforts of the various agencies involved in setting

energy  conservation  policies and  to  further  improve  energy

conservation in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the incentives relate largely to

consultancy fees and incentives such as tax depreciation.   Will

the  Government  consider rebates for those with  infrastructure

needs for greater efficiency?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I am not clear what the Member means by

rebates.  If he has some good ideas, he can suggest to me and we

will look into them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> By rebates, I mean basically actual cash

outputtings  rather than simple depreciation which in  times  of

present  economic downturn may not mean very much  to  companies

which  may be making little or no profits.  So that is the basic

idea of rebates.  But more generally,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>



will  the Government consider setting efficiency targets in  the

areas  of  both energy and conservation, just as we set economic

targets of growth?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes, this is something we can do.

<div align="center"><b>ASEAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTERS' MEETING</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress towards addressing problems of fires and haze</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>pollution)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the Environment

whether the recent ASEAN Environment Ministers' meeting has made

significant  progress towards addressing  the  problems  of  the

South East Asian fires and haze pollution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

the  ASEAN  Environment  Ministers were  able  to  make  further

progress  in their recent meeting in Brunei in their efforts  to

address the problem of forest fires and haze.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers agreed to form two sub-Regional Fire-fighting

Arrangements (RFA) under the Regional Haze Action Plan:  one  to

tackle  fires in Kalimantan and the other to prevent fires  from

developing in Sumatra and the Riau Islands. Under the RFAs,  the

affected  countries in the sub-regions will share  fire-fighting

resources  and  deploy international assistance when  available.

The  ASEAN Ministers agreed that top priority must now be  given

to  efforts to prevent fires from developing in Sumatra and  the

Riau  Islands.  The fires in East Kalimantan are now so  massive

and  widespread  that  efforts are best directed  at  containing

these  fires  and preventing them from spreading to Central  and

West Kalimantan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Environment Ministers also affirmed the UN

Environment  Programme  or UNEP's role in  helping  to  mobilise

international   assistance  to  deal  with  the  forest   fires.

Indonesia, in particular, had welcomed UNEP's initiative at  the

highest political level.  This is an encouraging development  as

we  believe  that  UNEP is in a position to reach  out  to  more

countries for assistance.  Already,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>



UNEP  has  sent a UN experts mission to assess the situation  in

Kalimantan,  and there will be a UN level meeting in  Geneva  on

21st  April among potential donor countries to assess the  types

of assistance needed by Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Brunei, I had conveyed to Prof Juwono, the new

Indonesian  Environment Minister, Singapore's concern  over  the

threat of smoke haze this year.   He had assured me that he  was

fully  aware of the magnitude and seriousness of the  Indonesian

forest fires and their impact on the region last year.  He  also

stated  that  he would do his utmost to get his government,  his

people  and  those  in  the  private sector  to  understand  the

economic  costs and the health impact of forest fires and  haze,

and   seek   their  cooperation  in  stopping  illegal   burning

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Environment Ministers also discussed the forest

fires  raging in the East Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah,

and  were briefed by the Malaysian Environment Minister on their

efforts  to  bring  these  fires under control.   The  Malaysian

Minister informed us that many of these are peat fires,  against

which conventional methods of fire fighting are not effective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drought in Kalimantan, Sarawak, Sabah and Brunei has

been particularly severe and prolonged, and rain is not expected

till the later half of this year.  The dry season in Sumatra  is

due  to  set in around the middle of this year.  Whilst  efforts

are  being made amongst the affected ASEAN countries to  jointly

tackle  the forest fires with international aid where available,

at  home  we  have  been advising Singaporeans  to  install  air

cleaners and special filters to mitigate the effects of haze  on

their  homes, schools and offices.  We have tested these devices

and found them to be effective.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister: (1) what measures are being taken to contain the fires

in  Kalimantan; and (2) is there any evidence of illegal burning

in Sumatra?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, at the present moment, a team from

UNEP, as well as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>



experts  from Germany, are in Kalimantan helping to  assess  the

situation.   I believe they will be presenting their  report  to

the Indonesian government and subsequently we will be getting an

update  from  the  Indonesian Minister at our  next  ministerial

meeting, which will be in May.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about whether there is any evidence

of  illegal  burning in Sumatra.  Sir, fortunately,  Sumatra  is

presently fairly free of fire, and that is why we have agreed to

put the highest priority on maintaining the current situation in

Sumatra.    We   have  set  up  the  sub-regional  fire-fighting

arrangement  which will be organised to operationalise  what  we

had agreed upon in terms of cooperation to spot the fires and to

deploy  the necessary people to prevent those fires from  taking

hold when they do break out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he does

not  consider it really a mockery to tell people, those who have

not  sufficient  funds even to meet their daily  expenses,  that

they should install air purifiers and cleaners in their homes to

avoid  any  health impact?  May I ask the Minister  whether  the

Government  has any plans to use some of the US$5  billion  that

they have set aside to help Indonesia to help the needy here who

may  be in need of respiratory equipment and other medical  aids

to help them get over the haze problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, our attempt to advise Singaporeans

was  in  response to the appeals by Singaporeans for information

of  what  action  they can take to mitigate the effects  of  the

haze.   Even  at the worst period last year, the  PSI  level  in

Singapore,  on a 24-hour basis, was in the region of about  138,

which  is  in  the  unhealthy region but not  in  the  hazardous

region, most Singaporeans really would be able to cope with  the

haze  without  any  equipment, such as  purifiers  and  filters.

However,  for those Singaporeans who suffer from health problems

-  the  asthmatics,  the elderly who are sick  and  who  require

medical  treatment  -  they can easily go  to  the  polyclinics.

First,  the  fees  in the polyclinics are already  very  heavily

subsidised,   but  for  those  people  who  require   additional

financial assistance, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>



have  the  Medifund  which  can  then  help  to  pay  for  their

polyclinic  fees  in  full.   So there  is  no  reason  for  any

Singaporeans  at  all to feel that they are  being  deprived  of

assistance from the Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister, regarding

the  fires in Kalimantan last year and the haze which it caused,

was  it  not  known that a large percentage of it  was  actually

caused by illegal burning on large plantations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in fact, the Indonesian Minister

at  our  last ministerial meeting in Brunei had stated  that  he

believed  that  the  present fires in  Kalimantan  were  largely

caused,  in the initial stages, by illegal burning.  But because

of  the  extreme  dryness of the island  due  to  the  prolonged

drought,  those fires have spread very rapidly into  the  nature

reserves and other areas which are by and large uninhabited.  So

in  terms  of the genesis, yes, the fire originally was  started

largely  by illegal burning but, however, the present  scale  of

the fires is caused largely by the prolonged drought.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, could nothing be done then about

illegal burning which is really the genesis of the fires?   When

you  talk  about  the  fires in Sumatra and  about  the  highest

priority  being taken, could not also measures be taken  against

illegal  burning, which probably would be the genesis  of  these

fires again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, indeed that is true and which is

why all the Ministers have been urging our Indonesian colleagues

to  impress upon its government the need to enforce the existing

laws in Indonesia against illegal burning activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Regarding the preventive actions in Sumatra

and  the  Riau  Islands,  given that  Singapore  companies  have

substantial investments and timber companies are often based  in

Singapore,  will the Minister consider sending  a  directive  to

Singapore-based companies to observe Indonesian laws?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, indeed that is what we have been

saying publicly.  We do not really have information on which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1910</b></font><br><br>



companies  in  Singapore are involved in plantation investments.

I  think  the  point  is  that it has  already  been  very  well

publicised  time  and  again on the need for  the  companies  to

comply  with  the  laws in the host country.   In  the  case  of

Indonesia, it means they should not engage in illegal burning.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> The Minister is right that people know it in

the  Straits  Times or the media.  But there is  another  thing,

would  the  Minister not agree, to receive  a  letter  from  the

Ministry pointing out the directive?  And surely on the question

of  which companies are doing it, is the Minister saying  it  is

beyond  the powers of the Government to find out which ones  are

doing it?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we will look into that, as to

whether  we  will be able to get the full information  from  the

various sources.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, if the Indonesian government is not

sufficiently  encouraged by the pressures from external  sources

to  take action against illegal burning, does that mean that we,

in  Singapore, would have to suffer the haze again this year and

next year and subsequent years then?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we have been engaged in very

extensive discussions with the Indonesian government as well  as

with  our  other  ASEAN colleagues and we hope  that  all  these

extensive discussions and the message which I believe  is  being

put  across  very  strongly through the mass media  as  well  as

through   our  direct  discussions  will  cause  the  Indonesian

government to be more vigilant in the future.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT GRANT TO PURCHASERS OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>EXECUTIVE CONDOMINIUMS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Extension to purchasers of private residential units)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  what  is the rationale for the  $40,000  government

grant given to first-time home buyers to finance the purchase of

their  Executive  Condominiums and  whether  his  Ministry  will

consider extending such grant to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>



first-time home buyers who wish to take advantage of the falling

property  prices to buy a private residential unit  straightaway

instead of joining or remaining on the long waiting list of home

buyers  for  Housing  and Development Board flats  or  executive

condominiums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National

Development  (Mr  Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister  for  National

Development): Mr Speaker, Sir, the CPF Housing Grant Scheme  was

implemented  in 1994 to assist young citizen families  who  have

not  previously enjoyed any housing subsidy to purchase a resale

HDB  flat to set up their own homes, thus obviating the need  to

queue  up for a new HDB flat.  The grant is treated as a housing

subsidy  enjoyed by the eligible recipient, in lieu of buying  a

new subsidised flat from HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the Government introduced the Executive

Condominium (EC) Housing Scheme to meet the aspirations of young

couples, many of whom are graduates and professionals, who  want

to own private homes quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage these couples to apply for an EC instead of

joining the HDB queue, the Government decided in 1996 to  extend

the  CPF Housing Grant to first-timers buying an EC.  The  grant

of $40,000 makes the ECs more affordable, since the grant can be

used towards the 20% downpayment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the NMP's question: will the $40,000 CPF housing grant

be  extended  to  those who want to buy private properties,  the

answer   is   no.    Because   unlike  private   apartments   or

condominiums,  ECs  are  sold under the  conditions  of  the  EC

Housing  Scheme  Act and Rules which have several  restrictions.

The  eligibility conditions are, however, similar  to  those  of

public  housing.  In addition, a purchaser is also subjected  to

the following conditions of ownership:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the purchaser must occupy the EC for the first five

years after taking possession of the EC;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the purchaser can only sell the EC after completion of

the  5-year occupation period, and from the 6th to the 10th year

of  ownership, he can only sell the EC to Singapore citizens  or

Singapore Permanent Residents; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the purchaser and spouse are permanently debarred from

buying subsidised public housing from HDB.  In other words, they

are totally out of the public housing scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of private apartments or condominiums, they are

sold by private developers under very different conditions.  The

Government  does  not  control ownership  of  these  residential

properties  which  the  purchasers can  use  either  for  owner-occupation or for investment or for speculation.  The purchasers

for  private  residential properties are also  from  the  higher

income groups.  Hence, the Government has no plans to extend the

housing grant to purchasers of private properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the problem of housing shortage serious? It is not so

serious.   The  waiting  time to book the  ECs  is  very  short.

Indeed, it is zero today.  With the completion of HDB's referral

of  applicants on the Executive Flat (EF) queue to the Executive

Condominium developers, 95% of all the ECs are now available for

sale under the open category.  In other words, anybody who meets

the  housing conditions can apply to buy an EC.  Applicants  are

now  able  to  book an EC immediately at the launch  of  any  EC

projects.   Yew  Mei is on the market for buying and  Summerdale

has  just  been  launched last weekend.  For those  first-timers

wishing to buy HDB flats, the average waiting time has also been

lowered  from the previous 4.5 years to 2.5 years now.   If  the

applicant is not fussy about location, he can get a 4- or 5-room

flat in the West Zone at an average waiting time of 1.25 to  1.5

years which, I think, is a reasonable waiting time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, first-time couples today have many choices to own

their own homes.  They can either buy a private property if they

have  the  means;  or they can buy a more restrictive  Executive

Condominium with the CPF housing scheme; or they can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>



buy  a  HDB  flat  from the resale market with the  CPF  housing

scheme; or they can apply for a new HDB flat.  Finally, there is

the  option to live with dad and mum, and that is the  option  I

encourage most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Chng Hee Kok



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. To ask the Minister for Manpower if he will provide

statistics  of  the  Central Provident  Fund  members  who  have

profited or lost from investments at the latest available date.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Question No. 9, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 12 per cent of total

CPF  investors  or  about 50,000 CPF members made  net  realised

profits  from October 1996 to September 1997.  90  per  cent  of

these  members or about 46,000 members achieved less than $5,000

each in net realised profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although about 83 per cent of total CPF investors made

profits  on  their CPF investments, about 310,000  of  them  had

profits  which were less than the CPF interest they  would  have

earned  in  their  CPF accounts, had they  not  used  their  CPF

savings  for  investment.  Hence, after offsetting for  the  CPF

interest,  these  members do not have any net  realised  profits

available for withdrawal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 17 per cent of CPF investors incurred

realised  losses, even before offsetting for the  CPF  interest.

Of  these,  76 per cent or about 56,000 members made  losses  of

less than $1,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the depressed stock market has added to the poor

performance  of CPF members' investment.  It is also  noteworthy

that  CPF  members usually choose to invest on the  local  share

market   themselves  rather  than  place  their   savings   with

professional fund managers in the form of unit trusts  and  fund

management   accounts.    Secure   and   successful    financial

investments require adequate pooling of funds for more efficient

portfolio



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>



management  to reduce investment risks and achieve good  returns

over  the  long  term.  Most CPF members may  not  have  a  good

understanding of financial investments and hence are  unable  to

construct  sound  long-term portfolios to  diversify  investment

risks.  They also have relatively small balances to construct  a

meaningful portfolio of investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is therefore looking into the further

refinement  and liberalisation of the CPF Investment  Scheme  to

give  members  more  options to invest  with  professional  fund

managers.  Members can choose from more fund managers  and  unit

trusts.  The fund managers of CPF-approved unit trusts will have

greater  flexibility to diversify portfolios to  maximise  risk-adjusted returns for CPF investors.  In addition, the new  rules

to  require greater disclosure of investment information by  the

fund  managers will enable CPF investors to make better informed

investment  choices.  Details of the changes will  be  announced

soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mrs Yu-Foo Yee

Shoon



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. To ask the Minister for Manpower, in view of the fact

that  members of the Central Provident Fund Board can use  their

funds  to  buy stocks and shares and as they may not be familiar

with  the  operation of the stock market, whether he will  cause

(i)  an  education programme on investment to be  conducted  for

them and (ii) safeguards to be introduced to prevent their funds

from being unduly exposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Question No. 10, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the CPF Investment

Scheme provides an opportunity for members to enhance their  old

age   savings   through  long-term  investments.   CPF   members

participating  in the Investment Scheme must, however,  exercise

prudence  and  judgement in their investments.   Currently,  CPF

members  who  wish to participate in the Investment Scheme  must

first have sufficient CPF savings to meet the full Minimum Sum



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>



requirements.  Thereafter, they can invest only up to 80% of the

available savings.  This provision serves to prevent CPF savings

from  being over-exposed to stocks and shares at the expense  of

CPF members' basic retirement needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to investor education, the CPF Board holds

regular  seminars  for its member to encourage proper  financial

planning for retirement.  Investor education is also provided by

CPF Agent Banks and organisations, such as Investment Management

Association  of  Singapore  (IMAS).  The  Investment  Management

Association  of  Singapore has launched several  initiatives  to

increase public awareness as well as educate the public  on  the

benefits   of  collective  investments  and  professional   fund

management.   It  has already provided fortnightly  articles  on

investments  in The Sunday Times and the Lianhe Zaobao.   It  is

working  towards providing more information and  guidance  at  a

website  on the Internet.  Sir, the Association is also  working

with  Radio Corporation of Singapore (RCS) on investor education

programmes over the radio.  Other groups are actively developing

TV   programmes,  seminars  and  magazine  series  for  investor

education.  Such initiatives will help to educate the  investing

public  and guide CPF members who wish to invest their  savings.

CPF  Board  encourages IMAS and other organisations' efforts  to

provide  more  investor education.  Nevertheless, Sir,  I  would

like  to  emphasise  that at the end of  the  day,  CPF  members

participate in the CPF Investment Scheme at their own discretion

and  must  be  accountable for the outcome of  their  investment

decisions.

<div align="center"><b>(Waiver of maid levy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

waivers  will be given to the maid levy for households  where  a

maid  is  specifically  employed to  look  after  a  handicapped

person.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the levy on foreign

domestic workers is meant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>



to  dampen  demand  so that Singaporeans will not  become  over-dependent on them.  We understand that some families require the

services of a foreign domestic worker and our policy is  not  to

deny Singaporeans of such service if they are able to afford it.

However,  there  is still a need to ensure that  the  number  of

foreign domestic workers in Singapore remains manageable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Households employ foreign domestic workers for a variety of

reasons.   Some employ a foreign domestic worker to  look  after

the  aged  and handicapped, others to look after young children,

and  yet others to attend to household chores or even to do  all

of  these things.  We should not favour any particular household

or  type  of work by exempting them from the levy or granting  a

concession.   The levy is a transparent pricing  mechanism  that

applies  equally  to all employers.  Waiving the  levy  for  any

particular   group  of  employers  will  undermine  Government's

efforts to manage the demand for foreign domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out that a working woman who

employs  a  foreign domestic worker to look after a  handicapped

family member is also entitled to the double tax relief from the

foreign  domestic worker levy.  Furthermore, the Government  has

provided  various tax reliefs and assistance to help handicapped

persons and their families.  For example, the family member of a

handicapped person is entitled to claim a handicapped  dependant

relief  of $3,500 for the maintenance of the handicapped person.

Government also provides other forms of assistance to  voluntary

welfare  organisations  which  provide  support  and  care   for

handicapped persons.  These include residential and respite care

centres,   hostels,  day  activity  centres  and  provision   of

technical  aids  for  disabled persons.  We should  address  the

needs of the handicap-care from a total perspective rather  than

simply  waiving  the maid levy which would increase  households'

reliance  on  maids and undermine the development of alternative

care systems.  It would also draw us into unnecessary debate  on

which other groups, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>



example,  those who look after the aged or very young  children,

should also be granted a similar waiver.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would

like  to ask the Minister whether there are statistics available

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have these

numbers  on hand.  But I am sure there are such statistics.   If

be able to give him the answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, according to the Handicaps Welfare

<div align="center"><b>EXTRADITION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Extradition Act in order to

enable  the continuation of the system of extradition with  Hong

Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Extradition Act allows the extradition of

fugitives to and from "foreign States" and declared Commonwealth

countries.  Extradition vis-�-vis Hong Kong was on the basis  of

the provision on declared Commonwealth countries.  From 1st July

1997,  Hong  Kong ceased to be part of the Commonwealth.   As  a

Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic  of

China,  Hong Kong is no longer a Commonwealth State, nor is  it,

strictly speaking, a "foreign State" within the meaning  of  the

Extradition Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to enable extradition arrangements with

territories which have a special status such as Hong Kong, it is

therefore  necessary  to  amend the Act.   This  Bill  therefore

amends  the  definition  of  "foreign  State"  to  include   any

territory  specified in the new Third Schedule to the Act,  with

which Singapore has an extradition treaty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the benefit of Members, let me say that the United

Kingdom has taken a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>



similar approach on the ground that the Hong Kong SAR is  a  sui

generis  entity  in international law.  Last  year,  the  United

Kingdom made elaborate amendments to their Extradition Act  1989

so  that its provisions pertaining to foreign States, designated

Commonwealth  countries and colonies also applied  to  the  Hong

Kong  SAR.   We,  however,  have taken  a  simpler  approach  of

widening the definition of "foreign State" so that it covers not

just states but also "territories" such as the Hong Kong SAR.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 45 of the Act

to  empower the Minister, by order published in the Gazette,  to

amend, add to or vary the new Third Schedule when an extradition

treaty  between any territory and Singapore has come into  force

or has ceased to be in force, as the case may be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Third Schedule in the Bill sets out the

territories with which Singapore has an extradition treaty.  The

Schedule  lists  the Hong Kong SAR of the People's  Republic  of

China.  Singapore and the Hong Kong SAR signed an Agreement  for

the  Surrender of Fugitive Offenders on 11th November last year.

It  will  enable  Singapore and Hong Kong to  surrender  persons

accused   or   convicted  of  offences  committed   within   the

jurisdiction  of  either  Party,  who  are  found   within   the

jurisdiction  of  the  other,  subject  to  the  terms  of   the

Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill is enacted and comes into force, Hong Kong

will  be gazetted under section 4(1)(b) of the Act as a "foreign

State" for the purposes of this Act and for the purposes of  the

Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) (Consolidation) Declaration

(Chapter 103, Declaration 1) will be amended to remove Hong Kong

from the list of declared Commonwealth countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my understanding of

extradition  is  that it is dependent entirely on  statute.   My

question to the Minister is that since Hong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>



Kong is not a sovereign state, can it sign an extradition treaty

with  the  Republic of Singapore?  Unlike the UK,  we  have  not

amended our laws in this respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the extradition treaty signed between Hong Kong

and  Singapore, may I ask the Minister whether  it  was  at  the

initiative  of  the  Hong  Kong government  or  was  it  on  our

Government's  initiative?   I would  like  to  further  ask  the

Minister  what  are the criteria he would look  into  before  an

extradition  treaty is signed between Singapore  and  a  foreign

country.   In this respect, may I ask how many of the  countries

in  ASEAN have signed extradition treaties with Singapore  other

than Thailand?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to refer to section 3 of our Extradition

Act.  I note that in that section, English extradition laws  are

incorporated  into our statute.  Section 3 puts into  effect  in

our  Extradition Act all those foreign States which have  signed

extradition  treaties  with  England  as  if  they  had   signed

extradition  treaties  with  us.   Since  we  are   now   making

amendments  to  our Extradition Act, I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  why he does not now also include the list  of  foreign

States  in the new  Third Schedule.  In the absence of the  full

list  of foreign States in our Extradition Act, we have to  look

to  the  English Extradition Act to find out all  the  names  of

countries which have an extradition treaty with us by virtue  of

the  said English Act.  This is quite inconvenient, to  say  the

least.   Would  the Minister consider putting the full  list  of

foreign States in our new Third Schedule?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I have noted the various points and

questions  raised  by  Mr Chiam.  As to  who  initiated  it,  my

recollection  is that there was a mutual desire  by  both  sides

that   the   arrangements,  which  previously  existed,   should

continue.    In other words, it was in the interest on  the  law

and  order  grounds  of both Hong Kong and  Singapore  that  the

arrangements,  which  had been in place for  extradition  before

Hong Kong became an SAR, should continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on whether they had the competence, I understand

that  they had the competence and there was no objection by  the

People's Republic of China.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as to which ASEAN countries have formal

extradition   agreements,   the  position  is   that   we   have

extradition arrangements with Malaysia and Brunei and  the  kind

of   expeditious  arrangements  are  set  out  in  our  criminal

procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the provision which he referred to concerning

extradition  treaties  entered into by the  United  Kingdom  and

other  foreign  countries, yes, before Singapore  separated  and

became  independent,  the  United Kingdom  had  its  extradition

treaties with other countries which may have listed Singapore in

its  scope  of operations.  It does not follow that, today,  all

those  arrangements automatically apply.  In  other  words,  the

Singapore Government will have to carefully consider whether all

these  treaty obligations are automatically binding on us before

we  can  consider publication of the treaties.  So this will  be

done   periodically  by  the  Attorney-General's   Chambers   in

consultation with those countries concerned.  But I want to make

the  point  that it is not automatic that all those  extradition

arrangements will apply in each and every case.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I believe the Minister has left out

one  point,  which is on the criteria for us to  enter  into  an

extradition treaty with another country.  Also, in the  case  of

Malaysia  and Brunei, my reading of the law is that  extradition

can only be carried out when there is an extradition treaty.  If

we  do  not have an extradition treaty with Malaysia and Brunei,

how  do  we  force those governments to hand over a fugitive  to

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If the Member will recall I do not have

the  statutory provisions with me right now  there are statutory

provisions  for Malaysia and Brunei to provide for  this  and  I

shall  be  happy, at a later occasion, to refer these  statutory

provisions to the Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the criterion for any extradition arrangements, not

only  for  Singapore, it is whether the two countries  concerned

feel  that  there  is a desire,  a shared desire,  that  in  the

interest  of law and order, it is mutually beneficial for  there

to be an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>



agreement  for  the reciprocal handing over of  fugitives.   But

that is a general principle.  There also has to be agreement  on

the  nature of offences which are known as extraditable offences

and  also  on  who  are extraditable persons.   Sometimes  these

arrangements  are  easier to conclude when countries  have  very

similar  legal  systems and procedures.   Where  countries  have

rather distinctly different legal systems and procedures, it may

be  more  difficult to conclude.  So, the general  approach  is,

first,  there must be a mutuality of interest that they want  to

conclude these agreements and, secondly, flowing from that, they

will  have  to  examine the legal provisions  whether  they  are

compatible or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill.  [Prof. S. Jayakumar].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>1.45 pm.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the State Lands Act to establish a

statutory office of the Chief Valuer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are consequential in nature, following

amendments  to  the  Constitution to make  the  Chief  Valuer  a

safeguarded appointment passed at the last Parliamentary sitting

on 20th March.  At that time, DPM Lee had set out the background

to these amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces new sections 2A, 2B and 2C to establish

the Chief Valuer, currently a departmental title, as a statutory

office.  He will be appointed by the President on the advice  of

the Public Service Commission.  The President has the discretion

to disagree with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>



Commission's advice.  Administratively, the Chief Valuer will be

responsible to the Minister for Law on all state land  valuation

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The independence of the office-holder is safeguarded by

provisions  which stipulate that the Chief Valuer's remuneration

and  terms  of  service cannot be altered  to  his  disadvantage

during his tenure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also set out the Chief Valuer's functions

and  confer on him right of access to buildings and  lands.   He

can  exercise  this right at reasonable hours and only  for  the

purpose of discharging his functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments will help strengthen the institutions and

systems  for  the  effective  operation  of  the  constitutional

safeguards over past reserves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br><i>Introduction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of foreign maids has increased from around

80,000  in December 1993 to more than 100,000 in December  1997.

We also have a few thousand locals working as maids.  Many could

be working part-time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic maids are female, work within the confines of

their employers' home for 24 hours of the day, and except during

their time-off, are isolated from the rest of society nearly all

the  time,  and depend on their employer for food  and  lodging.

Maids are therefore more vulnerable to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>



abuse by employers and their immediate family members, than  any

other categories of employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All employers have an obligation to treat their maids

humanly  and  decently.  The great majority of  employers  treat

their  maids well, but a small minority behave as if their maids

are slaves.   They get upset easily when their maids do not meet

their expectations.  Some even physically abuse them. Maid abuse

could  be in the form of simple assault or causing serious hurt.

Some  employers took advantage of their maids by outraging their

modesty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of maid abuse cases reported to the Police

nearly  doubled, from 105 in 1994, to 192 in 1997.   Of the  192

reported  cases  in  1997,  157 cases  were  substantiated  with

evidence,  and appropriate actions had been or are  being  taken

against  the  offenders.   Although the number  is  still  small

relative  to  the maid population in Singapore, we  should  curb

such incidents before they get out of hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid abuse runs counter to Singapore's aspiration to become

a  gracious and civil society.  Abuse of foreign domestic  maids

can  also  damage  our  international reputation  and  bilateral

relations.     The recent case of Hartati, the Indonesian  maid,

for  example,  was  widely  reported in  the  Indonesian  media.

Jakarta  imposed a temporary ban on maids coming  to  Singapore,

following that incident.



<br><br><i>Enhanced Penalties</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to designate certain offences in the

Penal  Code to carry 1.5 times the normal maximum penalties,  if

perpetrated upon a domestic maid (regardless of whether she is a

local  or  a  foreigner) by the employer  or  a  member  of  the

employer's household.   This will signal clearly to employers of

domestic maids that the Government takes a serious view of  maid

abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, these offences are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Hurt or Grievous Hurt (section 323, section 324 and

section 325) of the Penal Code;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Wrongful Confinement (section 342, section 343 and

section 344);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Assault or use of Criminal Force with intent to outrage

modesty (section 354); and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Insult of Modesty (section 509).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simple hurt and outraging of modesty are the two most

common   forms  of  maid  abuse.  These  two  offences  together

constitute about 92% of all cases in the last four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill creates a new section 73 in the Penal

Code, prescribing that the maximum penalties for the offences  I

have listed would be 1.5 times what the offender would otherwise

have  been  liable for, when the victim is a domestic maid,  and

the  offender  is  the employer or a member  of  the  employer's

household.   For  example,  the  current  maximum  penalty   for

voluntarily  causing  hurt is 1 year's imprisonment,  or  up  to

$1,000 fine, or both. The maximum penalty will become 1.5 years'

imprisonment, or up to $1,500 fine, or both. Clause 2 will  also

make  any  attempt  to commit or abet these offences  punishable

with the enhanced penalties.



<br><br><i>Applicability of enhanced penalties</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the enhanced penalties will apply whether the offences

take  place inside or outside the employer's place of residence.

This is because the abuse need not necessarily take place within

the  four  walls of the employer's home.   Employer's  household

will be defined as family members of the maid's employer who are

residing  in  the same home as the employer and the  maid.    It

will  exclude  visiting relatives and friends, as  they  do  not

exercise any authority over the maid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced penalties will also not apply in situations

such  as  when  a maid's employer sends her to work  in  another

household,  say, his brother's home on an ad hoc  basis,  and  a

member  of that household, say, his brother, subsequently abuses

her.    Of course, the employer should not have sent the maid to

work in his brother's home in the first place, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>



this  is  against the Employment of Foreign Workers Act.     But

should  he  do  that,  the enhanced penalties  would  not  apply

because  like  visiting relatives and friends, the brother  does

not exercise any real authority over the maid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the definition of domestic maid in the Bill, the

enhanced  penalties  will  also not apply  to  part-time  maids.

This is because part-time maids maintain their network of family

and friends, and are consequently less vulnerable to abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I first introduced the Amendment Bill in this House,

I  have received feedback that some employers are concerned that

their maids may exploit the special protection provided to  them

under  the  Amendment Bill to get out of their contracts  or  to

spite  their  employers.   Let me assure Members  that  we  will

continue  to safeguard employers' interests against such  maids.

Police  will warn and, where appropriate, prosecute a  maid  for

giving  false information to a public servant, under  the  Penal

Code.   Foreign  maids who misconduct themselves stand  to  lose

their  work  permit  and can also be debarred  from  working  in

Singapore.



<br><br><i>Jurisdiction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magistrate's and District Courts are currently

empowered,  under  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,   to   impose

sentences  up  to  two  years'  and  seven  years'  imprisonment

respectively.   To enable these Courts to continue to hear  maid

abuse  cases carrying the enhanced penalties, clause  2  of  the

Bill  provides for these Courts to continue to have jurisdiction

over such cases and impose the enhanced penalties.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is intended to send a strong signal to those

employers who have a tendency to abuse their domestic maids that

we take a very stern view against such abuse.   My Ministry will

continue to monitor closely maid abuse trends after the enhanced

penalties have been implemented. If necessary, we will take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>



additional  measures  to tackle maid abuse, including  expanding

the situations when the enhanced penalties would apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of  the  Penal Code (Amendment)  Bill  to  enhance  the

penalties for offences against domestic maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with growing affluence and the increase in dual income

families,  employing  women  foreigners  to  take  care  of  our

domestic  chores and to tend to our children or elderly  parents

has  become the trend in most families who can afford to do  so.

Even  for  families  where the wife is not working  outside  the

home, having a maid to do housework and to take care of children

or the elderly sick is fairly common as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, and sadly though, affluence does not bring about a

refinement  in character or behaviour of some Singaporeans.   In

recent  years, abuse of domestic maids, going by press  reports,

has become fairly common and there seems to be a worrying trend.

The  type  of abuses, as reported in the media, has also  become

more bizarre and cruel.  Abusers seem to be getting younger too!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are also reported cases of false

accusations being made against employers but such cases  are  in

the minority.  Those maids invariably did so to get out of their

contract  of  service  so that they may return  to  their  homes

early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by and large, the majority of domestic maids are well

behaved and discharge their duties admirably.  They take a  huge

load  off  their  employers, especially  the  career  women  and

working mothers.  There are also instances of domestic maids who

had  performed tasks beyond their call of duty and  helped  save

the lives and property of their employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good employers are also happily in the majority and many

grateful and understanding employers have also regarded  trusted

maids as members of their own family and take good care of their

maids.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding this, it is still necessary for us to

arrest  the  rising  trend  of domestic  maid  abuse.   We  must

understand  that domestic maids are human beings who are  forced

to  offer  themselves  as maids because of  financial  hardship.

They leave behind their families to come alone to a strange land

so that they may sustain their families at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic maids are not like those in regular jobs. They

have  no  co-workers  to turn to for help or emotional  support.

They are very much on their own to fend for themselves.  They do

not  work  regular hours as those in regular employment  do  and

there  are  cases of maids having to work literally 24  hours  a

day.   They have also no homes to return to, to unwind like most

of  us,  and  are  in  constant contact  with  their  employers.

Lastly,  they have no families to turn to for emotional support.

All  these make a domestic maid different from not only us,  but

also  other  foreign workers.  Domestic maids are cooped  up  in

their employers' homes day-in-day-out.  They are totally cut off

from  the  rest of the world, as it were.  If they  are  abused,

there  is no one on hand to help them.  It is for these  reasons

that  the  law must protect them and punish the guilty to  deter

others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a perception, Sir, that offences against domestic

maids  are committed by male employers.  This is not so as there

are  several cases of abuse committed by women employers,  their

parents  or  children.   Domestic maids are  not  only  sexually

abused,  they can be physically and emotionally violated.   Most

of  these  incidences  of abuse seem to  be  reported  by  third

parties,  and not by the maids themselves.  These maids  may  be

too intimidated to do anything but suffer in silence as they may

have  been  put  in  fear  of  their  life  and  limb  and  even

repatriation,  if  they  dare  breathe  a  word  of  their  ill-treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to address the concern of some Singaporeans who

feel  that the enhanced penalties seem to favour domestic  maids

more  than abused wives.  This is not so and I do not think that

this  is even our intention.  Wives should not be compared  with

domestic maids as they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>



are  a  special category of persons who enjoy the protection  of

the  law  and  they have a special role in our  society  as  our

policies  have  always been family-oriented.  Abused  wives  can

seek  redress  in  the  Family Court by way  of  a  personal  or

expedited  protection order for herself, or a domestic exclusion

order.   They  can  also  turn to their own  parents,  siblings,

relatives or friends readily for assistance to deal with violent

or  abusive husbands.  They can also bring an end to such abuse,

of course, ultimately by divorcing their husbands.  Maids do not

have this ready access or privilege.  Neither can they enjoy any

other  protection because they do not know how to access it  and

do not have the financial means to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps in seeking to enhance the penalties for

offences  against  domestic maids,  we  should  also  take  this

opportunity  to look into the penalties for offences  of  family

violence  as  well to see if they should also be brought  up  to

date.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in the

wake  of  a spate of maid abuse cases in the last few months,  I

think  the  Penal Code is timely, necessary and consistent  with

our  national effort, as the Minister himself said, to create  a

gracious  and  caring  society.   No  one  can  object  to   our

Government severely penalising employers who exploit their maids

and treat them like indentured servants or domestic animals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of enhanced penalties for a specially

vulnerable and defenceless category of victims is valid.  It  is

a  commendable  example of State-sanctioned protection  for  the

particularly  vulnerable  members of a  domestic  household.   I

would,  however,  take  the point further  and  argue  that  the

Amendment Bill has not gone far enough and should be extended to

include  enhanced  penalties for other vulnerable  victims  like

spouses, young children, handicapped and elderly dependants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me elaborate. The Amendment Bill sends an

inconsistent  message on violence.  If it  is  valid  to  regard

domestic maids as a specially vulnerable category



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>



of  victims  for protection, why leave out the other potentially

helpless  and  exploited  members in  any  household?  Does  the

Minister  not  feel equally compelled to also enhance  penalties

for  child abuses, especially sexual abuses of minors and  those

who are intellectually disabled?  Children are as vulnerable and

powerless as maids in the hands of abusive parents.  What  about

abuses of elderly dependants and spouses?  Why single out maids?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a consistent deterrent against domestic violence,

regardless of who is the victim.  Chief Justice Yong Pung How in

the  recent annual Workplan seminar said that "punishment policy

must be clear, predictable and coherent".  I cannot agree more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me a punishment reflects a society's values about what

it  considers  as unacceptable behaviour.  Our message  must  be

consistent.   Insofar as abuse of maids is an  act  of  domestic

violence, the same principle of enhanced penalties should  apply

to  all vulnerable victims such as spouses, young children,  and

the  handicapped  or  elderly dependants.  In  this  respect,  I

stress  that  injury need not simply be physical in nature,  and

extreme   humiliation  is  certainly  a  form  of  psychological

violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is the Amendment Bill highlights the

discrepancy  and discrimination in the treatment  of  wives  and

domestic  maids.  With enhanced penalties only for maid  abuses,

we  may  end up with an iniquitous situation whereby, if  a  man

bashed  up  his  wife he could get one year's jail,  but  if  he

commits  the same degree of violence on the maid, he  could  get

one-and-a-half time year's jail.  Why do we make  penalties  for

wife  abuse lighter?  Will we end up condoning spousal  violence

more than maid abuse?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case of equal treatment of women as a whole and

respect for them.  Our Constitution provides for equality before

the  law;  any preferential treatment of one category of  women,

the  domestic maids, as opposed to an equally important category

of women, the wives, will violate this principle and create more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>



resentment  against the law at its apparent lack  of  comparable

protection for local abused wives.  We need to remove or address

this discrepancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not address this two-tier punitive sanction, we

are  in  danger  of  creating different classes  of  victims  of

domestic  violence and it would be unfair to potential  victims.

It  would  appear  that  the drafters  of  this  Bill  are  more

sympathetic  to  the sufferings of the domestic maids  than  the

pain  of abused wives.  I hope the amendment of this Bill  is  a

start  for  an  overall review of the sentencing  guidelines  on

domestic violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only then we can clearly say to the community that domestic

violence  of any kind and to any helpless member of a  household

is  wrong.   I do not think it is highly improbable one  day,  a

violent  employer, who is about to hit a maid in a fit of  rage,

will suddenly think twice and will deliberately choose to hit  a

family  member  -  child,  spouse or elderly  parent  instead  - because  he  or  she  will  get away with  a  lighter  sentence!

Indeed,  many wives may be compelled to claim that they  are  in

fact  domestic  maids, in order to get greater protection  under

the law!  I am sure, Sir, that such an unintended consequence is

not  what  the  Government  has in mind  when  introducing  this

Amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third issue, which is related to this Bill which I

thought I should bring up, is the recognition that the Amendment

Bill  is only an enabling legal tool.  It is a necessary measure

but  not  a  sufficient one to stop maid  abuse.   Other  social

policies must be established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important reason why abuse of domestic maids occurs,

Sir,  is  not  because  of  inherent  nastiness  of  Singaporean

families.   The  same person who treats his subordinate  at  the

workplace   with  respect,  and  waitresses  or  other   service

personnel  outside the household, may abuse the  maid  at  home.

This apparent dichotomy in behaviour is due to the fact that our

society  has  created  certain normative  standards  of  conduct

towards people we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>



deal   with   outside   our  household.   The  employer-employee

relationship  is  bound by many laws which establish  a  web  of

mutual  obligations.  The State has created this web; otherwise,

we  would  have workplaces that resemble Dickensian  conditions,

and workers' rights have gone a long way since the last century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet we do not have a codified, formalised web of mutual

relationships  and  obligations  for  workers  in  the  domestic

household.   The  domestic  household  worker  should  have   no

different  rights  and responsibilities as a factory  worker  or

office  worker.  It is precisely because they do not,  and  that

their  destiny  is subject to the whims and random  kindness  of

their  employers.  Sir, we cannot leave such relational  harmony

in a household to "luck" and ambiguous management.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, we ask for greater deterrents against maid

abuse;  on the other hand, we must institutionalise the  working

arrangements  of  maids.   There should  be  standard,  properly

drafted work contracts stipulating terms and conditions,  mutual

obligations - no less than what governs the working relationship

between a factory operator and the employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry of Manpower to draft a standard

employment   contract  for  all  domestic  maids  in  Singapore,

regardless  of  nationality.  We should also consider  extending

the  Workmen's  Compensation Act and other  relevant  protective

legislation  for  gainfully employed people, to domestic  maids.

Currently,  only  some  embassies  out  of  concern  for   their

nationals  who  work as maids, do so.  But we  would  like  some

standardisation.   And  more  important  than   legislation   is

consistent  enforcement of State sanctions on violations.   Laws

are only effective when they are activated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are not enough, Sir. We also should have

education  programmes  to  educate families  about  relationship

dynamics and potential conflicts which can arise when a stranger

enters the family with all the attendant stresses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have countless programmes on parenting, on marital

counselling, etc.  Yet we have ignored the fact that a maid,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>



within the confined space and privacy of household, has not been

considered as a member of the family, for natural reasons.   Yet

we  do  not have programmes to teach employers and maids how  to

relate.  Companies hold courses for supervisors to learn how  to

deal  professionally  with workers, but we  do  not  think  that

employers, like housewives, for example, need to learn the  same

in dealing with their maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sooner we recognise the reality that domestic maids are

going  to  be  a permanent - and growing - feature of  Singapore

society  (we have 100,000 of them now and there will be more,  I

think)  and  establish  a  professional relationship  with  them

within the household, the better prepared we are as employers to

tap  them as a valuable resource to help us cope with the double

burden responsibilities of most Singapore families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Amendment Bill and I hope we take this

opportunity  to adopt a thorough and multi-pronged  approach  at

all  levels  to  address domestic violence within  the  coherent

framework of fair and appropriate sanctions for all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for allowing

me  this  opportunity.  First, I rise to support the Bill.   The

Bill  is  timely.  The newspaper reports, both  in  the  Straits

Times  and the New Paper, have highlighted the plight  of  these

maids,   especially  the  New  Paper.   Many  thought   it   was

sensational  to  have this news but I think it was  a  reminder,

Sir, to Singaporeans at large that some members of our community

are not being fair to these maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the majority of our citizens treat their maids well,

but there is a small minority who think they literally own these

maids.   They require them to do all sorts of things.  With  the

proposed  legislation,  this small group  is  well  warned  that

should they not change, they will meet the might of the law  and

the law will take all this into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many may think that this is a bit harsh, but I do not

think  so.   These  maids have come all the way  from  different

countries.  They have left their families;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>



they are in a foreign country with different cultural milieu and

they  have  come  here because of economic  necessity  in  their

countries.   In  fact,  let us not forget when  our  forefathers

came,  they  too came in this condition to earn a  living  here.

These  maids have left their families behind, some of them  have

young  children.   And instead of showing some  sympathy,  these

perpetrators have in fact treated these maids with abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in earlier days, maids were a luxury. Only the rich

could  afford them.  They were the traditional "black and white"

ladies  who,  in  most cases, were regarded as  members  of  the

family.   And  they, in fact, had authority  of  the  family  to

punish  errant children and many children regarded them as  good

as  their parents.  Why have we shifted the position?   I  think

this  is  something  that we ought to ask  ourselves.   Has  our

society  lost  its  compassionate  values?   Because  both   the

traditional  "black and white" ladies and these  ladies  do  the

same  thing.  It is necessary for parents that they conduct with

their maids in such a way that their children will pick the good

habits from them - the language that is used, the way we address

them,  the way we deal with them, the way we take them  out  for

lunch, whether we let them sit outside the cafeteria or they sit

with us.  These are the values which the children will pick  up.

In  many  cases, the maids are so good that the children  regard

them  as  foster  parents.  And these maids have very  important

responsibilities   to  the  family,  and  I   would   urge   the

Singaporeans at large not to do anything that will diminish  our

standing in the international community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Minister, not because of any pressure

from  outside  but because of our own conviction  that  what  is

being  done  is not correct, that the Government has decided  to

introduce this legislation.  If nothing else, it will serve as a

reminder,  I  repeat again, Sir, to those who are not  going  to

conduct  themselves properly that they are  going  to  meet  the

might of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one area which I am a little concerned. Some

of these maids have the habit  I have one experience through my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1935</b></font><br><br>



professional  dealings   of  making allegations  which  are  not

accurate.  There may be some truth in the allegation.  I am glad

that  the  Police were so thorough, that we must pay tribute  to

our  Home Team, and that the officers concerned investigated the

matter.   This  is very important because the Police  have  been

very fair.  When the law is being administered, we must see  the

genuine from the fake.  There will be some cases, Sir.  But this

is  an  administrative area.  I would urge the Minister  not  to

tolerate such acts of these maids which are purely to punish the

husband or wife of the household.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an increasing demand for maids. Although it is not

related,  I would like to mention that we may have to live  with

this phenomenon for some time to come.  But we should try to see

that  we  are less dependent on maids.  This is a social problem

that  we  have to consider.  But I am fully in support  of  this

move.   This  legislation is necessary.  I hope the  Government,

the NMPs and the Opposition in this House will vote and show our

neighbours and maids that we are all in support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, this is an important issue.

Singaporeans have been shocked by the cases spotlighted  by  the

media  and  I  believe no Singaporean condones the behaviour  we

have  seen.   Yet,  there seems to be no  sign  of  the  problem

abating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the figures of complaints made to the Philippine

Embassy alone, we can see that there has been little improvement

from  1992  to 1996.  The number of complaints of ill  treatment

had been held fairly constant.  For cases of molest, it had been

fluctuating from year to year, most notably, although with  some

fluctuation, complaints about assault had gone up sharply.   The

Minister's  figures on the Police reports, which  are  different

from  the Embassy's complaints, show similar trends for assault.

Briefly,  Sir,  in 1992, complaints received by  the  Philippine

Embassy  for assault were a mere 20; 1993, 70; 1994,  39;  1995,

79; 1996, 115.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1936</b></font><br><br>



I do not have the 1997 figure, Sir.  This kind of stark cruelty,

Sir,  flies  in the face of our ambition of becoming a  gracious

society.  For if we are to become truly a gracious society, then

we  must  accord  human  dignity to all of  us,  all  among  us,

regardless  of  race,  religion,  nationality,  status  or  even

economic standing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some basics, Sir, that must be respected. And if

these basics are not observed, then there must be equal right to

redress  against  the wrongdoer, no matter who  he  or  she  is.

Domestic  workers  and foreign maids must have equal  protection

under  our laws and equal access to justice and institutions  of

law.   That is the true promise of a gracious society, an  equal

society; that is the promise of human dignity and human  rights.

It  only  takes  a few severe cases to bring that  promise  into

question.   It  only  takes a few severe  cases  to  strain  our

relationships with the society from which these foreign  workers

come  from.   I do not mean just government and government  with

our neighbouring countries.  I mean between society and society,

people to people.  So I join the Government and the Minister  in

seeking  ways of improving our behaviour and stopping this  ill-treatment of domestic maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even so, in considering this particular Bill, we should

have  two concerns.  The first is whether this amendment is fair

and  just.   The second is whether this amendment is  sufficient

for the task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of fairness and justice, some other MPs and

NMPs  have spoken on this, and indeed some may question  whether

these  particular amendments are fair to Singaporean  employers.

This  is  because we are basically proposing a system of unequal

laws.   That is, as NMP Claire Chiang has pointed out, you  have

potentially  a lesser penalty if you strike your  wife  or  your

child as opposed to your domestic maid.  That is true too if you

strike  a foreign worker who is not a domestic maid or  a  part-time  domestic maid; you also do not get the enhanced penalties.

There  are some employers and other people who would argue,  no,

this should not be done.  In fact, there are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>



cases  in  which maids themselves have been guilty of  something

illegal.  I think these are real concerns.  But I want to  point

out  why,  to  my  mind,  these unequal  laws  are  nevertheless

justified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out that there are other cases in which we

do  give special attention and special protection to classes  of

people.    For  example,  we  guard minors,  the  young  in  our

society,  our  children,  to a far greater  degree  than  fellow

adults.   This is not merely because of their age or  youth  per

se.  Rather, it is a recognition of the particular vulnerability

of  this class.  So to me, when we talk about this unequality of

laws,  the  question must come: do domestic maids fit into  this

category of particular vulnerability?  I believe they do.   They

are  far  from  home in a strange land with laws,  cultures  and

sometimes even a language which they do not fully understand  or

are conversant with.  They live in the homes of their employers,

subject to instructions 24 hours a day, sometimes, unreasonable;

sometimes, reasonable.  And if they face ill-treatment, some  do

not  have  friends  to tell and often, do not  feel  comfortable

enough about our police system to make a complaint.  More to the

point,  many  may be reluctant to complain, lest they  may  find

themselves  sacked, sent home straightaway for this  will  cause

them  great financial loss in addition to the physical and other

abuses they have already suffered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on this point, I am reminded that our Minister for

Manpower has earlier pointed out our continuing policy  to  give

foreign workers a two-week period, at the most, once their  work

permits  are  revoked.  This is a threat, in a way,  that  hangs

over  the  heads of maids who want to complain.   So  for  these

reasons, the foreign domestic maids are more vulnerable than the

average  person in our society.  And for these reasons, I  stand

apart from those who would say we must raise the other penalties

first.  We should lead with this amendment and if these laws are

unequal, I think this can be justified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to my second question: whether this

amendment,  on  its own, is sufficient for the problem  that  it

tries to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>



solve.  Sir, in making laws and public policy, there are clearly

different  ways  and  stages for preventing  criminal  or  other

unwanted  behaviour.  There are at least four we can  think  of:

(1)  Education and self-control or restraint;  (2)  Counselling,

mediation,  often by the community;  (3) Preventive intervention

by  Police or other Government agencies;  (4) Punishment by  the

courts.  Of these four possibilities of stages and institutions,

the  Bill before this House clearly targets the fourth and  last

punishment by the courts.  This is not a prescription for  self-control  or  prevention.  These laws, if  passed,  increase  the

maximum  possible penalties.  The harm in that case has  already

been done.  The amendment does not help that particular employer

or  that  particular  maid.  It does not  prevent  a  particular

instance of abuse.  At most, we can say we are sending a  signal

to  other  employers that they should not cause  harm  to  other

maids.  Is that signal enough?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, crimes in a household are not rational and thought

out in advance.  They are often acted out on impulse, anger or a

moment  of  weakness.   In such cases, I  think,  frankly,  this

amendment  will not help.  Acting on impulse or anger,  few  are

going to pause, as NMP Claire Chiang has imagined they might, to

say,  "Wait, I will get 1� times the penalty.  Therefore, I will

stop."   Anger and impulse drive human nature much more strongly

than  this.   For  this  reason, while I  agree  that  the  ill-treatment  of domestic maids is an important problem, I  believe

this amendment alone is insufficient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Government to consider other

approaches  to  supplement  the present  amendment.   We  should

recognise that irrationality is often the cause of these  abuses

and   address  the  underlying  household  relationship  between

employer  and  domestic maid.  And I hope this  Government  will

take a multi-pronged approach to the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this approach, penal sanctions, such as those today,

will  play  a  part.   They can be a symbol that  we  take  ill-treatment  seriously.   Other measures  are  important.  So  the

symbol stands for something real and is not a mere symbol.   The

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>



measures  I  have  in  mind relate to the other  stages  I  have

mentioned for prevention, in terms of education, counselling and

mediation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been learning to use these tools more in

recent   years.   We  have  sought  to  apply  them  in  matters

concerning  the  family  and concerning the  community.   Beyond

family  members  and  neighbours, let us  also  include  another

member  of  many  Singaporean households, the domestic  maid  or

helper.   Government  agencies cannot and  should  not  do  this

alone.   They should work with civil society groups.  There  are

already  a  number  of civil society groups  and  non-government

organisations, such as the Family Life Society, to just  mention

one,  which  already offer some help and counselling to  foreign

maids.   More  can be done.  For example, courses for  employers

and  household members can be held.  But these groups often find

themselves  short  of staff and funds to cope  with  the  needs.

Government  can  and  should assist and support  their  work  by

closer  coordination  with MCD and relevant  agencies,  and  the

provision  of  funding.  Some useful work  that  could  be  done

includes  establishing  a hotline, or helpline,  especially  for

maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the employers, I urge information and education. The

Ministry  of  Manpower has taken steps in this direction.   More

can  be  done.  I would urge that on granting and renewing  work

permits,   the   Ministry  of  Manpower  sends   employers   (a)

information   on   agencies  and  NGOs  to   provide   frontline

counselling  and mediation; (b) information about  the  enhanced

penalties proposed by this Bill, assuming we pass it; and (c)  a

code  of  conduct  on treatment of domestic  maids,  if  not,  a

standard  contract.   Only some embassies  and  some  employment

agencies,  as  the  Minister well knows,  have  adopted  such  a

standard  contract.  The Government could help in this  case  to

ensure that other agencies are encouraged to follow suit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary aim of what I propose the Ministry or the

Government  as  a  whole   do would not be  to  scare  employers

because I think scare tactics would not help us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>



when  impulse  and irrationality take over.  Rather,  it  is  to

share  with  them  the  norms  that  this  community  and   this

Government expect of its citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which we could help domestic workers, the

maids, is to reconsider our repatriation policy as regards those

who  make  complaints.  At this point, I need some clarification

from  the  Minister or perhaps his colleague, the  Minister  for

Manpower.   My limited understanding of the issue  is  that  the

maids  who make complaints are treated just as any other foreign

worker who has his work permit terminated.  In other words, when

I  complain,  I  lose my job, I go home.  And  as  I  have  said

earlier,  in this short plea, that this in a way is  a  chilling

factor.    People  will  not  complain  because  their  economic

concerns and their livelihood are tied up with this issue.  They

will stomach much too much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such measures, Sir, can help prevent ill-treatment. Some

employer-maid   relationships  can  be  kept   cordial   through

counselling  and  mediation.  In other cases,  if  a  particular

relationship is beyond repair, then counselling and this  change

of manpower policy can help both sides recognise that it is best

for  the  maid  to  transfer to a new  employer  to  seek  other

employment,   rather  than  to  continue  in   that   household.

Prevention is a better approach than punishment after the crime.

These  measures will also help Singaporeans to be more  educated

and  move us towards a more gracious society, cognizant  of  the

human dignity of all of us and all among us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, some comments about the drafting of the Bill.

First,  I  think  it must be clear to all of us that  while  the

amendments  enhance  the  maximum penalty,  sentences  will  not

necessarily  be  heavier.   The  courts  retain  discretion   in

individual  cases  to  mete  out punishment  within  the  normal

limits, rather than going to the enhanced levels.  This Bill, in

this  sense, does not prescribe mandatory penalties.   Many  may

question  this.  I think  this is rightly so, that  these  cases

involve  household relationships, that there are many  variables

and, therefore, there may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>



be  many mitigating factors involved which should be left to the

courts on individual cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill singles out some crimes for enhanced

penalties but not others, as the Minister has explained.  But  I

find  that  this is so even if the other crimes are  of  a  very

similar  nature.  For example, wrongful confinement is  enhanced

under sections 343 and 344 of the Penal Code.  However, wrongful

confinement  under  section  342  is  not.   To  me,  the   only

difference  between these crimes is the period  of  confinement.

Section  343 is for three days or more.  Section 344 is  for  10

days or more.  Section 342, presumably, is for periods less than

three days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are differences of quantity and not of quality.

For consistency and to send the right signal, I would suggest to

the  Minister  that all these penalties should be enhanced.   It

should  then be left to the courts whether to enhance  penalties

in individual cases as befit the circumstances before them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point on drafting is how this Bill defines

"domestic  maids".  A "domestic maid" is defined as "any  female

house  servant  employed  in, . the  domestic  services  of  her

employer's  private  dwelling-house  and  who  resides  in   her

employer's private dwelling-house;".  The last part on residence

concerns  me.   It occurs to me that there are circumstances  in

which the employer, the person holding the employment pass,  may

house the maid elsewhere with another person, such as the parent

or  relative.  This, of course, is against the conditions of the

work permit.    However, though it is against the conditions  of

the  work  permit, it is not clear if the maid  would  still  be

protected  by  this  Bill,  since  she  does  not  live  in  the

employer's  house.   This means that the  employer  is  punished

under  the  work permit laws, but not the new enhanced penalties

under  the  Penal  Code.   For this  reason,  if  there  is  ill

treatment, it is not clear if the employer or relative would  be

subject to enhanced penalties under the Penal Code.  If this  is

true,  then  people  would benefit by doing  one  wrong,  acting

contrary  to  the work permit, and avoid punishment for  another

wrong, enhanced

penalties under this Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To clear these doubts and to give full effect to these

amendments,  I  suggest  the  section  should  have  a   deeming

provision.   Such a provision would deem that the holder  of  an

employment  permit is, for the purposes of the  Penal  Code,  an

employer for the purposes of enhanced penalties, and the maid is

deemed to live in the household, no matter what the situation in

actual  life  is.   This  would then make  two  sets  of  people

potentially liable, those who are in actual control of the  maid

and those who hold the work permit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill, as I have said from the start,

but  I  encourage that this be the first step.  Let  it  be  the

first  step  and let other measures, by Government  directly  or

Government enabling and civil society following, come after this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, I

shall  keep my speech short and sharp in view of the  fact  that

previous speakers have spoken quite eloquently on this.   In  my

view,  this is one Bill we should never have needed in the first

place.   But I rise to support this Bill, as I believe  that  we

should take stern measures against employers who commit offences

against such domestic maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the surface, the legislation appears discriminatory in

that  it  treats  offences  against  domestic  maids,  who   are

generally  foreigners,  more  seriously  than  similar  offences

committed by Singaporeans against other Singaporeans.  I have my

reservations about such discriminatory legislation although,  in

this particular case, there is justification for doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am assured that the Minister recognises the fear that

this legislation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1943</b></font><br><br>



can  lead  to abuses when maids may blackmail employers.   There

have  been  cases of maids making false allegations about  their

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can all agree that recent cases of abuses of maids

by  a few employers have tarnished and damaged the reputation of

Singapore, especially at a time when we want to attract  foreign

workers  who  work  and  live  here.   This  Bill  reflects  our

seriousness in ensuring that foreigners are not only welcomed to

Singapore,  their safety and security safeguarded, but  that  we

will go to the extent of having such discriminatory legislation.

In  the long run, however, Singapore's reputation as a place and

home  for  these  foreigners rests not on such  enforcement  and

deterrence, but on the goodwill, trust and respect that we  earn

of  being  responsible, caring and fair employers.   Until  such

time  when  we  can meet in this House again to  remove  such  a

provision  on  the  ground that such legislation  is  no  longer

required, we would not have achieved this goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge the Minister to consider other penalties,

such  as to prohibit employers and their immediate families from

ever employing a domestic maid, either local or foreign, if they

are  found guilty of abusing their maids.  In more serious cases

of  abuse, we should have no hesitation to shame and make public

the names of such offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that much of the problems we have seen in recent

cases stems from the disrespect some Singaporeans have of maids,

in  particular, and those who work and serve them,  in  general.

Perhaps  it  is timely that we considered a campaign  to  inform

Singaporeans  about  the  real need to  treat  foreigners  well,

whether  professionals or casual labourers,  and  especially  to

inform  them of the important contribution such foreigners  make

to Singapore's economy and society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I wish to support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise to speak in support of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an earlier sitting of this House on 30th August 1993,

the  Minister for Labour, in answer to an Oral Question, assured

the  House  that  firm action would be taken  against  employers

found  abusing their maids.  Not only are they subjected to  the

general  criminal laws of the land, the employer and the  spouse

will also be barred from future employment of foreign maids.  It

now   appears  that  these  measures  have  been  found  to   be

insufficient  in  dealing with the problem.  This  is  indeed  a

matter  of grave concern and deep disappointment.  In Singapore,

we  are  attempting to create a gracious and civil society.   At

the  same  time,  there  are  those  who  are  obstructing  this

objective and who are intent on victimising those who  work  for

them and their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is proposed in this Bill that the punishment be

enhanced  to 1.5 times that of the penalties in the  Penal  Code

for  the  prescribed offences.  While I agree that the penalties

should  be enhanced as proposed, I wonder whether that would  be

sufficient  to  deal with the mischief that the  Bill  seeks  to

address.   For example, are there enough avenues for  maids  who

allege  abuse  to  go to report such abuses?   Will  such  maids

refrain  from reporting if they think that to do so will  result

in  them  being unemployed or, worse, being asked to  leave  the

country?   Will  abusive  employers, who  are  cocooned  by  the

realisation that the maids may be most reluctant to report them,

be sufficiently discouraged by the increase in penalties?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be necessary and desirable to provide a code of

conduct,  a  series  of obligations of good  conduct,  that  the

employer  of every maid should be asked to comply with,  failing

which  they should then be deprived of the services of the  maid

and  also  be asked to pay the cost of the termination  of  such

services.  For instance, they may be asked to pay the  maid  the

remainder of the contract of services and other costs  to  allow

such  a  maid to gain other employment or to return to her  home

country.  I should emphasise that this is not a proposal to  set

up  a Maids' Charter or Bill of Rights.  Rather, there should be

a  code of decent behaviour that should serve as a guide to  all

those who employ maids.  In this way,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>



there  may  be  less  misunderstanding, fewer opportunities  for

abuse and more harmony between the employer, the family and  the

maid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think there should be some controls over maid

agencies  to  ensure that the maids are properly  briefed  about

taking  up  domestic duties in Singapore.  One  often  hears  of

maids  who  do  not  understand the standards  of  hygiene,  for

example, in Singapore.  Maid agencies should therefore give  the

maids orientation courses before they come to Singapore so  that

there  will   be less misunderstanding between the employer  and

the  employee.   And if there is less dissatisfaction  with  the

maid, fewer opportunities for abuse will arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to the Bill, there should be additional means

other than the enhanced punishments to control this problem.   I

refer  to  compensation for the victims of abuse.  It  would  be

extremely difficult, if not impossible, for any abused  maid  to

go  through the civil process, for example, to claim for loss of

pay or other costs, such as medical costs.  The courts also have

the jurisdiction and powers under the Criminal Procedure Code to

award to the victims compensation for the abuse.  This would,  I

am  sure,  be  a firm signal to the victim that we in  Singapore

would  want  not  only  to  see that the  abusive  employers  be

punished, but also that the victims be compensated.  Of  course,

if  this  type  of  compensation is allowed,  the  investigating

authorities must be very sure of the circumstances of each case.

But as there is already ex hypothesi a criminal investigation in

progress, I am sure that the standard approved will be  high  in

every case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to draw on a remark made by the

Minister just now when speaking on the Bill.  He mentioned  that

the Bill would not cover part-time workers.  On the question  of

whether  a  part-time worker should be regarded as somebody  who

does  not deserve this enhanced protection, perhaps the Minister

could explain to us why that is the case.  But, in general, Sir,

I support this Bill subject to the comments I have made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking in

support of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>



Bill.  I have heard all the comments that they have made and, in

particular,  I just want to address a few points raised  by  the

Members who have spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok and Mdm Claire Chiang asked whether we

would enhance or look at the punishment for family violence.   I

think  the  issue of family violence was fully debated  when  we

amended the Women's Charter about 1� years ago, and under  those

amendments  we  have provided a lot of access to women  who  are

abused  by their husbands and more or less given them an  easier

way  of getting redress from the courts or the authorities  when

they  are  abused by their husbands.  Of course,  I  believe  my

colleague in the Ministry of Community Development will continue

to look at the trends in wife abuse and if the amendments do not

deal  with the problem, then in future we may have to relook  at

the  punishments again.  But, as of now, I do not think  MCD  is

going to do anything about changing the Women's Charter, because

I  believe the amendments that it has made have adequately dealt

with the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the children who are vulnerable and, therefore, need

particular  protection, I believe we have also made revision  to

the  Children and Young Persons Act not long ago to enhance  the

penalties  for people who abuse children.  I think  we  have  to

wait and see whether the amendments have the intended effect  or

not.   If  not,  I believe my colleague will also  do  something

about  that.   But,  as  of now, I think  we  should  leave  the

situation as it is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have brought up this subject of maids to

this  House and ask Parliament to enhance the punishment is that

maids are very different from our relatives and other categories

of  workers.  These maids come from far away countries.  I would

say  most  of them are illiterate and live in rural areas.  Some

have  practically no idea what Singapore really  is  like  until

they step on to our shores and, therefore, adjustment can become

quite  difficult  for  them.  More so,  when  they  have  to  be

separated  from  their families and work in  a  totally  strange

environment under very strange conditions.  I think we  have  to

pay some special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>



attention  to how they adjust and cope with the new environment.

If  in  the process of working here, the employers were to  take

advantage  of  them or abuse them, then, in order  to  become  a

gracious  and  civil  society, we  have  got  to  find  ways  of

protecting  them.  Hence, this particular amendment  to  enhance

the punishment for those who abuse their maids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we should also equate our wives with maids.

We  really do not think our wives are maids.  I think all of  us

love our wives.  There is no doubt about that.  But for some who

do  not, there are other ways for the wives to seek redress from

their  relatives  and from those around them  and  they,  unlike

maids  who  are confined to the home, will know how  to  find  a

place  to  go  to if they are abused by their husbands.   So  we

should  not take this lightly and think that our wives are  like

maids and, therefore, we should enhance the punishment for those

who  abuse their wives.  But, as I said, if in time, indeed  the

abuse  of wives is a serious problem, then I have no doubt  that

the  Government will pay particular attention to that and  amend

the law, if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also in the process of reviewing the Penal Code for

other offences and the review has been on-going for a while  and

I  hope  to be able to move the amendments in Parliament  during

this  session.  But until they are ready, I will not be able  to

tell you more about the sort of amendments that we are going  to

make  and  whether or not we are going to enhance the  penalties

for family violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang and others have also suggested that we

should  have a standardised contract for maids and this  subject

has  been  raised many times, particularly with the Ministry  of

Manpower.   My colleague,  the Minister for Manpower,  tells  me

that  actually the contract between maid and employer is  really

between   the   two   of  them.   Maids  work  under   different

circumstances for different reasons, for different employers and

so  on,  and therefore it is quite difficult to have a  standard

contract specifying the exact terms for each of the maids and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>



employers.   But the Manpower Ministry encourages the  employers

to  have  a  contract with their maids, so that they  know  what

their  obligations are, what their duties are,  what  the  terms

are,  and  so  on.   And  I  believe that  most  employers  have

contracts for their maids.  Otherwise, they will not be able  to

settle disputes when these disputes arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower Ministry does have a unit in the Ministry to

help  settle disputes for the maids who complain to them or even

for  the  employers  who  complain  about  their  maids  to  the

Ministry.   My  colleague tells me that the  Ministry  has  been

quite successful in settling most of these disputes.  Therefore,

they  do  not  see  the need to impose a standard  contract  for

hiring  of  maids.  Some embassies, for example, do insist  that

maids  have  a  standard contract.  For example, the  Philippine

Embassy  does  insist that the maids have a  standard  contract;

otherwise they will not be allowed to work in Singapore.  Again,

we  leave  it  to  the individual embassies  to  work  out  such

arrangements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay suggested that there should be other

approaches  to  help resolve problems between  maids  and  their

employers.  As I said, the Manpower Ministry does have a unit to

help  to mediate in employer-employee disputes between the maids

and  employers.  But there are other measures that the  Manpower

Ministry is also considering.  For example, they are considering

issuing  an advisory to all foreign workers in Singapore.   This

advisory will give them information concerning the conditions of

work  permit  laws  and employment in Singapore,  the  telephone

numbers of the helpline of the Ministry, the contact numbers  of

the  relevant agencies such as embassies and the Police.  As  Mr

Tay  suggested,  there could be other NGOs  who  could  help  in

mediation  and  conciliation of problems between  employers  and

employees.   I  am sure the Manpower Ministry will consider  co-opting them if they can provide assistance to the Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is also considering doing an orientation video

on the culture and norms in Singapore and what the foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>



workers  can  expect  here,  and  this  will  be  produced   and

distributed free to all the employment agencies.  The employment

agencies  are  also encouraged to screen the  video  to  foreign

workers before they even start work.  The advisory and the video

will  be  available in a few months' time.  But in the  interim,

the  Manpower Ministry has provided the contact numbers  of  the

Foreign  Workers' Unit in the Ministry, through a letter  issued

to  all  the  employers, to all the domestic foreign workers  in

Singapore.   I believe those of us who are employers of  foreign

maids would have received such a notice some time ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from March last year, employers of foreign

domestic  maids are also required to take up a personal accident

policy for their foreign workers as a condition for grant  of  a

work  permit, and the minimum sum to be assured is  $10,000  and

the  compensation, should it be payable, will be  given  to  the

foreign domestic worker or her beneficiaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are steps that the Ministry has taken to improve

the  working  conditions and the terms of the  foreign  domestic

workers.   And  I  am sure the Manpower Ministry  will  consider

other  approaches and measures which they may think  about  from

time  to  time  which can help improve the lot of  the  domestic

workers in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked whether his understanding was correct

regarding  the repatriation policy of foreign domestic  workers,

that  is,  if  a worker were to complain, then the worker  would

lose  the  job  and  be repatriated by the Ministry  or  by  the

employer.  Apparently, according to the Manpower Ministry,  this

is  not  true.   If  a  complaint were to be lodged  against  an

employer,  the Manpower Ministry will not allow the employer  to

cancel  the  work permit just like that, because  they  want  to

investigate  the  complaint.  And sometimes the domestic  worker

could have gone to the embassy and be housed in the embassy, and

during  that period the worker also cannot be repatriated.   And

eventually should the maid be found to be not at fault  and  the

employer is at fault, and she has paid a lot of money or she



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>



really  wants  to work in Singapore, the Manpower Ministry  will

allow  her to continue to work in Singapore under a work  permit

for a different employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Ministry has been quite flexible, understanding and

compassionate  in  considering  the  plight  of  those   foreign

domestic  workers who have paid a lot of money to come  here  to

work and who really genuinely want to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the drafting suggestions made by Mr Tay, I have been

guided  by  the Attorney-General that this is the way we  should

draft  our laws.  Whether or not we should deem a person who  is

the  employer  as a registered employer of the domestic  worker,

even though that worker may not be working in his household, and

deem  the person liable for the enhanced punishment, I think  we

take  it  one step at a time.  If there is a trend to show  that

employers  overcome the law by getting another person to  employ

that worker, and eventually allow the person to work in his home

and  abuse the maid, then we will amend the law to take care  of

the  problem.   So, don't worry employers, if you intend  to  do

that, be sure the law will catch up with you in no time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Baharudin suggested banning employers from hiring maids

if  they  were found to have abused their maids.  Yes, in  fact,

that  is  what  the Manpower Ministry does.  If a maid  makes  a

complaint, and the complaint is substantiated, then the employer

would  be banned from hiring a domestic worker.  Employers  will

be  shamed  indeed if their cases go to court and you  will  see

that  their names will be all over the newspapers.  There is  no

doubt about that.  Our newspapers will make sure of that too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the code of conduct, as suggested by Prof. Chin

Tet Yung, I understand from my colleague, the Manpower Minister,

that  this  is  indeed  being  considered.   They  have  already

considered  putting up a guide for employers so that  they  know

their obligations and how they should treat their workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have dealt with most of the questions. If

there is any other question which I have left out, please let me

know.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>

<b>Phun):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the focus of the TAS Act, 1992, was on the separation

of  the  regulatory  function of TAS  from  the  commercial  and

operational  functions,  and  on  the  transfer  of  rights  and

liabilities of the reconstituted TAS to the privatised Singapore

Telecom  and  Singapore Post.  Since then, the telecommunication

environment  has  greatly  changed.   From  a  single   monopoly

operator environment, we are now moving towards a multi-operator

environment  where there is aggressive competition  between  all

players.   Today,  we  already  see competition  in  value-added

network  services,  cellular mobile  telephone  services,  radio

paging services, and Internet-access services, to name a few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come Year 2000, there will be competition in the biggest

piece  of the pie, which is the domestic and international basic

telecommunication services.  The whole process of liberalisation

aims to sharpen our competitive edge as a global business centre

and  bring maximum benefits to the consumers.  This can only  be

realised  if  there  is in place a strong and  clear  regulatory

framework which supports a level playing field and ensures fair,

effective  and sustainable competition among all operators.   In

addition,  the convergence of telecommunications, computing  and

broadcasting technologies is a worldwide trend giving rise to  a

new info-communications industry.  We will have to encourage the

introduction of new and innovative technologies in Singapore  to

ensure our services and infrastructure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>



meet  the  increasingly sophisticated needs  of  businesses  and

consumers.   The  regulatory  framework  that  we  develop  must

therefore  be able to address these rapid changes  in  both  the

market  environment and technology advancements.   In  order  to

address  these  varying issues, the current  TAS  Act  that  was

passed in April 1992 needs to be amended to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) ensure that TAS has the necessary powers to carry out

its  functions  and  duties  in  a  liberalised,  multi-operator

environment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) bring the TAS Act up-to-date given changes in

technology and new types of offences; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) ensure that the penalties and enforcement measures

specified   in   the   TAS   Act  are   adequate   to   regulate

telecommunication and postal licensees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the key provisions of the Bill. Clause

3  of  the Bill provides for a new function and duty for TAS  to

create an economic framework for the operation and provision  of

telecommunication  and  postal systems  and  services.   Such  a

framework would promote and safeguard competition and  fair  and

efficient market conduct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is necessary if TAS is to regulate any conduct which

may restrict competition in telecommunication services or in the

telecommunication  market.  As part of the regulatory  framework

that  TAS  will  establish,  TAS  proposes  to  issue  codes  of

practice, which would apply to its licensees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 7 of the Bill provide for additional

conditions  that  TAS  may impose on a  telecommunication  or  a

postal  licensee.   In  particular,  conditions  requiring   the

licensee  to  enter into agreements or arrangements relating  to

interconnection, access and sharing of infrastructure, would  be

made express.  The guiding principle is that where licensees are

unable to agree on the terms and conditions for interconnection,

access and sharing of infrastructure, these would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>



determined by TAS.  These issues are critical issues in a multi-operator environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interconnection and equitable access between and among

operators  are essential for end-to-end connectivity and  ensure

transparency  to  end  users  in a  multi-operator  environment.

While  TAS  has set broad guidelines for operators to co-operate

in  this area, TAS would need to be empowered to determine these

terms and conditions where licensees are unable to agree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 7 of the Bill also require telecommunication

and  postal licensees to comply with TAS' codes of practice  and

standards  of performance which TAS is empowered to issue  under

clause  27  of  the  Bill.  TAS may also  give  directions  with

respect   to   standards  of  performance  and  procedures   for

compliance by licensees.  Clauses 5 and 8 empower TAS to suspend

specific services instead of the entire licence which may  cover

several services, depending on the circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 makes it a requirement for TAS' prior approval to

be  sought  for  connection of equipment to a  telecommunication

system  or  equipment of any licensee, and  not  just  a  public

telecommunication licensee.  This is to protect the integrity of

our networks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 of the Bill provides for further measures against

telecommunication  fraud.  Two new offences in  connection  with

dishonestly   obtaining   a   telecommunication   service    are

introduced. With changes in technology, there has been  a  shift

in offences from the traditional telephony environment to mobile

communications.  Under the first offence, a person is guilty  if

he  has in his custody or control, anything which he intends  to

use  to  obtain  a  service  dishonestly  or  which  he  intends

dishonestly, to allow others to use to obtain a service.   Under

the  second offence, a person is guilty if he supplies or offers

to  supply  anything, which is intended to be used to  obtain  a

service  dishonestly. These provisions would address  those  who

possess  cloned  telecommunication equipment  and  use  them  to

dishonestly  obtain or use a telecommunication service.   It  is

important to control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>



the  incidence of fraud, not just to safeguard the industry  but

also  to  ensure  that  the higher costs of  operations  do  not

ultimately translate to higher prices to legitimate end-users.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in light of the various cable cut incidents last year

and  early  this year, we have put in place further measures  to

ensure that parties take due care against such incidents. Clause

18  increases  the fine that may be imposed for  an  offence  of

damaging  a  cable of a telecommunication system to $1  million.

Clause  19  introduces a new section which imposes  a  duty  for

persons who excavate any land to first ascertain the location of

any main, cable, pipe, conduit, circuit or wire belonging to  or

under the control of a telecommunication system licensee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant new provision is introduced in clause

23  of  the  Bill.  TAS is empowered to determine the space  and

access  requirements by the developer or owner of  the  building

who  requires  a telecommunication service to be provided  in  a

building.   This  is important in a multi-operator  environment.

TAS,  the  regulator,  is  in the best position  to  ensure  the

optimally-efficient space requirements of  all  operators  in  a

multi-operator environment. By doing so,  TAS would ensure  that

consumers  are  not deprived of the choice  of   more  than  one

service  provider,  for  the provision  of  a  telecommunication

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 expands section 103 to allow all

telecommunication   licensees,   and   not   just    a    public

telecommunication  licensee,  to  enter  any  building  for  the

purpose of eliminating interruptions or interference to a radio-communication system or service. This is necessary  to  maintain

the quality of service to its customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 introduces two new sections, sections 103A and

103B.   Section  103A  empowers TAS  to  give  directions  to  a

telecommunication licensee, and to a developer or an owner of  a

building,   on  the provision of access for the installation  of

facilities,  necessary  for  the  provision  or  enhancement  of

quality  of a telecommunication service.  Section 103B  empowers

TAS to direct a licensee to co-ordinate and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>



cooperate  with  any other person in the use or sharing  of  any

telecommunication  installation, plant  or  system  to  minimise

duplication or wastage of resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining provisions of the Bill are housekeeping

matters,  such  as  the  deletion of  obsolete  provisions,  the

enhancement of penalties under the existing Act as well as  some

minor amendments, such as removing the restriction on the number

of   Board  members of TAS.  This is to allow  TAS  to  tap  the

expertise of members from various industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill provides a framework which would equip TAS

with  the necessary powers and safeguards for a dynamic,  multi-operator, telecommunications environment.  The implementation of

the  proposed  amendments  to the  Act  would  serve  to  better

regulate the industry and protect the interest of  the public as

well as improve the standards of performance of the operators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to speak in support of the TAS (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, as introduced by the Minister of State for

Communications,  are  quite wide ranging, and  these  amendments

make  up  to  date the Telecommunication Authority of  Singapore

Act,  in  a  field  which is characterised by rapid  change  and

rapidly changing technologies which have very definitive  impact

on  competition, markets and market powers of the players.   The

TAS  has  a  role  to  create the framework  for  a  competitive

telecommunication service system in a market that has the  scale

and  scope  of  a  natural monopoly.  Further, telecommunication

services   have   also  the  features  of   call   and   network

externalities which are, in general, spillover gains  to  others

arising from the consumption of that service by an individual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These features of natural monopoly and externalities in the

telecommunication



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>



services industry make the fair and efficient regulation of that

market  environment so difficult.  By the character of a natural

monopoly  in  scale  and scope, it is entirely  possible  for  a

monopoly  to supply the whole of the market demand cheaper  than

multiple firms.  Yet, regulatory controls must be introduced for

a  rule-based  competition,  as  competition  is  good  for  the

consumer  and raises the standard of services of the  providers.

Someone  asked  me, a few months ago, why the Government  should

regulate and control our single licence holder, SingTel, to give

fair  competition to all these new entrants, many of  them  from

overseas,  when  our own operator may not be so  fairly  treated

overseas  in  other markets.  I do not know whether  this  is  a

valid complaint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good for the consumers here that some regulation for

universal service and interconnection access and the sharing  of

infrastructure  are provided for in these amendments.   This  is

done  in a general environment for encouraging deregulation  and

allowing  access  for  the  new  prospective  entrants  to   the

industry.   Consumers in Singapore have gained from the  limited

competition we have recently seen in the mobile phone and paging

markets.   Prices have fallen substantially and service  quality

has  generally  risen.  This augurs well for  further  areas  of

telecommunication services which may be deregulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulation for competition also gives our own major

service  operator the opportunity to get ship-shape and  tip-top

for   its   competition  overseas  in  this  very  intense   and

technologically fast driven market.  The most fundamental  tenet

in this deregulatory exercise must be to enable the industry and

the  players  in  it  to be abreast of the latest  technological

developments  and  the  facility they afford  to  discriminating

consumers.  Such technological developments have always expanded

the scope for competition and the boundary limits of the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems paradoxical that a deregulatory environment with

new  entrants  is also bringing with it new regulations.   These

regulatory controls which TAS will have to administer  are  more

complex and will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>



have  to  be  more  alive  to  the inter-relationships  and  the

efficient  networking  of  infrastructure  with  interconnection

access.  It is an everlasting play for profit, technologies  and

efficiency for the players, the TAS and the consumers.   I  hope

the Minister will also assure the House that consumers' interest

will be safeguarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, clause 26 of the Bill amends two subsections

of  section  114  dealing  with the  errors  and  omissions  for

information transmitted through telecommunication.  Under  this,

public  telecommunication licensee's exclusion of  liability  is

enabled provided these injuries or losses are beyond the  public

telecommunication  licensee's  control.   The  safeguarding   of

electronic  snooping or security control are important  features

for  public telecommunication licensees.  In the US, people have

sued  common  carriers for losses due to fraudulent messages  or

other   economic   losses  due  to  delays  or  distortions   in

telecommunication  messages.  One  particular  concern  is  that

service  provider employees should not be allowed  to  read  the

contents  of  other  people's  messages  without  authorisation.

Perhaps,  we  have not built up enough case experience  in  this

field  to  pinpoint, as of now, how the lines of  responsibility

should  be  identified  or drawn within the  various  ambits  of

responsibilities.  Nonetheless, it is important to know that the

Bill   does   not   exclude  entirely  the   public   licensee's

responsibility.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank

the GPC Chairman for his support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched on the safeguarding of the interest of

consumers.   Indeed, safeguarding the interest of  consumers  is

one  of the key objectives of TAS' function as a regulator.   In

order  to ensure that consumers are able to realise the benefits

of  effective  and  sustainable competition in a  multi-operator

environment,   a  framework  for  fair  competition   has   been

established.  TAS is mindful that there must be a level  playing

field for all operators.  This would be done by establishing the

relevant codes of practice and standards of performance for  the

operators to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>



comply  under  the  proposed  revisions  to  the  TAS  Act.   As

mentioned by Mr Chay, consumers have been the main beneficiaries

since   competition  was  introduced  in  the  telecommunication

industry  last  April.   With  further  liberalisation  of   the

telecommunication  industry, they can look forward  to  enjoying

the  wider  range  of new and innovative products  and  services

offered  at  competitive prices and a high  quality  of  service

standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also commented on clause 26 which seeks to amend

section 114.  He has rightly pointed out that we have to look at

the  implication of this clause and I would like to  assure  the

Member  that  where  there is loss from  error  or  omission  in

information  transmitted through telecommunication,  the  public

telecommunication licensee is not liable where it is due to  the

fault  of  another person or causes beyond the  control  of  the

public telecommunication licensee.  We do this because, in order

for  e-commerce, for instance, to thrive, we need to  have  this

protection so that the telecommunciation licensee will  be  able

to  provide   good quality of service standards for transmission

of  electronic data, and so on.  As for loss due to the fault of

the  telecommunication  licensee,  it  is  a  commercial  matter

between the provider of the service and the consumer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chay also raised a concern about giving new

entrants  the  opportunity to compete with SingTel when  SingTel

itself  is not given the same treatment overseas.  I would  like

to  say  that Singapore's competitive edge hinges on our ability

to  continually respond to technological changes and provide  an

efficient    and    innovative   info-communication    services.

Liberalisation of the telecommunication industry  will  help  us

maintain our competitive edge and entrench Singapore as a global

business  centre, besides encouraging SingTel to get  ship-shape

for its competition both here and overseas, as pointed out by Mr

Chay.   This  is also in accordance with our commitment  to  WTO

group  of basic telecommunications to help achieve a liberalised

global telecommunication market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to repeal the Princess Elizabeth Fund Act.

The  Act  was  originally  passed in  1949  to  erect  workmen's

dwellings  with  monies  left over from the  Princess  Elizabeth

Wedding Central Celebrations Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act was enacted to empower the HDB to let out and

manage  the Princess Elizabeth Estate comprising 252 residential

units  and  18  commercial  units.  The  situation  has  changed

completely  since 1949.  By the early 1980s,  close  to  75%  of

Singaporeans live in HDB flats.  About two-thirds  of  them  are

staying   in  home  ownership  flats.   The  units  at  Princess

Elizabeth  Estate were outdated and no longer popular as  rental

units.   In  1986,  approval was given to HDB  to  include  this

estate  in  HDB's decanting and redevelopment plan.  The  estate

has since been cleared and the vacant land returned to the State

on 20th July 1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the demolition of the buildings and the land returned

to the State, the Act is now obsolete.  The Attorney-General has

confirmed that it would be in order to repeal the Act.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT FROM OFFICE OF US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for Law what

steps  will  be  taken to address the issues  contained  in  the

report  from  the Office of the US Trade Representative  on  the

growing rates of piracy of intellectual property in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report to which the Member refers (the U.S. 1998

National  Trade Estimate Report on Singapore issued by the  USTR

on 31st March 1998) claimed that there has been a recent upsurge

in  pirated  software,  video and music  CDs  and  CD-ROMs  into

Singapore and that Singapore enforcement measures are inadequate

to deal with them.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that Singapore has the best IPR protection

regime  in  Asia  according  to an  independent  survey  by  the

Political and Economic Risk Consultancy or Perc last year.   For

three   consecutive  years,  the  International   Institute   of

Management  Development or IMD has ranked Singapore as  the  top

Asian  nation  in  the protection of IPR.  In the  same  survey,

Singapore was even ranked ahead of developed countries  such  as

Australia, Japan, France and the U.K.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government nevertheless recognises that changing

circumstances and improving technologies pose new and  different

challenges  in  IPR  protection  and  enforcement  and  we   are

committed to meeting these challenges by a combination of strict

laws and enforcement.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Legislation</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Copyright (Amendment) Act 1998, which was passed on

19th  February  1998 was brought into force last week  (on  16th

April  1998).  It puts into effect Singapore's obligations under

the  WTO  Agreement  on  Trade-Related Aspects  of  Intellectual

Property Rights or TRIPS Agreement.  The Act also enables us  to

accede  to  the  1971  Berne Convention for  the  Protection  of

Literary and Artistic Works, a fact noted in the USTR Report.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also a few days ago announced that

manufacturers  of  optical  discs will  be  licensed  under  the

Control of Manufacture Act.  A condition of the licence requires

the manufacturer not to infringe intellectual property rights in

its  operations covered by the licence.  In addition, under  new

regulations of the Regulation of Imports and Exports  Act,  only

these   licensed  manufacturers  will  be  permitted  to  import

replicating  and mastering equipment for optical  discs.   These

controls  will discourage the illegal replication  of  copyright

materials.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The optical disc manufacturing industry has also come

forward  to support Government's efforts.  Last Friday,  optical

disc  manufacturers signed a Code of Conduct which puts in place

operational  procedures in their business to enhance  protection

against the piracy of intellectual property rights.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Enforcement</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as enforcement is concerned, the USTR Report is

not  correct  to say that we have a self-policing  system  where

enforcement  is  left  largely  to  the  copyright  owners.  Our

experience has however shown that effective enforcement requires

more than just action by the Government.  It is best carried out

with  the  cooperation of the industry and the public and  by  a

combination  of  their  resources  as  well  as  those  of   our

enforcement  agencies.  This is borne out by the experiences  of

other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. and the

United States.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from Government agencies being inactive, the Police

have  initiated 20 raids in the first 3 months of this  year  in

Sim  Lim  Square  and  Bugis Village targetted  specifically  at

retail  pirates.  These have resulted in the arrest of 21 people

and  the  seizure of over 7,000 pirated articles.  A further  49

police raids were conducted on the initiative of IPR owners  and

a further 47 persons were arrested.  In the same period, the IPR

Warrant  Unit of the CID has seized infringing articles with  an

estimated  retail value of over $880,000.  Separate  raids  have

also  been  conducted  by  the Board of  Film  Censors  and  the

Hawkers' Department.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude by reiterating what I said during the

Second  Reading  of  the  Copyright (Amendment)  Bill,  ie  that

Singapore  is  fully committed to the protection of intellectual

property  rights.   It  is clearly in our  interests  to  do  so

because   our  maturing  economy  will  increasingly   rely   on

attracting knowledge-intensive industries to invest here and  on

encouraging the development of such industries locally.  We will

monitor  the  situation, continue with our current  efforts  and

introduce new measures if necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under the Employment Act, a female employee is

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical leave granted by doctors is recognised for the

purpose of enabling an employee to justify his absence from work

and  to  be paid for the period of absence.  It is not meant  to

grant additional payment to an employee if he is already on paid

leave  such  as paid annual leave or any public holiday.  It  is

also  not intended to enable an employee to claim for salary  on

the  day or days when he or she is on no pay leave or on a  rest

day. Hence, a female employee who is granted medical leave while

on  no-pay  maternity leave will not be entitled to  paid  leave

during the period of medical leave. This is clearly spelled  out

in section 44(4A) of the Employment Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA was corporatised in October 1997. Under the Port of

Singapore Authority (Dissolution) Act 1997, the port charges for

domestic cargo handled by PSA Corporation are regulated  by  the

Maritime  and  Port  Authority (MPA). PSA  has  to  justify  any

increase in its domestic tariffs to MPA before implementing  any

tariff  hikes.   To  date, PSA Corporation  has  not  sought  to

increase  its domestic cargo tariffs.  In fact, local  stevedore

rates,  which is the major component in domestic cargo  tariffs,

have decreased by 25% over the last 20 years.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep port costs down, MPA reduced port dues for

container  ships  by  20%  since May 1996.   PSA  and  MPA  also

recently  announced  the  waiver  of  overside  bunker  wharfage

charges which will result in a cost saving of $17 million a year

for port users.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of warehousing, PSA Corporation is one of

many  warehouse lessors in Singapore and port users have a large

pool  of warehouse operators to choose from.  PSA has also  been

responsive  to prevailing market conditions.  From  March  1998,

PSA  has lowered rents at Keppel Distripark by 10%.  It has also

been granting its tenants further rebates on their leases.

<div align="center"><b>SAFE BEACHES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National Development

(a)  what are the measures taken by his Ministry to ensure  that

our  beaches  are safe for swimming, sailcraft and powered  boat

activities;  (b)  whether the beaches are  demarcated  for  such

activities  by  signages  or  markers;  and  (c)  what  are  the

programmes  initiated to increase the awareness  of  the  public

concerning the danger spots along our beaches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many agencies are involved in the management of

Singapore's  beaches,  coastlines and related  sea  sports.  For

example, PWD is responsible for breakwaters and seawalls, NParks

is  responsible for the management of parks adjacent to beaches,

while  Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) regulates  the  use  of

sail  crafts  and powered boat activities in water  adjacent  to

beaches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the safety of swimmers from watercrafts, MPA

has  regulations  to restrict watercrafts from encroaching  into

areas  designated  for  swimming. For beaches  close  to  parks,

NParks  also does not allow powered water-sports boats like  jet

skis  from  being launched from parks. Warning signs  have  also

been put up along potentially dangerous areas along the beach to

warn  the public. In addition, the Singapore Life-Saving Society

provides  a  rescue service at East Coast Park and Changi  Beach

Park.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NParks has, through the media, encouraged the public to

observe warning signs erected. The Singapore Life-Saving Society

has  also used the media as a means to educate the public on the

need  to exercise care and to take the necessary precautions  to

ensure their safety.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the various agencies have taken steps to make

the beaches and shorelines as safe as possible, users of beaches

should exercise due care when visiting the beaches.

<div align="center"><b>PROFIT GUARANTEES OF SPECIALIST CLINIC PRACTICES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health whether

his  Ministry is aware that some specialist doctors have  agreed

to  give specific profit guarantees to a listed company that  is

proposing  to  purchase their specialist clinic  practices,  and

what will be the adverse impact such an arrangement will have on

the standard of medical practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is aware that four specialist doctors have

given  specific  profit  guarantees to  a  listed  company  that

purchased their medical practices. The profit guarantee does not

contravene   any   existing  legislation   covering   healthcare

establishments or practices, and the parties do not require  the

approval  of  my  Ministry  for  the  transaction.  However,  my

Ministry  is  very concerned with any commercial transaction  or

arrangement   which  can  lead  to  a  lowering  of   our   high

professional and ethical standards of medical practice.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media reported last week that the council of the

Singapore  Medical Association (SMA) has circulated a resolution

on   the  issue  of  profit  guarantees  to  its  members.   The

resolution states that:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Medical practitioners who are involved directly or

indirectly in the provision of medical services associated  with

profit   guarantees,   whether  imposed  upon   or   voluntarily

undertaken by them, are putting themselves at increased risk  of

unethical  behaviour arising from patients' interests no  longer

always being their first consideration.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMA's position is that the financial imperative imposed

by  profit guarantees is incompatible with the Singapore Medical

Council's   Physician's  Pledge  and  the   ethical   principles

subscribed to by the doctors.  The SMA President said  that  the

association is concerned that such commercial arrangements  will

compromise  the  doctor-patient  relationship  which  puts   the

patient's  interest first.  The Singapore Medical Council  (SMC)

is in full agreement with SMA's resolution.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry supports the strong stand taken by the SMA

and  SMC.   A high standard of ethical behaviour by the  medical

profession  is  at  the  heart of good  medical  care.   In  the

provision  of medical care, the patient's interest  must  always

come first.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that the doctor-patient relationship is

different  from other consumer-provider transactions, where  the

consumer  has sufficient knowledge of the service or product  to

make  an  informed choice.  It is therefore vital in  a  doctor-patient  relationship  that  the doctor  remains  professionally

independent to do what he believes is best for the patient, free

from  the  influence of any non-professional consideration  that

may   potentially  be  in  conflict  with  the  patients'   best

interests. Doctors who enter into business arrangements must  be

circumspect  and avoid any situation or arrangement which  would

potentially compromise their professional independence and their

patients' interests.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that high professional and ethical standards

of  medical  practice are maintained in Singapore,  my  Ministry

will  scrutinise more closely and conduct more intensive medical

audits on those medical establishments which are at greater risk

of  compromise of professional or ethical standards.  This  will

help  ensure  that  high professional and ethical  standards  of

medical practice are maintained in Singapore.  Let me assure the

House  that  MOH will not hesitate to act decisively  to  uphold

high professional and ethical standards of medical practice,  by

bringing   errant   doctors  to  SMC   for   investigation   and

disciplinary action whenever such action is warranted.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electrical workers are required to comply with the

national wiring Code of Practice and gazetted regulations, which

are  in  English.   Furthermore,  the  instruction  manuals   of

electrical   fittings  are  normally  in  English.    Therefore,

licensed  electrical workers need to have adequate knowledge  of

English  to understand the technical and procedural requirements

in  the  Code  of Practice, gazetted regulations and instruction

manuals to ensure that safety is not compromised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB therefore has to use English when it assesses

the   competency  of  applicants  for  issue  of  licences   for

electrical workers.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCING OVERSEAS BUSINESS IN SINGAPORE DOLLARS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether

the  Monetary  Authority of Singapore will  review  the  current

policy  of restricting Singapore-based companies to borrow  only

in foreign currency to finance their overseas business expansion

via  shareholder loans and whether the policy can be relaxed  to

allow Singapore companies to do so in Singapore dollars instead.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS' restriction on Singapore Dollar credit facilities for

use  outside  Singapore  applies only  to  non-residents.  Singa

poreans,  and companies that are majority-owned by Singaporeans,

are  free  to  borrow  in  Singapore Dollars  to  finance  their

overseas operations.  Banks are not required to consult  MAS  on

such loans, regardless of amount.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS explained this policy publicly in a letter to the

Straits  Times  in  May 1993, after Singapore  embarked  on  the

regionalisation drive. It has also informed the banks.  But  the

existing  MAS  notice  to  banks,  Regulation  621,  was  issued

earlier, in 1992. As it stands, Regulation 621 still states that

banks  should consult MAS on Singapore Dollar lending  to  Singa

poreans, for use outside Singapore. Banks still feel constrained

by  what  is stated in MAS Regulation 621.  MAS will revise  the

Regulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is currently reviewing its policy on the

internationalisation of the Singapore Dollar. The aim is to make

the policy intention clearer and more explicit, and minimise the

need  for  banks  to consult MAS before making Singapore  Dollar

loans  to  non-residents. The basic policy  of  not  encouraging

internationalisation remains unchanged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is working out guidelines to allow subsidiaries of

Singaporean  companies, and joint ventures  between  Singaporean

and  foreign  companies,  to borrow  in  Singapore  Dollars  for

purposes  of  regionalisation projects. We  are  also  examining

whether to ease some of the specific restrictions on the use  of

Singapore  Dollars,  especially for activities  related  to  the

capital markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will issue a revised Regulation to banks once this

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review is complete.

<div align="center"><b>REAL TIME GROSS SETTLEMENT SYSTEM</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister (a) what

is  the  status of the Real Time Gross Settlement System at  the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore; (b) what caused the  delay  in

its implementation; and (c) whether its implementation will make

the  Singapore dollar less vulnerable to speculative attacks  by

hedge funds.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is in the final stages of testing the Real Time Gross

Settlement  (RTGS)  System.   We  are  currently  conducting  an

Integrated Test of the System involving all participating banks.

MAS  together  with  the banks will review the  results  of  the

Integrated  Test  before  deciding on the  implementation  date,

which will likely be in June 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RTGS system was originally scheduled for implementation

at  the  end  of 1997.  This target date was set  early  in  the

project.  During the course of the project, however, a number of

operational and technical issues had to be resolved.   Following

a review of the project schedule, MAS decided that the middle of

this year was a more realistic target date for implementation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RTGS system is merely a real-time payment system to

settle inter-bank payments on a gross basis, ie, transaction  by

transaction, instead of accumulating all the transactions during

the  day to be settled on a net basis at the close of the  day's

business.   RTGS systems are being implemented in many countries

to  reduce  settlement risks.  They do not reduce nor facilitate

speculative attacks on a country's currency. How vulnerable  the

Singapore  Dollar is to a speculative attack depends  mainly  on

Singapore's economic fundamentals.

<div align="center"><b>HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs

whether the Government has responded to the allegations  in  the

US  State  Department Singapore Country Report on  Human  Rights

Practices 1997, including the allegation that the Government had

used  the judicial system for political purposes, and,  if  not,

whether the Government intends to respond.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given a detailed response to the 1997 US

State  Department  Country  Report  on  Human  Rights  Practices

through  an  Aide Memoire, which was conveyed to the Embassy  of

the  United  States  of America on 30th March  1998.   The  Aide

Memoire drew the attention of the Embassy to the errors of  fact

and   misleading  allegations  contained  in  the  Report.    It

emphasised that the Singapore Government does not condone  human

rights abuse and takes a serious view of any allegation of human

rights abuse in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aide Memoire expressed the Government's surprise and

regret  that  the 1997 Report has repeated old allegations  that

the Government has used libel suits to intimidate the opposition

and questioned the independence of the judiciary in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government rejected these unfounded allegations. It

has consistently pointed out that libel and defamation are taken

very  seriously in Singapore.  If the integrity of its political

leaders  or  key  institutions is questioned, Singapore  leaders

will  not  hesitate  to  clear their  names  and  protect  these

institutions  through due process of law.  Legal action  against

libel  and  defamation  is an established  part  of  Singapore's

political  culture  that seeks to maintain a  high  standard  of

truth and honesty in politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absurd to claim that the opposition in Singapore has

not  been able to challenge the dominance of the PAP because  it

has  been  intimidated by the threat of libel suits.  Opposition

leaders have themselves never hesitated to sue in the courts  to

clear their names when they believed they were defamed.  In some

cases, they have succeeded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegations against the Singapore Judiciary are also

completely  unfounded.   The Singapore  Judiciary  and  judicial

system  have  consistently  received  high  ratings  in  eminent

international  surveys  which affirm  the  independence  of  the

judiciary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has stated that it is regrettable that the

US  State  Department Report on Human Rights Practices persisted

in  making  unsubstantiated and unwarranted allegations  despite

the  facts  being  repeatedly drawn to its  attention.   It  has

requested the errors of fact and wrongful allegations be brought

to the attention of the authors of the Report.

<div align="center"><b>REVENUE LOSS ON INTRODUCTION OF GST</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he

will  provide the details on how the figure of $8.2  billion  in

total revenue loss to the Government on introducing GST for  the

period FY94-FY97 is arrived at.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST was introduced in April 1994, it was accompanied

by  a  comprehensive package of  tax cuts and rebates to  offset

the   impact  of  GST.   The  package  comprises  corporate  tax

reduction, individual income tax offsets, property tax  rebates,

reduction/suspension  of  various  indirect  taxes   and   other

additional rebates and offsets to assist the low income  groups.

The  revenue  loss  figure is computed from  the  taxes  forgone

arising  from  the  tax cuts and rebates,  and  also  additional

expenditure  incurred by the Government to implement  the  other

offset measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of $8.2 billion for the revenue loss and GST

collection  of  $6.7  billion  for  the  period  FY94-FY97  were

estimated  from  figures available as at  early  February  1998.

Based on the latest available figures, the revised estimates  of

the  revenue  loss  and GST collection for the period  FY94-FY97

should  be  $7.9  billion  and $6.8 billion  respectively.   The

breakdown of the revenue loss figure is as follows :

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)the top personal income tax rate was reduced from 33%

to  30%,  with corresponding  reductions in other tax  brackets.

Personal  relief was also increased from $2,000 to  $3,000.   In

addition, an annual rebate on individual income tax of  $700  in

YA  1994,  declining by $50 per year until  YA  1998,  was  also

granted.  The revenue loss from these changes amounted to  $3.91

billion;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the reduction in corporate tax by 3% resulted in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revenue loss of $2.55 billion;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)property tax rebates were granted on a sliding scale

for  owner-occupied  residential properties with  annual  values

less  than  $10,000.  The  property tax  rebates  totalled  $310

million;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)duties on motor vehicles and petroleum products, PUB

tax  and  CESS  were all reduced, along with the  suspension  of

entertainment duty, film hire duty and Telecom tax.   All  these

changes resulted in revenue loss of $838 million; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)other offsets comprise increases in the Public

Assistance  granted to single-person or single-parent households

and in the Singapore Allowance granted to pensioners; additional

subsidies  for  health  and education; rebates  on  Service  and

Conservancy charges for Singapore citizens staying in 1-, 2- and

3-room  HDB flats; rental rebates for Singapore citizens staying

in  1-  and 2-room rental HDB flats; and grants to the Citizens'

Consultative  Committees. These additional offsets  targeted  at

the lower income groups amounted to $306 million.
