<div align="center"><b>STANDING ORDERS OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PARLIAMENT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Amendment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister   whether  he  is  aware  that   certain

sections in the Standing Orders of Parliament are

irrelevant,  and whether he will  take  steps  to

amend them in order to bring them into conformity

with our independent status.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, there is a Standing Orders Committee

and  if  the  Member  for Punggol  will  write  a

memorandum  to  you  or to  the  Standing  Orders

Committee  and  indicate which  sections  of  the

Standing Orders are irrelevant or out of date,  I

am quite sure the Committee will look into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



matter  and make the necessary amendment;  I,  for

one, am not particularly aware of sections in  the

Standing Orders which are irrelevant at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is

the  Deputy  Prime Minister aware that  since  the

Standing  Orders  were drawn up,  they  have  been

amended  several  times?  But  subsequent  to  our

achieving  independent status and the  passing  of

several Acts, namely, the Constitution (Amendment)

Act,  1965,  and  the Republic of  Singapore  Inde

pendence Act (No. 9 of 1965), I believe there  are

consequential amendments necessary to be  made  to

the  Standing Orders. For example, in the Standing

Orders, under the section "Order of Business", one

sees   "Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  Address"   and

"Messages  from  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara".  I

would  say  that,  in order to keep  our  Standing

Orders up to date, amendments are necessary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I admire the Member for

Punggol for being up to date in this sense, but  I

would say that, as far as principles regarding the

conduct  of  business in the House are  concerned,

there   has   been  no  necessity  to   make   any

significant  changes. As the  Member  himself  has

pointed out, the Standing Orders are reviewed from

time to time to bring them up to date according to

conditions prevailing in the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The references that the Member for Punggol has

pointed  out  require only minor  amendments  with

regard  to nomenclature, and I am quite sure.  Mr

Speaker,  that you yourself can handle  that,  and

that  the  Government Printer  will  only  be  too

obliged to bring the present Standing Orders up to

date in the light of the new Constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

you  will recall that during the Budget debate  in

Committee  of Supply, time and again we  ran  into

difficulties  about guillotine  times.  Would  the

Deputy Prime Minister not agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



that  there is now occasion for extending the time

for the Budget debate in Committee of Supply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> There may be a good reason if

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang can argue before the

Standing  Orders Committee in order to revise  the

times  now  allocated  for the  Budget  debate  in

Committee  of Supply. It is quite true  that  when

the  present times were drawn up, it  was  in  the

light  of  the situation when much of the business

of  the  House  and of the Government  came  under

Malaysian  Central Government control.  Therefore,

we  found  it was unnecessary to spend  that  much

time  as  we  had done before we joined  Malaysia.

However,  now that all of the powers have reverted

to  the  Singapore Government, it may be necessary

for  us to look into the matter. If the Member for

Choa  Chu  Kang  or,  for that matter,  any  other

Member  of  the  House,  would  like  to  send  in

memoranda to the Standing Orders Committee,  I  am

quite  sure we will all together be able to  bring

up  to  date the Standing Orders to a state  which

will fit the present times.

<div align="center"><b>PLAYING FIELDS FOR AIDED SCHOOLS IN CITY AREA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Education,  as certain aided schools in  the  City

Area  have  no  playing-fields, if the  Government

will  consider allowing those schools the  use  of

any  available State land in the vicinity  of  the

schools as playing-fields.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the problem ol providing  adequate

playing facilities in the city area for schools is

not  confined  only  to aided  schools,  but  many

Government  schools in the city  area  share  this

handicap.  There is hardly any State land  in  the

city  available  for  use  as  playing-fields  for

schools, and we have only been able to secure  the

use  of  the  land at Shenton Way cm  a  temporary

basis  for  seven  Government and Government-aided

schools since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



1959.  Unfortunately, the area available has  been

reduced;  first, by the building of  the  N.T.U.C.

Conference  Hall  and second, by the  excision  of

another portion for barter trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that work is now being undertaken to

build  a  car  park on the remaining part  of  the

field, and that an alternative site will therefore

have to be secured. This is being attended to. The

Ministry of Education has no jurisdiction over the

use  of  State land not earmarked for  educational

development,  and I hope that in the redevelopment

of  the  urban areas more playing-fields  will  be

provided to serve the needs of the schools and the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is

it  proper to have a playing ground utilised as  a

car park?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Inche Rahim, that, I think, was more

a comment than a question. Mr Ho.

<div align="center"><b>ACCIDENTS ON NICOLL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>HIGHWAY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister of Defence,

since  the  conversion of Nicoll  Highway  into  a

three-carriageway  road, how many  accidents  have

occurred  on that road and how many of  them  were

fatal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a  total  of  151  accidents  have  occurred

between 5th August, 1967, and 17th January,  1968,

on  Nicoll  Highway  since its conversion  into  a

three-carriageway  road. Six  of  these  accidents

were fatal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Is the Minister of State of

Defence  satisfied that the rate of  accidents  on

Nicoll  Highway  is no higher  than  that  on  any

other comparable highway in the Republic?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

accident  rate on this highway may he higher  than

that on other highways.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



But the point is that it is the fault of the

motorists who usually go beyond the speed limit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> If the rate of accidents on

this particular highway is higher than that on any

other highway, what proposals has the Minister  of

State of Defence to reduce it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, more than 60

per  cent  of  the accidents which occur  on  this

stretch of highway were due to persons who  either

were  drunk or who were "late birds" visiting  the

city, because at that time the mobile traffic cops

are  not  on duty. So they are the ones,  probably

after  a  bout of drinks, who exceeded  the  speed

limit and got into trouble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> But wou!d the Minister of State

of  Defence not agree that drunken driving  occurs

on  all  roads?  Why  should  it  be  particularly

prevalent on this stretch of the highway?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the point

only arises because of the reply to a question  of

the  Member who wants to know whether the rate  of

accidents  is higher on this stretch of  the  road

than on any other road.

<div align="center"><b>PROTECTION FOR SINGAPORE FISHERMEN FROM PIRATES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister of Defence

whether he is aware that Singapore fishermen  have

often  been robbed, if not kidnapped, by  pirates,

and  whether  he  will consider strengthening  the

Marine Police Force to protect the fishermen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is aware that

Singapore  fishermen have been subject to  robbery

and   kidnap  by  pirates.  Of  the  24   reported

incidents  between  1966  and  1968,  21  occurred

outside Singapore waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore fishermen leave territorial

waters,  they assume risks for which the Singapore

Marine  Police  cannot  be held  responsible.  Our

fishermen are known to extend, their operations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



into  international waters, as  far  away  as  the

Philippines,  and  the  Marine  Police  cannot  be

expected to afford protection to these vessels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of our Marine Police patrols is

sufficient for present purposes. It is intended to

increase  the Marine Police fleet by a further  20

launches this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Minister  of State of Defence aware that  some  of

our  fishermen who have been kidnapped by  pirates

arc  at  present stranded in certain  islands  off

Singapore? And if he is aware, what steps will  he

take to seek their release?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Use commandos!



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

I do not think we are aware of such an occurrence.

if  the  Member  will  bring this  matter  to  the

attention of the police, it will he looked into.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fully aware of such

cases.  My  question is: would  the  Minister,  of

whichever  Ministry concerned,  try  to  seek  the

release of our fishermen? And if I may add, Sir, I

have  copies of correspondence seeking the release

of  our  fishermen, and up to date no sign of  any

release has been made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, if

the Member will refer this incident to the police,

probably they will look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am

satisfied with the reply given by the Minister  of

State,  but I would like to ask him this question.

If  these  fishermen cannot be  protected  by  our

Marine  Police,  then when the withdrawal  of  the

British  Military Forces is effected, how  are  we

going to take the necessary measures to strengthen

our naval power?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are only

responsible  for  the security of our  territorial

waters. So if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



any  incident  takes place beyond our  territorial

waters,  I  think our Marine Police is  unable  to

assist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> It would appear that these

fishermen  are  citizens  of  Singapore.  Are   we

prepared to send, for example, a gunboat along  to

their rescue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, unless we

have  a  bigger  navy, we cannot do anything  more

than we have done at present for our fishermen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister of State of Defence has said just now

that   if  our  fishermen  leave  our  territorial

waters, then they have to be responsible for their

own security. Why cannot our Marine Police prevent

them   from   overstepping  the  bounds   of   our

territorial waters?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> interrupted in Mandarin.

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION COURTS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Number of cases heard and number pending award)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Labour

if  he  will  obtain and furnish  the  House  with

figures of: (a) the number of arbitration cases in

which  hearings before the Industrial  Arbitration

Courts have already been concluded but in which no

awards have been made; and (b) the number of cases

referred  to the Courts under section  30  of  the

Industrial  Relations Ordinance  which  are  still

pending before the Courts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  number of  arbitration  cases

pending award is 12. Of these, two are in relation

to Government employees, namely, nurses and public

health  employees, and the rest have reference  to

employees  in the private sector. It  is  expected

that awards in respect of four of these cases will

be  handed down by the end of this month. One case

is due to be withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cases referred to the Courts under

section  30 of the Industrial Relations Ordinance,

1960,  which  are  still pending  hearing,  totals

eleven  in  number. Three of these concern  Government   employees.   Three  affect   employees   of

statutory  boards and the University of Singapore,

and  the remaining five concern employees  in  the

private commercial sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION COURTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Delay in handing down decision on completion of hearing)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Labour

whether   he   is   aware  that   the   Industrial

Arbitration Courts are often unable to  hand  down

decisions within two weeks after the completion of

the  hearing as provided under section 66  (3)  of

the Industrial Relations Ordinance; and what steps

he proposes to take to remedy this situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has

always  been  known that owing to the complexities

of  many cases, the Industrial Arbitration  Courts

may  be unable to hand down decisions in two weeks

after  completion  of  its  hearing  as  generally

provided  for in section 66 (3) of the  Industrial

Relations Ordinance, 1960. I have to point out  to

the  hon. Member that it was for this reason  that

when  the  Ordinance was first enacted, a  further

provision was added to the same subsection  giving

the court discretion to hand down decisions within

such extended time as in special circumstances the

Court  considers  to be required  for  the  proper

consideration  of the dispute or  matter.  At  the

appropriate time, I will introduce an amendment to

the Industrial Relations Ordinance to do away with

the  two weeks' time limit so as to give the Court

the  discretion to hand down its award at any time

it  considers  appropriate in  the  light  of  the

circumstances of each particular case.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Will the Minister

indicate, when the time comes for him to introduce

an amendment to the Industrial Relations Ordinance, whether it will improve the present system,

or it will make the present system worse?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of course,

we   are   trying   to  improve  the   system   of

arbitration.  There is no question  of  making  it

worse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister  has  misunderstood my question.  At  the

moment,  our  complaint is  that  the  awards  are

unduly  delayed. With the provision of  two  weeks

the Arbitration Court is now apparently unable  to

hand  down  awards  in  the  required  time.   The

Minister  has said that he is going to remove  the

two  weeks'  period. Would this mean  that  he  is

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I think the delay is not

because  of  the  system. It  is  because  of  the

availability of persons as members on  the  panel.

If  we  want to improve the system, we should  get

more persons on the panel.

<div align="center"><b>(Preventive action against sawmill)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development (a) whether he is  aware

of  the feeling of the people around Potong  Pasir

and  Toa  Payoh that flooding in the area  can  be

reduced  if  action is taken against a sawmill  to

prevent  it  dumping sawdust into the canal  along

Serangoon  Road  near the Fire Station;  (b)  what

action  has  been taken so far in this  connection

and  the results; and (c) what further action will

be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is

aware  of,  and  has kept under surveillance,  the

operations  of  the  sawmill referred  to  by  the

Member  for  Aljunied.  It  considers  that  these

operations   have   in  no   way   influenced   or

contributed  towards the flooding  of  the  Potong

Pasir  and  Toa  Payoh  areas.  These  areas   are

susceptible  to floods as they are  low-lying.  In

some  parts south of the sawmill there are  swamps

which  are  subject  to  tidal  influences.  These

factors and the recent heavy continuous rains have

contributed to the floods in Potong Pasir and  Toa

Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has expended over the last four years

$325,000 for drainage and flood alleviation  works

in  the  Kallang River area. The swamps are  being

filled up, and in the development scheme affecting

the  basin,  work is continuing on  the  dredging,

widening and diversion of the Kallang River  south

of  Serangoon Road. Provision for another $300,000

will  be made to continue these improvements.  The

sawmill  site  is  affected by  these  improvement

works.  In  consequence, the land on which  it  is

located  was compulsorily acquired and  possession

taken  in  September 1967. The sawmill  has  since

been  under  notice to vacate the site.  When  the

dredging,  widening and diversion of  the  Kallang

River is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



completed,  the  incidence  of  flooding  will  he

considerably reduced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I take it that the hon.  Member  is

referring to that portion of Jalan Pasar Sembawang

near  the  market  opposite  Chong  Pang  Road.  A

proposal  to make up this portion of the  road  to

kampong  road standard at a cost of $4,000  to  be

paid  by the Government was not supported  by  the

Urban and Rural Services Committee when it met  on

19th July, 1967. Instead, the U.R.S.C, recommended

that  the  Director of the Public Works Department

should consider making up this portion of the road

under   section   19   of  the  Local   Government

Integration Ordinance and charge the cost  to  the

frontagers. The Projects Committee at its  meeting

of  7th  August, 1967, accepted and  approved  the

recommendation of the U.R.S.C, and  duly  notified

the  Director  of the Public Works  Department  of

this  decision. Investigation by the P.W.D, showed

that there are shophouses along both sides of this

portion of the road which has a width varying from

25  feet  to 33 feet. This width is less than  the

minimum of 36 feet required for any street when it

is  made up under section 19. As the road can only

be  widened if some of the existing structures are

demolished, notices under section 19 have not been

issued. However, it is intended to repair the road

under   section   22   of  the  Local   Government

Integration Ordinance. But the P.W.D, has  a  long

waiting list of private streets to be so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>

Committee  that  this road could not  be  repaired

certain  land-owners have persistently refused  to

allow their private roads, which have been used by

be  repaired  by the Government in spite  of  many

appeals  by the residents, and what steps he  will

take to compel the land-owners under existing laws

to  repair  such roads, or whether the  Government

will  repair them and charge the cost to the  land

owners concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There are very few instances where

land-owners have objected to existing tracks being

repaired by the Government. Whether a private road

has been used for more than 20 years or not is not

so easy to establish, as the residents try to make

out. However, even if it is established that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>

road  has been used by the residents for more than

20 years, it does not confer title to the land but

gives only a right of way, a right to pass to  and

fro  over the road, which still cannot be repaired

by  Government  unless the consent  of  the  land-owners   concerned  is  obtained, if  the  owners

persistently refuse to give such permission and if

the Government is satisfied that the making up  of

these  private  roads  is  justifiable,  then  the

proposals could be considered under the provisions

of the Local Government Integration Ordinance. The

Director  of  Public  Works  is  empowered   under

certain  sections  of this Ordinance  to  make  up

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Prime Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  official  discussions  with   the

British  Government  took place  on  the  14th  of

January  from  5.30  p.m. to  10.45  p.m.  On  the

Singapore side, I was accompanied by my colleague,

the Minister for Finance, the Permanent Secretary.

Ministry of Defence, and our High Commissioner  in

London.  On  the  British  side  were  the   Prime

Minister of the United Kingdom, the Chancellor  of

the  Exchequer. Mr Roy Jenkins, the Secretary  of

State for Defence, Mr Denis Healey, the Secretary

of  State  for Foreign Affairs, Mr George  Brown,

the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,

Mr George Thomson, and several Under Secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already disclosed all that can reasonably

be disclosed about our defence discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relevant section in the British Prime

Minister's statement in the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



of   Commons on Tuesday, 16th of January, reads as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We [I quote here, meaning the British

Government] have accordingly decided to accelerate

the  withdrawal of our forces from their  stations

in  the  Far  East  which  was  announced  in  the

Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy of  July

1967 (Cmnd. 3357) and to withdraw them by the  end

of  1971.  We  have also decided to  withdraw  our

Forces from the Persian Gulf by the same date. The

broad  effect  is that, apart from  our  remaining

Dependencies    and   certain   other    necessary

exceptions,   we  shall  by  that  date   not   be

maintaning military bases outside Europe  and  the

Mediterranean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, by that date, we shall have withdrawn our

forces  from Malaysia and Singapore. We have  told

both Governments that we do not thereafter plan to

retain  a special military capability for  use  in

the  area. But we have assured them both, and  our

other  Commonwealth partners and allies concerned,

that we shall retain a general capability based in

Europe - including the United Kingdom

-     which  can be deployed overseas as,  in  our

judgment, circumstances demand, including  support

for  United Nations operations. During his  recent

visit  to  Kuala Lumpur, my right hon. Friend  the

Commonwealth  Secretary  told  the  Government  of

Malaysia that we wish to reach a new understanding

with   them  about  the  Anglo-Malaysian   Defence

Agreement  so  as  to  make  it  fit  the  changed

conditions.  As  the  House knows,  the  Agreement

contains  provisions for a review of this  nature.

He also assured the other Commonwealth Governments

concerned of Britain's continued interest  in  the

maintenance of security in South-East  Asia,  with

the   forces   which  will  be   available   here.

Meanwhile, if our Commonwealth partners so  desire

and  mutually  satisfactory  arrangements  can  be

made,  we  would  be prepared to  assist  them  in

establishing a future joint air defence system for

Malaysia  and Singapore and in training  personnel

to operate it. We have informed the Governments of

Malaysia  and Singapore that we will discuss  with

them  the aid implications of our accelerated with

drawal.  We shall amend our force declarations  to

S.E.A.T.O, as  our forces in  the  area  are  run

down.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the 18th of January, as I was leaving

London,  the  Secretary of State  for  Commonwelth

Relations sent me a note stating that the  British

Government intended to do all that they  could  to

assist Singapore and Malaysia, both separately and

collectively,  and  in  consultation  with   other

Commonwealth  partners in the  area,  to  maintain

their own national security.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of decisions made consequential on

the  devaluation of the Pound, we  shall  have  to

undertake  sooner than we expected full responsibi

lity  for  our  own defence. Before  the  31st  of

December 1971, there will probably be a number  of

conferences of governments with an interest in the

security  of  the  Singapore/Malaysia  area.   The

Singapore  Government  is willing  to  attend  any

conference  which will enhance peace and  security

in  the  Singapore/Malaysia area. And long  before

the 31st of December, 1971, we will have developed

a  sufficient  defence capability  to  make  us  a

dependable and a desirable partner in any  defence

arrangement.



<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would other

people   find  it  credible  that  we  can  defend

ourselves by the end of

1971?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some people

did  not  find  it credible as late as  March  and

April  1966 that we could develop sufficient  land

forces in order to look after ourselves by the end

of 1967. But I can assure the hon. Member that the

Deputy  Prime Minister of Malaysia found it  fully

credible that Singapore had sufficient land forces

to  look after itself. In a letter to our Minister

of  Defence  dated the 14th of November explaining

why the Malaysians were withdrawing not only their

battalion at Khatib but all their other units, the

Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I also understand that since the separation of

Singapore,   the  Government  of   Singapore   has

increased its Armed Forces for purpose of  defence

of  Singapore. The Malaysian Government  therefore

feels  that it is no longer necessary to  maintain

its  army  units in Singapore and I  am  therefore

informing   you  that  they  will   be   withdrawn

completely from Singapore by 31st December, 1967.'



<br><br>He  obviously found it credible that we  can  look

after ourselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

British Government respect the recent agreement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> All I can say to that, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is that we must accept  the  solemn

undertaking  of  any  British Government  at  face

value.  But  as has happened in the  case  of  the

solemn   undertaking  given  us  in   July   1967,

intervening   acts  almost  of   God,   like   the

devaluation  of the Pound Sterling,  made  certain

consequential amendments necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  can  the Prime Minister tell the  House  how

real are the possibilities of establishing a five-nation defence system for this part of the world?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, no one would expect me to

anticipate  what the final outcome of the  meeting

of  the five governments can be. In the very short

space  of time between July 1967 and January 1968,

circumstances  have altered so  completely  as  to

make  it necessary for us to rethink our basic  po

sition.  It  is  such  a  fundamental  change   of

circumstances  that  it is  rash  for  anybody  to

predict  what the position will be after a  series

of  meetings which will take place before the 31st

of December, 1971.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Prime  Minister  has mentioned a few  moments  ago

that  under  certain circumstances  and  with  the

consent  of other Commonwealth allies, the British

Government  is  prepared to assist  Singapore  and

Malaysia  in  the establishment  of  a  joint  air

defence  system. In this respect,  can  the  Prime

Minister  clarify  the  position  regarding   this

question?  What arrangements will be made  to  see

that  this kind of system will be satisfactory  to

both  sides? Will there be any principles  evolved

at the meetings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerns the joint air defence

system   -   will   it  give   rise   to   certain

interpretations? Will there be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>



some  kind  of merger militarily between Singapore

and Malaysia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it

would be best if I were to reread that portion  of

the  British Prime Minister's Statement  regarding

his  intentions to assist in a joint  air  defence

system. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Meanwhile, if our Commonwealth partners so

desire and mutually satisfactory arrangements  can

be  made, we would be prepared to assist  them  in

establishing a future joint air defence system for

Malaysia  and Singapore and in training  personnel

to operate it.'



<br><br>I  do  not think I have any authority to go beyond

the   public   statement  of  the  British   Prime

Minister.  All I can add to that is that  we  have

every  intention on our part to increase  our  own

capability,  because, unlike many other  countries

in  the  area,  we  form a very compact  and  neat

target, and therefore a sneak aerial attack  is  a

major  preoccupation  of any Defence  Minister  of

Singapore. It is therefore our intention to ensure

that such a sneak attack can never succeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

the  Prime  Minister has told the House  just  now

about  his  talks with the British  Government  in

London  and about having obtained certain promises

in  the  air defence involving Malaysia.  I  would

like  to ask the Prime Minister this question.  On

this  point, what is the attitude of the Malaysian

Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First of all, the assistance

will  comprise such equipment as already has  been

installed here. I have mentioned the radar system,

the  installations at Bukit Gombak, the ground-to-air  missiles  and the training  of  personnel  to

operate all these defence weapons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the attitude of the Malaysian Government

to the statement of the British Prime Minister,  I

think  it is only right and proper that we  should

await  their  own official response at  their  own

time. It is not for us to respond on their behalf.

But  we  would  definitely welcome  assistance  in

expertise  which is impossible to  produce  within

the  four  years minus 24 days that  we  have  got

left.

immovable  properties corporate and  unincorporate

in  Singapore. This duty, which applies to  trusts

and similar types of bodies where property is held

permanently in such manner that no tax is  payable

since no property ever passes on on the death of a

person,  was  originally complementary  to  estate

duty  which provided for a levy in respect of  the

estate of deceased persons only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law stands, it covers movable or immovable

property   in  Singapore  and  outside  Singapore,

whereas  in the case of estate duty the  scope  of

the   charge   specifically   excludes   immovable

property outside Singapore. The revenue collection

from this duty in 1966 was $55,954.68, and in 1967

(up   to  November  1967)  was  $55,706.45.   This

collection   is   not  substantial   taking   into

consideration  the  cost  involved.  It   is   now

proposed  to repeal the Corporation Duty Ordinance

because  the  exemptions provided in the  law  are

such that a very small class of property is liable

to  charge.  Property of religious and  charitable

organisations   and  property   constituting   the

capital  of a body corporate or unincorporate  for

trade or business are exempt. Thus only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



a  very  small number of properties which  do  not

pass   on   on   death  are  subject  to   charge.

Consequently,   it  is  not  productive   of   any

substantial  amount of revenue, as is  clear  from

the figures given earlier. Similar legislation  in

Malaysia was repealed in 1947.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.   Members   are  already  aware   that   the

withdrawal  of British forces from Singapore  will

render  a large number of workers unemployed.  The

House  has  just heard a statement  by  the  Prime

Minister  that the British have again notified  us

that  they will further cut short their  stay  and

that they will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



be  completely out by the end of 1971. This means,

from   the  employment  angle,  that  some  30,000

civilian  employees in the British bases  together

with  some  10,000  women and  girls  employed  by

Services families as domestic help will lose their

jobs by 1971. The great majority of these Services

employees are our citizens and the loss  of  their

jobs  will most certainly bring to them  a  fairly

long  period of uncertainty and confusion; and  in

the  interest of the workers, it is necessary  for

them  to  be prudent and conserve their  money  to

tide  them for as long as possible over the period

of unemployment pending re-training for new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On becoming redundant, most of the employees

will  get  a  sizable sum of money  as  redundancy

payments.   Many  of  them  are  unaccustomed   to

handling  substantial sums of  money  at  any  one

time.  The Government is primarily concerned  with

the  citizen employees, and the basic aim of  this

legislation  is  to  ensure that  the  money  they

receive  is  not  used unwisely and injudiciously,

which  will make them destitutes in a short period

and  bring them and their families great distress.

During  the  period of trial and tribulation,  the

Government  is responsible for ensuring  that  its

citizens  are adequately fed, clothed and  housed,

and  this  is  precisely what the  Bill  seeks  to

ensure for the workers. I must emphasise here that

it  is not the intention of the Government to take

away the redundancy payments from the workers  and

use  the money as revenue. I must assure the House

that  the Government will not and cannot make  use

of  the money, for the redundancy payments will be

paid into the Redundancy Payments Fund established

by  law. This Fund will be fully utilised for  the

full benefit of employees who become redundant  to

adapt  and  adjust themseves to a  new  situation.

Indeed,  the  administration  of  the  Fund   will

involve   the   Government  in   extra   financial

expenditure. An interest rate of 5¼ per  cent  per

annum  is  guaranteed even if the returns  derived

from  the Fund are insufficient to defray  the  in

terest due to members of the Fund.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>



In  such a case, the deficiency is charged on  and

paid out of the Consolidated Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important feature of the Bill is that money

paid  into and out of the Fund will be exempt from

income  tax. There are also provisions to  protect

the rights of the workers so that their money will

not be taken away by creditors or moneylenders.  I

would  like  to  illustrate here,  by  way  of  an

example,  how the income tax exemption will  bring

about  savings  to  an employee.  If  an  employee

earning  a salary of $500 per month, with  a  wife

and  three  children, gets a lump sum payment  of,

say, $20,000, he will have to pay about $3,200  in

income tax, but with the exemption from income tax

as  provided in this Bill, this sum will be  saved

by such an employee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "employer" in the Act covers

practically all employers in Singapore. But it  is

not  the  intention of Government  at  present  to

apply this Act to the private and public sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Bill provides for the establishment

of  a  Fund  to be called the Redundancy  Payments

Fund. Employers are required to put all redundancy

payments of their workers into this Fund.  Out  of

this  Fund the redundant worker may draw up to  60

per  cent  of  his  former wages  every  month.  A

citizen can keep on drawing until all his money in

the  Fund  is exhausted. A non-Singapore  citizen,

however, can only draw up to two-thirds of his  re

dundancy  payment, leaving a balance of  one-third

in  the  Fund. The purpose of retaining this  one-third  of  his  money is that if he is  unable  to

obtain  further employment in Singapore, he  will

have  sufficient money in the Fund for his passage

back to his home country. On the other hand, if he

decides to leave Singapore permanently and has  no

intention  of returning, he can straightaway  draw

out  all the money standing to his credit  in  the

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore citizens there are provisions to

withdraw lump sums from the Fund. If a citizen can

prove that he is making use of the money for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>



some  useful projects, such as buying a  house  or

entering into a business venture, he can have  his

money withdrawn for that purpose. I would like  to

assure  the  House that we will try to  administer

this  Fund  as flexibly as possible so as  not  to

cause hardship to our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above, hon. Members will see that

eventually  every single cent will be returned  to

the workers plus any interest that may accrue.  In

addition, the workers enjoy exemption from  income

tax  and their money is kept out of reach of their

creditors and moneylenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the Bill last month,

the   National  Trades  Union  Congress  and   the

Services' Unions have made lengthy studies of  it.

As a result of these studies, they have put up certain  recommendations  to  the  Government.  These

recommendations  have  been considered  carefully,

and  I  am  happy  to say that most  of  them  are

acceptable  to the Government. I shall  be  moving

amendments   at   Committee   stage    to    cover

circumstances  of  proven  hardship  as  well   as

withdrawals from the Fund by Singapore citizens on

their reaching the age of 55 as recommended by the N.T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other minor recommendations, such as setting

up  a  Board to consider withdrawals and arranging

for payments to be made at the nearest post office

and so on, can be met by administrative action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first time that

Singapore   is   facing   a   problem   of    such

unprecedented  magnitude, and  it  is  imperative,

therefore,  that  in a crucial situation  of  this

sort, urgent steps should be taken to protect  the

livelihood of so many of our citizens who will  be

affected.   We  have  surmounted  many   obstacles

before,  and  I  can  assure the  House  that  the

Government,   with   the   co-operation   of   all

concerned,   will   be  able   to   overcome   the

difficulties  that lie ahead by  making  plans  to

retain  our  workers  for alternative  gainful  em

ployment as speedily as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   in  principle,  the   Redundancy

Payments Fund Bill is a sound piece of legislation

as it provides some measure of protection not only

to  the  victims of redundancy but also  to  their

families   and  dependants.  The  Bill  can   also

restrain  the  recipients of  redundancy  payments

from    spending   their   money   lavishly    and

injudiciously and in the end finding it  necessary

to resort to public assistance from the Social Wel

fare  Department. It is usual, Mr Speaker, for  a

person  to  be  thrifty when his money  is  almost

spent and to be extravagant when he has much. This

very  often happens and there are many such  cases

to serve as examples. So it is appropriate for the

Government  to take steps to prevent  such  people

from  falling  victim  to  such  weaknesses  after

having  already  fallen victim to retrenchment  on

account of redundancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However. Mr Speaker, there are certain clauses

in  the  Bill  which are vague and  which  contain

unhappy features. For instance, in clause  6  (1) ,

the  redundant employee is required  to  authorise

his  empolyer, within seven days of  the  relevant

date, to pay the redundancy payment into the Fund.

But  clause 6 (5) states that if the employee does

not,  within  three months of the  relevant  date,

give  his  authorisation, the  redundancy  payment

will  automatically be paid into the  Fund.  Thus,

clause 6 appears to have the effect of forcing the

redundant employee to have his money paid into the

Fund, whether he likes it or not. He has no choice

whatsoever.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>3.37 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage I would like to make a suggestion

on  this  clause  for  the  consideration  of  the

Government. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



employee  should be given one of two choices:  (1)

either his money be paid into the Fund and thereby

be  entitled  to  the 5¼ per cent  interest  under

clause 4 (3) as well as exemption from income  tax

under clause 11 (2) of the Bill; or (2) that he be

permitted  to collect his money from the  employer

on  which he will have to pay income tax due under

the  Income  Tax  Ordinance,  in  the  case  of  a

Singapore  citizen  who  decides  on  the   second

choice,  he  should be debarred from  getting  any

form of assistance from the Government, whether in

the form of free textbooks and exemption of school

fees for his children, public assistance from  the

Social  Welfare  Department,  etc.  He  will   not

receive  such  public assistance  for  a  specific

period,  the length of which should be similar  to

that  during  which his credits in the  Fund  will

last,  as if his redundancy payment had been  paid

into  the  Fund.  For  a  non-citizen,  Sir,   the

question of assistance in any case does not  arise

by reason of his non-citizen ship status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 sets out the monthly payment to the

employee, which will not exceed 60 per cent of his

usual  wages, in the case of a Singapore  citizen,

payments  will continue until his credits  in  the

Fund  are  exhausted. But in the case  of  a  non-citizen, payments will be made up to two-thirds of

his  redundancy  payment; the remaining  one-third

being  payable  to  him upon  the  Director  being

satisfied that he is about to leave Singapore  and

will not return any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an employee who earns, say, $350 a month,

the  proportion  of his monthly  payment  will  be

$210,  and with this sum he can manage to maintain

his  family.  But  what about the  employee  whose

normal wages are, say, $200 or less per month?  He

will only get $120 or less a month. Is that amount

sufficient  for  him to support his  family?  What

about those non-citizens whose children were  born

in  Singapore? Is it proper that, by reason of the

father being a non-citizen, the children who  were

born in Singapore should suffer distress?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 says that only a Singapore citizen

may,  if  the Director is satisfied, withdraw  his

money   from   the  Fund  to  purchase   immovable

property,  or to enter into any trade or business,

whilst  a non-citizen may not do so. The  fact  is

that  there  is no existing law that  debars  non-citizens   from  buying  immovable   property   or

carrying on trade or business in the Republic.  If

we  ponder  carefully, Sir, among the businessmen.

investors,  and entrepreneurs in the  Republic,  a

good  many  of them are non-citizens. Furthermore,

the   Government  is  encouraging  investors  from

overseas  and  providing incentives  for  them  in

respect of citizenship and tax reliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other pertinent matter which disturbs me is

that  the  employee, that is to say, the Singapore

citizen, is allowed to purchase immovable property

or  to  enter into any trade or business.  I  fear

that  he  may suffer in the end. It is conceivable

that with the money he withdraws he can afford  to

buy  property, but can he afford the cost  of  its

maintenance,  such  as property tax,  assessments,

renovations, and repairs? Similarly, he can afford

to  use the money as capital if he embarks on  any

trade  or business. But has he the necessary know-how   and  experience  in  matters  of  trade  and

business,  bearing in mind that he has  all  along

been   a  white-collar  worker  or  an  industrial

worker? Thus his new venture might well end up  as

a misadventure instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I suggest to the Government that

if  it  wishes to safeguard the victims of British

military  withdrawal  in  line  with  its   avowed

principles of democratic socialism, then it should

set up a public corporation or industry managed by

and  under  the  supervision of experts  from  the

Economic  Development Board, and offer its  shares

to  these  redundant employees as well as  to  the

general  public.  This  will  not  only  help   to

safeguard  and protect their interests,  but  also

enhance  the  prosperity of  Singapore  after  the

British withdrawal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I

rise in support of the Redundancy Payments Fund

Bill. I quite appreciate that the economic and

other difficulties confronting Singapore,

consequent upon the wholesale accelerated

withdrawal of the British Military Forces from the

Republic, render it necessary to have a Bill such

as the one before the House. To minimise such

difficulties, the Singapore Government has

initiated a rather unique Bill which some

irresponsible elements have labelled as a gross

infringement of an individual's right to receive

and use any sum of money payable in respect of his

termination of service. This, of course, is a

deliberate distortion of the purpose of the

operation of the proposed Redundancy Payments Fund

Bill which seeks to reconcile and protect the in

terests of the individual in relation to the wider

interests of the Republic. It is quite true that

the individual who comes within the scope of the

proposed Bill finds that the right to receive and

use any retrenchment benefits payable to him as he

wishes has been curtailed to a certain extent.

But, on the other hand, balanced against the

curtailment is the exemption of such retrenchment

benefits from taxation under the Income Tax

Ordinance and protection from the harassment by

moneylenders. These are two significant benefits

which are given in consideration of the compulsory

payment of the retrenchment benefits into the

proposed Redundancy Fund and should not be

overlooked in any discussion of the merits of the

proposed Act. I also quite appreciate that the

principal intention behind the proposed Act, as I

see it, is to help prevent persons who are

unemployed as a result of the situation of

redundancy arising in their place of employment,

from becoming a burden on the State. It is not

difficult to imagine that the persons on receiving

a sum of money, a sum which is much more

substantial than they have ever laid their hands

on, may squander away such small fortunes

wastefully



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>



and  rapidly, regardless of the fact that they are

unemployed.  A  situation  may  result  when  such

persons and their families, after exhausting their

retrenchment benefits and have no other  means  of

support,  may join the ranks of destitute  persons

at  present  drawing  meagre allowances  from  the

Social  Welfare Department. It is probably one  of

the  reasons responsible for the decision  of  the

Government  not to include in the proposed  Act  a

provision  whereby an employee is given an  option

either to have his retrenchment benefits paid into

the   proposed   Fund  comprising  exemption   and

protection, or to receive and use such benefits in

any way as he wishes subject to the provisions  of

the   Income  Tax  Ordinance  and  harassment   by

moneylenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have two comments to make on the proposed

Act. First is the inclusion of the provision where

any payment made into and out of the proposed Fund

is  exempted from the provisions of the Income Tax

Ordinance.  The  Government  in  making   such   a

provision  in the proposed Act must have  realised

that  it  means a loss to the Republic of  not  an

insignificant amount of revenue. Such exemption is

extended  as  a means of alleviating the  distress

and   suffering  of  employees  who  are  rendered

unemployed  as a result of the withdrawal  of  the

British  Military Services. But I do not think  it

is  the  intention  of  the  Government  that  the

operation of the proposed Act should extend to the

expatriate staff of commercial firms. Otherwise we

would  have a ridiculous situation where  an  expa

triate employee, on expiry of his term of service,

returns  to  his country with a not  unsubstantial

amount  of  gratuity and other  payments  untaxed.

This  is  obvious from the enabling  provision  of

clause  16 of the proposed Act where the  Minister

is given power to exempt an employer or a class of

employers from the operation of the proposed Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, however, foresee some difficulty arising

from  the operation of the exemption under  clause

16 where the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>



commercial sector is concerned.  Exemption of an employer having an expatriate staff  by

the  Minister  from the operation of the  proposed

Act  means  also the exemption of the local  staff

from  the  operation of the proposed Act  together

with the expatriate officer. But as the purpose of

the  proposed  Act  is to help Singapore  citizens

tide   over   the   period   of   their   probable

unemployment,  the  purpose of  the  proposed  Act

seems to be defeated. To me it appears that either

the scope of the Act or the provision of clause 16

is unnecessarily and unduly wide. Either the scope

of  the  Act should be restricted to those persons

directly  affected by the British withdrawal  from

Singapore, or the exemption under clause 16 should

relate  not to employers but rather to an employee

or  a  class of employees. The wide scope  of  the

proposed Act seems unavoidable, but otherwise  the

proposed   Act  becomes  a  piece  of  legislation

specifically   enacted  against  a  selected   and

restricted  group of persons. On the  other  hand,

exemption  of  employers rather than of  employees

appears  unavoidable  because  the  proposed   Act

places  the  onus  on  making  payments  into  the

proposed  Fund  upon  the employers  and  not  the

employees.  I think the problem I have  raised  is

important  and  should  be  resolved  before   the

proposed Act becomes operative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second comment is the protection afforded to

any payments into or out of the proposed Fund from

any  legal proceedings or process in respect of  a

debt  or any other claim as provided in clause  11

of  the  proposed Act. The scope  of  this  clause

appears  to be very wide and I do not know whether

the  Government  has considered all  the  possible

consequences arising from such protection.  It  is

undoubtedly beneficial that the recipients of  any

payment  of the proposed Fund should be  protected

from  any  harassment from moneylenders,  but  the

possible  effect of such provision in relation  to

some  statutory  boards, such as the  Housing  and

Development  Board, the Public  Utilities  Board,

must also be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person who comes within the scope of the

proposed  Act runs up arrears on his rental  of  a

Housing  Board flat and is prepared  to  face  the

consequence of eviction, particularly in the  case

of non-citizens who have already made arrangements

to  leave the country, there seems no way for  the

Board  to  recover the arrears of rent.  Where  it

relates  to  one or two persons the amount  to  be

borne by the Housing and Development Board may  be

negligible,  but where if a thousand  odd  persons

are  to  take  advantage  of  such  provision  the

Housing  and  Development Board,  not  to  mention

other landlords, may have ---

not to mention other landlords, may have to be prepared  to write off a significant sum of money  as

unrecoverable  debts because of the provisions  of

clause  16. It seems to me that this Bill requires

a  lot  of further amendments before it can become

an Act.



<br><br>3.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

Bill in principle, particularly the provisions  of

clauses  8,  9,  11 and 12. But I  wonder  if  the

Minister can clarify the following points. In  the

case of a Government pensionable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



officer who is retired before the age of 55 due to

redundancy, he would normally be given a  gratuity

and  a pension. Would such gratuity be subject  to

the control of this Redundancy Payments Fund Bill?

Clause  10 provides that a member of the Fund  who

is  a  citizen of Singapore may withdraw the whole

or  part  of  the  redundancy payment  in  certain

circumstances.  The decision to allow  or  not  to

allow  this  withdrawal rests  entirely  with  the

Director whose decision shall be final. This seems

to  be rather unfair to the redundant employee  as

it  is  a  one-man  decision.  Will  the  Minister

consider  setting up a board specially to consider

such appeals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 seems to provide excellent protection

to  the  redundant  employee in  the  use  of  his

redundancy  payment. But I wish  the  Minister  to

consider the case of a man who has worked  for  20

or  30 years and now, on his redundancy at a  very

late  stage of his working life, is to be deprived

of even the small pleasures of life by being given

unconditionally a small portion of his  redundancy

payment.  No doubt I appreciate the fact that  his

redundancy  payment will eventually be given  back

to  him in full by way of small instalments.  Will

the   Minister   consider  giving   the   employee

immediately on his redundancy 20 per cent  of  his

redundancy fund unconditionally?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



associated themselves with the aspirations of  the

labour movement or interested themselves in labour

problems. Strangely enough, they appear to be very

much alive to the apparent opportunities presented

by  the  proposed Act for their mischievous talent

for  creating and fomenting industrial unrest. The

reactionary attitude manifested by such characters

is understandable, for they are interested only in

themselves and have no concern for local problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of this proposed Act are not aware that

the   majority   of  these  40,000  odd   civilian

employees  do  not  belong 10  the  higher  income

group. I am given to understand, Sir, that 75  per

cent  of these workers earn about $200 to  $250  a

month only, and with the prospect of an indefinite

period  of  unemployment due  to  the  accelerated

British    military   withdrawal,   a    socialist

government like the P.A.P. cannot afford to remain

inactive  and  leave  the  workers  to  fend   for

themselves without formulating a constructive  and

comprehensive   plan   for  the   protection   and

safeguard  of  the workers' retrenchment  benefits

during the transitional period. Irresponsible  and

disloyal  elements allege that the Government  has

plans  to  control or takeworkers' money to  raise

fact, the reverse is the truth, wanting to control

or  take  workers'  money,  the  Govmaking  a  big

concession  in  workers' money,  exempting  paying

income  tax when the Redundancy Payments Fund  Act

comes into operation. Sub-clause (2) of clause  11

provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Every redundancy payment paid into the Fund

under section 6 of this Act and every payment  out

of  the Fund under section 8, 9 or 10 of this  Act

shall  be exempt from income tax under the  Income

Tax Ordinance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with a number of provisos designed for the

protection  of the workers' benefit in this  Bill,

the  Government  has made further  concessions  in

this  Bill as a result of representations made  by

the  N.T.U.C.  I  am also glad to  know  that  the

Government  has  accepted the N.TUC.'s  additional

conditions for withdrawals by members of the  Fund

who are citizens as and when they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>

are  in  need  of money to meet any  contingencies

affecting  the  members themselves,  their  wives,

children and parents. Further, any member who is a

citizen  of Singapore on reaching the  age  of  55

years will be allowed to withdraw the total amount

standing to his credit in the Fund if the Director

is  satisfied  as to the true age of  the  member.

Sir,  nothing  can  be  more flexible  than  this.

Unlike  the  previous Government, the  P.A.P. has

always  stood  by and is guided by  its  socialist

principles.  It is loath to introduce  legislation

to  hoodwink  the public for its own interest.  If

legislation has to be introduced which will affect

the  interest  of the minority for  the  good  and

benefit of the majority and the State, so  be  it,

for  we  cannot  afford to do otherwise.  In  this

context, Sir, I remember that in the 1959  general

elections when the Singapore People's Alliance was

in  power,  this  clique  deliberately  introduced

legislation  to slash the rentals of  tenants  who

live  in Singapore Improvement Trust flats with  a

view to gaining popularity and winning the general

elections. But the people knew that they were  not

sincere  and honest. Therefore, no amount of  bene

ficial legislation which is of a temporary measure

will  help.  Therefore, one can safely infer  that

this  Government,  which is elected  to  power  by

universal   suffrage,   would   not   deliberately

legislate laws aimed at bringing hardship  to  the

civilian   employees  of  the   British   Military

Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments and the proposed

Redundancy Payments Fund Act, because I am of  the

opinion  that  the wider interest of the  Republic

necessitates such an Act and that the proposed Act

confers  some  undoubted benefits on  the  persons

affected  in return for some flexible restrictions

on their rights.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I fully support the Bill before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the aim of this Bill to protect the

civilian  employees  in the Armed  Forces  of  the

British Government so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



that  the redundancy payments to be given to  them

will be protected by law. The purpose of this Bill

is  to  look after the livelihood of the employees

themselves   as   well  as  their   families   and

dependants  and to tide them over the difficulties

with which they will be faced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The timely introduction of this Bill fully shows

that   the   Government  has  foresight,  advanced

planning and a strong sense of responsibility.  As

a  good Government, we are not only responsible to

the   employees  themselves  but  also  to   their

dependants. Therefore, the Government must  assist

and  look  after these civilian employees  of  the

Armed   Forces  and  see  that  their   redundancy

payments  are  gainfully utilised in  business  or

will  tide  them over their difficulties  for  the

time being. This is indeed a very wise measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the N.T.U.C., which represents

the   democratic  labour  movement,  has   already

indicated its full support for this Bill.  Indeed,

the  unions of the civilian employees in the  Army

and  Navy have also come out in its support.  They

are   of  the  view  that  the  Bill  is  a  clear

indication of the Government's intention to assist

and  look  after  the long-term  interest  of  the

workers as well as their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are certain provisions

in  this Bill which are particularly of benefit to

the  civilian  employees.  First,  the  redundancy

payments paid into the Fund will earn interest  at

the  rate  of 5¼ per cent per annum. Second,  such

payments are exempted from income tax so that they

are  intact at all times. Third, they are  out  of

the   reach   of   creditors   and   moneylenders.

Furthermore, the administration of this Bill  when

it  becomes  law will result in expenditure  borne

solely by the Government without a single cent  of

the money paid into the Fund being touched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, certain politicians in

Singapore  have  come out with adverse  criticisms

against  this  Bill  to  the  effect  that  it  is

intended  to exploit the workers. This  is  indeed

mala fide propaganda because it is unfounded.  The

people who make this vicious accusation are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



unable  to  assist the workers. Their idea  is  to

create confusion and unrest and they hope to  fish

in troubled waters. These vicious politicians must

be  made to understand that their attempt will not

succeed   because  the  workers   are   now   more

politically  conscious and fully understand  their

own   circumstances  and  the  situation  in   our

country.  The  workers are fully  aware  that  the

Government is planning ahead for them and also for

the interest of the nation. So they understand the

importance of cooperation with the Government.  It

is  only  when they co-operate with the Government

that  we  will be able to tide over this difficult

period.  As  a  matter  of fact,  the  accelerated

British    withdrawal   will   not   only    cause

difficulties  in employment but also  in  defence.

But  this is a challenge to the will and  guts  of

the  people.  I believe that if the  people  stand

united together, we will not be afraid to face any

difficulties   and  that  finally   we   will   be

triumphant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Bill.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although I

would like to support the purport of this Bill as

being an exceptional measure under exceptional circumstances, there are one or two unhappy features

about some clauses of this Bill which I would like

to bring to the notice of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to refer to clause 7 which

deals with the protection against action given  to

the Director and persons authorised by him. In sub-clause  (3)  the  only circumstances  under  which

protection  is not granted to the Director  is  in

the event of fraud where a person suffering damage

or  loss can recover whatever loss he has suffered

from   the  Director  by  way  of  possible  legal

proceedings. Sir, I do not see why the same  thing

cannot  be done with respect to negligent payments

made by the Director or persons authorised by  him

because  if payments are so made and the  Director

is protected by sub-clause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>



(2)  as  he is, I do not see why a member  of  the

Fund  should  really have to face the  expense  of

taking   action  in  court  for  the  purpose   of

recovering the money from the person to whom it is

wrongfully paid. I think this is an unfair  burden

to place on members of the Fund. The person who is

negligent in making wrong payments should meet the

expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to refer to

is  the  question of withdrawing the  funds  under

clauses  9  and  10.  Clause  9  refers   to   the

circumstances   under   which   non-citizens   can

withdraw their funds, and clause 10 refers to  the

circumstances  under which citizens  can  withdraw

their funds. I really do not see the reason behind

the  two  sets of circumstances - one for citizens

and  one  for  non-citizens - before  funds  can  be

withdrawn.  There  are  quite  a  number  of  non-citizens in Singapore who are non-citizens because

of technical reasons ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Come off it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> It is possible that this class

of  citizens would also be faced with hardship and

they  might want to withdraw the money  that  they

have in the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> They may take all the money and

go.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> That could be investigated. I

shall  be  grateful if the Minister  will  amplify

these points.



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of

all, I must thank Members of this House for

expressing their support of this Bill. I would

like to reply briefly to the points raised by

them.



The Member for Kampong Kernbangan and the Member

for Bukit Panjang have raised the point about the

different treatment accorded to citizens and non-citizens. But I must inform the House that this

Bill is specially designed to protect the interest

of the citizens and that we do not assume any

responsibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



for the non-citizens. I think it is very necessary

to  have  the two types of withdrawal, because  in

the  case  of the non-citizen he can withdraw  all

his money from the Fund if and when he decides  to

leave  the  country forever. In fact, we  are  not

interested in his money at all. He can  take  away

all  his  money if he wants to. It will be  better

for  us  if he does so. I regret that we  have  to

take  this measure, but there is no other  way  in

which we can deal with the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kernbangan has also

brought  up the argument that 60 per cent  of  the

redundant  employee's wages may not be enough  for

him to live on. He may want more

-  70  per cent, 90 per cent or even 100 per cent.

It  may  be  argued that 60 per cent  may  not  be

enough.  But I think the worker who has  lost  his

job  should  try his very best to live within  his

means.  It is better that he should draw out  less

so  that his money in the Fund can last longer. If

he  draws out more, his money will last him for  a

very  short time and after that the Social Welfare

Department  will have to take over. That  will  be

very unwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also touched upon the possibility

of  investing this Fund in commercial concerns and

industries  in the country, so that  it  can  draw

higher  returns  and may also be used  to  set  up

corporations so as to create jobs for the workers.

I  think he has forgotten that the Fund is subject

to  withdrawals, and it is very difficult  to  say

for  certain  how much money we will have  in  the

Fund  at  any  one time. So I think  Members  will

agree  that for a fluctuating fund of this nature,

it  is  rather difficult to invest it in any fixed

ventures.  Furthermore,  in  any  shares  in   any

business concerns, whilst there is the probability

of large profits, there is also the probability of

great  losses.  It is unwise to put  the  workers'

money  in investments of a speculative nature.  It

is  rather  early to say how the Director  of  the

Fund will invest the money in order to earn enough

income  to pay the 5¼ per cent interest guaranteed

to the workers. But it is safe to say that he will

only invest this money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



in Government bonds, Treasury Bills and other very

safe bonds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah wants to know

whether  this Bill will cover executive  personnel

in the commercial sector, because he does not want

them  to enjoy this exemption from income  tax.  I

can   assure  him  that  the  intention   of   the

Government  is  to  offer this privilege  only  to

workers in the British military bases, and  we  do

not  have  any intention at the present moment  to

extend it to other sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know what happens if a

member  of the Fund runs out of money to  pay  his

rent to the Housing Board, or to pay his water and

electricity  bill  to the Public Utilities  Board.

How  is  the Housing Board or the Public Utilities

Board  going  to recover arrears? If such  a  case

arises, and if the member is a citizen, I think he

can apply under clause 10 of this Bill to withdraw

his money in order to pay these debts. If he is  a

non-citizen, when he leaves the country  there  is

still  one-third of his money left in the Fund.  I

presume  this money will be sufficient to pay  for

his  passage as well as any arrears owing  to  the

Housing Board and the Public Utilities Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wants to know whether

gratuities paid to Government employees would also

enjoy this privilege of exemption from income tax.

I say that this is not the case because we have no

intention to extend this privilege to Government

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to set up a board to

consider   withdrawals.  This  can  be   done   by

administrative  action. It  is  not  necessary  to

include  this  provision in  the  Bill.  There  is

already provision that the Minister has the  power

to  regulate  the  nature of the withdrawals.  The

Member  also  wants 20 per cent of the  redundancy

payment  to be withdrawn unconditionally  so  that

the worker can have a little enjoyment. He has not

said  what this enjoyment is, but it may be a trip

round  the world or something like that.  That  is

exactly  why  this  Bill has been  introduced,  to

guard against such injudicious spending. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



worker has already lost his job, and it is

important that he should be careful in spending

his money. He should not spend more than he can

afford.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Bukit Panjang

deserves consideration. If it is necessary, we

will introduce amendments on a subsequent

occasion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.

Paper S.L. 1 of 1968, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the previous Highway Code was issued in 1949

and  is  very  much out of date. It  is  therefore

necessary to bring out a revised Highway Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Highway Code was prepared in consultation

with  the Traffic Police, the Ministry of Culture,

the Solicitor-General's Office, the R.O.V. and the

Automobile Association of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Highway Code is a code of conduct for all

road  users. It is intended to make them aware  of

their  responsibilities while using the roads  and

they  should follow the advice and guidance  given

in it. Observance of the Highway
