<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Speaker's Ruling)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the ruling of the Speaker admitting the

motion  of  the Deputy Prime Minister in regard  to

the  Member for Hong Lim be rescinded and that this

Assembly  has  no  jurisdiction to  deal  with  the

matters raised therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I proceed with the

subject of my motion, I wish to draw your attention

to  today's Straits Times which contains an account

of  today's proceedings. Page 1 of today's  Straits

Times contains a paragraph which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This right has been admitted in the case of the

House  of Commons and in all Legislatures patterned

after it.'



<br><br>There is another paragraph at page 20 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Last Monday, the Speaker ruled that under

Standing Orders the Assembly had powers to  discuss

the  motion and, if the evidence warranted  it,  to

find    the   member   guilty   of   "dishonourable

conduct".'.



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, it reads on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He also said that the Assembly had inherent

powers, should a member be found guilty, to suspend

or even expel him.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to seek your opinion as to

whether any of the passages referred to is a matter

which is sub-judice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The answer to the question is that

there  is  no  matter which can be considered

sub-judice  at  the moment. The expression "sub-judice"

is  used with reference to a court of law.  If  the

Member  for  Hong Lim is raising  the  point  as  a

matter  of privilege, then I will look into it  and

make  my  decision at some other time. Is that  the

point  the  Member  for Hong Lim  wishes  to  make,

whether  or  not  there has been a  breach  of  the

privileges of this House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, I wish to

raise  this point as a matter of privilege. I  wish

also  to draw your attention to the fact that  this

report  is not only contained in the Straits  Times

but   a   similar  report  also  appears  in  other

newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I shall look into the matter

and give my ruling on some other day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, coming back to

the  motion.  First of all, I must  ask  your  kind

permission  to permit me to trace very briefly  the

events  in this Assembly before the motion  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister was introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 20th October, 1960, during the debate on

Malayanisation, I was challenged in  this  Assembly

to repeat outside the speeches I made.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I know it is a very difficult

problem facing hon. Members, especially the  Member

for  Hong  Lim, but at the moment we  are  dealing

specifically with the motion by the Member for Hong

Lim  which challenges the ruling of the Speaker  in

admitting  the motion of the Deputy Prime Minister.

It  seems to me that the motion raises a matter  of

academic  interest,  and the  arguments  should  be

confined   to  arguments  which  are  of   academic

interest. I do not know how the incidents which led

to  the motion which was filed by the Deputy  Prime

Minister have anything to do with the motion we are

now considering.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I am trying to

trace the events which precipitated this motion  so

that  we  can  discuss  whether  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister raised this motion in order to uphold  the

dignity  of  the  House,  or  whether  it  has  got

anything  to  do with the practice of parliamentary

democracy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid if the hon. Member

does that, he will go very, very far away from  the

motion itself. The motion merely asks this House to

say  that  the ruling of the Speaker admitting  the

motion  of  the Deputy Prime Minister in regard  to

the Member for Hong Lim be rescinded. The House  is

asked  to rescind that ruling and then to say  that

the  Assembly has no jurisdiction to deal with  the

matters raised therein.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Would you, Sir, allow me to

continue  from  where  I  left  off  on  Monday  on

quotations   from  Sir  Ivor  Jennings - just   short

extracts?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, certainly, if they are relevant

to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, Ivor Jennings, one of the

foremost  British constitutional lawyers, has  said

in his book Parliament:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The power of the Opposition rests only on

sufferance.  There  is  nothing  whatever  in   the

constitutional   machinery   that    prevents    an

Opposition  from  being suppressed.  Nor  is  there

anything  effective to prevent  the  power  of  the

Opposition from being completely destroyed  by  the

destruction  of  free  elections.  The   Opposition

cannot out vote the majority. It can only carry out

the threat to defy it and appeal to the people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the debate last Monday, we were assured by the Leader of the House, in his speech,

that  freedom  of  speech is not  in  danger.  Sir,

freedom   of   speech   is   the   cornerstone   of

parliamentary democracy. We would have been happier

if that were the true position in Singapore today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion by the Deputy Prime Minister has quoted

a  historical  precedent. I have not been  able  to

search  a  similar  precedent in other  Parliaments

where  a  Member of the Parliament has been charged

with making so-called malicious falsehoods and  his

suspension is asked for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated before that I

do not like having to intervene in a matter of such

grave  magnitude to the House. But it seems  to  me

that  the Member for Hong Lim is now going back  to

the  original  motion. What I think  the  House  is

interested  to  know is, on what grounds  does  the

Member  for  Hong Lim say that the  ruling  of  the

Speaker  should be rescinded and that the  Assembly

has  no  jurisdiction  to deal  with  the  matters

raised  in the motion of the Deputy Prime Minister?

Mr Ong Eng Guan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am coming

slowly  to  the subject. The Leader  of  the  House

quoted 12 instances of breach of privilege, but  he

has  not  indicated which of the 12 commandments  I

have  violated. Sir, it is my submission that  this

Assembly  is  not  a  sovereign  Legislature.  This

Assembly is unlike the House of Commons. It is most

important and vital to bear it in mind at all times

during  today's debate that this Assembly does  not

possess  the same inherent powers as the  House  of

Commons. Sir, this is my first submission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this subject of the powers and privileges of

colonial  legislatures, may I be allowed  to  quote

from  Martin  Wight's book The Development  of  the

Legislative  Council which I got from the  Assembly

Library  yesterday?  This  is  a  research  on  the

development  of colonial legislatures  between  the

years  1606 and 1945. Mr Martin Wight says on  the

subject of "Privileges":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As colonial legislatures have not the powers of

the  House  of Commons, so they lack the  House  of

Commons'  privileges. Under  the  old  empire,  the

colonial  assembly regularly claimed  parliamentary

privileges,  and  governors  usually  conceded  the

exemption of assemblymen from arrest and  suits  at

law during the session of the legislature, but as a

royal  grant, not an inherent right. Under the  new

empire,  there  existed means of checking  colonial

pretensions; and when in 1839, in the course of the

troubles  that led to the suspension of  the  first

representative  constitution of  Newfoundland,  the

Newfoundland  assembly  ordered  an  arrest  on   a

complaint of contempt of privilege committed out of

doors,  the case was carried to the Privy  Council,

which  held that the assembly had only such  powers

as   were  reasonably  necessary  for  the   proper

exercise  of  its functions as a local legislature,

but not `the exclusive privileges which the ancient

law of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



England  has  annexed to the House of  Parliament'.

Subsequent judgments have confirmed that a colonial

legislature can remove an obstruction to  business,

but   not   punish  for  any  action   taken.   The

extraordinary  privileges of the British  House  of

Commons,    existing   by   ancient    usage    and

prescription,  are the consequence of  its  complex

and  unique  origins  which  transcend  the  merely

legislative function. They cannot be claimed  by  a

colonial   legislature  by  virtue  of   performing

similar  legislative functions, but only by  virtue

of its own enactment. `There is no doubt that apart

from  statute a colonial legislature  had  no  more

real power than a debating society except in so far

as  measures  to  preserve order therein  might  be

allowed to take more drastic forms than in  a  mere

debating society'.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is my first submission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this first contention, Sir, may I

quote  from the book by Sir Henry John May  on  the

South  African Constitution, wherein he  writes  on

the  powers and privileges of Parliament?  Sir,  on

page 126 of his book, Sir Henry John May wrote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the United Kingdom, Parliament has from

ancient times enjoyed certain privileges and powers

founded   mainly  upon  the  law  and   custom   of

Parliament  lex  el  consueludo Parliarnenti  based

upon ancient usage. Each House adjudges whether any

breach of privilege has been committed and punishes

offenders  by censure or commitment the courses  of

which  can  now be inquired into by the  courts  of

law.  This  body  of  custom, though  narrowed  and

confirmed  by statute is peculiar to the Parliament

of  the  United Kingdom and it cannot therefore  be

inferred  that like power belong to the legislative

assemblies of comparatively recent creation in  the

dependencies  of the Crown. When a  Legislature  is

created in a colony and no special statutory powers

are granted to it, it possesses only such powers as

are reasonably necessary for the proper exercise of

its  functions  and duties as a local  legislature.

The deciding line is to be found in the distinction

between the powers to punish for contempt, which is

the  judicial  power, and the power to  remove  any

obstruction offered to the deliberations or actions

of  the  legislative sitting, which last  power  is

necessary for self-preservation. If a member of  an

assembly  is  guilty of disorderly conduct  in  the

House  while  it is sitting, he may be  removed  or

excluded for a time, and even expelled, so that the

House may proceed with its deliberations. But there

is  a great difference between such powers and  the

judicial  power of inflicting a penal sentence  for

the offence. The right to remove in order



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



to  facilitate  the business of the  House  is  one

thing; the right to inflict punishment is another.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, may I, with all humility, submit

to  you  that  this Assembly has no inherent  power

which  the House of Commons enjoys? This House  has

no inherent power even if this, Sir, is a sovereign

legislature. As I mentioned just now, Sir,  in  the

South African example, the powers and privileges of

Parliament  have  to be derived from  statute.  Sir

Henry  John May wrote in his book, which  I  quoted

just now, on page 127:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has therefore been thought necessary specially

to  grant  the Union Parliament [i.e. the Union  of

South Africa Parliament] such powers and privileges

as  it  should have. Section 57 of the South Africa

Act provided that until Parliament was able to draw

up  its own code, the powers and privileges of  the

Cape  Parliament  were  to  apply  [i.e. the  Cape

Parliament].  In  1911 Parliament [i.e. the  South

African   Parliament]   passed   the   Powers   and

Privileges   of   Parliament   Act.   This   is   a

comprehensive  statutory code defining  the  powers

and privileges of Parliament and of its Members and

Officers,  and  contempt  of  Parliament,  and   it

regulates   the  methods  by  which   contempt   of

Parliament may be punished.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arising from my submission just now, firstly,

the  power to condemn, and, secondly, the power  to

suspend  Assemblymen in this House must be  derived

from  statute. There is no inherent power as  there

is  in the House of Commons. Therefore, it must  be

derived    from    either   (1)    the    Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958,  or  (2)  it

should be derived from an Ordinance passed by  this

Legislative Assembly, or (3) it should  be  derived

from the Standing Orders of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall first speak on the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in  Council.  Apart

from  section 48 empowering the making of  Standing

Orders,  the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order   in

Council  contains  no  provision  which  could   be

construed  as  directly creating a  power  in  this

Assembly to regulate its own internal affairs.  The

only  other  provision  of this  Order  in  Council

relevant  to  the  privileges of  the  Assembly  is

section 59, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be lawful, by law enacted under this

Order, to determine and regulate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



privileges,  immunities and powers of the  Assembly

and  its Members but no such privileges, immunities

or  powers shall exceed those of the Commons' House

of  Parliament  in  the United Kingdom  or  of  the

Members thereof.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, this is not a direct  grant  of

privileges.  It  is thus clear that  the  Singapore

Constitution  does  not  make  provision  for   the

expulsion  pf  Members. It is also  my  submission,

Sir,  that the Singapore Constitution does not make

provision for the suspension of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore my second submission, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  that  the  second part of  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister's  motion  is ultra  vires  the  Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council. 1958. Sir, we must

thus  seek  the  power, if  there  is  any,  in  an

Ordinance. The only relevant Ordinance is Ordinance

No. 33 of 1955 - the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges)  Ordinance. Section 20,  which  is  the

only  provision, empowers, the Assembly to  suspend

Members  but  only in the case of contempt  of  the

Assembly.  Section  20  defines  "contempt  of  the

Assembly" as:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Any member of the Assembly who



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) being a member of a Committee of the

Assembly, publishes to any person not being a

member  of such committee any evidence  taken

by  the committee before it has been reported

to the Assembly; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) assaults or obstructs a member of the

Assembly  within the Chamber or precincts  of

the Assembly; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) assaults or obstructs any officer of the

Assembly while in the execution of his  duty;

or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) is convicted of any offence under this

Ordinance,



<br><br>shall be guilty of contempt of this Assembly.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the motion by the Deputy  Prime

Minister  does not charge the Member for  Hong  Lim

for  contempt  of  the Assembly.  I  am  not  being

charged for having violated any provisions  of  the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance. Sir, it is therefore my third submission

that the Singapore Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, does not empower  this

Assembly  to  pass the second part  of  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister's motion, that is, to  suspend  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



for  Hong Lim on the charges laid down in the first

part of his motion. Sir, from there onwards -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like, and perhaps the

Members would like, to clear the issue. It seems to

me  that  the  hon.  Member for  Hong  Lim  is  now

debating  as to whether this Assembly has he  power

to,  suspend  or  even to punish,  apart  from  the

powers  given  by  the statute. What  I  think  the

honourable Members of this Assembly would like  to

know,  and I myself would like to know, is  whether

or  not this Assembly is debarred from debating the

Question - there  is  a  subtle difference  there.  I

trust the hon. Member for Hong Lim is following me.

I  think  what the Assembly would like to know,  on

the  motion before this Assembly, is whether or not

this  Assembly  is  even barred from  debating  the

subject matter. As to what the Assembly can  do  in

the  circumstances is also another issue,  that  is

the  punitive power of the Assembly.  Is  the  hon.

Member  for  Hong Lim now alleging that this  House

has no jurisdiction even to debate the substance of

the  motion by the Deputy Prime Minister?  I  think

that is the issue which has been raised in the hon.

Member's  motion. The other issue is  how  far  the

Assembly  can  go in the matter. They  are  perhaps

issues which can be taken up when we deal with  the

Deputy  Prime Minister's motion. The point now  is:

can this Assembly debate that motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will come to

that  later. Continuing from what I said just  now,

it  is my third submission that since the Singapore

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance declares itself, in its long title, to be

"An Ordinance to declare and define certain powers,

privileges   and  immunities  of  the   Legislative

Assembly", and since by section 2C it does  declare

and define the power of suspension, it follows that

no other power of suspension exists. Mr Speaker, I

will  come  to  the first part - if I  could  try  to

explain.  I am trying to go through both  parts  in

one breath.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now refer to the Standing Orders of

the  Singapore Legislative Assembly. Is  there  any

power  under  the Standing Orders  for  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister's motion? Last Wednesday, when  the

Deputy  Prime Minister wanted to move a motion  for

suspension under No. 30 (e) of the Standing Orders,

it  was ruled that Standing Order 30 (e) should  he

read  in  conjunction with Standing Order  No.  56.

Reference was therefore made to Standing Order  56,

paragraph (5), which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Standing Order shall be taken to

deprive  the  Assembly of the power  of  proceeding

against  any Member according to any resolution  of

the Assembly.'



<br><br>Sir,  may  you  permit me to dwell  at  some  great

length on the interpretation of S.O. 56 (5)?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two days, I have gone through the

Standing    Orders   of   many    other    colonial

legislatures, and they are basically the same. They

are  based on model Standing Orders adopted by  the

Colonial  Office Conference in 1927. Thus, Standing

Order 56 (5) of the Singapore Standing Orders is to

be  found  in  the Standing Orders of almost  every

other colonial legislature. Before I dwell at great

length  on  Standing  Order 56  (5),  may  I  first

explain  that  paragraph (2) of Singapore  Standing

Order  No. 103 could also be found in the  Standing

Orders  of  other  colonial legislatures?  Standing

Order  103 (2) states that in any matter for  which

the  Standing  Orders of Singapore do not  provide,

the relevant practice of the House of Commons shall

be  followed, but no restriction which the House of

Commons  has introduced by Standing Order shall  be

deemed  to extend to the Singapore Assembly or  its

Members  until the Assembly has itself provided  by

Standing Order for such restriction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, what is meant by "the relevant

practice of the House of Commons" on the suspension

of  Members?  According  to  Erskine  May,  in  his

authoritative work "Parliamentary Practice",  (16th

Edition.). pages  104  and 105,  it  appears  that

suspension  can still theoretically be  imposed  at

the discretion of the House of Commons, But on 25th

July,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



1877,  as  a  result of persistent  obstruction  by

Members,  Mr  Speaker  Brand  made  the  following

ruling:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The House is perfectly well aware that any Member

persistently   and   wilfully  obstructing   public

business  without  just  and  reasonable  cause  is

guilty  of contempt of this House and is liable  to

punishment, whether by censure, suspension from the

service  of the House, or commitment, according  to

the judgment of the House.'



<br><br>This   is   reported  in  the  House   of   Commons

Parliamentary   Debates  1877,  235,   col.   1814.

Therefore,  in  February 1880,  the  procedure  for

suspending a Member was laid down in Standing Order

22 of the British House of Commons. Please refer to

page  471  of  Erskine May. The House  of  Commons'

Standing  Order  22  is similar  to  the  Singapore

Standing Order 56. Since February 1880, it  appears

that  no suspension of Members has been made except

on  grounds  contained  in Standing  Order  22.  It

seems,  therefore,  that in the House  of  Commons,

suspension of a Member has been restricted to cases

covered by the House of Commons' Standing Order 22,

which is Singapore Standing Order 56. Although  the

House  of  Commons,  in theory,  has  inherent  and

absolute  power, it nevertheless, Mr  Speaker,  is

restricted  in  its  practice by  a  huge  body  of

conventions and precedents. This is important,  and

we  should bear this in mind when we interpret  the

words "the inherent power of the House of Commons".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this restriction of powers on the suspension

of  Members  in  the  House  of  Commons  has  been

introduced  in Singapore by Standing Order  56.  My

submission  to you, Sir, is that according  to  the

practice of the House of Commons, the Deputy  Prime

Minister's motion is out of order. The Deputy Prime

Minister  has  not  quoted any precedent  from  the

House  of Commons' practice to back his case.  Sir,

suspension of a Member under Standing Order 56 must

comply with the following conditions:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the offence must be (a) disregarding the

authority  of the Chair, and (b) persistently  and

wilfully  obstructing the business of the Assembly

by abusing the rules of the Assembly;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the motion must be made immediately

after the commission of the offence.



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I have not  been  charged  for

having  violated  Standing Order 56  or  any  other

Standing Orders of this Assembly. Can this Assembly

use  Standing  Order 56 (5) to  suspend  a  Member?

Standing Order 56 (5) cannot be interpreted to mean

that  this  Assembly  can pass any  resolution  for

whatever  reason against any Member. These  are  my

arguments.  Sir. Standing Order 56  (5)  cannot  be

taken in its literal sense as Standing Order 30 (e)

cannot  be  taken in its literal sense.  Otherwise,

acting  under Standing Order 30 (e), this  Assembly

can  suspend  a Member at any time without  notice,

without reason, without debate, and even during his

absence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been ruled that Standing

Order  30 (e) should be read in the general context

of  the  whole  Standing Orders  of  the  Singapore

Legislative Assembly and with special reference  to

Standing  Order 56. It is thus my contention,  Sir,

that  likewise  Standing Order  56,  paragraph  (5)

should be read in the general context of the  whole

Standing   Orders  of  the  Singapore   Legislative

Assembly with special reference to Standing  Orders

52  to  58 which come under the general heading  of

"Rules of order in the Assembly". The whole purpose

of Standing Orders 52 to 58 is to preserve order in

the  Assembly.  Everyone of  these  seven  Standing

Orders deals with rules of order. Briefly they are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 52: The Chairman to be heard in

silence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 53: Decision of the Chair is

final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 54: Irrelevance or repetition may

cause speech to be discontinued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 55: Disorderly conduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 56: Order in debate.



<br><br>And  in  this  Standing Order 56, a Member  can  be

suspended  only for disregarding the  authority  of

the  Chair or persistently and wilfully obstructing

the business of the Assembly by abusing the rules.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 57: Suspended Members to withdraw

from precincts of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 58 gives the Speaker power to

adjourn  or  suspend a sitting  in  case  of  grave

disorder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that these Standing Orders, that

is, Standing Orders 52 to 58, are rules of order in

the  Assembly - that  is, order in  debate - and  if  a

Member has not been guilty of any offence under any

of  such  Standing Orders, no motion to suspend  is

justified  under the Standing Orders,  and  it  is,

therefore, out of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, I have not been charged for any

offence  against  these  Standing  Orders.  It   is

therefore  my contention, Sir, that Standing  Order

56,  paragraph (5) is controlled and restricted  by

Standing Order 56, paragraph (1) according  to  the

rule  of law known as usdern genesis, that  is,  of

the  same kind or nature. This is one of the  rules

of construction applied by the courts in construing

documents  of  all kinds, whether statutes,  deeds,

mercantile  documents and others. My submission  is

that  S.O. 56 (5) is therefore restricted to  those

grounds of suspension set out in S.O. 56 (1) .  S.O.

56 (5) should be read under the general heading of

Standing  Orders 52 to 58. "Rules of order  in  the

Assembly". Under Standing Order 56 (5) ,  a  Member,

as  distinct from the Chair, under S.O. 56 (1)  may

move  a  motion against another Member  for  having

violated  S.O.  56  (1) to maintain  order  in  the

debate  in  case  the Chair did  not  move  such  a

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, therefore S.O. 56 (5) is very

useful  in  case the Chair is occupied  by  a  less

capable  person or by a Party man. It  is  also  my

contention   that  the  phrase  in  S.O.   56   (5)

"Proceeding  against"  cannot  be  interpreted   to

include  the powers of suspension or expulsion.  It

could mean reprimand. It could mean that this House

can  levy, say, a forfeit or anything on  a  guilty

Member.  Mr Speaker, Sir, if it were ever intended

that  S.O.  56  (5) should be read in  its  literal

construction,  then my submission is that  Standing

Order 56 (5)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



should   have   been  a  separate  and  independent

Standing Order when the model Standing Orders  were

drafted   and   adopted  by  the  Colonial   Office

Conference  in  1927, and not as a paragraph  under

Standing  Order  56.  Sir,  it  should  be  as   an

independent Standing Order. Perhaps a new  Standing

Order  to  be  numbered, say, 104,  after  the  103

Standing  Orders  in this Assembly.  It  should  be

taken  out  of the heading "Rules of order  in  the

Assembly".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1927, when the Colonial Office Conference

was  held  and  which  adopted  the  set  of  model

Standing Orders for all colonial legislatures, most

of  the  colonial  legislatures  then  were  having

official  majorities with the Governor  taking  the

Chair.  The  colonial legislatures were legislative

only  formally. For though its consent is necessary

to  pass legislation and the Annual Estimates, that

consent  is  assured by the official majority.  The

capacity   of   the   unofficial  members,   mostly

nominated,   is  really  advisory.  The   nominated

unofficial  members, being nominated by the  Crown,

will  always co-operate with the Crown  on  general

policy  and  important issues for obvious  reasons.

The  most  important  activity  of  these  Colonial

legislatures at that period was the debate  on  the

Annual Estimates. This is what Martin Wight in his

book,  "The Development of the Legislative Council"

at page 123 said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"`There is no doubt that apart from statute a

colonial legislature had no more real power than  a

debating  society except in so far as  measures  to

preserve  order  therein might be allowed  to  take

more   drastic  forms  than  in  a  mere   debating

society.' ".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I emphasise the words "to preserve order".

The  Singapore  Standing Orders are  based  on  the

model   Standing  Orders  of  the  Colonial  Office

Conference of 1927, and Standing Orders  52  to  58

are  meant  just for the preservation of  order  in

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the past two days I have made a study

of   the   Standing   Orders  of   other   colonial

legislatures.  May you permit me to reproduce  here

the  equivalent of Standing Order  56  (5)  in  the

Standing Orders of other legislatures to show the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



interpretation,  and they are  all  concerned,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, with breaches of order? First of all,

Nigeria.  Under  the  Standing Orders  of  Nigeria,

Standing  Orders  33 to 35 come under  the  general

heading of "Order". S.O. 35 (9) says this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Order shall be taken to deprive the House of the

power of proceeding against any Member resolution of the House.'.



<br><br>Word  by  word the same as S.O. 56 (5) of Singapore

Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamaica - Standing Order 29. The heading is "Speaker

to   be   heard   in   silence."   Standing   Order

30 - "Responsibility for Order." Standing  Order

31 - "Breaches of Order". I quote the equivalent of  our

S.O. 56 (5). That is Standing Order 31(9):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Order shall be deemed to prevent

the  House  from proceeding against any Member  for

any  breach of order not specified therein or  from

proceeding  in  any  other way  it  thinks  fit  in

dealing   with   the  breaches  of   order   herein

mentioned.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see that the Jamaican

equivalent  of S.O. 56 (5) deals, in  more  detail,

with what is the purpose of that particular clause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the Standing Orders of Hong

Kong.  Standing Order 21 - "President to be heard  in

silence."; S.O. 22 - "Responsibility for Order"; S.O.

23 - "Breaches  of  Order".  I  shall  reproduce  the

equivalent of S.O. 56 (5) in Hong Kong. Their's  is

Standing Order 23 (9):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Order shall be deemed to prevent

the  Council from proceeding against any Member for

any  breach of order not specified therein or  from

proceeding  in  any  other way  it  thinks  fit  in

dealing with the breaches of order.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must beg your pardon if I am

trying   your  patience  in  repeating  all   these

Standing  Orders.  I now come to  the  Gold  Coast.

Standing  Orders  46 to 48 come under  the  general

heading  "Rules of Order". Rule 46 -  "Chair  to  be

heard  in  silence"; 47 - "Decision of Chair  final";

48 - "Order in the Assembly". I shall now reproduce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



the equivalent of our S.O. 56 (5) in the Gold Coast

Standing Orders. Their's is S.O.48(8):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Order shall be deemed to prevent

the Assembly from proceeding against any Member for

any offence not specified herein.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, please remember the word

"offence".   "Offence"   means   "offence   against

breaches  of  order".  Now  I  shall  produce   the

Standing  Orders  of  our  closest  neighbour,  the

Federation  of Malaya. Both 1950 and 1957  are  the

same  on  this subject. Standing Order 47  concerns

breaches  of  order.  S.O. 47  (9),  which  is  the

equivalent of our S.O. 56 (5), reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to prevent

the Council from proceeding against any' Member for

any  breach of order not specified herein  or  from

proceeding  in any other reasonable way  it  thinks

fit  in  dealing with the breaches of order  herein

mentioned.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come to Ceylon. Standing

Orders  82 to 87 come under the general heading  of

"Order in the House", and Standing Order 87 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in these Orders shall prevent the House

from proceeding against any Member for breaches  of

order specified in these Orders in any other manner

than the manner specified in these Orders.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, my last quotation will be from the Standing Orders of the Assembly of Victoria,

Australia.  Standing  Order 141  of  the  Victorian

Parliament is a very long one and reads as follows.

(It is in one Standing Order):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If any Member be named by the President or

reported by the Chairman of Committees for



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) wilfully interrupting or making a disturbance

during   the  business  of  the  Council   or

Committee of the whole Council; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) disorderly conduct or;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) using objectionable words and refusing to

withdraw the same or behaving offensively and

refusing to make a satisfactory apology; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) wilfully and persistently refusing to conform

to the Standing Orders; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) wilfully disregarding the authority of the

Chair,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such Member shall be called upon to make an

explanation or apology he thinks fit and  a  motion

may be moved forthwith, no amendment, adjournment

or  debate  being  allowed,  that  such  Member  be

suspended  from  the service of the Council  during

the remainder



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



of  the  sitting or for such period as the  Council

may  think  fit.  Any Member suspended  under  this

Standing Order shall immediately withdraw and shall

not  come within the precincts of the House  during

the period of his suspension unless, on receipt  of

a  satisfactory  apology in  writing,  the  Council

resolved   on  motion  made  without   notice   and

determined without amendment or debate to discharge

the  order of suspension. Nothing herein  shall  be

taken  to  deprive  the Council  of  the  power  of

proceeding against any Member according to  ancient

usages.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of the best

quotations  so  far.  In the Victorian  Parliament,

Standing Order 141 is in only one paragraph. It  is

not  like  the Singapore Standing Orders  separated

into five paragraphs, and the last sentence in  the

whole paragraph is this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing herein shall be taken to deprive the

Council  of  the  power of proceeding  against  any

Member according to ancient usages.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the examples of the other

legislatures I have quoted above, Standing Order 56

(5)  of  Singapore is clear. It is  concerned  only

with a breach of order in this Assembly and is  not

capable of wider interpretations. Therefore,  under

Standing  Order 56 (5), the motion  of  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister, which charges a Member for  making

malicious falsehoods, is out of order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the speech the Deputy

Prime  Minister has not stated under which specific

authority this Assembly can discuss this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Was it under the inherent powers of the House

of Commons?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have submitted just now that a colonial

legislature has no inherent power, unlike the House

of Commons; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Was it under the Singapore Constitution?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have submitted, Sir, that as far as the second

part  of  his  motion is concerned,  the  Singapore

Constitution makes no provisions for the suspension

or   expulsion   of  Members.  The   Deputy   Prime

Minister's second part of the motion is against the

Singapore Constitution; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Was it under the Singapore Legislative (Powers

and Privileges) Ordinance?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have submitted, Sir, that I have not been

charged  for  having  violated  the  laws  of  this

Ordinance  which  provides for  the  suspension  of

Members.  The  Deputy  Prime Minister's  motion  is

therefore against this particular Ordinance; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Was it under the relevant practice of the House

of Commons?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have submitted, Sir, that the Deputy Prime

Minister  gave  us  12 breaches  of  privilege.  He

quoted  12  commandments and he  did  not  indicate

which of them I have violated. On the one hand, the

Deputy   Prime  Minister  quoted  12  breaches   of

privileges;  on the other hand, he charged  me  for

abuse  of privilege. It seems to me that he is  not

clear about even the fundamental distinction



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member should

not  go  into  a debate now on the details  of  the

Deputy   Prime  Minister's  motion.  Let   us   now

concentrate  on  what I have called  this  academic

problem.  We  should try, as  far  as  we  can,  to

confine ourselves to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no precedent

in  the  House  of Commons has been, quoted  as  an

authority.  I  believe  there  has  been  no   such

precedent. The motion is thus against the practices

in the House of Commons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also submitted, Sir, the restrictions

imposed  on  this Assembly by S.O. 103 (2)  of  the

Singapore Standing Orders; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Was it under Standing Order 56 (5)? Just now I

quoted  at length Standing Order 56 (5)  which

concerns itself only with a breach of order in

the  Assembly  and  is not  capable  of  wider

interpretations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not been charged for a breach of

order.  Where is the authority, Sir, for the motion

by  the  Deputy Prime Minister? It is therefore  my

humble  submission, Sir, that this Assembly has  no

jurisdiction  whatsoever to deal with  the  matters

raised  in the motion by the Deputy Prime Minister.

I  submit that his motion is against the provisions

of   the   Singapore  Constitution,   against   the

Singapore   Legislative   Assembly   (Powers    and

Privileges) Ordinance, and against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



the Standing Orders of this Assembly. Sir, I submit

that the motion by the Deputy Prime Minister is out

of order and unconstitutional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on an unprecedented constitutional issue of

this nature, whether this Legislative Assembly will

be  acting  ultra vires the Singapore  Constitution

and against the laws of this country, I must submit

that  the  decision cannot be made by vote  of  the

House.  In my opinion, Sir, none of us here  is  an

authority  on constitutional matters,  despite  the

fact  that  all  of  us have a battery  of  lawyers

studying  this  grave constitutional  issue  facing

this  Assembly.  I  must  submit,  Sir,  that  this

Assembly  should  seek expert advice  from  leading

constitutional experts in the United  Kingdom  and,

in  the  meantime, no decision can be made by  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to this Assembly, this is a constitutional

issue,  but  I  consider  this  is  not  merely   a

constitutional  issue. It is at  the  same  time  a

grave political issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think, at the moment, this

Assembly is not interested in the political  issue.

I  think  it  is  interested in the  constitutional

issue.  Let  us  concentrate on the  constitutional

issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I will finish within a few

seconds, Sir, I therefore ask the Prime Minister to

take  this  issue  to the people. Resign  both  our

seats forthwith to take this-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is completely irrelevant to

the motion that is before the House. The motion  is

quite  clear. It seeks to convince this House  that

the  motion of the Deputy Prime Minister cannot  be

heard, and I think that is all we are interested in

in this House. If there is to be a challenge of any

sort,  that can be made elsewhere, but not  in  the

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Thank you, Sir. This is my

speech. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I pose the Question, I think

the  Member for Hong Lim might make the  issues  he

has  raised more clear. By his speech is he  saying

that the Speaker ought to have ruled the motion  of

the  Deputy Prime Minister out of order  just  like

that, out of hand? Is that it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, that is

my submission.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Another point of elucidation then is

this.  If  therefore a Member - I am  only  taking  a

hypothetical case - is alleged in this  House  to  be

guilty  of  abuse  of  the  freedom  of  speech  by

uttering  slanderous words in this  Assembly  which

might  bring this Assembly into disrepute,  is  the

Member for Hong Lim then urging that this Assembly.

firstly, cannot condemn or suspend the Member  and,

secondly, that this Assembly cannot even debate the

conduct of the Member in this Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is also

my submission. I have submitted just now that there

is  nothing  in the statute to provide for  such  a

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye): Mr

Speaker,  I have taken the State Advocate-General's

opinion on this motion moved by the Member for Hong

Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council,

1958,  enables  the Legislative Assembly  to  make,

amend  and  revoke  the  Standing  Orders  for  the

regulation   and  orderly  conduct   of   its   own

proceedings  and the despatch of business.  In  the

exercise  of  this power, the Legislative  Assembly

has made Standing Orders, and Standing Orders 52 to

58  of  these Standing Orders provide for the rules

of  order in the Assembly Standing Order 56 (1)  to

(4) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Whenever a Member has been named by the

Speaker or by the Chairman, immediately'-



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh (Joo Chiat):</b> On a point of

explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may the Hon. the Deputy

Prime Minister give us the section of the Singapore

(Constitution)  Order in Council,  1958,  which  he

says gives the power to do such and such a thing?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I refer to section 48 (1) of

the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order  in  Council,

1958, which reads:

<pre>

 `Standing     Subject  to  the  provisions  of   this

Orders.         Order,  the Assembly may from  time  to

                time  make,  amend and revoke  Standing

                Orders  for the regulation and  orderly

                conduct of its own proceedings and  the

                despatch of business.'

</pre>

<br><br>I  hope, Sir, that will satisfy the Member for  Joo

Chiat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me proceed. Standing Order 56 (1) reads

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whenever a Member has been named by the Speaker

or   by   the   Chairman,  immediately  after   the

commission  of  the  offence  of  disregarding  the

authority  of  the  Chair, or of  persistently  and

wilfully  obstructing the business of the  Assembly

by abusing the rules of the Assembly, or otherwise,

then,  if  the offence has been committed  by  such

Member in the Assembly a motion shall forthwith  be

proposed  by a Minister or Parliamentary  Secretary

present  "That Mr... be suspended from the service

of  the  Assembly", and the Speaker shall forthwith

put  the  question  on that motion,  no  amendment,

adjournment  or debate being allowed; and,  if  the

offence  has  been  committed in Committee  of  the

whole   Assembly,  the  Chairman  shall   forthwith

suspend the proceedings of the Committee and report

the  circumstances to the Assembly; and the Speaker

shall on a motion being made as aforesaid forthwith

put the same question, no amendment, adjournment or

debate  being allowed, as if the offence  had  been

committed in the Assembly itself.'



<br><br>Paragraph (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Not more than one Member shall he named at the

same  time,  unless  two or more  Members,  present

together, have jointly disregarded the authority of

the Chair.'



<br><br>Paragraph (3) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If a Member is suspended under the provisions of

this  Standing Order, he shall he directed  by  the

Speaker to withdraw. His suspension shall last  for

such period as may be determined by the Assembly.'



<br><br>Paragraph (4) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If a Member, or two or more Members acting

jointly,   who  have  been  suspended  under   this

Standing  Order from the service of  the  Assembly,

shall  refuse to obey the direction of the  Speaker

to  withdraw,  when  severally summoned  under  the

orders  of the Speaker by the Serjeant at  Arms  to

obey  such  direction, the Speaker shall  call  the

attention of the Assembly to the fact that recourse

to  force is necessary in order to compel obedience

to  his direction. When the Member or Members named

by  him as having refused to obey his direction has

or have been removed from the Assembly he or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



they  shall thereupon without any further  question

being  put  be  suspended from the service  of  the

Assembly during the remainder of the session.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, so far the Standing Orders deal with the

powers of the Speaker or Chairman to deal with  any

Member who commits the offence of disregarding  the

authority  of  the  Chair, or of  persistently  and

wilfully  obstructing the business of the  Assembly

by abusing the rules of the Assembly; but Standing

Order 56 (5) goes on to provide that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Standing Order shall be taken to

deprive  the  Assembly of the power  of  proceeding

against  any Member according to any resolution  of

the Assembly.'



<br><br>Sir, quite apart from the powers of the Speaker  or

Chairman   under  Standing  Order   56   (1),   the

Legislative  Assembly itself has power  to  proceed

against  any  Member  by resolution.  It  is  under

Standing Order 56 (5) that my motion was brought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Sir, have ruled that I have satisfied the

House that the proceedings I took were proper to be

brought  and  could  properly  be  debated  in  the

Legislative Assembly. The Member for Hong  Lim  has

now challenged this ruling under Standing Order  53

which provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Speaker in the Assembly . . . shall be

responsible  for  the observance of  the  rules  of

order in the Assembly. . . and his decision on  any

point  of  order shall not be open  to  appeal  and

shall not be reviewed by the Assembly except upon a

substantive motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 54 (1) of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order in Council, 1958, in so far as it deals  with

motions, provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Order and of

the Standing Orders of the Assembly, any Member may

... propose  any  motion for  debate  in  ... the

Assembly,  and  the  same  shall  be  debated   and

disposed of according to the Standing Orders of the

Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitations on the powers of the Assembly are

expressly  laid down in the Order in  Council:  for

example,  in  section 54 (2)  (b)  which  says,  in

effect,  that  the Assembly shall not proceed  upon

any  motion  the effect of which is  to  impose  or

increase  any  tax, or to impose  or  increase  any

charge on the revenues



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



or   other  funds  of  Singapore,  except  on   the

recommendation   of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara

signified  by  a Minister. Thus, prima  facie,  the

Assembly  has  power to deal with any  motion,  and

anyone  who asserts that the Assembly has  no  such

power  must  show  that  there  is  some  statutory

provision  in the Order in Council which  restricts

the powers of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of my motion seeks merely to

condemn the Member for Hong Lim for his undignified

conduct.  I  would  submit that this  Assembly  has

clearly  powers  to  deal with  this  part  of  the

motion.  Standing  Order  No.  46,  paragraph  (10)

provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>This,  when read together with Standing  Order  No.

56, paragraph (5), which provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Standing Order shall he taken to

deprive  the  Assembly of the power  of  proceeding

against  any Member according to any resolution  of

the Assembly.'.



<br><br>gives the Assembly power to condemn the conduct  of

any  Member. Such a power is necessary to  maintain

the decorum and dignity of the Assembly and must be

possessed by every Legislative Assembly. The Member

for  Hong  Lim  has  referred to  this  Legislative

Assembly  as a colonial legislature. The  Singapore

(Constitution)  Order  in  Council,  1958,  confers

complete  internal self-government  on  the  State.

This Assembly has, therefore, sovereignty over  its

own proceedings, and it cannot be called a colonial

legislature. I would therefore say, Sir, that there

is  no  doubt as to the correctness of your  ruling

that  this Assembly is competent to deal  with  the

first part of my motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion by the Member for Hong Lim

also  takes in the second part of the motion. I  do

not know whether the Leader of the House would like

to touch on that aspect.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will deal with that when the

time comes, and after we have disposed of the first

part of my motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In elucidation, I think the Members

of  the House would like to know whether it is  the

contention of the Leader of the House then that the

Speaker's  ruling in admitting the second  part  of

the  motion is also in order. Perhaps I could  make

myself  a  little clearer. Apart from the  question

whether or not the Assembly, in fact, has the power

to suspend - that is apart from that Question because

in  debating  the  second part of the  motion,  the

Assembly  is,  of  course,  at  liberty   to   make

amendments;  if it is satisfied that  there  is  no

power  to  suspend, then, of course, the  amendment

could be to censure or to admonish.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if it is your

wish,  I  will  deal with the second  part  of  the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I begin, Sir, by referring to your ruling on

Monday? I quote from the [unrevised] transcript  of

proceedings of this House on 19th December, 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As I see it, therefore, if this House is

satisfied  that the conduct of the hon. Member  for

Hong  Lim  is such as to be an affront to  its  own

dignity and prestige in the sense, inter alia, that

that conduct has brought discredit to the House  as

a  whole - not  merely to individual Members  of  the

Government Parliamentary Party, or indeed,  to  any

other  Member  of  the House or to persons  outside

this House - then the House may feel itself justified

in condemning or censuring the hon. Member for Hong

Lim  and  therefore in proceeding to consider  what

punishment,  consonant with its powers,  it  should

mete out to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What those powers are is a matter of law on which

I  am  not called upon to pronounce. Suffice it  to

say  that  there is an undoubted power inherent  in

any  House, in the interest of the orderly  conduct

of its business and the preservation of its dignity

and  prestige, inter alia, to suspend or even expel

Members  who are, in its opinion, unfit to  sit  in

the  House and who would bring discredit  upon  it.

But  let  me sound a word of warning. Whether  this

Assembly has those extreme powers unabridged, is  a

matter this Assembly will have to inquire into with

care  and,  if  need be, upon which  this  Assembly

might  wish to seek legal advice. I myself feel  it

my  duty as the guardian of the privileges of  this

House  and  the  custodian of the  rights  of  hon.

Members to sound that note of warning having regard

to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, section 48 (1) of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, which I have

already quoted;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Standing Orders made thereunder;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, section 59 of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, which  reads

as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"59. It shall be lawful, by laws enacted under

this   Order,  to  determine  and  regulate   the

privileges, immunities and powers of the Assembly

and   its   Members;  but  no  such   privileges,

immunities  or powers shall exceed those  of  the

Commons'  House  of  Parliament  in  the   United

Kingdom or of the Members thereof.";



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges)  Ordinance, 1955,  the  long  title  of

which reads as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An Ordinance to declare and define certain

powers,   privileges  and   immunities   of   the

Legislative   Assembly  established   under   the

Singapore Colony Order in Council, 1955,  and  of

the  Members  of  such Legislative  Assembly,  to

regulate the conduct of members and other persons

in  connection with the proceedings  thereof,  to

give  protection to the persons employed  in  the

publication  of the reports and other  papers  of

the   Legislative  Assembly  and   for   purposes

incidental  to  or  connected  with  the  matters

aforesaid.".'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those provisions of law and of the Standing

Orders do give to this Assembly powers to suspend a

Member  under certain circumstances. But as I  have

indicated,  this  Assembly  will  have  to  satisfy

itself  that  these provisions of law  and  of  the

Standing  Orders  have not, in fact,  abridged  the

inherent  power  of  this  Assembly  to  suspend  a

Member, more especially in the circumstances  which

have  arisen in this particular matter. The  powers

of  the  Legislative Assembly to  regulate  and  to

provide   for  the  orderly  conduct  of  its   own

proceedings   and  the  despatch  of  business   is

contained   in   section  48   of   the   Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958.  Section  59

of  the  Singapore (Constitution) Order in  Council

also provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be lawful, by laws enacted under this

Order,  to  determine and regulate the  privileges,

immunities  and  powers of  the  Assembly  and  its

Members;  but  no  such privileges,  immunities  or

powers shall exceed those of the Commons' House  of

Parliament in the United Kingdom or of the  Members

thereof.'



<br><br>No such law has so far been made under the Order in

Council.  The  Legislative  Assembly  (Powers   and

Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, deals with the powers,

privileges and immunities of the Legislative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



Assembly  established  under the  Singapore  Colony

Order  in Council, 1955. But the Ordinance is  made

applicable  to the present Legislative Assembly  by

virtue  of  section 121 (2) (f)  of  the  Singapore

(Constitution)   Order  in   Council,   1958.   The

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance,  1955, was enacted under  the  Singapore

Colony  Order  in  Council,  1955,  which   had   a

provision  in section 65 similar to section  59  of

the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order  in  Council,

1958. While the Orders in Council of 1955 and  1958

enable  legislation to be enacted to determine  and

regulate  the privileges, immunities and powers  of

the  Assembly  and  its  Members,  the  Legislative

Assembly  (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance,  1955,

merely  purports, as stated in its long  title,  to

declare  and define certain powers - I repeat - certain

powers,  privileges and immunities of the  Assembly

and  its Members. The Ordinance is, therefore,  not

exhaustive of the powers, privileges and immunities

of  the  Assembly. It seeks, in the main,  to  deal

with the privileges and powers of the Assembly vis-a-vis the Courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contempts of the Assembly are dealt with in

section 20 of the Ordinance, but the Ordinance does

not  seek to deal exhaustively with all the  powers

of  the  Assembly  vis-a-vis its own  Members.  The

regulation   of   the  orderly   conduct   of   the

proceedings  of the Assembly is a matter  on  which

the  Assembly itself is competent to make  Standing

Orders  for  their purpose. Standing Orders  derive

their  validity  not from any local Ordinance,  but

from   the  Singapore  (Constitution)   Order   in

Council,  1958,  itself.  And  the  provisions   of

Standing  Order 56, paragraph (5) which  refers  to

the  power  of the Assembly to proceed against  any

Member  according to a resolution of the  Assembly,

cannot  be  read subject to the provisions  of  the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance, 1955. It cannot seriously be argued, for

example,  that  Standing Order  56  paragraph  (1),

which  clearly gives the Assembly power in  certain

circumstances to suspend a Member, is  ultra  vires

the  provisions of the Legislative Assembly (Powers

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



Privileges)  Ordinance,  1955.  Neither  can   that

Ordinance  affect  the  inherent  powers, of   the

Legislative  Assembly  which  are  referred  to  in

Standing  Order  56, paragraph  (5) .  The  inherent

powers of a colonial legislature, even if we regard

this  Assembly as a colonial legislature, have been

dealt  with in a number of Privy Council cases.  In

Calvin  vs.  Castle,  1844. Volume  4;  more  Privy

Council  cases,  63,  Baron  Park,  in  giving  the

opinion of the Privy Council, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We feel no doubt that such an Assembly has the

right of protecting itself from all impediments  to

the  due  course of its proceedings.  To  the  full

extent  of  every measure which it  may  be  really

necessary  to adopt to secure the free exercise  of

their legislative functions, they are justified  in

acting by the principle of the common law.'



<br><br>In  Burton  vs.  Taylor, 1886,  Volume  11,  Appeal

Cases,  page 197, the Earl of Selbourne, in  giving

the opinion of the Privy Council, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It results from these authorities that no powers

of  that  kind  are incident to or  inherent  in  a

colonial Legislative Assembly without express grant

except as such as are necessary to the existence of

such  a  body,  and  the  proper  exercise  of  its

functions which it is intended to execute. Whatever

in  a  reasonable  sense  is  necessary  for  these

purposes  is  impliedly  granted  whenever  such  a

legislative   body  is  established  by   competent

authority.'



<br><br>Later in his speech he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The power, therefore, of suspending a Member

guilty  of obstructing or disorderly conduct during

the continuance of any current sitting is, in their

Lordships' judgment, reasonably necessary  for  the

proper exercise of the functions of any Legislative

Assembly of this kind. And it may well be that  the

same   doctrine   of  reasonable  necessity   would

authorise a suspension until submission of  apology

by   the   offending  Member  which,  if  he   were

refractory, might cause it to be prolonged, not  by

the  arbitrary discretion of the Assembly,  but  by

his own wilful default for some further time.'



<br><br>At  the  very  least,  therefore,  the  Legislative

Assembly has the power, even if it is regarded as a

colonial legislature by the Member for Hong Lim, to

take  such measures as are necessary to secure  its

existence  and the proper exercise of the functions

which  it  is intended to execute. In addition,  we

have  the express power contained in Standing Order

56   paragraph  (5).  This  gives  the  Legislative

Assembly power to proceed against any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



Member according to any resolution of the Assembly.

The  procedure for this is not expressly laid down,

but  for  this, reliance can be placed on  Standing

Order 103 paragraph (2), which provides, in effect,

that in any matter for which the Standing Orders do

not  provide, the practice of the House of  Commons

shall be followed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 54 (1) of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order in Council, 1958, in so far as it deals with

motions, provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Order and of

the Standing Orders of the Assembly, any Member may

... propose any motion for debate in ... Assembly,

and  the  same  shall be debated  and  disposed  of

according to the Standing Orders of the Assembly.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limitations on the powers of the Assembly are

expressly  laid down in the Order in  Council,  for

example,  in  section 54 (2) (b),  which  says,  in

effect,  that  the Assembly shall not proceed  upon

any  motion  the effect of which is  to  impose  or

increase any tax, or impose or increase any  charge

on   the  revenues  of  Singapore  except  on   the

recommendation   of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan   Negara

signified by a Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, prima facie, the Assembly has power to deal

with  any  motion, and anyone who asserts that  the

Assembly has no such power must show that there  is

some  statutory provision in the Order  in  Council

which restricts the powers of the Assembly. Even if

we  are unable to find any express enactment giving

us  power  to  deal  with this motion,  this  House

should, in my opinion, be bold and generous  enough

to claim and assert the power. For to say that this

Assembly  has no power to deal with this motion  is

tantamount to asserting that this House  is  unable

to   regulate  the  orderly  conduct  of  its   own

business. This Assembly will then cease  to  be  an

effective  body, and instead of decorum and  order,

we  will  have  licensed misconduct and  chaos.  If

anyone  should assert that this House has no  power

to  adopt  this  motion, let him go to  some  other

tribunal  and  say that the Assembly  has  no  such

power.  This House at least should not  accept  the

argument  that it has no such power. Nay,  even  if

some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



other tribunal were to assert that the House has no

such  power,  we should not meekly  accept  such  a

ruling, but should assert the legislative supremacy

of this House to give itself such power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a surrender of our powers, rights and

privileges for us to say that such a motion  as  is

proposed  cannot  be  moved  and  adopted  by  this

Assembly.  Whilst Standing Order 56  paragraph  (5)

gives   the  Assembly  power  to  take  proceedings

against  any Member by resolution, it does not  set

out  the  practice  and  procedure,  and  we  have,

therefore,  to go for guidance to the practice  and

procedure of the House of Commons. The practice  in

England,  as  I  have stated earlier,  is,  if  the

matter of the complaint is a charge alleged  to  be

made  by  one Member against another,  to  give  an

opportunity to the Member to establish the  charge,

that is, if he wishes to do so; or to withdraw  the

charge.  Where  the  Member has refused  either  to

withdraw  the  charge  or to substantiate  it,  the

House  may  adjudge  him  guilty  of  a  breach  of

privilege and deal with him accordingly. Where  the

Member  accused  has  made a  proper  apology,  the

motion  may  be  withdrawn,  or  the  House,  while

condemning  the  Member's conduct as  a  breach  of

privilege,  may resolve that it would  not  proceed

further in the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have given only a precis of

the  opinion of the State Advocate-General on  this

matter. In due course, a full written opinion  will

be  forwarded  to  you  and  all  Members  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Koh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> When can we expect that opinion of the

State Advocate-General?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> This written opinion will be

delivered to Mr Speaker probably between ten  days

and a fortnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I was under the misapprehension that we would proceed to my motion, and I have certain

other  matters to deal with. But if you will permit

me to continue. I shall do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I see it, the issue at the moment

before  the House is whether or not this House  has

power  to  entertain the motion. That is  the  only

issue.  Has  this  House  power  to  entertain  the

motion,  in view of what has been said by,  I  take

it, the legal luminaries of Singapore? If the House

is  satisfied  that it has power to  entertain  the

motion,  then, of course, the motion proceeds,  and

what course that motion takes is a different matter

entirely. We now have to decide whether or  not  we

could continue with the motion which has been filed

by the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of order, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order. Yes. Mr Ong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Can I ask that we adjourn this

sitting  until we have full details of the  opinion

of  the  State  Advocate-General to enable  a  more

detailed debate on the subject?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is not a point of

order.  From  the suggestion which the  Member  for

Hong  Lim is making, it seems to me that the issues

have,  in fact, been somewhat confused. We are  now

debating the motion whether or not the Speaker  was

correct  in  admitting this motion as a motion.  In

other  words,  the Speaker is of the  opinion  that

this  House  has  power  to entertain  the  motion.

Whether  this  House has power  to  condemn  or  to

suspend in the circumstances indicated, that  is  a

separate  issue.  It seems to me  that  the  issues

have,  in  fact,  been confused. I  would  like  to

dispose of the first issue, which is whether or not

this  House has power to entertain the motion.  And

if  the  House  is satisfied that it has  power  to

entertain  the motion as such, then we go  back  to

the  Deputy Prime Minister's motion. The first part

has  already been proposed to the House. The  first

part suggests that the House condemns. As I see it,

the Member for Hong Lim says the House has no power

to  condemn, and the Leader of the House  maintains

that  the House has power to condemn. That  is  the

issue which perhaps would be raised When we come to

the first part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



of   the   motion  of  the  Leader  of  the  House.

Similarly, the same issue might be raised  when  we

come  to  the second part of the motion. The  issue

would  be - Has the House power to suspend? The first

thing  to  dispose  of, I think,  to  put  it  very

shortly,  is this - Has the House power to entertain

the motion filed by the Deputy Prime Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order or a point of

explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Point of order. Mr Speaker, Sir, will I

be  in order now to move an amendment to the motion

of the Member for Hong Lim?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What are the terms of the motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> What I have in mind is this - That the

ruling  of the Speaker admitting the motion of  the

Deputy  Prime Minister in regard to the Member  for

Hong Lim be - and this is my amendment, Mr Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`referred to Sir Ivor Jennings or other leading

counsel on constitutional law for an opinion'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will I be in order to make that amendment now?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have the terms of the

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> The words "rescinded"-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I have the amendment in writing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will have to decide whether or not

this suggested amendment is, to quote the words  of

Standing  Order 34, an amendment which is  relevant

to the motion before the House; and beyond that,  I

must  also  decide whether the amendment is  within

the  scope of the original motion. This is a matter

of some little difficulty, and I propose to suspend

for  an hour to give Members time to have their tea

and   perhaps   to  discuss  this  matter   amongst

themselves. I will take this Chair again  at

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question,

"That  the  ruling  of  the Speaker  admitting  the

motion  of  the Deputy Prime Minister in regard  to

the  Member for Hong Lim be rescinded and that this

Assembly  has  no  jurisdiction to  deal  with  the

matters raised therein."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before the Assembly rose, I intimated

that it was perhaps an appropriate time for tea and

that  during  the  interval I  would  consider  the

desire  expressed by the Member for  Joo  Chiat  to

move  an amendment to the motion before the  House.

The  Member  for  Joo Chiat has intimated  that  he

desires  to move an amendment which seeks to  leave

out  the  words from "be" to the end and  there  to

insert  "referred  to Sir Ivor  Jennings  or  other

leading  counsel  on  constitutional  law  for   an

opinion".  So  that if accepted the amended  motion

would read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the ruling of the Speaker admitting the

motion  of  the Deputy Prime Minister in regard  to

the  Member  for Hong Lim be referred to  Sir  Ivor

Jennings or other leading counsel on constitutional

law for an opinion.'



<br><br>An amendment to be admitted must be relevant to the

motion  which  seeks to amend and must  not  import

anything outside the scope of the motion,  that  is

to  say, it must have reference to the substance of

the  motion  itself and have the effect  rather  of

restricting   the  field  of  debate  which   would

otherwise  be open on the question on  the  motion.

The  motion invites the House to rescind the ruling

of the Speaker and to say that this Assembly has no

jurisdiction  to  deal  with certain  matters.  The

amendment invites the House to seek expert  opinion

on  the  ruling  of the Speaker. To  my  mind,  the

amendment  poses an entirely different proposition.

It  is outside the scope and confines of the motion

itself and is therefore inadmissible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joe Chiat had the Floor. Does he

wish to address the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you have made the issue

now very clear and, as I understand it, it is this,

whether your ruling is correct or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has addressed you very lengthily. If I am correct, the two basic

principles propounded by him are (i) that the power

of  this House is unrestricted, except those powers

restricted   by   any  Ordinance  or   rules   made

thereunder.  I repeat, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that  the

powers  of this House are unrestricted unless - if  I

am  wrong,  I  hope the Deputy Prime Minister  will

explain - as   I  say,  as  I  understand   it,   his

contention on law is that unless the powers of this

House  are restricted by any Ordinance or any rules

or  regulations made thereunder, then those  powers

are unrestricted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I did endeavour to channel

the  debate to the course I thought was proper, and

I indicated that, in my view, the motion we are now

debating is merely a motion to say whether  or  not

the  House has power to entertain the motion as  it

stands.  That is the issue. And the other issue  is

whether  or  not the House has power to condemn  or

suspend. Those are the issues which perhaps  really

arise  on  the motion by the Deputy Prime Minister.

What  we are now concerned with is whether  or  not

the  Speaker was right in admitting the  motion  so

that the House would be able to entertain it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do understand you,

but  may  I  explain  that you are  also  bound  by

certain laws? I say this with respect. Sir. And  it

is the Deputy Prime Minister's contention that your

powers  also are unrestricted unless restricted  by

some written law or rules or regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Assembly is not a

sovereign Assembly, as the Member for Hong Lim  has

said.  The  British Parliament is in  a  completely

different  position to our Assembly.  Our  Assembly

was   brought  into  existence  by  virtue  of  the

Singapore  (Constitution) Order in  Council-Part  V

which   is   headed  "Constitution  of  Legislative

Assembly",  at page 19. The sections  involved  are

sections 34 to 46.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said just now and with

humility  I  say  that this has  reference  to  the

matter  under  discussion  now.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister says



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



that  unless  you  have something  restricting  the

powers,  then  the  powers are unlimited.  That  is

contrary to all the rules of interpretation that we

are used to in our courts of law. The principles of

interpretation are dealt with very ably by  Maxwell

in  The  Interpretation of Statutes. I  have  here,

Sir, the 10th Edition (1953) of Maxwell and on page

12 he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is but, a corollary to the general principle

of literal construction that nothing is to be added

to  or to be taken from a statute unless there  are

similar  adequate grounds to justify the  inference

that  the  legislature intended something which  it

omitted to express.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a wrong thing to read into an Act of

Parliament  words which are not there  and  in  the

absence  of clear necessity it is a wrong thing  to

do.'



<br><br>That  was  said, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the  case  of

Thompson v. Gould, 1910, Appeal Cases 409 and 420.



<br><br>Also:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not entitled to read words into an Act of

Parliament  unless clear reason for  it  is  to  be

found within the four corners of the Act itself.'



<br><br>Those  words  were  spoken by  Lord  Lorburn,  Lord

Chancellor, in the case of Vickers v. Evans, a 1910

case reported in Appeal Case 444.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Words plainly should not be added by implication

into  a statute unless it is necessary to do so  to

give   the  language  sense  and  meaning  in   its

context.'



<br><br>If  I  read that paragraph correctly, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  it means that we cannot give more powers than

the  powers given by a statute. To bring it  closer

to  the  subject under discussion, we have  here  a

statute,  the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order  in

Council, 1958, and in particular sections 34 to  46

thereof.  We  must act within the four  corners  of

this  Order  in Council. We cannot import  into  it

powers  which are not given by it. And therefore  I

say    it   would   be   inverting   the   ordinary

interpretation of statutes to adopt the  contention

of the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister. Sir, if I am

correct  in  that contention, then your powers  are

given by section 35 of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order in Council which reads as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Subject to the provisions of section 111 of

this Order, when the Assembly first meets after any

general  election  and before it  proceeds  to  the

despatch  of any other business, it shall  elect  a

person  to be Speaker, and, whenever the office  of

Speaker  is  vacant otherwise than by reason  of  a

dissolution of the Assembly, shall not transact any

business  other than election of a person  to  fill

that office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Speaker may be elected, in such manner as

the Assembly may from time to time decide...'.



<br><br>That concerns, Sir, the election of the speaker. It

goes  on  to section 36 (Remuneration of  Speaker),

section 37 (appointment of Deputy Speaker) and then

to  section  38  the marginal note of  which  reads

"Performance of functions of Speaker":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Order, the

functions conferred by this Order upon the  Speaker

shall, if there is no person holding the office of

Speaker  or if the Speaker is absent from Singapore.'.



<br><br>It  does  not  define your powers at all.  Now  this

(Constitution) Order in Council is the fountain  of

the  powers  of this Assembly, and if it  does  not

give any powers to you, then where do we find those

powers,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir?  We  have,  under  the

(Constitution) Order in Council, Part VI, which  is

headed  "Powers  and Procedure of  the  Legislative

Assembly",  section 48 (1) which  has  been  quoted

many  times  today, and which gives power  to  this

Assembly to make, amend and revoke Standing  Orders

for  the regulation and orderly conduct of its  own

proceedings and the despatch of business. Now  here

is  a law which gives the subject matter upon which

our  Standing Orders must be based, and that is the

regulation and orderly conduct - I emphasise the word

"conduct",  Mr Speaker, Sir - of its own proceedings

and  the  despatch of business. That is  the

over-riding  section which our Standing Orders must  not

be  ultra vires. Now to say that Standing Order 56,

paragraph  (5)  gives  extensive  powers  to   this

Assembly  would  contravene section 41,  subsection

(1)  of  the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order   in

Council.  And,  therefore, we  must  take  it  that

paragraph (5) of Standing Order 56 deals only  with

subjects  given within that Standing Order.  It  is

not a comprehensive omnibus type of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have, Sir, what is known as the privileges

Ordinance. There again, as the Member for Hong  Lim

has  brought  to your attention, the  offences  for

which a Member may be suspended are defined, and in

the  section defining the matter - section 20 of  the

Ordinance - there is no mention at all of the subject

matter  of  the  motion. Under those circumstances,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, would it be  correct  for  this

Assembly to discuss something for which it has  not

been  given  power in any written law or regulation

made   thereunder?  I  think  the  answer  to  that

question  is  the answer to the motion  before  the

House today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I cannot quote any written law which says

that  the Speaker cannot make a motion in the terms

that are before the House today; nor can the Deputy

Prime  Minister quote any section which  says  that

you  can  do  it.  But I do quote  Maxwell  on  the

interpretation of statutes which says  that  unless

the  written law itself gives a power,  you  cannot

import  into  the Ordinance anything which  is  not

within  the four corners of the Ordinance. That  is

as  far  as  I can carry the legal aspects  of  the

motion before the House now, Sir.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Deputy Prime Minister, in reply to the  Member

for  Hong  Lim, informed the House that the  motion

which  he  had placed before the House was  brought

under  Standing Order 56, paragraph  (5).  Standing

Order  56  prescribes the order in debate and  sets

out  what  the  Speaker can do,  whereupon  certain

consequences then ensue. Now, paragraph (5) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Standing Order shall be taken to

deprive  the  Assembly of the power  of  proceeding

against  any Member according to any resolution  of

the Assembly.'



<br><br>The  Deputy Prime Minister says that he brings  his

motion  within the ambit of this paragraph of  this

Standing Order. And he says that this comes  within

the  phrase  "any resolution of the Assembly".  Mr

Speaker,  in coming to any conclusions as  to  what

exactly the phrase "according to any resolution  of

the  Assembly" could mean, I think one has to  look

at the House of Commons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



Standing Orders from which our Standing Orders  are

taken.  The  equivalent proviso  in  the  House  of

Commons Standing Orders reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Standing Order shall be taken to

deprive  the  House  of Commons  of  the  power  of

proceeding against any Member according to  ancient

usages.'



<br><br>The  operative words there, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  are

"ancient usages", and our operative words here  are

"according  to any resolution of the Assembly".  It

seems to me that the Deputy Prime Minister seeks to

equate "ancient usages" of the House of Commons  to

"any resolution of the Assembly". Mr Speaker, even

the  House of Commons is restricted as to  what  it

may  do  under paragraph (6) of Standing Order  22.

The  House  of  Commons  itself  cannot  go  beyond

"ancient  usages";  in other words,  the  House  of

Commons  has not got an unbridled licence to  bring

in  any  resolution it may like. The power  of  the

House  of Commons to bring such a resolution  under

paragraph (6) is a restrictive one; not an expanded

one  but a restrictive one, and it restricts itself

to  the  ancient usages which the House of  Commons

enjoys.  So therefore that is a restrictive  clause

imposed  upon the House of Commons, which does  not

enable it to go outside ancient usages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by this phrase "according to any resolution

of  the Assembly", can we give ourselves very  much

wider  powers  than  the House  of  Commons  itself

enjoys?  I submit, with respect, that is  not  what

the  Deputy  Prime Minister means. If that  is  not

what  he  means,  then there must be  some  meaning

given  to  this phrase "according to any resolution

of  the  Assembly".  I submit,  Mr  Speaker,  with

respect, that before one can find out exactly  what

this  Assembly can bring within the scope  of  this

paragraph,  one  has to resolve in one's  own  mind

what the powers of the Assembly are. Therefore,  it

becomes   necessary  to  look  at   the   Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958. We  go  back

to  Part  VI of the Constitution, on page  25,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  - "Powers  and  Procedure   of   the

Legislative Assembly". Section 47 says:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Order, it shall

be  lawful for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, with the

advice  and consent of the Assembly, to  make  laws

for  the  peace,  order  and  good  government   of

Singapore.'



<br><br>So  it  would appear that this Legislative Assembly

does  not  make  laws;  it is the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  who makes laws with the advice and  consent

of  this  Assembly. That is the  first  thing.  The

second thing is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Order, the

Assembly  may  from time to time  make,  amend  and

revoke  Standing  Orders  for  the  regulation  and

orderly  conduct  of  its own proceedings  and  the

despatch of business.'



<br><br>In  the section, Mr Speaker, it does not say  "the

Assembly  may  from time to time  make,  amend  and

revoke  Standing Orders" on anything it  likes.  It

puts  a check on the powers of the Assembly  in  so

for  as  Standing Orders are concerned. It  further

goes on to say in that subsection that the Standing

Orders  then extant shall be applicable until  such

time  as  they are adapted or altered. That  really

does  not  matter, but it is section  48  (1)  that

makes  the  difference  - "for  the  regulation  and

orderly  conduct  of  its own proceedings  and  the

despatch  of  business." I am going to  suggest  to

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that this only  gives  the

Assembly  power to make regulations in  so  far  as

proceedings  and  behaviour within these  precincts

are concerned. Under this particular subsection  of

the  Constitution,  it does not give  the  Assembly

power  to  go  beyond  the House,  or  to  regulate

conduct and matters beyond the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, section 59 of the Constitution, on page 27, Mr Speaker, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be lawful, by laws enacted under this

Order,  to  determine and regulate the  privileges,

immunities  and  powers of the  Assembly  and  its

Members;  but  no  such privileges,  immunities  or

powers shall exceed those of the Commons' House  of

Parliament in the United Kingdom or of the  Members

thereof.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I make the point - and it seems to be borne out

by  the  Constitution - that in so  far  as  Standing

Orders  are concerned, it shall confine  itself  to

"the  regulation  and orderly conduct  of  its  own

proceedings and the despatch of business".  And  in

so far as the "ancient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



usages"  are  concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir  - now  we

come  back  to  the phrase "ancient usages  of  the

House  of Commons" - they are nothing but the  powers

and  privileges  of the House of  Commons.  So  the

Order in Council says this: if you want to regulate

your  own proceedings within the Chamber,  you  may

frame  Standing Orders to that intent and  purpose;

but  if  you  want  to  give  yourself  powers  and

privileges, you shall not give yourself powers  and

privileges beyond those now enjoyed by the House of

Commons, but you shall do it by statute:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It shall be lawful, by laws enacted under this

Order'.



<br><br>I  take  it  that "laws enacted under this  Order"

merely means a statute or an Ordinance to determine

and  regulate the privileges, immunities and powers

of the Assembly. So that before one determines what

this  House  can  do  or cannot  do,  what  it  can

entertain or cannot entertain, one has to  look  at

section  48 and section 59 of the Order in  Council

before  one  can  come  to  what  the  powers   and

privileges are and what this Assembly can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that in so far as this particular motion is

concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am suggesting to you

that the three relevant documents we need look into

are: first of all, the Constitution; secondly,  the

Standing   Orders;  and  thirdly,  the  Legislative

Assembly  (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance,  1955.

So  these  are  the three sources from  which  this

Assembly  derives whatever powers or privileges  it

may have or whatever procedure it is to follow.  So

before one can determine, Mr Speaker, Sir, whether

your ruling is a correct ruling or not, I think one

has to determine exactly whether the motion put  in

by  the  Deputy  Prime Minister is something  which

this House can entertain either under the Order  in

Council  or  the Standing Orders or the Legislative

Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Order in Council, Mr Speaker, Sir, merely

sets out what this Assembly can give itself in  the

way  of  powers  in general terms. But  what  those

powers are, how they are to be used,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



and  what  they  are  to be is  a  matter  for  the

Assembly itself to determine, either in the form of

Standing Orders or in the form of an Ordinance.  In

so  far  as the Standing Orders are concerned,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Standing Order  that  could  be

applicable to this is Standing Order 56,  paragraph

(5),  and  the Deputy Prime Minister also suggested

that  Standing Order 46 paragraph (10) might apply.

He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>By  that  I take it that the Deputy Prime  Minister

intended to suggest that as the Member for Hong Lim

had  touched  upon  the  personal  conduct  of  two

Members  in  this  Assembly,  therefore,   it   was

relevant  to this motion which he moved.  But  with

due  respect to him, I would say that whatever  the

Member for Hong Lim might have said, he did not say

it  in connection with the personal conduct of  any

Member  of this House. Whatever he did say  was  in

connection  with  the  public  conduct  of  certain

Members  of  this  House who  were  holding  public

office.  Therefore, this particular  section,  with

due  respect, cannot be brought into  play  in  the

consideration  of  whether or  not  the  motion  as

framed by the Deputy Prime Minister is admissible.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Let me try to elucidate that

point,   because   it   rather   puzzles   me.   My

understanding  of  that part of  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister's speech which touched on that is that his

motion  was akin to a motion with reference to  the

personal conduct of a Member of the Assembly,  that

is,  the  personal conduct of the Member  for  Hong

Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir, and that of the

Deputy  Prime Minister. If that was the  contention

of the Deputy Prime Minister, then might I say that

that  is  not  what is intended to  be  covered  by

section  46 (10) of the Standing Orders? Sir,  `The

personal  conduct of Members of the Assembly  shall

not  be  referred to except upon  a  substantive

motion  moved for that purpose', I take  it,  means

that  if  the personal conduct of a Member  outside

this House brings dis-respect to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



this  House,  then a substantive  motion  could  be

moved. But the personal conduct here complained of,

in respect of which the Deputy Prime Minister seeks

to  suggest  that this motion could be brought,  is

conduct  in  the  Assembly in  the  course  of  his

duties,  and it has nothing to do with his personal

life.   Therefore,   I  would  submit   that   that

particular  proposition put forward by  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister is not relevant to  the  issue  now

before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would admit that if this House had all the

powers and privileges of the House of Commons, then

this  motion is admissible. I do not contest  that.

But  what I am suggesting to the House is this.  In

the  circumstances  in which the  House  now  finds

itself,  with  the  Order  in  Council,  with   the

Standing  Orders as they are now extant,  and  with

the  Legislative  Assembly (Powers and  Privileges)

Ordinance  as it is now extant, this House  has  no

power to entertain this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion which the Deputy

Prime Minister has introduced in this House is,  in

fact,  an attempt to punish a Member for the  abuse

of  privilege,  contempt of the  House,  and  as  a

result  of  which  certain  punishments  ensue.  In

determining those things, Mr Speaker, Sir, one has

to find out what is the nature of a contempt of the

House. Now-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to be intervening.

But  I  think  Members of the Assembly  would  like

elucidation of this particular point. Is the Member

for  Farrer  Park  not confusing  the  meanings  of

"resolution" and "motion"? The "resolution" against

the  Member,  which is the word used in  paragraph

(5)  of  Standing  Order 56,  as  distinct  from  a

motion.  A  resolution is the result of  a  motion.

Therefore, the question which really arises on this

motion  by the Member for Hong Lim is - can a  motion

seeking   a  resolution  be  entertained   in   the

Assembly?  Is not the Assembly then at  liberty  to

discuss  the  motion,  and thereafter  dismiss  the

motion if it is satisfied that a resolution on that

motion  cannot be passed? Is that not the issue  on

this particular motion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is the hair

which  you, with due respect, are splitting!  If  a

motion  which is brought to the House is  a  motion

until such time as the House has come to a decision

on  it,  when it then becomes a resolution, then  I

admit  that  there is a difference. If a resolution

of  the House is something which the House has made

its determination on, then I agree that there is  a

distinction   between   the   word   "motion"   and

"resolution".  As I have always felt,  the  way  in

which the Deputy Prime Minister has sought to bring

this  motion  in  two  parts has  placed  me  in  a

difficulty  in arguing this case, or  presenting  a

case.  If  the  point of the motion  is  merely  to

discuss  it, without reaching a conclusion, perhaps

the  House can debate it. But if the purpose of the

motion is in order that the House might come  to  a

resolution to punish the Member for Hong Lim for  a

breach,  then I say this House is not competent  to

come  to  a resolution on it. If, Mr Speaker,  you

are  saying that a motion can be introduced  merely

to  discuss the pros and cons of it, without coming

to any resolution on it, in the sense of condemning

or  taking positive action, then perhaps it is  all

right. But if the motion is to go further, to  seek

a  remedy  for what the motion claims  are  wrongs,

then I am saying that the remedy is not there, and,

therefore,  the  motion  cannot  be  brought  to  a

resolution.  If  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  will

concede me that, I will stop talking.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is the Member for Farrer Park

contending that the motion, as a motion, cannot  be

discussed if it seeks a resolution which  is  ultra

vires?  Or is it not the position that the  motion,

as  a motion, can be discussed, and if the Assembly

is  satisfied that the resolution sought  is  ultra

vires,  it  will just dismiss that  motion  out  of

hand? The debate must-



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, here again my difficulty is this:

if  there had been two motions before the House - the

first motion in respect of the first part, and  the

second motion in respect of the second part - I would

have conceded that the first motion could have been

introduced and discussed. But the motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



is  so  framed  that the resolution  on  the  first

motion   precedes  the  resolution  on  the  second

motion. That is my difficulty in this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have solved that difficulty,

because  I have made it quite clear that I  am  now

treating  the  motion as two distinct motions.  The

first  one  is  whether or not  the  Assembly  will

condemn   the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  for  certain

conduct,  and, thereafter, depending on the  result

of  that  motion,  the House will then  proceed  to

consider  the second motion. It is in two  distinct

parts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The question whether this House can

condemn  the  Member for Hong  Lim  in  respect  of

certain conduct in this House, may I put it to  the

House, is not admissible. Let me get down to  grips

with that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Standing Order 56 paragraph (1) sets out the

circumstances in which you yourself,  Mr  Speaker,

name   the  person,  and  then  a  Minister  or   a

Parliamentary Secretary moves a motion, and that is

put  to the House without debate and the suspension

then  takes  place. That is not the  case  in  this

particular  matter. Now the Deputy  Prime  Minister

seeks to bring it under paragraph (5). Therefore we

have to find out what are the motions which can  be

introduced  under paragraph (5). The motions  which

can be introduced under paragraph (5) would depend,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, on the Constitution firstly, and

on the Legislative Assembly (Powers and Privileges)

Ordinance,  1955. Now section 20 of the Legislative

Assembly  (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance,  1955,

sets   out  the  circumstances  in  which   certain

proceedings  could be taken. Perhaps I  had  better

read out the whole of that section, Mr Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`20. -(1) Any member of the Assembly who



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) being a member of a committee of the

Assembly, publishes to any person not being a

member  of such committee any evidence  taken

by  the committee before it has been reported

to the Assembly; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) assaults or obstructs a member of the

Assembly  within the Chamber or precincts  of

the Assembly; or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) assaults or obstructs any officer of the

Assembly while in the execution of his  duty;

or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) is convicted of any offence under this

Ordinance,



<br><br>shall be guilty of contempt of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Where any member is guilty of contempt of the

Assembly, the Assembly may, by resolution reprimand

such member or suspend him from the service of  the

Assembly for such period as it may determine.'



<br><br>My  point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that paragraph  (5)

of  Standing Order 56 relates itself to section 20,

subsection  (2) of the Ordinance. That  could  then

make  sense, Mr Speaker, Sir, because in the House

of Commons it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Standing Order shall be taken to

deprive  the  House  of  the  power  of  proceeding

against any Member according to ancient usages.'



<br><br>Now our Standing Order reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... according to any resolution of the

Assembly.'



<br><br>This  paragraph (5) had to be put into the Standing

Orders  in  order  to  enable a  resolution  to  be

brought in to bring in misconduct within the  terms

of  section 20. Section 20, Mr Speaker, Sir, deals

with  two types of offences, if I may put  it  that

way. The first type of offences, set out in section

20  (1) (a), 20 (1) (b), 20 (1) (c), could refer to

Members  of  the Assembly; whereas section  20  (1)

(d),  "is  convicted  of  any  offence  under  this

Ordinance,  shall  be guilty  of  contempt  of  the

Assembly."  refers to persons outside the  Assembly

in  all  cases. There is a further section  in  the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance - section 22 - Mr Speaker, which says this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) A member shall not in or before the Assembly

or any committee take part in the discussion of any

matter  in which he has a direct pecuniary interest

without disclosing the extent of that interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Any member who acts in contravention of this

section may be adjudged guilty of contempt  by  the

Assembly  and  shall be liable  to  the  penalties

provided  in section 20 of this Ordinance for  such

contempt.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that section 22, Mr Speaker, Sir, and section

20  (1) (a) , section 20 (1) (b), and section 20 (1)

(c)  provide cases of Assemblymen being brought  up

before  the House for discipline. If paragraph  (5)

of  Standing  Order 56 were not there,  then  I  am

suggesting to you, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  Sir, that such disciplinary action  could

not  have  been taken. It is because of  that  that

paragraph  (5) is there, and it is not intended  to

serve  any purpose beyond the purposes set  out  in

this Ordinance. That is my contention. If the terms

of the motion by the Deputy Prime Minister could be

brought  to  bear on matters which are  within  the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance,  then I would concede to him  that  this

motion is in order. Otherwise, Mr Speaker, Sir, it

cannot be moved. Maybe there is a hiatus. If  there

is  a  hiatus,  it is up to us to resolve  it.  But

looking  at  the  three  documents,  I  think  this

Assembly is not competent to say that even if there

is  a  hiatus, we can still bring up  a  motion  in

spite  of that hiatus. I think, to that extent,  we

are a restricted body. The powers must be expressly

given  to us, and as they have been expressly given

to  us  in  the  statute and  in  Orders,  we  must

therefore confine ourselves within the four corners

of the powers so given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the powers given to the Assembly with regard

to  powers  and privileges are restricted.  In  the

Courts  Ordinance here, the power of the courts  to

punish  for  contempt  is expressly  given  by  the

section in the Courts Ordinance which says: that in

so  far as punishing for contempt of court for  the

High Court is concerned, it shall be equivalent  to

the powers enjoyed by the High Courts in England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the High Court here, in so far as the

punishing  for contempt of court is concerned,  has

an  equivalent jurisdiction as the High  Courts  in

the United Kingdom. But in so far as this aspect of

the  powers  and  privileges  of  the  Assembly  is

concerned, we do not enjoy the same privileges  and

the  same powers that the United Kingdom Parliament

has, Mr Speaker, Sir, because our powers have been

restricted  under  the various relevant  documents.

Because  of  that, I am now saying that the  Deputy

Prime  Minister was wrong when he suggested to  the

House  that this Standing Order gave him the  power

to  move this motion. I am suggesting to him and to

you, Mr Speaker, Sir, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



this paragraph of Standing Order 56 does not enable

the  Assembly  to  entertain  any  motion  of  this

nature.  It  only relates to matters in respect  of

which  this Assembly has express powers. The Member

for Hong Lim, Mr Speaker, Sir, gave it a much more

restricted meaning. I am not saying he is right  or

wrong. He may well be right. But I am saying  this:

the  most  I  am prepared to concede is  that  what

anybody  can  bring  under this  paragraph  (5)  is

anything which the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, prescribes.  Supposing

paragraph (5) were not there, Mr Speaker. Sir,  it

would  not  be  possible to move a  resolution  to

suspend a Member in respect of matters set  out  in

section  20 of the Powers and Privileges Ordinance,

1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 48 of the Singapore Constitution says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... for the regulation and orderly conduct of

its own proceedings and the despatch of business.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, powers to make those regulations have been

given  to  us, and if this Assembly has  not  given

itself  sufficient  powers under  this  section  to

regulate  its own business and its own proceedings,

and  if it finds that there are deficiencies in the

Standing  Order  which  is bringing  about  certain

difficulties  and  troubles,  then  I   think   the

solution  is to amend the Standing Orders to  bring

certain  behaviour within the ambit of the Standing

Orders.  If  the Standing Orders are  deficient,  I

think  it  is not competent for this House  to  say

that  because  the Standing Orders  are  deficient,

therefore  it has inherent authority to  punish  in

spite  of that deficiency. That would not be right,

if  I  may  suggest. So my contention briefly,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is that, reading the three documents

together,   namely,  the  Order  in  Council,   the

Standing   Orders  and  the  Legislative   Assembly

(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, it appears

to  me  that the subject matter of the motion which

the  Deputy  Prime Minister has introduced  is  not

covered  by  these three documents,  and  therefore

this motion is not admissible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is another legal luminary who

has been very silent. I wonder whether he will give

us the benefit of his views?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> If you want

me,  Mr Speaker, to assist you in any way  in  all

these legal matters, I am willing to do so. But  as

the  Deputy Prime Minister has indicated, I do  not

really  wish to participate in the debate as  such.

But  if  you feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that I  should

make   some  contribution  to  clarify  the   legal

position, I will be happy to do so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it has been made very clear

that  neither  the Prime Minister nor the  Minister

for  Labour and Law will partake in the  debate  on

the  substance  of the motion moved by  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister.  But this motion  which  has  been

moved  by the Member for Hong Lim, I think, affects

the  House  as  a  whole, and there  is,  in  fact,

academic  interest in it. So far  there  have  been

conflicting  opinions,  and  if  there  is  another

opinion  which  could be added to  the  conflicting

opinions,  perhaps the House will be a little  more

"confused" and then decide on other courses  to  be

taken.



<br><br>6.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I thought

that,  by speaking, I would add to the "confusion",

I  would certainly restrain myself from undertaking

such  a  hazardous  task. However,  may  I  try  to

restate  the problem as I see it? We are concerned

at  this moment with a resolution by the Member for

Hong  Lim  which,  in effect, says  that  you,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, have wrongly ruled. That is  all  we

are  concerned  with - that the ruling  you  make  in

allowing  the motion to be on the Order  Paper  and

then  allowing the Deputy Prime Minister, as Leader

of  the House, to move the first part of the motion

was  out  of  order. That is all we  are  concerned

with.  I  beg  to  submit that  the  arguments  put

forward  by  the  Member for Farrer  Park  are  not

relevant to that part of the problem with which  we

are  confronted.  His arguments would  be  relevant

when  the  question whether or not  the  House  has

powers to punish arises.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can I just restate the three

relevant  provisions,  and restate  them  in  their

order  of  importance? The most important  document

that  was referred to by the Member for Farrer Park

is  the  Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council.

That is a piece of legislation which over-rides the

Standing  Orders and the statutes of this Assembly.

That  is  the constitution upon which the whole  of

the  super-structure of the law is based. There are

certain  parts of that constitution  which  we  can

amend in this Legislature. That has been granted to

us  in  an  appendix  in the Order  in  Council  in

respect  of  certain matters. The  powers  of  this

Assembly  shall  be supreme. I would  suggest,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that in respect of all those sections

where the power is in this Assembly to amend,  then

to  that  extent  this  is a  completely  sovereign

Assembly. The first important section is section 54

(1). The first important rule of interpretation  is

that words shall be given their common and ordinary

meanings.  And it says, "Subject to the  provisions

of  this Order", that is, subject to the provisions

of  any  other section in this Order, "and  of  the

Standing  Orders of the Assembly" made under  this,

"any  Member may introduce any Bill or propose  any

motion  for debate in, or may present any  petition

to, the Assembly, and the same shall be debated and

disposed of according to the Standing Orders of the

Assembly." That I say is the complete and  absolute

answer  to  anyone who challenges your  ruling.  In

fact,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say that `had  you

ruled  otherwise,  then we would  have  drawn  your

attention, and any member of this House would  have

the  right to draw your attention, to this the most

important document - important in the sense  that  it

over-rides  any other document. It says there  "any

motion". This is a motion which is "any motion". It

goes on to say "it shall be debated". I do not want

to  do  what  on one famous occasion in this  House

legal  luminaries sought to do,  and  that  is  to

exhibit  their skill in argument on the intricacies

of  the  law.  You will recall that there  was  an

argument  that "shall" means "ought to". It  is  as

simple  as that. Unless there is any other document

as important in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



status as this which says to the contrary that  the

Assembly  can do nothing, then I say, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that  this is the beginning and  end  of  the

argument.  However, lest it be feared that  I  had

not  adequately  alerted my mind  to  the  argument

propounded by the Member for Farrer Park, may I  go

on to say this? His argument is as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That any motion where we are to censure a Member

in this Assembly, must mean a motion which complies

with S.O. 56 (5) of the Standing Orders; subsidiary

legislation,  which he then goes  on  to  enact  by

spelling  out "ancient usages" to mean the  Powers,

Privileges   and   Immunities  Ordinance   of   the

Legislative  Council, as it  then  was,  a  motion

within  the  terms of reference of that  Ordinance.

Sir,  there is not the slightest authority,  either

in  law  or logic, to support that proposition.  To

construe  the plain meaning of the word in  section

54  to  mean that, we are going against  the  first

principle  of the interpretation of any statute  or

any  document, that words shall mean what they  are

ordinarily supposed to mean. "any" there, means, in

my submission, "any" and "shall" means "it shall be

debated".



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> On a point of information, Mr Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Koh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> I hope the Hon. the Prime Minister will

not  forget that section 54 (1) of the Constitution

begins  with  "Subject to the  provisions  of  this

Order and of the Standing Orders".



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was aware

of  the opening words of that section, "Subject  to

the  provisions of this Order" - subject to any other

provision  in  this Order. What I  was  saying  the

Member  for  Farrer Park has not done is  to  show

that   there  is  any  provision  either   in   the

Constitution or in the Standing Orders which  says,

"You shall not move a motion to condemn a Member of

the  Assembly"  either by expressed  words  or  by

implication. I say



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



that  in  the absence of any such expressed  words,

either  in  the  Constitution or  in  the  Standing

Orders, you, Mr Speaker, Sir, are obliged to allow

this motion and let it be debated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I develop the other limb in

my  argument,  that in so far as this provision  is

concerned - section 54 (1) - it is in that part of  the

Schedule in the Constitution which is amendable and

repealable  by this Assembly. It is  in  the  Third

Schedule,  "Provisions of this Order which  may  be

amended  by the Legislative Assembly". I say  that

in so far as this provision is concerned, in so far

as  the  conduct of debate, procedure and  motions,

other  than the prohibition contained in subsection

(2)  or  in any other subsection in this  Order  or

Standing  Orders which prohibit, is concerned,  the

power  is absolute and cannot be questioned, in  my

submission, either in this Chamber - because we  are

our  own  judges - or in any other tribunal  in  this

country, because within this Constitution,  as  far

as   section  54  is  concerned,  the  Assembly  is

sovereign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me elaborate by taking the

point which was made by the Member for Farrer Park

in connection with the powers of punishment. May  I

first  preface my remarks by saying that I  do  not

believe  that  there  is a  more  odd  and  curious

situation  anywhere in any non-independent  country

where the people, or their representatives, do  not

claim  the right to do what they consider necessary

for  their  own good government. But here  in  this

Chamber,   as   representatives  of   the   people,

doubtless unwittingly, we have had the spectacle of

legal  luminaries and others who are  by  force  of

circumstances compelled to take an interest in  the

intricacies  of the law advocating that  we,  as  a

Chamber, should restrict our right. The fundamental

assumption upon which I suggest we proceed is  that

we  are a sovereign Assembly until somebody says to

the  contrary,  as far as those provisions  in  the

Constitution which are amendable are concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park says that if a motion

seeks  to do something which is not properly or  is

not  obviously within its competence, then not only

is the resolution ultra vires but the motion should

also  never be debated. Sir, there are two distinct

propositions,  and both of them, in my  submission,

are  spurious. The first proposition is that  if  a

matter  is  ultra  vires, in the  sense  that  this

Assembly  seeks to do something which, in fact,  it

cannot  do,  therefore  the Assembly  is  not  only

incapable  of doing it but also should be prevented

from   debating   it.  That  is,  in   short,   the

proposition advanced by the Member for Farrer Park.

Let  me  put this hypothetical case. There  is  one

thing,  Sir, which this Assembly definitely  cannot

do,  and that is to expel a Member of this Assembly

from his membership, which the House of Commons can

do. We cannot do so because this document, which we

cannot  amend  other than what we  are  allowed  to

amend in those sections of the Third Schedule,  has

laid  down  when  a  seat  shall  be  vacated,  and

expulsion  from the Assembly is not  one  of  those

circumstances. Therefore, if we attempted to  expel

a  Member,  I think a petition could be brought  to

the  Privy  Council to assert that he  is  still  a

Member   because  we  have  infringed  the  primary

document - the Constitution. Section 42 (2)  of  the

Constitution,   where  membership   is   concerned,

("Tenure of office Members.") reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The seat of a Member shall become vacant-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if he ceases to be a citizen of Singapore...;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if he enters into the employment of any

foreign power ...;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if he is appointed to or to act in any public

office ...;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if he is adjudged or otherwise declared

bankrupt ...'.



<br><br>But  nowhere does it say when he is expelled by the

Assembly.  But I say that even in respect  of  this

section,  we  can  give  ourselves  the  power   by

amending section 42 (2), because that is one of the

amendable sections in the Third Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us assume that we refuse to take the

necessary  legal preliminary step of  amending  the

Constitution and say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



"(x) When he had by resolution of the Assembly been

so  expelled", and we by resolution expel a Member,

is  it  seriously suggested that we cannot?  First,

you,  as  Speaker, cannot allow the debate to  take

place; and, second, that this Assembly cannot  pass

it  as a resolution. Where is the authority? It  is

one thing to attempt to do something which is ultra

vires. It is another thing to ask you, Mr Speaker,

to  say  that it cannot be done. Whether it can  or

cannot be done, Mr Speaker, Sir, as you have  very

wisely  pointed  out at the very beginning  of  the

preliminary  remarks before the  debate  began,  is

something which has to be tested and tried in  some

other  tribunal;  and  there  are  many  borderline

issues  upon which the rights of this Assembly  may

be  in  doubt. Is it suggested that in any of  this

hinterland  upon  which'  we  are  not  quite  sure

whether  the writ of the Assembly runs  or  not  we

should abrogate our powers? I suggest, Sir, that it

runs  to  the full extent of the strength  of  this

Assembly, and anybody who says it does not run must

prove  it.  Only  on that basis are  we  likely  to

discharge  our  responsibilities as representatives

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other argument, that it should not even be

debated  because  in so debating  it  we  may  lead

ourselves  from  a  motion into a  resolution,  and

therefore  end  up in a resolution  which  somebody

else  may challenge in some other tribunal as ultra

vires,  is, in my submission, non-sequitur.  Sorry,

"non-sequitur" means it does not follow, it has  no

connection  in  logic.  I beg  the  pardon  of  the

Members  of the Opposition. I would like to  avoid,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, so far as is  possible - I  think

hon.  Members  should - legal jargon, because  I  am

sure  the  proceedings  on  this  debate  will   be

followed  with considerable interest  not  only  in

this  country but in other parts of the world where

interest   in   the   theory   and   practice    of

parliamentary  democracy  still  survives.  But  to

carry out to its logical conclusion the proposition

of  the Member for Farrer Park - that if a mutter  is

ultra vires, therefore no resolution should ever be

allowed;  because  a debate may lead  to  an  ultra

vires resolution,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



therefore  a  debate should not be  allowed-then  I

say,  Mr Speaker, Sir, there would never have been

anybody  who  would have cause to complain  to  any

higher  judicial tribunal. Because, to begin  with,

all  you  need  have to do is to get an  injunction

against the Speaker and say, "Mr Speaker, you will

not  allow  that motion, because it  is  not  quite

certain  (1) whether the writ runs and the Assembly

has  the power to do those things; (2) whether  the

Assembly should be allowed to run the hazard  of  a

debate  which will land it with a resolution  which

is  ultra vires." Sir, in legal language, it really

means   this.  Where  is  the  authority  for   the

proposition that this Assembly, in the  conduct  of

its  own affairs, is confined by any other document

than  the  Standing  Orders and  the  Constitution?

There  are only two documents, I submit with  great

respect,  Sir,  which  bind this  Assembly  in  the

conduct  of  its business: the Constitution,  which

has its dos and don'ts on broad principles, and the

Standing  Orders, which say these are the rules  in

detail as to how things are to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to put the positive side of the case. Here is

the  Constitution  about which I  first  said  "Any

motion shall be debated." The detailed rules  under

Standing  Orders 46 (10) and 56 (5) dearly envisage

a  substantive  motion on the personal  conduct  of

Members  of this Assembly. Sir, Standing  Order  46

(10) says in the negative:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall  not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>Sir, I do not think one requires a great stretch of

the imagination to put it in the positive. This  is

a prohibition. It says that you shall not do so and

so unless so and so. In other words, if you want to

touch  upon the personal conduct of Members, either

in  praise  or  in denunciation, you  will  move  a

substantive motion. That is what it means. Standing

Order  46 (10) says - not what the Member for  Farrer

Park   understood  the  Leader  of  the  House   to

mean - that  because  my personal  conduct  has  been

referred to, therefore I am entitled to attack  the

person who had attacked me.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



It  has nothing to do with that proposition.  I  am

spelling  from  Standing Order 46  (10)  the  clear

inference - the  only  logical  inference - that   the

personal  conduct of Members of the  Assembly  can,

upon  a  substantive motion moved for that purpose,

be referred to. That, Mr Speaker, Sir, is what the

first part of the motion intends to do. Clearly and

beyond  any doubt, it is within Standing Orders  46

(10) and 56 (5).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second limb, I say again it comes within

section 54 (1) of the Constitution. Whether  it  is

ultra  vires  the Constitution or  not  is  another

matter to be determined in some other tribunal. But

for  the  reasons you have stated, the  unhappiness

and  uneasiness you feel as to the certainty of the

matter,  and  the greater confusion that  has  been

added  to it since the debate began. I think it  is

only right and proper - and perhaps desirable in  the

interest  not  only  of this Assembly  but  of  the

country  as  a whole - that we should have  time  to

consider all possible advice on the matter. But  on

one  thing  we  need no advice and should  need  no

advice,  and  that is how to run the  business  of

this   Assembly,  how  to  comport   ourselves   as

representatives of the people without the advice of

luminaries  like Sir Ivor Jennings or  other  legal

experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue that is raised by this motion is simply

this:  do  we seriously say to ourselves that  this

House cannot debate this motion? Whoever says  that

must   quote   against  section  54  (1)   of   the

Constitution    either   a   provision    in    the

Constitution, or a provision in the Standing  Order

which  says  explicitly, "You  shall  not  do  this

particular thing," as has been set out in  Standing

Order  46,  "You shall not use offensive, insulting

language,",  "You shall not do this,",  "You  shall

not  do that." But nowhere does it say, "You  shall

not  condemn the personal conduct of a Member."  In

fact, I think it is partly because of the sense  of

delicacy  of  the draftsman who first  drafted  the

particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



Standing Order 46 (10) that he had desired  to  put

it  in the negative; not to say, "We shall be happy

if  you  condemn  a Member" but  to  say,  "We  are

unhappy  that  you should condemn a Member,  unless

there is a substantive motion to that effect."  And

there  is  a  substantive motion. The  question  is

whether it is properly administered in this  House.

That  is all. And I say, the less we now say  about

the  other  things, the better it is,  because  the

issue  at the moment is this: is the Speaker  right

or  wrong  in  having allowed  this  motion  to  be

debated?  I  say  this:  if the  Speaker  had  done

anything  else,  he  would  have  contravened   the

Constitution and the Standing Orders made under the

Constitution.



<br><br>6.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

hesitate to enter into this debate after two  legal

minds  have given an exposition of whether  or  not

the  Constitution gives this Assembly the right  to

debate  the  motion  before  the  House.  But,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like, at the very outset,  to

say this: you have, in your announcement before the

motion  of  the  Deputy Prime Minister  was  moved,

stated  that the motion should be in two parts  and

you  have given us a certain line of debate that  I

submit,   Sir,  with  due  respect,  had  made   it

difficult  for  the Opposition to enter  into  this

debate  which, in the minds and the hearts  of  the

people outside, has nothing but a political motive.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have tried very carefully to

ask  hon. Members to treat this motion as a  motion

which  affects  the House as a whole,  without  any

reference  to politics or to political motives,  or

any  allegations  to that effect.  If  the  Speaker

allows  this debate to range over political issues,

then I am afraid the debate will go very, very  far

away  from the issue which is, in fact, an academic

issue  and which the House is called upon to decide

as an academic issue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I am afraid

you  have not listened me out. What I was going  to

say  was  that we on this side of the  House  think

that the right way to discuss this motion is as you

have ruled and that we do not give credence to what

the   people  outside  say,  although  we  consider

ourselves to be representatives of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have this difficulty now, Sir, in the light of

what the Prime Minister has said. He has said, "Let

us  go ahead with the first part of the motion." As

far  as the second part is concerned, there is some

doubt in his mind that it should-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not in my mind.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He has at least, Sir, considered

that there is a case that he could be wrong, and in

order - no, that-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I neither want to be right nor

wrong. All we want to make sure is that the correct

position  is placed before the House. I think  this

is  important, when we are on a plane which I  hope

is  above political issues, such as we are on,  and

on  which an important constitutional precedent may

be  set.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, by  our  conduct,  our

demeanour,  our  words uttered in  this  particular

motion, we are setting the tone and the pace in the

tradition of this particular Chamber. What  I  want

to  have  on  record is not that I am in  doubt  or

anybody  is  in  doubt. You have expressed  certain

doubts,  Sir,  in  your own wisdom.  We  have  been

advised by the State Advocate-General, who  is  the

correct  officer  within  the  Constitution  to  so

advise,  and  I say, let there be time to  consider

the State Advocate-General's opinion, and let there

be  time to seek other opinions if you so desire on

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



other   issues.   But  on  the  issue   before   us

now - whether we as a Chamber know or do not know how

to  comport ourselves in our own business - I say the

less time wasted the better.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought,

after that discourse on the interpretation of  law,

the  Prime Minister would have stood up on a  point

of order and given an explanation of something that

has confounded me. I gave way because of a point of

order, and it was no point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the point of

elucidation was quite clearly stated by  the  Prime

Minister. It was a point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if it was a point of

elucidation, well, he has so elucidated. But I want

some elucidation here, Sir, If it is felt desirable

and  necessary,  in  the  interest  that  is  being

centred  around this motion not only  in  Singapore

but  elsewhere, that there should be  legal  advice

sought, what is the position about this motion?  If

we  are  to  say that we are right, then  why  seek

advice?  But  we  cannot say  that  we  are  wrong.

Because we want to seek advice, we do not say  that

we  are  wrong. But do we want to say that  we  are

right?  Once  we say that we are right,  we  should

stick  to  it  and  say  that  we  are  right.  The

unfortunate thing, Sir, as the Member  for  Farrer

Park has brought out, is that the two parts of  the

motion have been put into one motion. Had it  been

just  one motion moved at that time, the Opposition

on  this  side  would have debated that  point  and

discussed whether or not it is desirable  that  the

dignity  of the House be maintained. And there  can

be  only  one  answer.  But, unfortunately,  it  is

because  of  the wording of the motion as  a  whole

that  has brought about all this confusion and  all

the  lengthy  debate  on a matter  which,  honestly

speaking, is clouded with what is to come  in  the

second part of the motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am just wondering whether, in view

of   the   conflicting  opinions  that  have   been

expressed  not only in regard to the motion  before

the  House, but also in regard to the Deputy  Prime

Minister's  motion,  it  would  not  be   in   the

interests  of  the House to adjourn the  debate  on

both  motions to obtain legal opinion on the  whole

issue,  which  seems to have been  confused,  which

seems to be inter-related, and which seems to  have

been clouded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Eng Guan, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support your

suggestion with all my heart-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And soul!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> First of all, I wish only to

mention about -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member supports

the  suggestion of the Chair, then perhaps he  will

give  time  to any other Member who would  like  to

move that the debate be adjourned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Member speaking? Mr Ong Eng Guan, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  in  his  speech  said  that  this  is   a

sovereign  Legislature. But on the other  hand,  he

said that it is definite this Assembly has not  the

powers to expel a Member. It is my submission, Sir,

that  all sovereign Legislatures have the right  to

suspend and expel Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is still under the British Colonial

Office,  and the Constitution is still colonial  in

character.  I  submit  that  this  is  a   colonial

Legislature  and, as such, it is  not  a  sovereign

Legislature. I think the Prime Minister  was  going

to  confuse  it  is stated in the  book  by  Martin

Wight,  that  a  colonial  Legislature  is  not   a

sovereign  Legislature but it is  sovereign  within

its  powers. Sir, in other words, this Assembly can

only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



operate within the Constitution and the laws of the

country.  The  motion by the Deputy Prime  Minister

was  not  raised  under  any  particular  laws   or

Standing  Orders  of  this country.  First  it  was

raised  under Standing Order 30 (e).  It  was  then

shifted to Standing Order 56 (5). Now reference  is

also made to Standing Order 46 (10) which refers to

a  substantive  motion  on  personal  conduct.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  motion  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister is not a motion on my personal conduct - not

a  motion on the personal conduct of a Member,  but

on his official conduct in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has also been stated by the Prime Minister

that  section 54 (1) of the Constitution gives  any

Member  the  right to raise any motion for  debate.

May I read out the whole of section 54(1)?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Subject to the provisions of this Order and of

the Standing Orders of the Assembly, any Member may

introduce any Bill or propose any motion for debate

in,  or  may present any petition to, the Assembly,

and  the  same  shalt be debated  and  disposed  of

according to the Standing Orders of the Assembly.'



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, the qualification is quite clear.

A  motion  for  debate  must  be  subject  to  the

Standing Orders of the Assembly, and it can only be

disposed  of  according to the Standing  Orders  of

this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I wish to raise is all about

the  cases  cited  just now  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister. He quoted a tot of cases which are  cases

concerning  a  breach of order of  legislatures.  I

have  not  been accused at any time of a breach  of

order,   and   therefore,  all  those   cases   are

irrelevant to the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the proposal raised by

you just now, which is the same as my proposal - that

since there is so much conflicting opinion in  this

Chamber on this issue, and since any decision might

be  against  the Constitution, I submit  that  this

matter be referred to more expert legal opinion and

that the matter be temporarily suspended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member is too late. I did

give  an  opportunity to any Member who  wished  to

move the adjournment of the debate. The debate  has

now  been  completed and I will  have  to  put  the

Question  to the House. The Question is, "That  the

ruling  of the Speaker admitting the motion of  the

Deputy  Prime Minister in regard to the Member  for

Hong Lim be rescinded and that this Assembly has no

jurisdiction  to  deal  with  the  matters   raised

therein."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many as are of that opinion, say Aye.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Aye.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To the contrary, say No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Division.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Noes have it? Do I hear a

division?  Hon.  Members must know that  they  must

claim  a division when I sense the voices.  I  will

put the Question again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the ruling of the Speaker

admitting  the motion of the Deputy Prime  Minister

in  regard  to the Member for Hong Lim be rescinded

and  that this Assembly has no jurisdiction to deal

with the matters raised therein."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many as are of that opinion, say Aye.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Aye.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member just wait until

I have sensed the voices?

<br><br>7.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy

Prime  Minister  has brought three charges  against

me.  First, I shall dwell on the subject of Mr  M.

R. Marcus. In the meantime, I would like to ask the

Deputy  Prime Minister to let me have  a, look  at

the'  circular paper which was stated to be  issued

by  the  Administrator, City  Council,  dated  12th

November,  1959,  contained  in  page  12  of   the

Legislative Assembly Debates - Official Report.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, this circular is quite  relevant  to

me,  and  I  would like to ask for a  copy  of  the

circular.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot find the passage. Could the

Member for Hong Lim indicate the passage again?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is on page

12,   paragraph   3  of  the  Unrevised   Singapore

Legislative Assembly Debates - Official Report.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The difficulty I am faced with is

that  I do not know what stand the Member for  Hong

Lim  is  taking. Is he endeavouring now to  justify

his  statement - to substantiate his allegations?  If

he  is  doing that, then the proper thing would  be

for  this  Assembly to consider whether or  not  it

should  take evidence so that the Member  for  Hong

Lim  may be given the opportunity of substantiating

his allegations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

substantiate all the things I have said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So do I take it then that the Member

for   Hong  Lim  does  not  wish  to  withdraw  his

allegations;  he  does  not  wish   to   give   any

explanation of them, and his desire is to  try  and

substantiate  the  allegations  he  made  in   this

Assembly?  Is that the course the Member  for  Hong

Lim is taking?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, I have nothing

to apologise.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated to hon. Members that

if that is the course which the Member for Hong Lim

wishes  to  take, then it might be convenient  that

this  Assembly resolve itself into a  Committee  to

deal with the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Could I just make a point, Mr

Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since Monday

when  the House stood adjourned, I have been busily

occupied  with preparing my speech for  the  motion

today  before  the  House. I would  ask  the  House

kindly to consider adjourning the sitting to Monday

so  that  I  could collect more facts  and  try  to

prepare my case.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Leader of the House has already

indicated, indirectly perhaps, that he wishes  this

matter   to   proceed   beyond   the   Moment    of

interruption.  The decision, of course,  lies  with

the  Members themselves as to whether or  not  they

would like this debate to be further adjourned. Any

Member is entitled to move that motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the Member for Hong Lim

has  declared  that he is prepared to  substantiate

the   three  allegations  which  are  in   this

[Interruption].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have suggested, Mr Speaker, that the proper

procedure  would  be for this Assembly  to  resolve

itself into a Committee. However, if the Member for

Hong  Lim  pleads  for  time  to  substantiate  his

allegations, we are prepared. I would ask you,  Mr

Speaker,  to  suspend this sitting for  20  minutes

while  we  consider  whether we  will  adjourn  the

discussion on this motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then I will take this Chair again at

twenty to eight.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on 15th December,

the motion was first introduced. It was debated on

19th December-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First, I think I must know

whether the request of the Member for Hong Lim is

being acceded to by the Government side?

Speaker-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid all these

technicalities are a little bewildering  sometimes.

But the Hon. the Leader of the House cannot make  a

speech  unless  he assures me that the  proceedings

will be adjourned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I wish to state, Mr Speaker,

that we are prepared to concede to the plea by  the

Member  for  Hong Lim for time to  study  his  case

provided  that  he satisfies certain conditions.  I

wish  to  state now one simple condition, which  is

this:  we would like to know what are the facts  on

which   the   Member  for  Hong   Lim   relies   to

substantiate his allegations. Let him state them as

clearly and as categorically as I did in my  speech

on  Monday, the 19th of December, so that  we  will

know  what  are the facts in dispute in order  that

evidence can be taken in Committee upon them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It may perhaps be convenient, and

indeed  the  proper course to take, for the  Member

for Hong Lim to make his statement now in full,  as

has been done by the Leader of the House. That,  of

course,  would  not prevent him from  supplementing

that  statement in Committee. That, I think,  would

be for the convenience of all Members concerned.



<br><br>7.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this is

the  case, I must ask the House to understand  that

many  of  my  statements will be made from  memory,

because  since  Monday, I  have  not  had  time  to

prepare.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will deal with all the three

charges  at one time. Sir, I had been a  member  of

the P.A.P. since its formation, and I had also been

a member of the Government since 5th of June, 1959.

Earlier,  in December 1957, I was elected Mayor  of

the  City  Council. During this time I  learnt  the

workings  of the City Council and how it was  being

run;  and I came to learn about many of the  senior

officers of the City Council. At the same time,  of

course,  I  also had an intimate knowledge  of  the

workings of the P.A.P. and of this Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are eight Standing Committees in the

City  Council.  Each  of these  Committees  has  an

Assistant  Secretary whose duty it is to take  down

the  minutes  of  the meetings and  send  them  for

confirmation at future meetings. Sir, one of  these

Assistant  Secretaries is called Mr M. R.  Marcus.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, during my association  with  the

P.A.P.,  I  was always invited by the Minister  for

Labour  and  Law on occasions and parties,  and  at

these  parties I used to meet the Marcus  brothers.

Three  of  the Marcus brothers worked in  the  City

Council  and Mr M. R. Marcus was one of them.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, when I went to the City Council,  as

far  as  I  can  remember, Mr  M.  R.  Marcus  was

occupying  the  post  of Class  IV  in  the  Senior

Officers' scale. Later we took steps to promote all

the three Marcus brothers and one of those affected

was  Mr  M. R. Marcus. I remember faintly that  he

was  promoted from Class IV to Class III. The  post

was  reclassified in order to give an increment  to

Mr  M. R. Marcus. Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure this

Assembly knows of the City Council during the later

period when I was there. During this period, we had

differences  with the three Marcus brothers.  About

the  middle of April 1959, I resigned from the City

Council, and there was a vacuum. I went back to the

City  Council  on 5th June. In other words  I  took

charge  of  the  City Council again  on  5th  June.

Between  the  time I resigned and the time  I  went

back to the City Council, Mr M. R. Marcus tendered

his  letter of resignation. He had to give adequate

notice  and his resignation could only take  effect

from 2nd June,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



1959. Mr Speaker, Sir, these are facts on which we

agree  in common between the Government and myself.

In  other  words, Mr M. R. Marcus did  not  resign

during  the  time  I  was in  charge  of  the  City

Council. He resigned before I went back to the City

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fact on which we have no disagreement,

Sir, is that Mr M. R. Marcus was getting more  pay

before  he  resigned. The Leader of the  House  has

said on page 13 of the unrevised transcript of  the

proceedings  of  the Legislative Assembly  on  19th

December,  1960, that he was paid  $740  per  month

plus  existing  allowances, and  that  he  was

re-engaged on an all-in salary of $600 per month.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  he  was  getting  $740  basic  plus

Municipal  Provident Fund benefits, which  came  to

about an average of 20 per cent before he resigned;

and  when  he was re-engaged he was paid  an  all-in

salary of $600 per month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader of the House has said

that there were seven officers who were taken back,

and  that is reproduced in Hansard, Vol. 13, No.  8

of  11th  August,  1960, in  columns  607-8.  Seven

officers were taken back and, in my opinion, out of

them only Mr M. R. Marcus suffered a reduction  in

his total remuneration. Why should this be so?



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Nepotism!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have never

used  the  word "nepotism" against any of  the  two

Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third fact I wish to raise is that this is a

new appointment. It is not asking an officer to  go

back. It is a new appointment. The qualification of

the   Secretary  of  the  City  Health   Department

requires the applicant to be a University graduate.

Mr   M.   R.   Marcus   did   not   possess   that

qualification. Had the post been advertised and had

it  gone before the Public Service Commission, Sir,

Mr  M. R. Marcus would definitely not have got the

job.  The previous holder of the post of Secretary,

City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



Health  Department, was a University  graduate  and

his   application  went  to  the   Public   Service

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I wish to raise is that from

the same Hansard in column 607, it is clear that it

took  13  months  for  Mr M.  R.  Marcus  to  be

"reappointed"  as a temporary officer  with  effect

from 30th July, 1960. It took 13 months for Mr  M.

R.  Marcus to be "reappointed". This time factor is

very   important,  because  between  the  time   he

resigned and the time he was reappointed, it  would

not be 13 months but it would be 14 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from the facts of the case, I

have  inferred  and what I have  said  I  sincerely

believe  is  the honest truth about the appointment

of Mr M. R. Marcus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now come to the appointment of Mr Kwa

Soon Chuan.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I just want to get the issue

very  clear. Is the hon. Member for Hong  Lim  then

alleging that Mr M. R. Marcus got his job  merely

because  he  happened to be a brother-in-law  of  a

Minister? Is that the allegation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall

now  come  to  Mr  Kwa  Soon  Chuan.  When  I  was

appointed the Minister for National Development  on

5th June, 1959, the, Land Office was one department

under this Ministry. Mr Kwa Soon Chuan was working

in  the Land Office. First of all, I must say  that

during the time he worked under me, I found him  to

be an officer who was non-corruptible. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I must say that he is an officer who has great

personal integrity and is very hard-working. During

the debate on the Estimates, I never even mentioned

the  names of these two particular officers - Mr Kwa

Soon  Chuan and Mr M. R. Marcus. When I  mentioned

these  two points, it was on a matter of principle.

There  was  no malice whatsoever against these  two

particular  officers. When I was in charge  of  the

Land Office, Mr Kwa Soon Chuan was acting in a No.

1 post in that office. He was holding the post  in

an acting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



capacity.  He  was  being paid on  his  substantive

appointment at $960 per month. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

would  like  to  refer to page 9 of  the  Singapore

Establishment  Staff List dated 1st January,  1959.

Mr  Kwa Soon Chuan was being paid $960 per  month,

although he was acting in a post which, if he'were

substantively  appointed, would have  given  him  a

salary  of  $1,520.  In other words,  Mr  Kwa  was

acting  in  a  post which, if he were substantively

appointed, would have given him a salary of $1,520,

but  because  he was only acting in  the  post,  he

obtained  $960. There was another officer who  was

Acting  No. 2 in the Land Officer. I remember  some

time   early  this  year  before  I  went  to   the

Federation  for a holiday that the person  who  was

acting  in  the  No. 2 post was  appointed  by  the

Public Service Commission to fill substantively the

No.  1  post, and Mr Kwa Soon Chuan had to  revert

back to his original substantive appointment.  As

far  as  I  know, this has seldom happened  in  the

history of the civil service. Mr Kwa was acting in

the  No. 1 post. Another officer was acting in  the

No.  2 post. The Public Service Commission reversed

the  position. Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand  that

when   Mr   Kwa  learned  of  this   reversal   of

position - which does not happen very  often - he  took

leave   from  the  Land  Office.  Sir,   from   the

Establishment Staff List dated 1st June,  1960,  it

is  clearly stated that Mr Kwa Soon Chuan was  the

Acting   Deputy  Commissioner  (Valuation),  Inland

Revenue, Superscale G post, which carries a pay  of

$1,520  ...  24th  May, 1960. Mr Speaker,  I  cannot

remember  the  date when I went to the  Federation,

because  I have not been allowed time to  check  on

the  date.  I learned of the reversal  of  the  two

posts  in  the  Land Office by the  Public  Service

Commission. Since Mr Kwa Soon Chuan had been asked

to  go  back to his substantive appointment in  the

Land   Office,   he  took  leave,  and   from   the

Establishment  Staff List, I learned  that  he  was

transferred  from one Department  under  the  Prime

Minister's  Office, which is the  Land  Office,  to

another  department of the Prime Minister's Office,

which is the Assessment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



Department, and that is on the 24th May, 1960.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, these two departments are both  under

the  control of the Prime Minister, although it  is

always   stated   in  theory  that  the   Valuation

Department  would  one day be integrated  with  the

Ministry of Finance. But having been a Minister  in

the Government, I understand very well that even in

those  departments which were supposed to be  under

my  charge,  the Prime Minister did sometimes  take

charge of staff matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember the Minister for

Finance  said  during the debate on  the  Estimates

that  the  post was circularised in July 1960,  and

that  it was filled by Mr Kwa Soon Chuan in August

1960. It means, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Mr Kwa Soon

Chuan   was   thus   seconded  to  the   Assessment

Department  by the Prime Minister for three  months

before  his  case  was  considered  by  the  Public

Service   Commission.   Mr   Speaker,   Sir,   the

substantive  appointment of Mr Kwa Soon  Chuan  as

Deputy  Commissioner of Valuation would  entail  an

increase in salary of $525 basic. Sir, I have  been

associated  since the formation of the P.A.P. with

the present Ministers of the Government, and I also

knows  and I also understand that three members  of

the  Public  Service Commission have  been  closely

associated  with  the leadership  of  the  People's

Action Party and the present Ministers; two of them

have been associated in financial assistance to the

P.A.P. before the general elections,  and  one  of

them  has given free medical aid to P.A.P. members,

including myself. Mr Speaker, Sir, I sincerely and

honestly believe from all these facts that  what  I

have  stated in this Assembly is what I believe  to

be the honest truth.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I then try and pinpoint the

issues  in  this  other matter?  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister,  when he moved the motion, had elaborated

on the second and third charges. He suggested that

what  the  hon. Member for Hong Lim meant  when  he

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to put it to the

Minister that many of these recommendations - which I

have  read  myself - are meant  for  the  purpose  of

fixing up certain things.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



was that `The Committee' - it is at the end of page

15 of the unabridged report-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`consisting of a Permanent Secretary and four

departmental  heads were improperly prevailed  upon

by  political influence to frame the qualifications

of  the post to suit the appointment of the present

incumbent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Member's own words, these recommendations

were  "meant  for  the purpose  of  fixing  certain

things".'.



<br><br>Is that a fair comment on it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the five

officers who formed the Working Party to look  into

the   working   of  the  City  Council   Assessment

Department  were  these  - the  Permanent  Secretary

(Treasury)  as  the  Chairman, the  Comptroller  of

Income   Tax,   the  Acting  City   Assessor,   the

Government  Valuer and Assessor, the  Head  of  the

Organisations & Methods Branch of the  Ministry  of

Finance.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  out  of  these  five

officers,  two work in the Prime Minister's  Office

and  three work in the Ministry of Finance. I  have

been  associated with the Government for  one  year

and  I know how things are worked out. Mr Speaker,

Sir, from my own, experience and from the fact that

these  five officers are under the control  of  the

Prime  Minister  and the Minister  for  Finance,  I

sincerely and honestly believe what I have said  to

be the truth.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can the House then take it that you

are  willing  to substantiate this allegation,  and

that is that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The committee consisting of a Permanent Secretary

and   four   departmental  heads  were   improperly

prevailed upon by political influence to frame  the

qualifications of the post to suit the  appointment

of the present incumbent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Member's own words, these recommendations

were  "meant  for  the purpose  of  fixing  certain

things".'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what the Member for Hong Lim seeks to

establish?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from my

experience in the Government and from knowledge  of

some  of  these officers, I have inferred from  all

the  facts I have said just now about how the  post

was being put up.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the answer "Yes"? If the answer is

"Yes" - am  I  right? I do not wish to say  something

which  is perhaps wrong. Is the answer then  "Yes",

and that the Member for Hong Lim will endeavour  or

is  endeavouring  to  substantiate  the  allegation

contained in that paragraph?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg your

pardon. Would you mind explaining to me whether  it

means I have to substantiate the first part of  the

motion or just on the Working Party?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The quotation from the speech of the

hon. Member for Hong Lim is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to put it to the

Minister that many of these recommendations - which I

have  read  myself - are meant  for  the  purpose  of

fixing up certain things.'



<br><br>And  the  Deputy  Prime Minister has  alleged  that

there is an innuendo, or that means that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The committee consisting of a Permanent Secretary

and   four   departmental  heads  were   improperly

prevailed upon by political influence to frame  the

qualifications of the post to suit the  appointment

of the present incumbent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Member's own words, these recommendations

were  "meant  for  the purpose  of  fixing  certain

things".'.



<br><br>Is  that what the Member for Hong Lim meant when he

said those words?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must admit

that  I  am not very clear about the question,  and

that  is why I have asked that this sitting  should

be  adjourned to give me a chance to delve  further

into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member for Hong Lim is not

prepared to answer at this moment. The second point

made  by the Deputy Prime Minister is in connection

with what was said by the Member for Hong Lim,  and

the passage quoted is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In my opinion, there is nothing, as far as I

know,  to  merit this transfer other than the  fact

that   he  is  the  brother-in-law  of  the   Prime

Minister.'



<br><br>Is  the Member for Hong Lim, quoting the words used

by  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, now alleging  that

"the appointment to the post was not made by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



Public  Service Commission or, if it was  so  made,

that  the  Public Service Commission was  subjected

and  guided  to  improper influence in  making  its

recommendations for this appointment", that  is  to

say, the appointment was made because the incumbent

was the brother-in-law of the Prime Minister? Is he

prepared to answer that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

put  forward by the Deputy Prime Minister is  quite

different  from what I have said. And I  also  need

time to give a more detailed reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Leader of the House then

prepared to move the adjournment of the debate?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, has the Member for

Hong  Lim  any  new facts? And can he  state  quite

clearly  in what way what I said is quite different

from  what  he said, because I have quoted  exactly

and   accurately   from  the  transcript   of   the

proceedings?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the Member for Hong Lim has

indicated that, if the debate is adjourned, he will

be  prepared  to make his allegation more  specific

when the debate is resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, may I enquire

whether  the  Member for Hong  Lim  has  any  other

relevant  facts to substantiate the allegations  he

has made?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member for Hong Lim has

completed  his explanation, then it is now  up,  to

the  Members to decide whether or not he should  be

given    further   time   to   make    supplemental

explanations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, as the House will

at   a  subsequent  date  resolve  itself  into   a

Committee  and  witnesses will be  called  to  give

evidence  on oath, the Government is to  submit  to

you a list of witnesses which we intend to call  in

Committee.  To be just to everybody  all  round,  I

would  now  ask  the Member for Hong  Lim  also  to

submit  a  similar  list of his witnesses  whom  he

intends  to  call  to  give  evidence  on  oath  in

Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the intention to move that this

matter  be  dealt with in a Committee of the  whole

House? I take it that is the intention.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Standing Order would be Standing

Order 41, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Whenever in any matter, other than matters

considered  under procedure on Bills, or  financial

procedure,  a  Member desires that  the  matter  be

considered in a Committee of the whole Assembly, he

may  move, without notice, that the Assembly  shall

immediately  or  on  a future sitting  day  resolve

itself  into  a Committee of the whole Assembly  to

consider the matter.'



<br><br>And if it is the intention that witnesses should be

called, then this Committee must be given power  to

send  for  persons, papers and records.  These  are

matters  of  procedure, but if there is  to  be  an

adjournment now, the adjournment can just  be  that

the  debate  be now adjourned, under  the  relevant

Standing Order 24. Then the Speaker will call  upon

the  Leader  of the House to name a date  when  the

debate can be resumed, and on that day a motion  to

resolve the Assembly into a Committee of the  whole

Assembly could be moved. I hope I have made  myself

clear.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I have just stated that I

have here a list of witnesses which I will give  to

you,  and  these witnesses will be  called  by  the

Government   to  present  evidence   on   oath   in

Committee,  to  be  set on  a  date  to  be  named.

Likewise, the Member for Hong Lim ought to give you

a similar list. That is what I am asking now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think if the Member for Hong Lim

wishes to call witnesses, he will have to submit  a

list of witnesses in order that the Clerk may be in

the  position to summon those witnesses to  appear.

That  must  be done if the Member for Hong  Lim  is

going  to  call any witness. If he is not going  to

call  any  witness, that is the end of it.  Is  the

Member for Hong Lim anticipating that he will  call

witnesses?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a Member of

the  Opposition is not in the same position as  the

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If power is given to send for

persons, papers and records, then the Committee has

power to summon these witnesses to appear. It is up

to  the  Member for Hong Lim, if he wishes to  call

any  person, to submit his name to the Clerk and  a

summons could be issued.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

consider the matter, having regard to their present

positions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated the course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, let us be clear on

this  matter.  Will the Member for Hong  Lim  state

categorically whether he will be calling  witnesses

or not? That is all we wish to know.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think we can insist on the

Member  for Hong Lim saying now that he  will  call

witnesses. I do not think we can insist on that  at

all. It is up to him entirely. He is now, as I have

said  earlier  on, in the position of a  defendant,

and  he  is  now  seeking to  substantiate  certain

charges.  To  do that, it is up to him to  consider

whether   or  not  he  should  call  witnesses   to

substantiate his allegations. If he does  not  call

witnesses    to   substantiate   his   allegations,

obviously  then  he relies on his  own  statements.

Then  it is up to the House to consider whether  or

not  the allegations have been substantiated. I  do

not  think  we  can  force him  now  to  name  his

witnesses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, there must be at

least  a  day by which time he must have a list  of

witnesses -  if  the Member for Hong Lim  wishes  to

call them - which should be delivered to the Clerk of

the House, and I think that day must be fixed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Leader of the House suggesting

then  that if the Member for Hong Lim does not give

a  list  of witnesses, he will not be able to  call

the witnesses? Is that the suggestion?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> No, Mr Speaker. The only

difficulty  is  that unpleasant inferences  may  be

drawn from this.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As far as I see it, the Member for

Hong  Lim is on trial. He is a defendant. It is  up

to him. He has now made certain allegations, and he

has  said  that he is prepared to substantiate  his

allegations.  What  the force of  the  evidence  is

which  he can bring up, it is up to him to  decide.

If  he just relies on his statements, then it is up

to  the  House  to decide whether or  not,  on  his

statements,  on  his words, the charges  are  being

substantiated.  If  he  does  not  wish   to   call

witnesses,  the strength of his case  would  depend

entirely   on   his   own  words  supplemented   by

extraneous evidence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I will accept your

ruling  on  this  matter.  Shall  I  now  move  the

adjournment of the Assembly?
