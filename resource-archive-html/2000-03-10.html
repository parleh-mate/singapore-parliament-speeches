there  has been reservation by customers in accepting chilled

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, pork stall holders appear to be generally happy

with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>



the  use  of  chillers  to  retail  fresh  pork.   Some  have

indicated that their volume of sale has increased.  They  are

now  able  to sell fresh chilled pork obtained from  approved

farms overseas whereas in the past they could only sell fresh

pork slaughtered in the abattoirs in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public have also taken the chilled meat system well.

They  have  found the chiller system to be cleaner  and  more

hygienic.

<div align="center"><b>VACANT HAWKER STALLS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Harun A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment  if  he will give some indication  (a)  how  many

stall  holders have given up their stalls; (b) how many  have

changed  their  trade;  and  (c) whether  his  Ministry  will

consider   allocating  vacant  stalls  for  hardship   cases,

especially  those  stalls which have not  been  taken  up  by

tenders.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker Sir, each year an average

of  320  stall  holders, or 1.7%, give up  their  stalls  and

another 50, or 0.3%, change their trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vacant stalls are tendered out and an average of 300

stalls are filled each year in this manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to tender out vacant hawker stalls to the

general  public instead of allocating them to hardship  cases

was  taken in 1990 for several reasons.   Operating a  hawker

stall is a business that requires a financial investment  and

good  culinary skills.  Many "hardship" cases allotted stalls

in  the  past were unable to operate their stalls  profitably

and  their  businesses  failed,  leading  to  more  financial

hardship.    Some   resorted  to  subletting   their   stalls

illegally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawker business is best left to people with adequate

resources and culinary skills whilst "hardship" cases  should

seek other forms of employment or assistance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun A. Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Could the Minister tell

us  how  many of the "hardship" cases were not up to standard

and they had to give up their stalls?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I do not quite get the question. The

policy  to  allocate stalls to hardship cases was started  in

1975 and the policy was stopped in 1990. When the policy  was

reviewed, it was felt that there was no longer a need for the

policy.   Maybe I can give an idea of the situation  at  that

time.  There were then a total of 648 approved hardship cases

on the waiting list.  In 1990, when the policy was stopped, a

total  of  212  vacant cooked food stalls  and  1,621  market

produce stalls were offered to them.  However, there were  no

takers.  In fact, all 648 cases had not selected a  stall for

nine  months and 538 had not selected any stalls for  over  a

year.  In fact, most of them were not really in dire need  of

a  stall.   Many of them could not operate the stalls.   They

were  hoping  to get stalls in good locations  so  that  they

could  sublet to other people and, indirectly, get a  subsidy

for living allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [9th March, 2000],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100."  -  [Mr Chay Wai Chuen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low is not here. Prof. Chin.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would

like  to raise three matters concerning road safety.   First,

can  the Ministry look into whether the entry and exit points

on   certain   highways,  such  as  the  CTE,   be   resited,

particularly one that involves a confluence of points  on  to

the  CTE.   For example, first, the confluence of two  exits,

one from the PIE and the other from Toa Payoh, as we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>



approach  the CTE.  Next, these two then converge on  to  the

CTE  just  at the point when the CTE has an exit  point  into

Farrer  Road.  This, I believe, is why every evening  we  see

the  sign, "Heavy traffic up to Braddell".  In the  same  way

from  the other side of the CTE going towards the city, every

morning we have virtually the same problem so that we see the

warning, "Heavy traffic from Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 or 1 to  the

PIE".   Arguably, these must be the most congested areas  and

it  may  well  be due to the misplacement of exit  and  entry

points.   So I hope that the Ministry can do something  about

alleviating the conditions by resiting exit and entry  points

on this particular stretch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, could LTA look into more road safety indicators

to  prevent  two  bad habits?  The first is the  tendency  of

drivers and motorcyclists to cut into lanes or weave  in  and

out  of  lanes,  especially  on the  expressways.   I  wonder

whether installation of devices, such as cat's eyes, would be

one  way  of discouraging this irritating and often dangerous

behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second bad habit is tailgating, particularly, on bus

lanes.  Could the Ministry, for example, consider the use  of

chevrons  on  the roads, particularly on the  fast  lanes  to

indicate  safe distances that cars should have between  them.

Too  often,  we  have  had multiple car pile-ups  because  of

tailgating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, could LTA consider the banning of fog lights? I

know that, recently, LTA has responded in the Forum pages  to

say that such lights would be permitted.  But very often,  on

clear  nights, there appears to be a lunatic freak who drives

a  certain mark of car, I think it is German, who delights in

switching on these lights that usually blind all others  even

if  we  were  to view them from the rear view  mirror.   Such

inconsiderate  people never seem to learn  the  lesson.   And

such  lights  are supposed to be switched on when  there  are

hazardous   conditions.   But  in  Singapore,  these   lights

themselves  actually form the real hazard.   So  I  hope  the

Ministry will look into these matters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

have  raised this issue in this House before and I would like

to  hear  a commitment from the Minister that, at the  policy

level,  his  Ministry will review transportation  safety  for

school  children from the ages of 3 to 12 who are  travelling

to  and  from  school in buses.  The review will  consist  of

working out the costs of fitting school buses with bus  seats

befitting  the  size  and leg length of children  of  varying

ages,  beginning with those of a child as little as  3  years

old.   The review will address the costs also of fitting  the

back  seats  of  the car with padding so as  to  cushion  any

concussion that may result from a sudden brake by the driver.

The  Ministry  will  establish  and  continually  assess  the

driving  competence of bus drivers.  They would  ensure  that

each  bus has a competent assistant who is able to discipline

the  children by making sure that they are seated and  belted

and  who  is capable of crisis-management should an  accident

happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister of State told me, during the last

sitting,  that  there  were  no  fatal  accidents  linked  to

transportation   of   school   children   in   kindergartens.

Therefore,  there  was no need for seat  belts  or  to  refit

current  fleet of school buses.  I also learnt that the  same

vans  or  buses which are ferrying school children  at  other

times  are  used  by  older  students  and  adults  as  well,

therefore making it less cost effective for the bus  operator

to  fit his buses only for use by a limited category of young

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for me, safety is an issue which cannot be

compromised   or   calculated   on   principles    of    cost

effectiveness.   Unless we study the problem and  the  latest

development  on car fittings, we cannot be so sure  that  the

cost  is  unaffordable.  In any case, the principle  of  best

practice   on   transportation  safety  must  be  safeguarded

irrespective of costs and pragmatic reasoning.  A speed limit

cannot  serve  as a safety substitute.  We all  know  that  a

sudden  brake,  even when driving at the slowest  speed,  can

succeed  in throwing the child towards the window screen  and

cracking his or her neck.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister not to delay in studying this issue

seriously.   It is better to err on the side of caution.   We

may  not  have  had fatal accidents, but certainly,  we  must

protect our children from being maimed due to our failure  in

not  spending a few hundred dollars more in fitting  out  the

buses.   One  real concern is the unhappiness of  parents  if

they were to pay more for transportation because the costs of

refitting  the buses will mean passing the costs  on  to  the

users.   Surely, if any government is capable of  making  its

people  accept a good policy despite its price hikes,  it  is

our  Government.   And  surely, the fear  of  unhappy  public

reaction cannot be a good reason for not doing something that

is right in the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the role of the Government be one of a protector

in  the  interests  of  the school children,  or  that  of  a

defender  on  behalf  of  the  commercial  interests  of  bus

operators?  The Government must balance this conflicting role

in favour of the children.  For me, as a mother, the decision

is clearly evident.  I will pay for my child's safety because

he  or she is priceless.  For those parents who cannot afford

it,  the  school  and other supportive parents  can  help  to

subsidise  transportation  charges  for  their  children.   I

repeat, Sir, our children's safety cannot be compromised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, Singapore has 3,120

kilometres of roads and 700,000 vehicles on the roads.  As we

progress  to become a vibrant metropolis, we will expect  our

roads  to be more busy, especially during the night.  We  are

also  a  fast  ageing population and there will be  a  higher

proportion of drivers between the age of 50 and 60 years  old

in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, we have many different types of road markings

and  signages  on  our  roads.  The  road  signages  come  in

different  sizes,  fonts, colours  and  shapes.   These  road

signages  are usually placed at ad hoc locations and  can  be

untidy  and  sometimes confusing.  The recent change  of  the

tourist  attractions'  road signages to  brown  is  indeed  a

correct  step  towards standardising our  road  signages  and

making them more user friendly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also many road markings on our roads.

Some of these road markings are necessary and also confusing.

The  extensive road markings on our roads also  increase  the

maintenance  cost, and affect the smooth flow of  traffic  as

they need frequent maintenance and repainting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek the Minister's clarifications

on the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the policy for deciding where to place road

signages and road markings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How much is spent on road signages and markings

maintenance per year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to

ensure  that  all  road  signages and markings  are  visible,

especially at night?

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, last year, the

Ministry  adopted  the  bold  move  of  not  fining  the  ERP

violators  from  the  start, but by asking  them  to  pay  an

administrative  charge and the relevant ERP  fee.   This  has

been  seen  as  a good move by the Ministry which  should  be

congratulated for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether this example should not serve as a

model  for treating other types of offences that are,  so  to

speak,  victimless.   I will give an example.  Last  year,  a

mother  and  her six-year old child was caught  eating  while

they  were  leaving  an MRT station. They  had  already  gone

through  the  electronic barrier and the mother thought  that

they  were  out of the restricted zone as it were.   However,

they  were  unpleasantly surprised when  they  were  accosted

while   their  mouths  were  bulging  with  paus  and   given

summonses.  The officer did not listen to their  explanation,

which was that the mother made a genuine mistake and it  took

two  letters  of appeal before LTA decided to let  them  off.

But  once  again,  may I say that I am grateful  to  LTA  for

letting them off.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this has led me to wonder whether we are doing

the right thing by banning, for example, eating and drinking,

when what we are interested in is to punish littering.  It is

not  what  we  put inside our stomachs.  Surely that  is  the

issue.   I  am  all for imposing fines for littering  because

that  is  definitely a matter of public hygiene.  But banning

eating   and   drinking,   perhaps,  needs   reconsideration.

Perhaps, a public education programme would be better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation's

regulations,  I  can  give  other examples  where  the  first

response had been to summon the person and to give penalties.

I  refer  especially,  for example,  to  non-compliance  with

instructions of an LTA officer, $500 fine; entering into  and

remaining in train when it is full, $500 fine; feet placed on

seats,  $500 fine; spitting and littering, $500 fine; playing

musical  instruments,  $500 fine; throwing  missiles,  $5,000

fine.   I  know all these fines are compounded but these  are

matters that I thought could be dealt with first by having  a

public education programme, rather than by imposing penalties

straightaway on such undesirable modes of conduct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that LTA will consider reviewing their whole

structure  of  regulatory offences to see whether  the  first

response  should  be  through the criminal  sanction.   Using

criminal  sanction  as first response for  certain  types  of

conduct  can  be akin to using a machine gun  against  a  guy

armed with a bow and arrow.  What I am saying is that a  good

public education programme should be tried out first and,  if

it  does really become a problem, for example, if the  trains

become  littered  with rubbish, then I  would  say  that  the

criminal sanction would be justified.  I hope that LTA  would

pursue more the line of public education rather than punitive

measures.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, any visitor

who  travels on our roads will invariably get the  impression

that we have very new cars and generally green cars which  do

not pollute the air. That same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>



visitor  would  be forgiven if he, at the same  time,  thinks

that  as  far  as our buses, vans, taxis and motorcycles  go,

however,  the  norm  is  that of  a  trail  of  black  smoke.

Perhaps,  the  authorities here give some  special  exemption

from   anti-pollution   laws  to  commercial   vehicles   and

motorcycles.  That impression should be corrected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles which spew pollutants reduce the quality of air

that  we  rely  on  to live.  It is an issue  which  we  must

address as a matter of survival.  Vehicles using fossil fuels

also drain our financial resources, as these fuels have to be

imported at great cost from a cartel of nations which do  not

necessarily have our nation's interests at heart.  Therefore,

we  must look at alternatives to the diesel or petrol  driven

vehicles  for  the sake of our health, finances and  national

security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cut our reliance on fossil fuels totally may not be

feasible,  but  we can reduce that reliance.  After  all,  we

will  be  getting  plenteous  amounts  of  natural  gas  from

Indonesia  soon.   Being  a tropical  country,  we  are  also

blessed   with  lots  of  free  sunshine.  There   are   many

alternatives  which  use these sources of  energy:   electric

cars  which have become quite reliable with advances in,  for

example, battery technology; hybrid cars which allow electric

cars  to  travel beyond the city; liquid petroleum gas  (LPG)

cars which use natural gas, and even solar-powered cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus surprising to me that the Government is not

putting in more effort to permit the use of such vehicles  in

Singapore.  Could we not give tax incentives, for example, to

those  who  import such vehicles and the fuel that is  needed

for  such  vehicles, or rebates for those who use these  cars

and   tax   reliefs  for  those  who  have   to   build   the

infrastructure,  such as the fuel stations,  to  service  and

maintain such vehicles?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the day when, because of such

measures, we will have cleaner air, cheaper fuels and cheaper

cars  and,  best of all, we can cock a snook  at  the  petrol

cartels.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to

seek  the  indulgence of the Minister for Communications  and

Information  Technology to consider the  future  of  post-war

classic  cars in Singapore.  We are referring to those  post-war cars that are more than 20 years old and quite apart from

those   pre-war  vintage  cars  that  already  enjoy  special

privileges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to look into this matter now because

most  of  these cars have 10-year certificates of entitlement

(COEs)  that will expire in May 2000. These cars are restored

and  well-maintained  by  enthusiasts  and  they  are  to  be

considered a heritage of ours worth preserving.  The problem,

Sir,  is  that  the costs and returns to continue  preserving

them are too foreboding under these current circumstances:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the prevailing quota premium (PQP) is about $50,000

and this is far too exorbitant in relation to the car values;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) a payment of the full PQP will not be commensurate

with the usual amount of usage of these cars; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) the payment of PQP has to be on a 10-yearly basis

in order to qualify for future COE extensions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the owners are not able to afford the

impending  outlay for the COEs and they will have  to  either

export or scrap their cars. This will be most unfortunate and

it  would, therefore, be good if the Minister alleviates  the

situation by endorsing a "classic car category" fairly  soon.

The  more  than 20-year post-war cars could then be  accorded

some  privileges  similar  to  those  for  the  "vintage  car

category".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority would have to collaborate

with  the relevant involved parties to formulate the criteria

and  rules.   It  is necessary to be prudent  and  avoid  two

situations.  Firstly,  a "bonanza" situation  should  not  be

created  in  these cars and especially in the "new"  20  year

olds  when privileges are accorded. Secondly, an increase  in

the number of "bad" cars on our roads.  This may happen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>



when  poorly maintained "new" 20 year-old cars get registered

in  the  "classic  car category" instead of  being  scrapped.

Perhaps  having the cars qualify for categorisation initially

and  imposing punitive transfer fees may ensure  only  valued

and well-maintained cars remain in the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are encouraged to preserve and to appreciate our

history  and heritage.  In line with this,  I would  like  to

persuade  the Minister to enable us to continue  keeping  our

classic cars.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, Singapore is

probably the most expensive place in the world to buy and own

a  car. It all started many years ago when the car population

exploded  and there was a need to dampen the demand for  cars

to deal with congestions, which carries a high economic cost.

We  introduced the ARF, and then PARF, CBD, COE, RPS and ERP.

There was a time when COE for bigger cars fetched a price  of

$100,000.  In spite of the high cost of owning a car,  demand

for  COEs remains in excess of the supply. This is partly due

to  the aspiration to own a car and to a great extent, due to

convenience, bordering on necessity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been done and is being done to extend the

network of public transport. Undoubtedly, we already  have  a

public  transportation  system  that  we  can  be  proud  of.

However,  we  only  have to look at the  queues  of  vehicles

outside   the   schools  to  see  but   one   important   and

indispensable  use  of the car. Many mothers  have  made  the

sacrifice to care for their young children and part of  their

daily routine includes the ferrying of their children to  and

from  school  for classes, ECA activities, and  to  tuitions.

For  the  mothers, having a car is not a convenience,  but  a

necessity. The alternative would be that their children would

have  to wake up before 5 am and prepare for the school  bus,

and what about the activities outside school hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have an effective means of dealing with

congestion. We have in place

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>



the  Electronic  Road Pricing system that is  unique  in  the

world.  Its  effectiveness  has  attracted  attention  and  I

believe that there are interests shown by other countries  to

implement  a similar system.  As a result, the ARF  has  been

reduced and the scale for road tax has been smoothened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broken down vehicle inevitably causes congestion.

There  is  belief  that older vehicles would  have  a  higher

tendency  to break down.  Well, new cars do break  down  too.

In   any   case,  cars  being  retained  beyond  their   10th

anniversary  are  subjected to a  revalidation  of  the  COE,

premium  on the road tax, which amounts to 50% from the  15th

year  on, and an annual vehicle inspection. That is a lot  to

pay for any person.  Whilst it is easier to explain about the

revalidation of the COE, given that it has a validity  period

of only 10 years, it is almost impossible to sound convincing

about  the  premium on road taxes since cars  older  than  10

years are subjected to an annual inspection.  Of course,  the

inspection is to check on certain main safety aspects of  the

vehicle   and  cannot  give  much  comfort  on  the   overall

reliability of the vehicle.  Vehicles can break down  minutes

after passing a vehicle inspection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as motorists, we bear with the costs. However,

except for the ERP, which is usage based, other policies  are

non-discriminating.  A person who uses the  car  occasionally

for  essential purposes only is equally penalised on cost  as

the person who uses the car indiscriminately, such as driving

to  the provision store just five minutes away. With the COE,

the  growth  in  the  vehicle population is  controlled.   It

cannot grow faster than the number of COEs being released.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ERP, vehicles are kept away from the main

arterial roads to keep them relatively congestion-free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that those who keep their cars in good

condition  are  rewarded. A badly maintained car  will  break

down  even if it is just a year old. Whilst whether a car  is

in  good  condition  can  only be determined  by  a  thorough

inspection, an effective alternative measure would be that if

it is still

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>



running  well, in spite of being over 20 years old,  it  must

have been reasonably well-looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) introduce a more thorough annual inspection scheme

for  vehicles  older than 10 years and remove  the  road  tax

premium on such cars; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) introduce a special scheme for cars older than 20

years  for restricted usage.  The main aim of such  a  scheme

would be to reduce the ownership cost of keeping a car beyond

20  years.   Without proper maintenance, it is very  unlikely

that  a vehicle would be retained beyond 20 years. There  are

many  well-manufactured cars that, with proper care,  can  be

used  on  the roads for many decades. This will avoid wastage

where  serviceable  cars are scrapped and  worse,  if  it  is

replaced,  our foreign exchange reserve will be drawn  on  to

pay the foreign manufacturer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special scheme for older cars would benefit the

retirees.  We are making the call for active ageing.   If  we

want  older  persons to remain in the workforce or  volunteer

their  services,  we  should, at  the  very  least,  make  it

affordable  for  them  to  retain  their  personal  mode   of

transportation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average person would make a major upgrade when he or

she is around 45 years old.  20 years on, the person would be

65  years  old  and approaching retirement or  retired.   The

person  will have less use of the vehicle but would  like  to

keep  it.   After  working  hard  and  contributing  to   the

Singapore's economy all these years, it would not  be  asking

much  to make it affordable for him to retain his vehicle  if

he  so wishes.  He will be subjected to the ERP, like anyone,

and  would likewise have to use the vehicle discriminatingly.

As a bonus, Singapore will have its own pool of heritage cars

that  would, in time, be viewed as vintage cars. We will have

on  our roads a living history of the evolution of cars  used

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your consideration, Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, most

people in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  basically understand that as a small  nation  with

limited  land  to  use,  we need to  have  a  set  of  highly

efficient land transport system and a vehicle control system,

to  make sure that our roads are free flowing.  The roads and

rail networks are like the blood vessels in our body.  If the

blood vessels are blocked, then the body will be partially or

completely paralysed.  Singapore is the only country  in  the

world  that  has  successfully implemented the  COE  and  ERP

systems.  However, we cannot just depend on all these control

measures,   because   clothing,   food,   accommodation   and

transportation are the four essential conditions in our life.

When  everybody wants to own a car and there are  not  enough

roads for the cars to move, we have to do something.  We have

to build a very good network, a rail network or an integrated

public transport system.  These are very important to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail network has progressed very rapidly in the last

few years.  The MRT system enables us to travel from east  to

west and from north to south.  The Airport line and the North-East  Line  will be completed in 2001 and 2002  respectively.

An  effective MRT system has also let us to make optimum  use

of our land.  I would like to know whether the Government has

any  plans  to  extend  the rail network  to  all  the  major

residential estates, so that they could be linked up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the former Communications Minister, Mr Mah Bow

Tan,  and  the GPC Chairman, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, visited  many

countries  in  the world, and recommended the LRT  system  in

1995.  The LRT will become an important mode of transport  in

our HDB estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced the first LRT

system  in  February 1996, and thereafter the Government  has

also  announced  LRT systems in Bukit Panjang,  Sengkang  and

Punggol, and the people were very excited about this.   After

this,  the  residents in the other estates have been  waiting

and  waiting, and yet they do not hear any news of LRT coming

to their new towns.  I would like to ask the Minister whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>



we   are  going  to  extend  our  LRT  system  to  the  other

residential estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the rail network, our road network

should also be improved.  Last year, in the  Budget debate, I

mentioned that ERP is a specific and effective cure, but  not

a panacea.  We must expand our road network and to clear some

of  the  bottleneck situations in some of our roads.   It  is

like  a  patient  who  has an artery  blockage  problem.   If

necessary, we may have to get a specialist to put in a stent,

so  that the blood vessels will be free again.  Otherwise, we

may even have to perform an operation on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our CTE is like a blood vessel which is almost

incurable.   Recently, many private residential estates  were

developed  along  the  CTE.  In the north-east  area,  in  my

constituency,  with the completion of Hougang  new  town  and

with  Sengkang and Punggol 21 rapidly developing, with  about

1,000 units being completed every month, I hope we could have

a  new  blood  vessel there, so that these  areas  will   not

suffer a stroke and become paralysed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not wish to see the CTE having more and more

ERP  gantry points.  Otherwise, passing through the CTE  will

be a problem because we have to pay ERP all the way.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the North-East Line that is due to be completed in 2002-2003 will, of

course,  bring  great  relief to the residents  of  Sengkang,

Punggol  and  Cheng  San  GRC  in  general.   We  very   much

appreciate  that  MCIT  has  helped to  speed  up  the  work.

Unfortunately,  the  residents do  face  significant  traffic

problems because, as part of the MRT construction, there  are

significant road diversions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few points that we would like to raise with

the  Minister.  Firstly, we would appreciate it  if  LTA  can

look  beyond just the local diversion, because some of  these

local diversions prevent the opening of major arterial roads.

This means that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>



even though they do divert a small bypass but, for the estate

as  a  whole, the roads are choked.  For example, in Sengkang

town, the main arterial road now is Punggol Road, which is an

old   road   and,   unfortunately,  it  cannot   be   widened

significantly.  So this causes significant problems and  time

wastage  for the residents.  We are looking at whether  other

arterial  roads like Sengkang East Way or some  other  bypass

could be opened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is on transport problems on a larger

scale, like what my colleague has just mentioned.  If we look

carefully  at  how the town is growing, we are  having  about

1,000  new households moving in every month or so.   At  this

rate  of  increase  in the population,  we  do  face  traffic

problems,  not  just locally, but also when  going  to  town,

congestion on CTE and other bypass roads.  The ERP has helped

to some extent but, in the longer term, we should really look

at   other   expressways  or  semi-expressways   to   provide

alternatives for the residents there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with more and more

new  towns  being  developed, like Sengkang and  Punggol  21,

nowadays  the  HDB  estates are getting  bigger  and  bigger.

Sengkang is bigger than Ang Mo Kio, and the density  is  very

high.   There  are  more and more people in  each  new  town.

Therefore, we should have a very good public transport system

for the convenience of the residents there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether there is any coordination

between  LTA  and HDB in this aspect, so that  the  residents

would  not  have to move into a new town where there  are  no

buses  running.  It would have been very inconvenient.  Also,

the  construction  of bus stops should  also  be  planned  in

advance, so that they could be completed before the residents

move in.  In this way, they would not have to suffer from the

strong sun and rain when they are waiting for buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have some direct buses from the city to

the  new  towns.  For example, Service No.  572 goes all  the

way

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>



from  Lorong  Chuan  to Shenton Way.   Such  an  express  bus

service  is very convenient for the residents, and  many  car

owners may even turn to taking the bus instead of driving  to

town.  However, I feel that this type of bus service has  not

received  much attention, because the numbers of these  buses

are not found on the bus stops.  Once when I went to this bus

stop,  I  was not sure which buses were passing that way  and

whether the bus routes were still operating.  I hope the  LTA

would encourage more operators to provide such direct express

service  so  that the residents in the new towns would  enjoy

this benefit.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, in tropical Singapore, travelling

can  be  quite uncomfortable for bus commuters and motorists,

especially during the rainy days.  Whenever there is a  heavy

downpour in Singapore, we will notice that some bus commuters

will  be standing on the seat at bus stops for shelter, while

many motorists will seek shelter under flyovers, resulting in

bottlenecks and traffic congestion.  These motorists are also

endangering themselves by staying at the road shoulder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve a seamless land transportation system, it is

necessary to integrate the development and upgrading  of  bus

shelters  into  the  development  guide  plans.   More  micro

planning  efforts should be focused to ensure that bus  stops

are   correctly  positioned  for  the  convenience   of   bus

commuters.   The authorities must coordinate more closely  to

ensure   that   bus  shelters  are  provided   expeditiously,

especially  in new housing estates.  We also need  to  review

the design guidelines of bus shelters and rain shelters.   In

many    developed   countries,  bus  shelters   are   simple,

aesthetically pleasing, functional and maintenance free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek the following clarifications

from the Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the policy for providing new bus shelters in new

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;housing estates?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the progress of upgrading existing bus shelters?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will the Ministry expedite the construction of rain

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shelters for motorists

along expressways?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, sweeping the road is

not  a  very desirable job.  With labour shortage and  rising

labour  cost,  it makes sense to use mechanical  sweepers  to

clean  our  pavements.  We have seen some of  these  sweepers

being  used today in a limited way.  But it is quite  comical

when  they  try  to  navigate around trees, lamp-posts,  high

curbs  and  other obstacles, which are in their  way  on  the

pavements.  Would the Minister consider setting some standard

and  uniformity in the design and building of our  pavements,

in such a way as to facilitate the more extensive use of such

mechanical sweepers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next topic relates to covered linkways. Our

Town Councils and LTA have, over the years, built hundreds of

kilometres of these linkways.  They do not come cheap, and  I

have  been  told  that  this  is because,  at  times,   major

underground  services need to be diverted.   Apart  from  the

high  cost,  sometimes the diversion of these major  services

have  resulted  in  delays  and  caused  irritation  to   the

residents  around there.  A hole has been dug to prepare  for

the  foundation  and if the work does not  progress,  it  may

breed mosquitoes and our residents have complained from  time

to  time.  To me, a linkway is quite a simple structure,  and

can  be  constructed with lightweight materials.  Perhaps  no

one has really sat down to work out a structure that could be

used without the need of a deep foundation.  I would like  to

ask  the  Minister whether an agency can be tasked with  this

responsibility  of designing a structure  that  can  be  used

uniformly across Singapore without the need of designers  and

contractors  looking  at  it  on a  case-by-case  basis,  and

designing  it  for  that purpose, but to  use  a  lightweight

structure  that  does  not  require  a  deep  foundation  and

therefore to reduce the cost of these linkways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third question is a simple one for the Ministry.

How  does  a  mother with two young children, aged  5  and  2

years,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>



one of whom is in a stroller and the other has to be held  by

the  hand, cross Alexandra Road safely from the Ikea side  to

the Anchorage Condominium on the other side of the road?   By

this,  I  am  referring to the tragic accident that  happened

just before the Lunar New Year, where a Korean mother and her

two  young  children were knocked down.  Most of us  had,  at

some  point  of  time, young children, and  all  of  us  have

experienced  how difficult it is to use overhead  bridges  or

underpasses  because  of  the  steps,  when  we   also   have

groceries,  shopping bags and a stroller  The  difficulty  is

compounded  many  times, to the point where pedestrians  find

that they have no choice but to risk dashing across the road.

Why  can  we  not  install escalators?  Even  the  very  busy

underpasses  under Orchard Road and Scotts Road do  not  have

escalators throughout.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited some cities in Germany in 1980 when I was

studying  in  England.  I was very impressed  that  they  had

escalators  leading  to their subway systems.   They  do  not

operate  all  the time, but are equipped with  pressure  mats

like  those  that  we  have to open automatic  sliding  doors

before  motion detectors became popular.  Sir, when you  step

on  the  mat, the system is activated and it moves.  After  a

while,  the escalator stops to conserve energy.  That was  20

years  ago. Do we have a lower standard of living today  than

that enjoyed by the Germans 20 years ago?

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a fast aging population. Our overhead

bridges and underpasses have to be more elderly friendly  and

less cumbersome for people who are less than fully mobile.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first I would like to

thank all the Members who have spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Dr Michael Lim, Mr Goh Choon Kang and

Mr Yeo Guat Kwang

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>



have  also  spoken on the ERP and the road system.   I  would

like  to  take  them  altogether since they  are  all  inter-related.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin first by highlighting some of the key

challenges  we  face  in  the  future  with  regard  to  land

transport because that is very relevant to the solutions that

we  are  having today and in the future.  Today, Singaporeans

make only about seven million trips a day and already, as  we

all  know, some roads are very congested and during the  peak

hours  the buses are all packed.  We project that the  number

of  daily trips will increase to 10 million by the year 2010,

which  is  a 40% increase from today over the next 10  years.

By  the year 2030, the number of daily trips will increase to

14  million.   That is a doubling over today's number.   Such

significant  increases  would not be  a  problem  if  we  had

plentiful land but, unfortunately, we do not.  About  12%  of

our  limited  land  is  already used by  the  land  transport

infrastructure network.  By comparison, 13% of our total land

is  used  for housing.  This shows that there is very limited

scope  to significantly expand our road network to cater  for

more  vehicular  trips and therefore the cornerstone  of  our

land  transport policy is, and will always be,  an  excellent

mass   public  land  transport  system  that  is  affordable,

efficient,  comprehensive in coverage and  which  can  be  an

attractive alternative to private transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all trips can be made on the rapid transit

system  or  in  buses.  Goods being transported  have  to  be

transported  in  vehicles and these  vehicles  use  the  road

system.   Buses also use the roads and will continue to  have

an  important role  in serving areas not covered by our rapid

transit  system.  Our vehicular population will also continue

to  grow as we cater to the growing demands for business  and

for  the  aspirations of our people to own cars.  But because

of land, and therefore, road constraints, we cannot allow our

vehicle population to grow unfettered.  Nor can we allow  our

roads to be congested that all economic and social activities

come to a halt.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Vehicle Quota System to control the growth of

the  vehicle  population and the ERP system to  control  road

congestion.   These are vital components of the  Government's

overall  land  transport  policy.   They  will  enable   more

Singaporeans  to  own cars whilst ensuring  that  our  roads,

which are like our nation's economic arteries, as pointed out

by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, are kept flowing efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim was concerned about the ERP Phase 2B and

the further expansion of the ERP system. The objective of the

ERP  Phase  2 is to address the increasing traffic congestion

along the arterial roads leading into the existing Restricted

Zone (RZ). Hence,  Phase 2 of the ERP established this second

cordon  along the outer ring roads. As not all the  roads  in

the second cordon are presently congested, LTA will implement

Phase  2  in  stages.   The  first  stage  of  Phase  2   was

implemented  last year in September 1999, and seven  gantries

were implemented at the most congested locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2B, which is on the way, will have 11 to 12

gantries, and this will complete the second cordon.  I  would

like  to assure Dr Lim that we will be very careful and  will

only introduce these gantries when the traffic conditions  at

each  of  these locations become unacceptable.  As Dr Michael

Lim  has  also  pointed out, whenever we have an  ERP  priced

road, it tends to divert traffic to other parts that are  not

ERP-priced.   This  is, of course, to be expected.   I  think

Singaporeans are very aware of the need to control cost.   So

those  who find that the ERP rate may be too high, they  will

seek  other alternative roads.  In fact, this is one  of  the

desired  outcomes of the ERP system.   When one road  is  too

congested  we price it.  Those who find that the  pricing  is

too high would then find alternative roads, or they can shift

their travel times because there is some flexibility there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the ERP system which uses the user-pay principle

has  been  very effective in influencing motorists' behaviour

and has kept the traffic flow on our roads quite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>



manageable in the day time.  However, certain expressways are

beginning  to  show signs of strain during the  peak  evening

hours.   If  necessary, ERP may be extended  to  the  evening

hours  on  these heavily congested roads to ensure  that  the

traffic does not come to a standstill.  LTA is monitoring the

traffic  speeds on the congested expressways in the  evenings

and  will recommend whether we need to introduce evening  ERP

in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Chay and Dr Michael Lim also asked about

alternatives  to ERP.  Other than just simply increasing  the

rate  for  ERP, what are the alternatives?  Sir,  as  I  have

mentioned just now, motorists do have alternatives.  They can

change  their  pattern of travel, their time  of  travel  or,

better still, they can switch to public transport.  In  fact,

we  certainly hope that more motorists will switch to  public

transport over time.   LTA will continue to work closely with

the  Public Transport Council, SMRT and the bus companies  to

ensure  that  the  public  transport  system  is  keeping  up

satisfactorily with the demand.  We will also be speeding  up

construction of  two new expressways and expanding the  rapid

transit system.  I will go into this later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang brought up a few points yesterday. He

referred  to  the  request  that he  made  last  month  about

reducing ERP rates for school holidays or certain periods  of

the  year where travel is less.  As I had informed him in  my

reply,   LTA  will look into his suggestion.  I am  happy  to

inform  the House that LTA has studied the situation and  has

agreed  that it is possible for the ERP rates to  be  revised

during  parts of the year as the travel pattern is definitely

lighter.  This coincides with the school holiday pattern.  As

we all know, many families go away during the school holidays

and  therefore  the roads become noticeably lighter.   So  we

will begin the first trial in June this year to coincide with

the  June  holidays.   The  new rates  will  be  designed  to

maintain  acceptable speeds on the roads.  We may adjust  the

rates  from  time to time, as we do with all  the  other  ERP

rates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang also suggested that we review the ERP

charges  for  the  restricted zones because  during  off-peak

hours he mentioned that certain roads in the restricted  zone

tend  to be very lightly used.  Sir, the speeds measured  for

the  restricted  zone are based on a basket  of  routes  that

cover  both  the busy areas as well as areas which  are  less

busy   or   less   utilised  and  they  are  chosen   to   be

representative of the average traffic conditions  within  the

restricted  zone.   It  is not possible  to  just  isolate  a

particular  road  that  is lightly used  because  within  the

restricted  zone, all the roads are inter-related and  inter-connected.   For example, a certain stretch of  Orchard  Road

may  be  very lightly used but, nonetheless, the  traffic  on

that  stretch  can still end up in Bras Basah Road  or  other

parts of the city and contribute to congestion. So we have to

take  the whole restricted zone as one.  Nonetheless, I  will

ask   LTA  to  monitor  the  situation  closely  within   the

restricted zone and see whether it is feasible to reduce  the

ERP rates during the off-peak hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay yesterday also asked about the ERP and how does

the  ERP  collection  compare with  the  old  Area  Licensing

Scheme.   Sir,  the  ERP  has  resulted  in  a  25%  drop  in

collections versus the previous ALS system.  This  is  before

even accounting for the rebates in road taxes.  The drop is a

very real one.  It is quite substantial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked about the COE quota for this year and

whether  LTA  is  going  to introduce the  recommendation  to

moderate  the peak in the COE supply  by his Committee  which

was  made last year.  Members will be happy to note that  the

COE  supply  will again provide for 3% growth in our  vehicle

population for the Quota Year May 2000 to April 2001.   Based

on  LTA's  computations, the COE quota  for Quota  Year  2000

will  be 109,452.  This is about 61% more than that of  Quota

Year  1999,  and  will be about 50% more  than  that  of  the

current  projection for Quota Year 2001.   Although  the  GPC

chaired  by  Mr  Chay  in its review of  the  VQS  last  year

recommended that we moderate this peak

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>



in  supply,  my Ministry has decided not to do  so.   Let  me

explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because we have implemented the GPC's

recommendation that we use projected deregistrations  of  the

current  year  rather than the actual deregistration  of  the

previous year in computing the new COE supply.  This has  led

to  a  better  match  between supply  and  demand.    As  the

projected  number of deregistrations will be high this  year,

there  is a need to raise the quota correspondingly to  match

the   peak  demand  pattern.   If  the  Government  were   to

arbitrarily  moderate the quota, we run  the  risk  that  the

moderated  quota  may  be too low to  meet  the  demand  from

deregistrations. As a result, this would cause the COE prices

to spiral upwards.  If the actual deregistration figure turns

out  to be higher or lower than what was projected, then next

year's  quota supply will be adjusted accordingly.  LTA  will

be releasing the full details of the annual quota today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay had also asked whether the COE prices for cars

have  stabilised after the merger of the car  COE  categories

from  four to two categories.  During the review of  the  VQS

last  year,  the Committee had noted that the  monthly  quota

size  for  Category  1, which are cars  below  1,000  cc  and

Category  4,  which are cars above 2,000 cc,  was  relatively

small.  It felt that such small quota size was undesirable as

it was likely to lead to greater fluctuations in COE prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the amalgamation of the four categories into two,

the COE prices in Categories A and B have seen some degree of

stability,  as  anticipated  by the  Review  Committee.   For

instance, let me give Members some figures.  During the  past

six  months, the month-to-month fluctuation in the COE prices

in  Category  A ranged from 1% to 13%.  Prior to the  merger,

there  were wide fluctuations in Category 1 COE prices.   For

example,  between October and November 1996, the  fluctuation

was  67% and between February and March 1996, the fluctuation

was  80%.   Between  April and May 1995,  the  month-to-month

fluctuation was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>



134%.   Indeed,  the recommendation of the  Committee  was  a

correct one.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Category B? Category B COE prices have also

stabilised with fluctuations between 1% and 11%.  Previously,

the  fluctuations in Category 4 COE prices went up to as high

as 42%.  So that was a good recommendation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Dr Michael Lim talked about the

CTE  and  the  traffic  access  to  the  North-east  part  of

Singapore  and  also asked what plans we have  for  expanding

both the expressways and rail network.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to relieve the CTE congestion, I am happy to inform

the House that LTA is developing two new expressways, ie, the

Kallang  Expressway (KLE) and its northward extension,  which

is  the  Paya Lebar Expressway (PLE).  The KLE and  PLE  will

provide  an alternative road for people living in the  North-east,  such as in Sengkang and Punggol.  I have asked LTA  to

look   into   speeding  up  the  development  of  these   two

expressways.   As  a result, I think Members  would  be  very

happy  to  know that LTA would be commencing construction  of

both  Expressways early next year, and will complete the  KLE

in 2005 and the PLE in 2006.  LTA will also work closely with

the bus companies to further improve the bus services serving

the  North-east area, so that those motorists who  decide  to

switch   to   public  transport  would  have  an   attractive

alternative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, we will continue to expand the

road  capacity, but there is a limit to this, given our  land

constraints.  Our growing transport needs must be met through

a comprehensive and efficient public transport system, one of

which  is  our  rapid  transit system.  This  will  form  the

backbone of our public transport system in the years to come.

The Government will be developing a comprehensive RTS network

matching  the coverage and convenience of systems in  London,

Tokyo and Paris.  The venture system will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>



comprise  a  close grid-like network of rapid transit  lines.

From  the  city we will have rail lines spanning outwards  to

the  population centres, and there will be an orbital or ring

line  linking  all  the  rail lines, and  this  will  form  a

complete distributed network.  We will have local LRT network

to  provide  links to the MRT network within  HDB  towns  and

between HDB towns.  So this is in reply to Mr Yeo.  Yes, this

will  be  done,  but  of course all this will  take  time  to

deliver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the Government expects to triple the rapid

transit  system  network from today's 91  kilometres  to  270

kilometres by the year 2010.  So in 10 years' time,  you  can

expect tripling, and to again double it to 540 kilometres  by

the year 2030.   Currently, LTA is already working on several

new  lines.   They are the North-east line, the Changi  line,

the Sengkang and the Punggol LRTs, and we are retrofitting  a

new station on the existing East-west line near the Singapore

Polytechnic.   And  soon, work will also  begin  on  the  new

Marina line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that we have put in place

tough  but very necessary vehicle demand management measures.

The  ERP  and the VQS are key components of the overall  land

transport policy framework.  The public transport system  is,

in  fact, the cornerstone of our land transport system.   The

Government  will continue to invest heavily in expanding  our

rapid  transit system, and we will continue to work with  the

bus  companies  to  ensure that there  is  an  efficient  and

attractive  bus  alternative, and  all  these  together  will

enable  us  to keep our car population growing while  keeping

our expressways and arterial roads congestion-free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran yesterday called for more consultation by LTA

when  planning new roads and expressways.  Sir, I agree  with

him  that it would be ideal if the road planners can  consult

everybody,   from   the  conceptualisation   stage   to   the

construction  stage.   But  there are  constraints.   Let  me

explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads are planned and built to support economic and

social activities and to cater

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>



to  traffic growth.  In land scarce Singapore, road  projects

will  inevitably  affect existing land usage  and  buildings.

Thus, when planning and designing a road, the designers  will

carefully examine various alternatives and alignment options.

Their main aim is to minimise the land take in the most cost-effective  manner.   This  is done  very  professionally  and

objectively, since the designers have no vested interests  at

all in the properties along the route.  Furthermore, the road

proposals will be closely scrutinised and are deliberated  at

length  by  the  Master Plan Committee  before  they  can  be

implemented.   The  Committee members comprise  a  number  of

representatives  from Government departments  and  they  will

evaluate  the  proposals based on factors,  such  as  traffic

justification, economic value, land and environmental impact.

Alternative  road  schemes  are  also  examined   for   their

feasibility.  So it is not just one proposal.  There have  to

be various alternatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that the information on which plot of

land  or  which building is going to be affected  by  a  road

scheme is very, very price-sensitive.  Thus, such information

should  not  be  divulged when the detailed design  is  still

under  study and very much likely to be subjected to  change.

If property owners along the proposed route are consulted,  I

think,  first,  we  can  expect the prices  in  the  area  to

fluctuate   very  significantly,  and  we  can  also   expect

objections  from those affected.  I think it is very  natural

for  residents in the area affected to want to  have  a  road

nearby  but  not  to  have  it  affect  them  directly.   The

consultation process will likely result in protracted  delays

to  the  project and maybe even result in the  project  being

abandoned, as we have seen in many countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, before LTA proceeds to implement a road

project,   it  will  brief  the  adviser  of  the  grassroots

organisation   and  even  the  grassroots  leaders   of   the

constituencies  affected, of the implementation  details  and

the schedule of works, so as to prepare them for the oncoming

activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>



LTA  will  also  try to assure them of the  various  measures

which  are  being  taken  to  minimise  inconvenience.    The

consultation  will have an added benefit in  the  sense  that

this  will  allow the adviser and the grassroots  leaders  to

also  offer suggestions on how to minimise the inconvenience.

So this is a very important process which we will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim expressed some concerns about the impact

of the MRT construction on the road system in Sengkang.  Sir,

let  me,  first,  assure him that LTA and HDB  do  work  very

closely  together in planning the road network  for  the  new

towns.   The situation in Sengkang is, I think, quite a  fair

bit  complicated by the fact that just as we are building the

new  town and the new roads, we are also having a very  major

MRT  line going through it all underground.  And we know that

underground construction does pose a lot of complications  to

the road system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Sengkang, it was decided in 1996 that LTA

will  construct some of the internal roads which are affected

by the construction of the North-east line.  This is to allow

better coordination between the construction of the line  and

the  construction  of the roads.  The roads affected  include

Sengkang  East Way, Sengkang Central and Sengkang East  Road,

and I understand these are major roads feeding into Sengkang.

The  roll-out plan for the road infrastructure was worked out

jointly  between  LTA and HDB, taking into consideration  the

pace  of development in these two towns.  Therefore,  LTA  is

aware that a thousand units are being opened each month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sengkang East Way has since been completed by LTA at the

end  of January this year, and LTA has opened one of the  two

lanes in each direction.  I will ask LTA to expedite its work

and  open the remaining lane, both ways, as fast as possible.

Sengkang  Central and Sengkang East Road were  scheduled  for

completion  only  end  of  next year,  and  this  is  because

Sengkang  Central is a two-way road, sitting  directly  above

the North-east line tunnel and the Buangkok station.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>



Obviously, the road cannot be completed until the station has

been completed.  On the other hand, the Sengkang East Road is

affected by the construction of the North-east line depot.  I

will  ask LTA to try to expedite the work there at the North-east  line depot and see whether we can schedule to move  the

completion date for the Sengkang East Road by maybe April  or

mid of next year, instead of December next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Punggol Road, this road, as mentioned by

Dr  Lim, was expanded by HDB to a two-lane dual carriage  way

road.  However, because of the intensive development work  on

both  sides of the road, I think this road tends to  be  very

congested.  Not only that, I understand that there is  a  lot

of illegal parking along the road as well, and this has added

to  the  congestion.  So I will get the LTA to work with  the

relevant  authorities  to see what we can  do  about  illegal

parking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will ask my Minister of State and Parliamentary

Secretary to answer the other questions.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, first, I would

like  to  thank  Assoc. Prof. Toh for  his  kind  remarks  on

measures taken by LTA to improve road safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road safety is a key consideration of LTA. And to that

effect, LTA has set up a special unit called the Road  Safety

Engineering  Unit  which focuses on road safety  engineering.

It will continually review and identify areas for improvement

and help to enhance road safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has also engaged a consultant to carry out road

safety  review for all the expressways.  The review has  been

completed  for  PIE, BKE, CTE and KJE, and it  has  concluded

that  these  expressways have met our stringent  road  safety

standards.   LTA will follow up with some minor modifications

that  the consultants have suggested to further improve  road

safety on these roads.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh asked whether the review can be extended to

other  roads  as soon as possible.  Yes, LTA  also  plans  to

carry  out  road safety review for all existing major  roads,

and  there are about 570 kilometres in length of these  roads

in  Singapore.  So it will take some time and we expect to do

the review perhaps over the next three to five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also asked that LTA tap the feedback and

suggestions of the public to improve road safety.   Yes,  LTA

welcomes public feedback.  The public is encouraged  to  give

their feedback through the LTA hotline or the Feedback Unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the policy for road markings and

signs.  Road signs and markings are important elements in our

road  design for traffic management and to ensure  safety  of

motorists.   LTA  has  a signs manual for  implementing  road

signs  and markings.  The guidelines in the manual were drawn

from  manuals  used overseas, for example, UK and  Australia,

and  adopted for local use.  The manual has been updated from

time  to  time to make it current.  For instance, it  is  now

being amended to include guidelines for the use and placement

of variable message signs (VMS) used in connection with EMAS.

We   did  not  have  VMS  earlier.   The  signs  manual  sets

guidelines  for a number of things.  For example, the  siting

of signs, ie, the distance from the decision point, the types

of  destinations to be included and the order they should  be

displayed,  the size of the letterings for different  speeds,

the   spacing  between  letters  on  the  sign,  the   colour

combinations  for the different types of signs, for  example,

yellow  on  green for expressways, white on green  for  other

roads,  white  on brown for tourist sites,  etc.   Also,  the

specifications  of  the  material  used  are   all   in   the

guidelines.

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High quality materials have been used to ensure their

effectiveness and to minimise maintenance cost.  LTA has used

durable  thermo  plastic painting with glass  beads  as  road

marking material for the lanes along our roads.  This ensures

that the carriageways are well delineated both

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>



in  the  day  and  night.  However, the visibility  of  these

markings  may  be  affected by rain at  night.   One  way  to

overcome this problem is to use cat'-s eyes or road studs, as

proposed  by Prof. Toh.  LTA had used these studs  mainly  to

delineate  some  of the turnoff points to  the  exit  of  the

expressways.  These studs are currently not used on the  main

lanes  on  the  expressways  because  the  safety  impact  on

motorcyclists is still uncertain.  In other words, what would

happen  if motorcyclists ride between lanes or change  lanes.

LTA  will  therefore continue to study the issue closely  and

see  whether  there are other options to address  the  issue.

Earlier,  Prof.  Chin  was proposing  using  studs  to  guide

motorcyclists or impose a discipline on them.  As I said,  we

have to also look at the safety issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for road signs, electro reflective sheetings for road

signs  are  also used to improve their visibility, especially

at  night.   In view of the ageing population, LTA  has  been

progressively upgrading the existing directional signs  along

our  roads and expressways by using better grades of  electro

reflective sheeting.  It also has a programme to upgrade  our

street   name  boards  and  traffic  signs  to  improve   the

visibility of these signs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the maintenance cost. Annually,

about  $2.5  million  is  spent on the  maintenance  of  road

markings  and  another $1 million on the maintenance  of  the

85,000  road  signs  in  Singapore.   The  maintenance  works

include washing, replacement of old and damaged signs.   This

cost  is not high, considering that a good maintenance regime

is  essential to ensure that the road markings and road signs

continue  to  serve  their purposes so  that  safety  of  the

motorists is not compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin commented on the exit and entry points along

expressways.  I assure Prof. Chin that the locations  of  the

entries  and  exits  along  the  expressways  were  carefully

studied  before  construction.  The  present  arrangement  is

considered to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>



optimum,  in  terms of traffic functional requirement,  given

the  land available.  It will be ideal if we could have exits

from the entrance to expressways spread out.  This would  cut

down  confluence and convergence.  However, with our  limited

land  and dense expressway network intersecting major  roads,

junctions  are frequent and necessary.  In general,  we  will

prevent access to expressways from the minor roads.  However,

in  the  case  of CTE, which he has brought up,  we  have  to

provide  for the connection to the major roads, such as  from

Braddell  Road  and PIE.  If we do not do  so,  then  traffic

intending to join or leave the CTE has to go to the  adjacent

parallel roads, such as Thomson Road or Upper Serangoon Road,

where  traffic conditions are also heavy.  The congestion  at

the  CTE  between PIE and Braddell is mainly due to the  very

high  volume  of  traffic  and partly  also  because  traffic

exiting at Braddell is backed up to the expressway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I note that Prof. Chin's real concern is

the  way  in  which we can reduce the traffic congestion.   I

would  like  to  inform him that the LTA  is  constructing  a

vehicular underpass along Braddell Road.  This underpass will

be  ready by December 2002 and will improve the situation  at

the  interchange  between the CTE  and  Braddell  Road.   LTA

expects  that, with the underpass in place, more  green  time

would be available to allow traffic from the CTE to exit into

Braddell Road, thereby easing the congestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bad driving habits, LTA will step up its education

programme.  I believe that is what Prof. Chin would  like  to

see,  ie, more education.  And LTA will continue to work with

the  Traffic  Police and other relevant agencies  to  educate

drivers  on  good driving habits and discourage  bad  driving

habits,  including dangerous lane switching  and  tailgating.

Prof.   Chin  has  also  suggested  using,  what  he   calls,

"chevron". Basically, it is a  safe-distance guide marking on

expressways  to allow motorists to keep a safe  distance.   I

would  ask  LTA to look into his suggestion.  LTA  will  also

study,  perhaps  instead  of studs, whether  raised  pavement

markers can be used to discourage dangerous lane switching.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Prof. Chin's concern about fog lamps,

these  lamps are designed to project a low and diffused light

to assist the drivers to see road markings more clearly under

foggy conditions when visibility is very poor.  The authority

decided  to  allow the installation of fog lamps  to  improve

visibility  following the bad haze experience  in  1994.   If

approved  fog lamps are properly installed, they  should  not

blind  other road users.  LTA has advised vehicle  owners  on

the  proper design and installation of the fog lamps.  During

the  mandatory periodic inspection, vehicle owners  would  be

required to remove or cover the lamps, if their vehicles  are

found  with  unapproved or improperly  installed  fog  lamps.

Nevertheless, the LTA will continue to monitor the  situation

closely  and, if necessary, step up enforcement of unapproved

or improperly installed fog lamps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now, I come to Mdm Claire Chiang's issue. She

brought  up  the  issue  of  safe transportation  for  school

children again.  I share Mdm Chiang's concern over the safety

of  our school children when travelling in school buses.  But

she  seems  to  think that the safety of the school  children

taking  school bus is compromised.  I would like to reiterate

to her that their safety is not compromised.  That is because

we  have  at  the moment a number of measures.  Firstly,  for

instance,  we  require the bus to fulfil stringent  technical

requirements.  Secondly, we require the bus drivers to have a

vocational  licence  and  medical  check-ups.   Thirdly,   we

require  the bus to have a bus attendant.  Fourthly, the  bus

cannot exceed the speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour.  All

these  measures  have helped us to maintain the  good  safety

record that we have.  But, nevertheless, it is always good to

see how we can look for other ways to enhance road safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would ask LTA to do three things. Firstly, I would

ask  LTA  to monitor the safety records closely and  look  at

trends  and  indications  whether  safety  is  being  eroded.

Secondly, I would ask LTA to discuss with MOE and school  bus

operators to find cost effective ways to enhance the  safety.

To Mdm Claire

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>



Chiang,  perhaps she does not mind paying.  But I  think  the

cost  effectiveness  and cost levels  must  be  a  legitimate

concern.  If there is a diminishing return, I do not think it

is  wise to do something which may not be necessary.  But  we

will  look  at  how  we can reduce cost,  for  instance,  for

installing  seat belts or back padding, and so on.   And,  if

necessary,  I would enlist her help to look at how  the  cost

issues  can be addressed.  Thirdly, I would also ask  LTA  to

step  up  the training of the school bus attendants  and  the

enforcement of their responsibilities.  So I think these  are

the  things  that  we  can do instead of mandating  that  all

school  buses must install seat belts.  Because,  as  I  have

said  before,  from  our preliminary calculations,  the  cost

implications are not a small one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked how we plan public

transport and bus services in HDB new towns.  At the planning

stage  of  a  new HDB town, the bus operator responsible  for

providing  bus  services  for  the  town  would  put  up  the

conceptual  bus plan based on the bus service  guidelines  of

the  Public Transport Council.  The bus plan would take  into

account HDB's inputs on the size of the town, ultimate number

of  dwelling units, estimated population, land use  and  road

system  for the town.  Bus stop locations are also identified

during the planning stage and are indicated in a road-related

facilities  plan.  The authorities concerned,  HDB  and  LTA,

make provisions for these facilities at the development stage

when  the  roads  are constructed.  There is an  inter-agency

committee  and they meet quarterly and all these  issues  are

discussed  and  implemented.   In  the  initial  stage   when

residents start moving into the town, the bus operator  would

implement bus routes to the CBD and other employment  centres

as  well  as  links  to  the  MRT  station,  interchange  and

amenities  in  nearby towns.  The operator is  provided  with

HDB's  staging  plans  for the town's  development  and  will

introduce  more bus routes in tandem with the growth  of  the

town.  Routes are planned in accordance with the travel needs

of  residents which are assessed through surveys  at  various

stages of the town's development.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about the premium bus service. The

premium bus service serves a niche requirement and it  serves

to  complement  the trunk service provided by  the  main  bus

operator.   If  necessary,  we  can  always  introduce   such

services.  He mentioned about the publicity of such services.

Yes, I would ask LTA to look into how we can get the operator

to  publicise  them  and  to ensure that  their  numbers  are

displayed properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked about the bus shelters' design.

Bus  shelters  are designed taking into account  construction

and  maintenance cost as well as comfort for commuters.  Most

bus shelters today are three metres wide.  Newer bus shelters

have  been  installed  with panels  which  serve  to  shelter

commuters from the rain.  Presently, about a quarter  of  all

bus  shelters  have such panels.  The design and construction

materials of the shelters will continue to be reviewed by the

LTA  so  as to improve comfort for commuters while minimising

costs.   We welcome any new ideas that Members have that  can

contribute to a better design.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rain shelters, LTA recognises the plight of the

motorcyclists during heavy downpours and has thus constructed

rain  shelters  under  flyovers  for  their  use.  These  are

concrete  bays, located away from the traffic flow to  ensure

the safety of all motorists.  LTA has provided these shelters

under all flyovers where space permits.  LTA will continue to

improve  the existing rain shelters by expanding the bays  to

accommodate more motorcyclists, where possible.  It will also

explore   ways   to   overcome  space  constraints,   without

compromising  the safety of motorists. In view  of  our  high

rainfall,  motorcyclists should also be  prepared  by  having

raincoats at hand in case of inclement weather.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked me to update him on the progress of

upgrading  of  bus  shelters.  In Phase I, LTA  has  upgraded

nearly 900 bus shelters and there are more than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>



3,000  bus  shelters to go. LTA will carry out the  upgrading

over the next four years and the plan is for LTA to call  for

tenders  and  to  ask the contractors to  design,  build  and

operate  these  shelters.  LTA will, of course,  specify  the

locations and the design specifications for the bus shelters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong raised three issues. Firstly, he asked about the

pavement  design.   With  regard to standardised  design  for

footpaths and pavements, I agree with Mr Ong that this  would

make  sweeping by mechanised road-sweepers easier.  LTA  has,

in fact, already introduced such guidelines. However, many of

the  existing pavements were built way before we standardised

their  designs, hence, the variety of different  layouts  and

characteristics, as pointed out by Mr Ong.  As most of  these

footpaths are still in good condition, it would be a waste of

public funds to reconstruct them to the latest standards.  We

will  replace  them when necessary and, in the meantime,  LTA

will  discuss  with ENV on ways to improve the efficiency  of

mechanical road sweeping for these older pavements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On linkway design, for the linkways built by LTA, LTA

has  adopted a few standard designs of basic form.   However,

these  covered linkways are often connected to a  variety  of

different  amenities of different designs.  Hence,  there  is

also  a need to see that the covered linkways can be designed

to  blend in with the surroundings.  LTA tries to maintain  a

balance  between  the  two.  As for linkways  built  by  town

councils  between flats and other buildings, HDB  has,  since

1997,  provided  15  designs of linkways for  town  councils'

reference  to  assist  them  and  their  consultants  in  the

construction of linkways.  The designs have been standardised

to   expedite  processing  time  and  cut  down  cost,  which

addresses  Mr Ong's concern, and at the same time, provide  a

sufficient variety of choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked whether we can install escalators on

overhead  pedestrian  crossings and underpasses.   Escalators

have been provided for many pedestrian overhead bridges which

are connected to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>



shopping centres. The reasons for installing them at shopping

centres   are,  firstly,  the  heavy  usage  by  pedestrians;

secondly,  the  mechanical and electrical equipment  will  be

under cover and protected from rainwater; and thirdly, if the

escalators break down due to faults or vandalism,  there  are

the  security personnel at the shopping centres to  put  them

back into operation quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For expressways, we will build pedestrian bridges or

underpasses  with  ramps.  For  other  overhead  bridges  and

underpasses, we will look into the various factors,  such  as

site   constraint   for  ramps,  vehicular  traffic   volume,

pedestrian  traffic volume, cost-effectiveness of  escalators

and their operational problems, and review how safety and the

need  to cater to the elderly can be met.  I believe  I  have

answered all the questions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, Prof. Chin has made a call to MCIT and

LTA  to  review the way we treat offences.  I would  like  to

thank Prof. Chin for his thoughtful suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the introduction of the

administrative  surcharge as a first stage  in  dealing  with

certain   ERP  violations  actually  arose  from  a   similar

suggestion made by Prof. Chin at the debate in the  Committee

of  Supply last year.  Here, I would like to point  out  that

Prof. Chin's latest suggestion is somewhat different from his

earlier  one.  The  rationale for  the  introduction  of  the

administrative surcharge for ERP violations was  premised  on

the  fact  that  ERP enforcement is almost 100%.  Hence,  any

violation  is mainly due to forgetfulness or carelessness  on

the  part  of the motorists. This is not the case  for  other

offences, such as eating at MRT stations, when enforcement is

more   difficult  and  we  would  have  to  rely  on   public

cooperation not to dirty our trains and MRT stations.   While

SMRT  would like to avoid fining commuters, sometimes  it  is

necessary  to  drive home the point that  people  should  not

engage in such inconsiderate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>



behaviour.  But, nonetheless, Prof. Chin's suggestion  is  an

interesting one which I would ask LTA to look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh has asked whether my Ministry has any plans to

encourage  the use of more environmentally friendly  cars  on

our  roads.  It  is  indeed  true that  today,  there  is  an

increasing awareness of the environmental pollution caused by

the  combustion  of conventional fuels. Some  countries  have

embarked  on  the development of green vehicles that  utilise

alternative fuels. Such green vehicles include electric, fuel

cell and hybrid vehicles.  Recent technological advances have

placed such vehicles closer to reality and some have actually

become available for sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a land transport perspective, we have no objections

to  the  use of green vehicles on our roads, as long as  they

meet  established safety standards. As these  green  vehicles

also  occupy  road space and they contribute  to  congestion,

they will be subjected to the same registration and licensing

requirements  for conventional vehicles. As such,  all  green

vehicles  will  similarly be required  to  pay  COE  and  ERP

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we recognise that these vehicles are less pollutive

at  the  point of usage, as compared to conventional vehicles

using  petroleum-based  fuels.   Therefore,  my  Ministry  is

examining  if tax incentives should be provided, as suggested

by  Prof.  Toh,  to promote their use in Singapore.  We  will

carefully  study  this  together with  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment and Ministry of Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to thank both Dr Lily Neo and Mr

Gerard  Ee for making a call for a scheme for older  cars  or

cars  older than 20 years old. Today, as we know, there is  a

vintage car scheme where special tax concessions are given to

cars  manufactured  before 1940. Under a  restricted  scheme,

these  vintage cars enjoy COE exemption and, in return,  they

may  only be used for a maximum of 28 days a year. There  are

about 100 vintage cars in Singapore. Internationally, cars

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>



manufactured   during  the  pre-war  period   are   generally

recognised   as   vintage  cars.   However,   there   is   no

international  agreement on what constitutes a  classic  car.

Some  clubs and associations use a criterion where  cars  are

deemed  classic if they were manufactured more than 20  years

ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are currently about 31,000 cars

above  20  years of age.  I am sure Members will  agree  that

31,000  is  quite  a large number and that not  all  of  them

possess  a heritage value.  In fact, it is very difficult  to

assess the heritage value of these cars.  Therefore, we  must

be  very cautious about granting any concessions for  such  a

large  group  of  cars  as this would greatly  undermine  our

existing    policies   which   are   tough   but   necessary.

Furthermore, we do not want a situation where there  are  too

many  old cars on our streets as owners take advantage  of  a

generous concession scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For owners who do not want to use their cars on a

regular  basis,  there  is an existing  off-peak  car  scheme

(OPC).  Under this scheme, owners pay reduced taxes in return

for  using their cars during off-peak periods.  Moreover,  as

we  further  shift the balance between the  upfront  cost  of

owning  a car to usage cost via the ERP and road tax rebates,

the  financial burden for the retention of these classic cars

under  the OPC will further be minimised. Car owners and  car

enthusiasts may wish to consider the OPC scheme,  which  will

help them to reduce cost somewhat although, obviously, not to

the same extent as  complete COE exemption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult for us to justify COE exemption or the

payment  of  a lower PQP for this large group of 31,000  cars

when  their  heritage value cannot be ascertained objectively

and  definitively.   The COE, as has been  explained  by  the

Minister,  is  a  basic  component of  vehicle  ownership  in

Singapore. COE exemption is given only to a select  group  of

vehicles that include scheduled buses, emergency vehicles and

those for the handicapped.  Hence, any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>



treatment  for  cars  over 20 years  old  must  be  evaluated

against  the  adverse impact they would have on  our  overall

vehicle quota system.  However, my Ministry will continue  to

review  the feasibility of having a classic class scheme  and

what this would entail for Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, I

did  also  ask  the Ministry whether they could  give  us  an

update  on  the effectiveness of the KJE and if  it  will  be

extended  to other expressways.  Could I ask if Dr John  Chen

has an answer to that also?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I have answered him. The

consultants have told us that the road resistance is good for

this  expressway and we have passed with flying colours.   It

will  be extended to other expressways. At the moment,  about

26%  of  our expressways are already surfaced with  this  new

material.  It  is  called drainage mix and  it  drains  water

faster  and as a result of this drainage, it is less wet  and

therefore of higher resistance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, could the MOS address the question

whether  with  more stringent annual vehicle inspections,  he

could  consider  removing the premium on road  tax  for  cars

older than 10 years?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> We will certainly consider

all these suggestions given by Mr Gerard Ee on whether or not

such  a  scheme will be viable. But again, we want to  remind

Members that we have to balance this against the need for  us

to maintain a car population which is of a certain age and to

also  ensure  that  our  roads  are  well-utilised  and   not

congested.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

giving   me   this  opportunity  to  seek   a   very   simple

clarification  from  the  Minister.  The  Minister   actually

touched  upon the merger of COE categories in his  reply  and

has  said that it is a good proposal because it brings  about

very stable COE prices. May I remind him that in the Question

for  Oral  Answer,  I  actually asked a similar  question  on

merger of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>



COEs and the MOS has replied to my question on the impact  of

the  merger of COE categories, that is, the merger was  based

on   non-budgetary  consideration.   In  fact,  it  would  be

possible  that the merging of the COE categories  will  bring

about a lowering of revenue collected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek a clarification on page 18 of the

Budget  Statement  for FY2000.  It says, "Revenue  for  motor

vehicles  taxes  is expected to increase  by  35.5%  to  $1.6

billion and this is due to more COEs released for quota  year

1999  and the registration of more vehicles with higher  open

market  value following the merger of the COE categories  and

also  the recovery of the economy."  May I ask how could  the

Ministry,  once  again,  under-estimate  the  impact  on  the

revenue   collected  following  the  merging   of   the   COE

categories?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the reply given by my MOS to Dr

Wang is correct.  The merging of the four categories into two

categories is not because of budgetary reasons. We did not do

that  in  order  to  raise more revenue.  So  the  answer  is

correct.  My point to Mr Chay is also correct when  he  asked

whether  there  is  stability and whether it  has  helped  to

stabilise the COE prices. As the figures have shown, what the

GPC Review Committee had expected has come true, that is,  by

merging  the  four  categories into two,  it  has  helped  to

stabilise COE prices. As to why there is an increase  in  the

COE  collections, the answer is very simple. As  stated,  the

number of quotas for 1999 has been much higher than in  1998.

Secondly,  as the economy has recovered, the COE prices  also

recovered.  Most car dealers will tell you that if  you  want

to know about COE prices, look at the stock market.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I am actually referring to the

operative   words  in  the  statement  that   says   ".   the

registration  of more vehicles with higher open market  value

following the merger of the COE categories."

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Which page is it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> It is at page 18, paragraph 4 or 5.

In  other  words, the merging of the two categories  actually

resulted in registration of vehicles with higher open  market

value, ie, bigger cars.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, with the merging of the two

categories, the advantage is that the user can decide whether

he  wants, with the same COE, to purchase a higher value  car

or  a  lower  value  car.  In the past, we forced  people  to

compete  in the small category and having bidded successfully

for  Category 1, they have no choice but to buy a small  car.

Now, they can decide whether they want to buy a bigger car or

a smaller car.  It shows that the market prefers a bigger car

and,  of course, a bigger car has a higher open market value.

That is the consequence and there is a choice, not because of

our  intention of trying to rake in more revenue, but  it  is

actually to allow Singaporeans to have more choices.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I inform the Minister of

State  that  some Singaporeans are indeed very  happy  to  be

forced  to  compete in the small car category.   Today,  they

have no choice but to buy larger capacity vehicles.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the Minister has also shown

the  Member  the pitfalls of the small number  of  quota  for

category  1.   And  if we have a very small number,  the  COE

prices  tend  to fluctuate, and that is not  good.   For  any

system, if there are large fluctuations in prices, it is  not

good.  On  top  of that, experience has shown  that  the  COE

prices for Category 1 were not too far behind the Category  2

prices and, at times, exceeded the Category 2 prices.  So  we

made  a  judgment  and we feel that by merging,  we  actually

eliminate the pitfalls and provide more choices.  If we  look

at it as a whole, we feel that it is a better system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Sir, I just like to seek clarification on

the subject of premium on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>



road  tax.  I have always thought that the ERP was introduced

to  deal  with  congestion, and the vehicle quota  system  to

control  the  car  population.  Having introduced  these  two

measures, is there still relevance for a premium on road tax,

other  than penalising those who cannot afford to buy  a  new

car and have to keep their cars for a further 10 years?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I believe the premium

that Mr Ee spoke about is for people who want to retain older

cars.   The  reason why that is in place is that we  want  to

ensure  that  we  have a relatively young car  population  in

Singapore.   That is the policy that we have  adopted.   But,

certainly, in view of the call now to consider whether or not

there  is  provision  for older cars in  Singapore,  we  will

consider  all these factors in our review on the  feasibility

of having a classic car scheme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I just like to reiterate that the

stability of COE prices has been brought about at a price, in

other words, at a price that some Singaporeans are unable  to

purchase small cars of their own choice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the price of a COE and the price

of  a  car are very much related to the state of the economy.

When the economy is doing very well, when people are keen  to

buy  new cars, they bid up the price of the COE.  At the same

time,  having got the COE, they now have to decide what  sort

of  car they want to buy.  Do they buy a cheap import  or  do

they buy a European import that may be double the price?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the economy did very well. Whereas in the

past, a person with, say, category A, may have bought a small

car,  but  because  of the better state of  the  economy,  he

decides to buy a car which is of a higher value, and he  gets

a  higher  OMV.  So, the system is one which is very open and

it  gives the consumers the ultimate choice  -  how  much  to

bid, what to buy and how much to pay for the car.  It

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>



is  all within his control, and he has to buy something  that

fits  his budget and pocket.  And having got the COE, if they

decide to buy a better car, who are we to prevent them?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, from my experience of buying

cars, most people will decide, first of all, what kind  of  a

car  they would like to buy.  I do not think people  will  go

and  bid  for a COE and having got a COE, then decide whether

they  want  to  buy a small car, a big car or a  luxury  car.

Having  obtained a COE, within a period of six months, unless

I  strike a lottery, I am unlikely to buy a bigger car than I

originally planned to do so.  I think the sequence  that  the

Minister  has illustrated is completely the reverse  of  what

ordinary Singaporeans would do when purchasing cars.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I have tried to simplify it for

the  Member.  Basically, when a person buys a car, first,  he

does  not  even  bid for the COE, which is why the  Committee

came  out with this proposal to have open bidding so that  we

can  encourage more Singaporeans to bid and therefore  be  in

better  control.  But the decision is made based on  what  is

the COE price and, ultimately, what is the total price of the

car, which is why I said it depends on what is his budget and

what he can afford from his pocket.  And that is the ultimate

cost all roped in  -  COE, OMV, taxes, the whole works, which

is the price of the car on the road.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I agree with Dr

Wang  that  the  decision to buy a car is made  first  before

getting  a COE.  But I want to go back to the point that  the

Minister of State made on price fluctuations.  In my opinion,

why do we not let market forces decide, rather than we try to

control  price fluctuations. On one occasion, the  COE  price

dropped  to $50 and $50,000 on another occasion.   We  should

let  the  market decide and if people decide to bid  in  that

way, I think we should let it be and give the flexibility  to

the market.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, that is precisely what we

are doing, to let the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>



market decide what cars they want to buy.  Let me ask  you  a

question.   How many COEs should we give to small cars?   Who

is going to decide?  You or the market?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could the Member please address the Chair?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sorry, Sir. Let me remind

Members  that before the merger, the numbers for  category  1

over  the  years were dropping.  And just before the  merger,

the number was only 100-plus a month.  It was getting smaller

and  smaller.   Is  that desirable?  And why  is  the  number

getting  smaller  and smaller?  Because  we  have  allowed  a

mechanism via the open category to allow the market to decide

what  choice  of  cars people want to buy, and  that  is  the

signal we were receiving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh said that he agrees with Dr Wang

that  the people would decide what car to buy first.  I agree

with  him.  That is also what happened under the new  system,

which shows that people prefer to buy a higher cc car.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

letting me join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we made this recommendation in the VQS report, we

have always been haunted by this issue.  Actually, one of the

terms  of  reference  of  the VQS study,  I  want  to  remind

Members, is the stability in the quota prices.  As a term  of

reference, that was one of the considerations.  It was not  a

budgetary or fiscal revenue collection consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure, as rightly pointed out by the Minister of

State,  for  Category A, below 1,000 cc, was  actually  very,

very  small.   As  the figure gets smaller and  smaller,  the

tendency for fluctuation in value becomes very high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ang Mo Kio asked about why do we not let

the  market  decide.  Precisely, there was  this  problem  of

great fluctuations in the prices of COE  -  we had an outcome

of $50 and so on  -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>



and this was one of the issues that we wanted to address.   I

would just like to make this clarification that the stability

in  the COE prices was one of the considerations in the terms

of reference.  It was never a budgetary or revenue collection

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is on the open market value. Actually,

if  the consumer wants to, he can still buy a smaller car and

the  OMV would be small, even in the present situation.   But

then the question is, what is the COE price that he will have

to  bid?   The principle on which the Committee went  by  was

that  every user of the road is occupying a certain space  on

the  road and should be considered equally, not just  because

somebody  says his is a smaller car, therefore, he should  be

charged  at  a  lower  rate.  If we want  to  address  equity

reasons, then let us address it through differential rates of

taxation, road tax for cars and so on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, as far as I can recall, we only

had  one  point  in  history  where  the  COE  prices  really

fluctuated  from  a big amount to $50.  Other  than  that,  I

think  throughout  the time the COE system  has  worked,  the

prices  were determined by market forces.  In my opinion,  if

we  had  continued  with the old categories  and  let  market

forces  decide on how to distribute the number of quotas  for

the  various  categories, I do not think we  will  see  major

price fluctuations, as what the suspicion is.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I shall close the debate by having

the last word.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we follow what Mr Singh has said, I think we are

going  to  be  in for a lot of trouble.  His closing  remarks

were  to  let the market decide on the distribution.   If  we

take it to the ultimate, we will only have one category.   Is

that what Mr Singh is proposing?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Why not?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I will remember that in the future.

In  any  case, as regards price fluctuations, as I  mentioned

just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>



now,  under  the old scheme, the fluctuations  were  actually

quite  significant, going up to 160% at one stage,  month  to

month.  I do not think that is really in the interest of  the

consumers,  because  I  understand  that  most  of  the   car

companies  take a buyer's order with the provision  that  the

final  price would depend very much on the COE price.   If  a

car  buyer works with a limited budget and the COE  price  is

jumping like crazy and is going upwards, I think he is  going

to  be  on  tenterhooks.  So, it is better  that  we  have  a

system,  as proposed by the committee, that still allows  the

market to decide what is the final price for the COE, and yet

having a big enough quota number so that while the market can

decide, the fluctuation tends to be a little bit less.   That

does  not  mean that there is no fluctuation.  If  the  stock

market  is going to triple tomorrow, I am sure the COE prices

will likewise go up quite significantly, maybe not triple but

definitely not in the current range of up to 11% or so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think hon. Members can continue this

discussion  over  tea  later.   We  have  got  to  move   on.

Otherwise, we will not be able to finish with this amendment.

Prof. Toh, can you move to your topic?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, moving on from earth-bound issues to something a little more airy, literally - we live in an environment of liberalisation, deregulation and

globalisation.   Some  of the main philosophies  in  such  an

environment  is that we have regulators who are  transparent,

who  would  promote good governance in the market and  ensure

that  regulators  are impartial in all that  they  do.   And,

ultimately,  of  course, there must be market  efficiency  in

services  that are provided.  We have moved in this direction

in  many  areas.  In the port, for example, we have decoupled

the  regulator from the port operator.  So PSA and  MPA  were

born.   In  the National Computer Board before it was  merged

into the IDA, they had interest in a certification authority.

But  when  the NCB became the regulator, they divested  their

interest in Netrust.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>



And  we have also taken pains to divest the telecoms operator

from the telecoms regulator, and the broadcast regulator from

the  broadcast operator.  I just want to ask why we have  not

done  this  for the airport and therefore this  is  something

that  makes it an anomaly, not just internationally, but even

in Singapore itself.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the Port of Singapore is ranked

as the busiest port in the world in terms of shipping tonnage

as well as the top bunkering port.  PSA Corporation made $1.1

billion of profit before tax out of a revenue of $2.3 billion

in  1998/99.  To me, this also means that there is plenty  of

room  for competition for the regional ports  to compete with

Singapore.   What  is  the  Minister's  view  regarding   the

potential  threats to these ports including  Tanjong  Pelapas

and Port Klang?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, our seaport has

all  along been our pride.  Credit must be given to  all  our

cargo operators, the PSA group and all the port workers.  Our

port has now enjoyed a reputation as one of the busiest ports

in  the  world and it has won praises from all quarters.  For

this  reason, our seaport has become the favourite  and  true

love  of the ocean shippers in this region.  However, we  are

troubled   by   recent  media  reports  that  some   shipping

companies,  including NOL, are beginning to be unfaithful  to

us.  They  are falling out and they have forsaken  their  old

love for the new love and singing "Good-bye, my love" to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These rumours are very strong. We keep reading it in the

newspapers.   The names of third parties such as  Port  Klang

and  Tanjong Pelapas are mentioned again and again. It  looks

as though they will soon become the new loves of the maritime

industry  in  this region.  I would like to know whether  the

Government  has any good policy  to ward off the advances  of

the  third  party  so  that we will not be  forsaken  by  the

shippers.  Will  the  Maritime and  Port  Authority  consider

opening some of our berths  for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>



shipping companies to operate and manage, like the way it  is

done in Hong Kong?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister's  view  with regard to the privatisation  of  berth

operations.   There  are several new ports  emerging  in  the

region  threatening to take away business from the  Singapore

port.   Of course, at present, the Port of Singapore is still

ranked  No.  1  and support services in Singapore  are  still

superior  compared  to  the  regional  ports.   However,  the

prospect of major shipping companies moving over to privately

operated berths in Tanjong Pelapas poses questions of whether

the  time is now ripe for some of our own berths in our ports

to be leased out to private shipping companies to operate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain advantages for berth operations to be

privatised.  Shipping companies can lease their berths for  a

period  of  time.  Since they have to pay for this they  will

have to maximise efficiency down the supply chain to maximise

value.  They can also plan to maximise the use of berths  and

plan  their turnaround time for mother and feeder vessels  to

and  from  the region.  There is no doubt that  the  Port  of

Singapore  is  doing well.  There is also  the  need  to  see

beyond tomorrow,

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, actually, I was

going to suggest that we use the cashcard instead of the toll

coupon  for  our motorists to go through the Causeway.   But,

the  Ministry has already made an announcement on this a  few

days ago.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the

Minister  for  giving us this good news.  But I  have  a  few

questions to ask the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some motorists have already purchased a lot of these

toll   coupons.  They have not finished using them.  Although

the  Ministry said they can be refunded, there is  an  expiry

date  for these toll coupons.  Secondly, they have to  go  to

the  Ministry for the refund. Can we allow them to go to  the

petrol  stations  or some other outlets to get  a  refund  on

their  unused toll coupons?  This will be more convenient  to

them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, although at various times it has

been  said that, with the explosion going on in the world  of

the Internet and e-commerce, the hottest thing in the not too

distant  future  is  the  battle for  bandwidth.   Yet  I  am

concerned  about  the  state of our broadband  Singapore  One

project.   There  are today about 30,000 subscribers  to  the

Singapore  One  broadband  multimedia  since  it  was   first

launched  commercially  in June 1998.   There  is  a  general

perceived  lack  of  value  in our broadband  content.   Many

people get dissatisfied with the service and switched back to

the  narrow  banding Internet service.  My  concern  is  also

because  of  the  high rate of technological obsolescence  in

this  field.  Why have we not been able to develop a sizeable

customer base to sustain the viability of the project?   This

customer  base is said to be around 200,000.   How  does  the

agency  intend to go about developing this?  Is there a  time

frame and content development to reach this base?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the present scheme of charges for the SCV and

Magix access is too high.  Perhaps to give the industry  more

scope  for business development, the Minister should consider

separating  the  infrastructure  provider  from  the  content

providers.   For  example, a service  provider  can  run  the

infrastructural  facilities leasing  out  the  bandwidth  and

leaving  the multimedia content business to others.  In  this

way, we can give a more focused efficiency to players in  the

industry and to give value to the customers.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I have the same

concerns  as Mr Chay.  We have for many years now a broadband

capability called Singapore One. At the rate technology  goes

obsolete  in  this  new  economy, I fear  that  we  might  be

building  a  while elephant, a monument to a grandiose  dream

that  was  not meant to be.  I know there is a  lot  of  talk

about how effective and how useful  broadband would be and  I

think we need to do something about this base of 30,000  that

is not attractive to entrepreneurs providing content, because

with  30,000  people they do not sell many, many  things  and

they are not going to come to  Singapore.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>



other than the issue which Mr Chay raised about lowering  the

cost  for the end users, I certainly agree with him that  the

Government  should look into making it cheaper for  the  end-users.    Right  now,  cable-modem  and  ASDL  are  the   two

technologies  used   -   perhaps we can  look  into  wireless

technology  and  allowing for some kind of  competition  that

will drive down the prices, and perhaps for Government to pay

for  the  infrastructure in the same way that we pay for  the

infrastructure in MRT and allow the operator to recover  just

the operation revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing about the broadband technology we have

is  that  I  think people forget that the real issue  is  not

technology. We have the technology and we have the best  that

can  meet  the world's competition on technology.   They  say

that  Bill  Gates  is not really a technology  genius.   Bill

Gates is a marketing genius.  I think that we do not have the

marketing genius where Singapore One is concerned.   We  have

not been able to sell it well enough.  We have not publicised

it  enough in the international arena perhaps and we get very

little  response  also partly because the base  is  just  too

small.   So  how  do  we enlarge this  base  and  how  do  we

publicise  this  infrastructure so that the world  will  come

rushing down to our doorstep.  Perhaps we need a Li Ka  Shing

or Richard Li?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I agree with the views

expressed by Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Prof. Toh. In this era  of

Information technology, information and knowledge travel very

fast from one part of the world to another.  News on what  is

happening  in  this  part of the world  is  transmitted  very

quickly to another part of the world.  As such, we must speed

up  our efforts to equip our people with at least some  basic

knowledge  in  IT  so that they would be  able  to  use  this

network to obtain all the information they want, quickly  and

accurately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broadband network is a very important

infrastructure.  If we say that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>



the  land  transport system is like blood vessels,  then  the

broadband  is like the nervous system in the body.   We  must

spread  it  throughout the nation and everyone would  have  a

feel  of  what  is happening in the world in  order  to  make

appropriate responses promptly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government is financing the development and

construction of the land transport system, the MRT system and

the  telephone system, why is it that the Government has  not

considered  financing  the  installation  of  the   broadband

network  infrastructure,  so that broadband  access  is  more

affordable to our people? From what I know, SCV's charge  for

use of the broadband is almost double that of Hong Kong's.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the Internet

revolution  has  taken the world by storm  but  to  date  the

English language is the predominant language of the Internet.

Increasingly  it  has become clear that Internet  development

will  take place in other languages.  The trends seem clearly

to  indicate the number of people who are going to use  their

native  languages  to access the Internet  will  increase  in

future.   In  fact,  recently  the  National  University   of

Singapore  spawned  off  as  an  individual  business   which

provides  registration of domain names  in  other  languages.

Similarly,   MITA  in  the past has  encouraged  the  use  of

Chinese  Internet by setting up the Chinese Internet Steering

Committee  which has now been spawned off as a  business.  In

fact,  I  was  very happy that recently Singaporean  Business

Enterprises  has got together and spawned off  Huayi.net.  In

view  of the new development and the future prospects on  the

Internet  in terms of usage by different languages,  I  would

like the Minister to tell us what are the plans that MCIT, in

particular, IDA has, for the future development of  Internet,

particularly   in  the  Singapore  context  for   the   three

languages, which are Chinese, Malay and Tamil.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Minister Yeo Cheow

Tong announced recently that the Government has planned

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>



to  allocate $25 million in the next three years to give away

second-hand personal computers to 30,000 low income  families

and  to allow them to surf the Net for free.  This is a  very

good idea.  At the same time, every Singaporean above the age

of  45  years  will  be provided with an e-mail  account  and

personal  website,  thereby narrowing  the  gap  between  the

computer savvy and the computer illiterate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, the business community is better informed of

what  is happening in the world through the Internet  and  e-mail.   Through the use of personal computers, they can  gain

access  to a wealth of knowledge and information.  Therefore,

we must be computer-literate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has been offering training on the use of computer

to  the  workers.  Now that almost every family has a PC  and

the fact that housewives and senior citizens are in the habit

of  watching television programmes, the Ministry may want  to

work  hand in hand with TCS to produce some documentaries  on

the  use  of computers and information technology, and  teach

them  how  to  surf  the  Net.  This is  more  effective  and

economical than  employing  2,500 computer experts to  go  to

the  RC  centres  and teach the people there.   We  can  also

cooperate with TCS to telecast to our residents, particularly

the  lower income people, the latest news on network updates,

and recommendations on interesting sites on the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In China, there are regular TV programmes on the latest

developments  on  information  technology.   These  are  very

informative  and  interesting programmes. It  will  help  the

people  to  understand IT better.  I hope the  Minister  will

consider introducing such programmes to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, the Auditor-General's

Report  highlighted  weakness in  computer  security  in  the

the Registry of Trade Marks and Patents, Maritime and Port of

Singapore  Authority,  TAS, the Inland Revenue  Authority  of

Singapore and the PUB.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all aware that with the advent of

information  technology and its usage, it is also  associated

with  the  risk of losing information, or worse,  undesirable

manipulation of the technology to one's advantage.   Computer

security  lapse  could  also  lead  to  a  private  citizen's

sensitive information being revealed through the Government's

database.   I  think the Government, being the user  of  such

technology, should also be aware of the risks associated with

it.   The  Government  also  has a public  responsibility  to

ensure that the data it has on citizens are properly secured.

I  am  therefore surprised that the Auditor-General found  so

many   computer  security  problems  in  so  many  Government

agencies.  I therefore have the following questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the security standard set by the relevant

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authority?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is the Government sure that the standard set is

secure  enough  to prevent some unauthorised  access  to  the

database?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Who is responsible for ensuring that the set standards

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are met?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I raise this issue in

the  context  of  our current obsession with the  spread  and

scope of information technology.  Technology must be used  to

help  Singaporeans access information, understand and use  it

appropriately.   How  do  our  Ministries   fare   in   these

functions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June 1998, a researcher analysed for me the

webpages of the Ministries of Health, Manpower, Home  Affairs

and  Community Development.  On the whole, she felt that  the

webpages  were  not interactive, information was  inadequate,

sketchy  and  not  updated, particularly press  releases  and

speeches in each Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I had three of my staff spend a whole morning

surfing  these same Ministries and one more, the Ministry  of

Education.  It was a morning well spent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>



and  it benefited the staff because they learned so much more

about  the  Government  and society.   Their  reactions  were

positive, indicating a vast improvement from the observations

made in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from their responses to the various websites,

they  look  for  three things.  First, is  clear  information

which is comprehensive and useful.  For example, one staff in

her  30s,  single, was drawn to a list of assistance  schemes

and  range  of services the Ministry of Community Development

offers.  The website of Ministry of Health, to another staff,

a  mother  of  two, was comprehensive, thoroughly educational

and user-friendly.   She made special mention of two reports.

First, the National Health Survey 1998, and second, Dr Yaacob

Ibrahim's  report  on  employment  and  employability.    She

benefited from both reports personally.  As an older  person,

she is drawn to the setting up of Silver Manpower Centres  in

housing estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website of MOM was an exciting one for two of my

staff  because of the long list of employment agencies posted

on the web.  They were particularly pleased about the Back-to-Work  programme.  I wish I will not lose my staff because  of

this information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website of Education was evidently the most

thoroughly  prepared, including information  on  the  current

system,  a  section  on PRIME, Programme for  Rebuilding  and

Improving  Existing  Schools  and  on  Planning  Ahead  about

educational   choices.   For  parents,  these  segments   are

invaluable  information.  My staff drew my attention  to  the

section  on  FAQ (frequently asked questions) and found  them

reassuring.   They  do not feel they are  the  only  ignorant

parents  or  kiasu  ones.   She also  liked  the  segment  on

Episodes   from   the  Singapore  Story,   particularly   the

photographs, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing they look for is an interactive format.

Here,   the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  apart  from  being

comprehensive and informative, must be singled

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>



out  for  its  colourful layout and interactive format.   One

regret  was  that, unless you have CD-ROM, you cannot  access

the eCitizen Corner.  So there is a suggestion for setting up

a  chat  room  for young people to express their fears  about

school  bullies or gangsters to policemen who can then  serve

as   on-line   mentors  or  befrienders.   Can  the   various

Ministries consider setting up a chat forum, like the one  in

Ministry of the Environment, particularly for the young?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing they look for is fast response. One

staff  in  posting  her suggestion to MHA at  11.22  am  that

morning  had  an immediate screen response that said:  "Thank

you  for  your  feedback.   We will seriously  consider  your

comments and will get back to you if necessary.  Have a  nice

day."  She was pleased by that and she exclaimed, "Hey,  they

got  my  message!".  To her delight, that afternoon, at  4.23

pm,  an  e-mail  from a Mr Daniel Tan Chee  Kiang  (Corporate

Communications  Division) indicated  to  her  that  they  had

accessed the eCitizen Centre hyperlink and invited her to try

it  one  more  time.  He thanked her again for bringing  this

matter to his attention.  In the words of my staff, "this  is

the  kind of interactive communication we need for Singapore,

well done Home Affairs!".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Ministries to assess and update their

websites  regularly.  There are inconsistencies.   There  are

still  incomplete information.  For example, MCD has  a  Shop

Front  retailing books, but when it comes to payment and  the

procedure  of  application,  there  is  no  information,   no

procedures being set, and no indication of postage or courier

charges, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the responses of my three staff, I observed

that  this  information is important to them.  But  my  three

staff also asked one basic question: what if you do not  have

a computer, how do you access this information?  An even more

fundamental one, the one that Mr Ravindran just mentioned, is

what  if  you  cannot  read and write English?   I  hope  the

Ministry  will look into these issues and fully  exploit  the

Internet as a form of raising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>



public   education,  making  information  user-friendly   and

accessible   for   promoting  mutual  understanding   between

Government and the people sector.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is not here. Dr Teo.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, despite the advent of IT, letters

still   provide   a  common  means  of  communication   among

individuals   and   businesses.   Due  to  labour   shortage,

Singapore  Post  has  been adjusting the collection  time  of

mails  from mail boxes and relocating some mail boxes.   This

has  increased  delivery  time of  letters  and  also  caused

inconvenience to some people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome this problem, I would like to suggest the

following for the Minister to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can we install outgoing mail boxes in all

residential  blocks?   This will facilitate  the  posting  of

mails   by   residents.   At  the  same  time,  postmen   can

conveniently collect mails after their mail delivery time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can we relocate mail boxes along roads, especially

main  roads,  so as to reduce traffic congestion  or  provide

parking bays for such mail boxes?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank all the

Members for their suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat asked about CAAS and why, in contrast

to  what  we have done in other areas, CAAS is still both  an

operator and a regulator.  Sir, CAAS has actually managed  to

serve  both  roles  very well, and that has served  Singapore

well.   In  the process, it has made Changi Airport into  the

premier  air  hub  in  the region.   We  did  look  into  the

necessity  to  privatise CAAS.  That was done  in  the  early

1990s.  We had a firm of consultants to help us look into it,

and  the  conclusion was that there was no really  compelling

need to corporatise or privatise CAAS at that time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an airport operator, CAAS has actually done a

wonderful job.  The commercial operations in the airport are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>



actually  farmed  out  to  private  sector  operators.    For

example,  the  airport ground operations, such  as  passenger

check-ins,  baggage  handling, cargo handling,  and  the  in-flight  catering,  are all done by private  sector  companies

such  as  SATS and CIAS.  As a result of all the  efforts  to

improve  the  airport, Changi Airport has  consistently  been

rated  as the best airport in the world for many, many years.

Despite  the fact that CAAS is a statutory board, it has  not

rested  on  its  laurels.  It has continued to introduce  new

concepts   and   new  facilities  to  the  airport,   because

competition  at  the airport level is not just  regional  but

international  as  well.  And with more  long  haul  aircraft

coming  in,  I  think the competition is  going  to  be  even

tougher.  So we need CAAS to remain on its toes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key projects that CAAS is now embarking on is

the  development  of  our Terminal 3.   The  construction  of

Terminal  3 would start shortly.  When completed in the  year

2006,  Terminal 3 will increase Changi Airport's capacity  to

64  million passengers from its current 44 million.  So  CAAS

is  looking into the future, and it will continue to take the

necessary    steps    to   maintain   our    competitiveness.

Nevertheless, I can assure Prof. Toh that we do  revisit  the

question every so often, because we need to be clear  in  our

minds  as to whether the time has come to separate those  two

roles.  So we will continue to revisit that question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Chay Wai Chuen spoke on the

port.  They asked about competition from other regional ports

and  how  do we fare against the other ports, and whether  we

have  benchmarks.  Both Mr Yeo and Mr Chay also  asked  about

the possibility of allowing dedicated terminals to operate in

our port.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, competition from regional ports has indeed

intensified  in recent years.  I am sure Members  would  have

read about the efforts to improve Port Klang, the opening  of

the  new Tanjong Pelapas port, which is right next to us, and

efforts  by ports elsewhere  -  Sri Lanka, Indonesia   -   to

upgrade and to improve.  In fact, some of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>



these  new ports or upgraded ports have publicly stated  that

their  intent is to not just emulate PSA but to take business

away  from  PSA.   Tanjong Pelapas, our  new  neighbour,  has

publicly stated that it is targeting taking away 10% of PSA's

business.  So the competition is going to be hotting up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port competition is not new to Singapore. It is

something that we have faced all through the years.  But more

importantly,  port  competition is  not  just  from  regional

ports.  Because today the concept of hubbing and treating the

whole world as one huge network means that shipping companies

can  hub  as far away as, for example, Malta, for the region.

They transship in Malta or they can transship in Colombo when

it  comes  to  shipping containers into our region.   So  the

competition is not just from neighbours but it is really from

further afield as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you that PSA does take all this competition

very seriously.  They have embarked on a lot of activities to

improve  on their competitiveness.  PSA and both MPA  monitor

very   closely   several  indicators,   for   example,   port

connectivity.  How many ports is PSA connected  to?   Because

the  more ports we are connected to, the more we will be used

as  a  transshipment centre.  They monitor productivity,  how

many  containers are moved, loaded, unloaded.  And they  also

monitor  what is the value for money that users get from  our

port.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be happy to know that we are connected to

more ports in the world by more shipping lines than any other

regional ports.  PSA also currently holds the world's  record

of  moving  234  containers per  hour  from  one  ship.   The

competition  is  not  really  just  on  price  alone.    Many

commentators comment quite wrongly on just basing  on  price.

Because  we know that you can pay a very low price  for  some

goods  but  you get no value.  Whereas if you  pay  a  higher

price for other goods and the value is there, it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>



still  worth the while paying the higher price.  And that  is

what  PSA  sets  out to do.  It does not compete  to  be  the

lowest price provided.  They strive very hard to provide  the

highest  value  for  your money. And  this  has  resulted  in

growing business for PSA and our port even during the  recent

financial crisis.

On  the question of dedicated terminals, both Mr Chay and  Mr

Yeo  asked  whether we will allow dedicated terminals.   Sir,

the  Government will introduce competition to the port as and

when  that competition proves necessary and beneficial.   So,

for  example,  the  cart  services have  already  been  fully

liberalised  and  port users now have a choice  of  six  cart

operators to choose from.  In the area of container  terminal

operations, PSA is currently the only operator for main lines

in  Singapore.  As I said just now, it does not mean that PSA

is  a  monopoly  because PSA has to compete for transshipment

business  with both regional ports as well as  ports  in  the

South Asian and Middle East regions.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transshipments make up more than 80% of PSA's business.

As  Members would be aware, transshipment cargo does not have

to   use   PSA.   They  are  not  meant  for  us,  as   final

destinations, and they do not originate from us.   Therefore,

the  fact that they use Singapore must be because we are able

to add value to their business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about dedicated terminals? For those Members who

are not familiar, dedicated terminals refer to port terminals

that  are  managed or owned by shipping companies  to  handle

their  own cargo.  Because of the heavy investments  required

in  some  ports, some countries do invite shipping  lines  to

come  in  and  set up their own terminals.  But quite  often,

those  dedicated  terminals  are  present  in  what  we  call

"gateway  ports", that means, the bulk of the  business  from

the  shipping  line is with that country where  the  port  is

sited.   So if there is a lot of outward and inward  shipment

of  containers to that country, it may be worth while for the

shipping line, if the shipping line has a lot of business, to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>



operate its own port rather than use another port.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, PSA is known as a common user

terminal for our operator which shall serve all ships calling

at  our  port.  PSA has done a very good job, as I  mentioned

just   now.    As  a  result,  Singapore  is  now   the   key

transshipment  hub in the region.  We were  No.  1  port,  in

terms of container throughput, last year.  This year, we have

fallen  to  No. 2.  But it still shows that PSA  has  a  very

dominant  and successful business.  The high volume of  cargo

allows  PSA  huge economies of scale. And as a  result,  this

makes it attractive for shipping companies to use our port to

transship  to  other  ports.  So in a  way,  this  becomes  a

virtuous  cycle.   The  more they use  us,  the  greater  the

economies  of  scale,  and there will be  more  feeder  lines

serving us, and the business builds up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When charting the course of the future, we must continue

to  understand what are the reasons for a common user port to

be  successful  and what are the reasons that shipping  lines

want  to have their own dedicated terminals.  For the present

moment, we do not intend to have dedicated terminals, but  we

will  keep an open mind.  We will have to watch the  dynamics

of the business and the changes in the shipping business.  If

good  reasons  exist, we will definitely look seriously  into

having dedicated terminals in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Dr Toh See Kiat, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang

and,   yesterday,  Dr  Michael  Lim  talked  about  broadband

multimedia.    They  commented  that  they   are   not   very

competitive.  This is a very important industry and  service.

And we should make all efforts to make broadband multimedia a

success  in  Singapore.  Sir, let me first explain  that  the

broadband  multimedia market is still in its infancy  in  all

parts  of the world.  In the USA, broadband adoption is  only

6%.  In Singapore, we have about 30,000 subscribers, or about

100,000  users, and the 100,000 users comprise about  14%  of

all  Internet  users.   So  in  terms  of  penetration  rate,

broadband penetration in Singapore is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>



actually higher than in the US.  From what I hear, we are one

of  the  highest  in the world.  We were  one  of  the  first

countries to spot the tremendous potential for broadband  and

as  early as 1996, we put in place the Singapore One  network

which  is the backbone of the broadband network.  We want  to

have  a  large  and vibrant broadband industry  in  Singapore

because  this would contribute very greatly to  our  goal  of

becoming an infocomm hub in the Asia-Pacific.  Because of its

importance,  the development of broadband is in fact  one  of

the key elements in my Ministry's Infocomm 21 Masterplan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To grow the broadband industry, as mentioned by both Mr

Chay  and Mr Yeo, we need attractive content and also a large

subscriber  base.  Both feed on one another.  It  is  like  a

chicken-and-egg challenge.  Which one comes first,  broadband

content or subscribers.  We feel both are important.  We  can

attract  more  content  providers  if  we  can  get  a  large

subscriber  base.  On the other hand, as mentioned  by  Prof.

Toh,  the subscribers find that the content is not attractive

and  not  very  exciting.  Therefore, they  do  not  want  to

subscribe or they are reluctant to subscribe.  Another factor

holding back subscribers is the high cost.  Compared to  USA,

our broadband access is more expensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA is working on three initiatives to develop our

broadband   sector.   Firstly,  it  is  wooing  new   content

providers to come into Singapore and provide content and  hub

from Singapore.  Secondly, we are also assisting the existing

ones  to  upgrade  their  services.  In  fact,  yesterday,  I

mentioned  about the three marketing trips by  IDA  and  EDB.

Recently, my Minister of State also went on a trip to the  US

and  the  objective  of  the trip is also  to  reach  out  to

broadband content providers to get them to come and locate in

Singapore.   So,  in effect, we are actually  marketing  very

aggressively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative, and this is very crucial, is that

we  are working very closely with SCV, SingTel and, later on,

StarHub to reduce consumer prices.  In fact, SCV,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>



arising  from  our  discussions with them, has  already  gone

ahead  to  reduce their prices.  I understand that  they  are

quite competitive compared to the regional service providers.

With  full liberalisation of the telecommunication sector,  I

can  assure  Members that we should expect to  see  broadband

prices coming down in Singapore in the months ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third initiative is that IDA intends to open access

to  the  infrastructure to other Internet service  providers.

By  opening access, I think it will make the broadband sector

more competitive and attractive and we should be able to  see

more  subscribers arising from that.  We also expect  to  see

new  technology  being introduced, wireless  transmission  of

broadband.  That is definitely in the works.  And we hope  to

see the wireless broadband transmissions coming in later this

year or early next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked why the Government does not subsidise the

development  of  the  cable infrastructure  since  it  is  so

important.   Sir,  let me first clarify that  the  Government

does  not subsidise and pay for the telephone infrastructure.

The telephone company actually makes the investments and they

expect  to  make  a  commercial return on those  investments.

Similarly, the cable infrastructure is an investment made  by

SCV  and  they  use  it for both their cables  and  broadband

transmissions.   I would think that SCV and its  shareholders

would  expect  to  have some returns on their  investment  as

well.   Nonetheless, the Government recognises the importance

of  the  broadband infrastructure in our development  into  a

regional infocomm hub.  We expect that while today,  many  of

the  Internet  subscribers are opting for narrow  band,  more

will migrate to broadband because the contents will be better

and prices should be coming down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that we supported the roll-out of

cables  to  HDB flats and private residential  estates.   The

Government, through the HDB, actually contributed $16 million

towards the cabling of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>



HDB  estates, bringing broadband to all HDB households.   HDB

flat  dwellers do not have to pay any upfront charges at  all

for  the  cable infrastructure.  In addition, the  Government

has,  through  IDA,  helped to lower  the  overall  costs  of

broadband subscription by subsidising 70% of the cost of  the

head-end   equipment  and  the  cable  modems  required   for

broadband  services.   For  the  private  homes,  the   cable

infrastructure has been rolled out to the kerb.   Because  of

the  high  costs of laying the cables to low density  private

housing,  SCV  has decided to charge individual house  owners

for the last mile of cable to their homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that my Ministry will

continue  to  strongly  promote  growth  and  development  of

broadband in Singapore and we expect the introduction of full

and open competition in the telecommunications sector to help

us achieve our objective of growing this important sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will ask my Minister of State to answer the other

questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I intend to take the break now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, the other day I was

walking down the street and I saw this lady walking in  front

of  me, wearing a T-shirt. At the back of the T-shirt, it was

written  "The answer is no".  I was very curious of what  was

the  question in front. So, I overtook her and in  front,  it

was written, "The answer is still no".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listened to the various cuts put up by the

various  Members with an open and receptive mind. I  want  to

assure  them  that  I did not come in with any  pre-conceived

ideas.   Let  me  respond  to some  of  the  cuts  that  were

presented by the Members here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Iswaran touched on the issue of a digital

divide.   59% of households in Singapore today have a  PC  at

home and 42% have access to Internet.  In fact, Singapore  is

one  of  the  most IT-intensive nations in the  world  today.

However, we feel that the threat of a digital divide is still

very real.  The question is, why?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the penetration of home PCs, for the 1-to 3-room HDB flats, it is only 41%, compared to 78% for the

HDB  Executive  flats and private housing. Among  the  people

using computers today, only 1 in 5 is more than 40 years old,

and  1  in  20  is more than 50 years old. In  fact,  80%  of

computer users today are those who are younger than 40  years

old.   In  terms  of  educational qualifications,  among  the

computer users again, only 1 in 6 is a primary school leaver,

1 in 3 is a secondary school leaver.  60% of computer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>



users  are  those with post-secondary and tertiary education.

In  short, we think that there is an early sign of a  digital

divide  along  the line of household income,  age  group  and

educational qualifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under ICT 21 Masterplan, one of our aims is to dot.com

the  entire  people sector so that there will be  no  digital

divide  in  the  information society of  the  future.   Among

households  without home PCs, according to  our  survey,  14%

cited the high cost of a PC as a reason for not owning a  PC.

For  low-income households, we need to help make ownership of

home PCs more affordable to them.  However, what is even more

important  is  to  help  more Singaporeans  to  discover  the

usefulness  of  IT  and Internet and  to  learn  to  use  the

technology.  This  is because among those households  without

PCs  at home, 73% of them either do not see the need for  PCs

or  do not know how to use a PC. Some of them also feel  that

they are too old to learn to use IT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bridge this emerging digital divide, the Government

cannot  do  it  alone. What we need is a  broad-based  people

sector  driven  movement, reaching out to all  the  different

population  segments in our society. We need to rely  on  the

joint  efforts  of the Government, the labour  movement,  the

business  community and the various volunteer and  grassroots

organisations,  so  as to overcome the  barriers  of  income,

language and mindset which are holding back some Singaporeans

from embracing IT and Internet today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran made three suggestions yesterday. Firstly,

to  draw on the People's Association in reaching out  to  the

grassroots  users. Secondly, to use characters well-known  to

older Singaporeans, such as Liang Po Po and so on, as our  IT

icons  and e-ambassadors.  And thirdly, to take the  path  of

least  resistance, such as games and entertainment, to induce

first-time  computer users before they progress to  something

more  serious.  My response to Mr Iswaran's three suggestions

is yes, yes and yes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran suggested that we should step up effort to

promote development of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>



Internet  contents in Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.   Again,  my

response  is yes. Up till now, Internet content is very  much

US-centric  and mainly in English.  With the  rapid  rise  in

Internet  users based in Europe and in Asia, we are seeing  a

clear  trend towards the development of regional contents  in

regional  languages.  We can expect to see a rapid growth  of

Asian portals in Asian languages from now on.  In fact,  this

morning, Media Corp Interactive and Popular Holdings launched

a  joint venture known as the Chinese 88.com. Their aim is to

become  a  global  player  in the  Chinese  Internet  portal.

Likewise,  our Malay and Tamil communities are promoting  the

development and the use of Malay Internet and Tamil  Internet

to  keep  up  with  the transition towards a  knowledge-based

economy and the information society.  The Government, through

the  IDA,  will work with these various industry players  and

civic  organisations, such as the Malay  and  Tamil  Internet

Societies,  and  provide them with the  necessary  assistance

because the proliferation of non-English Internet is probably

the  best  way for us to attract more older Singaporeans  who

are  more  comfortable with their mother tongues rather  than

English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we will be providing assistance through

the   Local  Industry  Upgrading  Programme  (LIUP)  and  the

Innovation  Development Scheme (IDS) to  help  companies  and

organisations  that want to go into the development  of  non-English  contents  and portals.  At the same  time,  we  will

continue  to  step up our training of Internet in  Malay  and

Tamil.  For example, at One Learning Place in Toa  Payoh,  so

far,  1,200 users have been trained to use Internet in  Malay

and 257 were trained to use Internet in Tamil and we will  do

more of this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh suggested that we should do more to reach out to

the   homemakers.  I  agree  with  him.   In  fact,  we  have

identified homemakers as one of the five target groups.   The

other  four  are  NS men, workers, senior  citizens  and  the

disabled. We will explore the use of TV as a medium

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>



to  bring IT education to the homes, as suggested by Mr  Peh.

Meanwhile, Mr Peh may be pleased to note that IDA is  running

the  One  Learning Place in Toa Payoh to provide training  on

broadband  Internet which is more fun and more exciting  than

learning Internet on TV.  For the 10 months, from May 1999 to

February  this  year, One Learning Place has reached  out  to

more  than  37,000 trainees. Among them, more  than  30%  are

Singaporeans  who  are more than 40 years, including  608  of

them  who  are  more than 60 years old. Even  though  working

adults  make  up  the  majority of the trainees  at  the  One

Learning  Place,  we  did  have 2,970  homemakers  among  the

trainees  and  we hope that more will join the  class  as  we

intensify  our efforts in reaching out to these  five  target

groups in the coming years.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang urged the Ministries to make their

websites  as  interactive  as  possible  and  she  urged  the

Ministry  to exploit the full potential of Internet.   Again,

my  response is yes.  The public sector has been the  leading

users   of   IT   since   we  started   the   Civil   Service

Computerisation   Programme  (CSCP)  in   1981.    The   CSCP

spearheaded the use of PCs and database in Singapore  in  the

early 80s, followed by data communication and electronic data

interchange  (EDI)  in  the  mid-80s,  and  followed  by  the

intelligent  systems  and integrated office  systems  in  the

early 90s.  It has also been an early adopter of Internet and

Intranet in the past few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next IT challenge for the civil service is to become

a  leading user of broadband Internet, wireless Internet  and

Internet appliance.  With our firm foundation in IT built  up

over  the  past 20 years, we should aspire to  be  among  the

first  nations  in the world, if not the first,  to  offer  a

comprehensive  e-Government services for the  convenience  of

the  public.  We hope the day will come when members  of  the

public  can have access to Government services in a triple  A

manner, meaning any time, anywhere, using any device,  be  it

the PC, Notebook, Palmtop, cellular handphone and so on.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, we should not forget the

significant role played by the labour movement.  In fact, the

NTUC  is  today  the  largest provider of  IT  education  and

training  in  Singapore, training more than 20,000  rank-and-file  workers in IT every year.  It will continue to  have  a

major  role to play under the ICT 21.  We believe that it  is

through such concerted efforts of the Government, the  labour

movement, the business community and grassroots organisations

that  we  are hopeful that many Singaporeans will embrace  IT

and cross over to the right side of the digital divide in the

coming years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now move on to respond to the cut proposed

by Mr Low Thia Khiang regarding IT security in the Government

sector.  I agree with Mr Low that, as we intensify the use of

IT  in  the  Government sector, IT security will become  even

more important, because it is important that we safeguard the

reliability  and the security of the system, as well  as  the

information maintained in this system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked three questions. Firstly, whether we have

IT  standards in place for the Government sector.  The answer

is  yes.  In fact, since July 1996, the former NCB, which  is

IDA  today,  formulated a comprehensive set  of  IT  security

standards.   In  the  formulation  of  these  standards,   we

benchmarked ourselves with best practice all over  the  world

and we even have a foreign expert to advise us.  Today, there

is  a comprehensive set of IT security standards in place for

the  public  sector.  It covers all areas of security,  right

from  IT  security  policy  to  various  specific  guidelines

regarding  firewall and even disaster recovery, meaning  that

if  something were to happen to our data centre, we  will  be

able  to recover and relaunch the whole system within a  very

short period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low's second question is: are the guidelines secure

enough to prevent illegal access?  The answer is yes and  no.

The  answer is yes because the guidelines, based on  what  we

know today, in terms of the technique for illegal access, are

sufficient  to  prevent illegal access, at  least  to  detect

them.   But we must be mindful that every day there could  be

someone

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>



dreaming of new ways of making an illegal access.  Basically,

the  risk  is always there.  Our challenge is to continue  to

update  our  security standards to make sure that the  system

will be as secure as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Low wants to know who is responsible to

ensure  that the security guidelines will be implemented  and

followed  in the civil service.  The direct agency that  must

be held responsible for the implementation of these standards

must  be  the  respective Ministries, because the information

and  the  data  are owned by the respective Ministries.   The

Ministries will therefore have direct responsibility to  make

sure  that the security standards are being implemented,  and

yet  at  the  same  time, we have in place  a  system  to  do

auditing.  For example, every year, the Auditor-General  will

have  a  programme to audit the various Ministries.   At  the

same  time, the IT audit team from IDA  goes round  to  audit

the Ministries, and they complement the effort of the Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the cut by Dr Teo Ho Pin who

asked  two  questions.   Firstly, he  asked  whether  we  can

install  outgoing mail boxes in all residential blocks.   The

answer is no.  The reason is because SingPost did a study and

they  came  to  the conclusion that if they were  to  put  an

outgoing  mail  box in every residential block,  firstly,  it

will  be very labour intensive, meaning that they would  have

to  employ more postmen to do the job.  Secondly, what is  of

even  greater  concern to SingPost is that it  will  actually

slow  down  the delivery time for local mail.  Because  right

now  under  the IDA guidelines, SingPost will have to  ensure

95%  next day delivery for mails outside the CBD.  For  mails

within the CBD, the standard is 98%.  And their assessment is

that  if  they  were  to put outgoing  mail  boxes  in  every

residential block, it will actually lengthen the process  and

delay the delivery of mail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question Dr Teo asked was whether we can

relocate  the  mail boxes along the roads  so  as  to  reduce

traffic congestion or provide parking bays for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>



such  mail boxes.  Sir, the answer is yes.  IDA will continue

to  work  with  SingPost  and the  LTA  to  minimise  traffic

congestion and relocate the post boxes to population centres,

such  as MRT stations, community clubs, bus interchanges  and

selective petrol stations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, since the NTUC has committed to

support and fund the training of all its 10,000 union leaders

for  basic IT and Internet, I would like to ask the  Minister

of  State  whether  his  Ministry can  request  the  People's

Association to do the same for all the grassroots leaders.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> I think this is a very good suggestion.

The IDA will take it up with the People's Association and see

how we can implement a similar programme.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State what

measures  have  been  taken by the Ministry  to  ensure  that

residents can post mails conveniently?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, under the licence issued by the

IDA  to  SingPost, there is a requirement  in  terms  of  the

location  of the mail boxes.  For example, in the  population

centres,  for  HDB estates that are more dense, the  distance

between  any two outgoing mail boxes cannot be more than  500

metres.   For  the medium density blocks, it is  750  metres.

For  the low density blocks, it is 1 km.  Within the business

district, it is 250 metres.  In that sense, we make sure that

our  residents do not have to walk too far in order  to  have

access to a mail box.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister, the

Minister of State and the Parliamentary Secretary for all the

answers and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2). I am afraid there is

only one minute left.   Do you want to speak, Mr Chiam?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head I of the

Development Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code IH

5200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Minister can modify the COE

system  by  having  a cap of one-third of the  price  of  the

successful bid or strike price.  If we have such a scheme, it

will  be a stabilising effect on COE prices.  I will give  an

example.  If the strike price is $30,000, one third  of  that

is  $10,000.   And  anyone  bidding  above  $40,000  will  be

disqualified for that particular round, but his name  can  go

over  to  the  next  or  following bid.   This  will  have  a

stabilising  effect.  Instead of the upward push  of  prices,

this  cap would keep prices fairly stable, and not a  runaway

price like the $100,000 COE price that we had some time back.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are 30 seconds left, Mr Yeo.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I think I should answer the Member.

The  studies  by LTA show that the successful  bids  actually

cluster very closely to the lowest successful bid.  Using the

example of $30,000, actually most of the successful bids  are

within  that $10,000 band that the Member was talking  about.

This is the vast majority.  This is already taking place.

<br>3.55 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, since

there has been no such cut in the Parliament budget for  many

years, I will certainly try to be very careful in putting  my

points  forward, so that I do not get cut midway  through  my

speech, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Could I cut you, please? Could you move

your amendment first?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head F of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our new Parliament House is a new icon for all of

us  in Singapore.  It is a new hardware that we are all  very

pleased  and  proud of.  Thanks to you, Sir, as Speaker,  and

all  those  who  have  been  involved  in  this  development.

However,  I think that it is an opportune time to review  the

software  -  the Standing Orders and other related matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a few points. First, the

sitting times.  The sitting time of this House should perhaps

be  extended from the present time in the Standing Orders  of

<br>4.30 pm to, say, 6.30 pm. The reason is that in the last

81/2 years or so that I have been in this House, I have seen,

almost  at every sitting day, the Leader of the House had  to

stand up and ask for an extension.  I think it is not fair to

impose  it  on him, and I think that we should extend  it  to

<br>6.30 pm. If we finish early, he can stand up occasionally to

say, "Let us adjourn."  That will be a better arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the notice for Oral Questions. Presently, we

need  to give seven days' notice, and I would like to propose

that  with all these Internet speeches being made, we  should

move  to  a  more Internet time of maybe two or  three  days'

notice.   I know that some countries like the UK has  got  10

days' notice.  In the US, they hardly give any notice.   They

go  through  the committees.  There are various models.   For

every  country that we can find to say it is seven  or  eight

days,  we  can find countries, which like Uganda, have  three

days' notice.  So there is no right or wrong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>



model, but let us look at what is suitable for us.  This will

make  us more relevant and not dated in putting our Questions

forward.   When  the  Straits Times  has  come  out  with  an

article, we have to wait seven days to ask the same Question,

which does not really look right and current.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the civil servants and, to some extent, the

Frontbench have to work a little bit harder if it is  two  or

three  days'  notice,  but I think it is  worth  it  for  the

benefit  of  all  Singaporeans who want to  get  the  updated

position of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on Question Time is that we only have

one  hour for Question Time.  We have so many Questions.   In

the past, many Questions cannot be answered.  Something could

be  done, occasionally for  the Speaker or the Leader of  the

House to decide that we  extend Question Time by another half

an  hour to clear most of the Questions, and this can be done

with the discretion of the two gentlemen of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards time limit for Backbenchers, you may be

very,  very  happy, Sir. At present, we allow 30 minutes  for

speeches  by Backbenchers.  I would like to propose maybe  we

cut  it down to 15 or 20 minutes, simply because some  of  us

here  are  very  tired of hearing old gramophone  records  of

speeches  and  points made by some persons on such  topic  as

lack  of  democracy in Singapore or lack of rule  of  law  in

Singapore, and so on.  Sir, certainly, we do not want to  put

up with this.  I do not know whether Dr Vasoo agrees with me.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Certainly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Certainly. I want to move on to the

Committee  of  Supply.  With many substantive  issues  to  be

discussed  in  this  House  and the  number  of  Budget  cuts

increasing by the year and records being broken every year, I

would like to propose something practised by Westminster, ie,

to  divide  the House into at least two Committees.   If  you

look at the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>



Budget  book on page 11, the financial expenditure is divided

by   various  sectors.  We  have  got  security,  social  and

community  services, economic and infrastructural development

and  general services.  The first two categories  are  really

more  for Defence and Home Affairs, Civil Defence, Education,

Health,  MCD  and  Sports,  MITA,  Environment,  and  so  on.

Infrastructural development will include many of the business

areas:  National Development, MCIT and so on.  We can  divide

the House into two and find a way to organise the MPs, either

they sit in one group or the other, or use our professors  in

the  University to find out how they schedule  their  student

programmes,  where  they  go  through  various  modules   and

combinations.    I  know there are expert  systems  that  are

available for universities to use, and we can use  it  for  a

few days, I am sure.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, can I ask you to allow

time for the Minister to reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Can I just be allowed two minutes

more, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to propose that we

look  at  this  Committee model so that we can be  much  more

efficient and at the same time give more time for speakers to

put their points forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the $100 cuts. Mr Chiam has put

in  many  $10  cuts.  Maybe he is following  the  rules  very

correctly, but maybe he is just putting in his name  so  that

his name appears in many places and not be given a chance  to

speak because most MPs now put $100 cut.  Maybe we should get

away with that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point is, I do not want to say anything

about  the Speaker's title because although he does not speak

much  here,  the  Speaker is a distinguished  title  that  we

should still keep it.  It is an honorary title.  But for  the

Clerk of Parliament, in today's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>



context  in  Singapore, (Mr P O Ram is about to  retire  from

civil  service)  if  we try to get younger  people  to  come,

nobody  would  want  to  be the Clerk of  Parliament  because

everybody thinks that it is a clerk's job.  P. O.  Ram  is  a

senior  civil  servant.  Many younger people will  not  come.

Even an insurance agent is called an insurance consultant.  I

think we should look at all these points and perhaps call for

a  review  of  our  Standing Orders by  our  Standing  Orders

Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> I thank the

Member  for making this amendment.  Since the Speaker  cannot

speak, I will speak on his behalf and I hope he will not  cut

me off at 4.05 pm.  I think we follow what some people do and

we  also  do new things on our own. I always have  a  dictum.

We  always look at what we do all the time, review them  and,

if  it  is necessary to change, we will change.  But  I  also

believe sometimes that when it ain't broke, do not fix it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few points that the Member raised. For

example, the extension of Question Time by more than half  an

hour.   I  have looked up the other Parliaments and  I  found

that practically all of them have one hour or less.  In fact,

in  some cases, even just 30 minutes.  In the case of Canada,

a  question cannot even be asked in more than 35 seconds  and

an  answer cannot be given in more than 35 seconds.  I do not

know  whether  you want to get to that stage.   For  Question

Time,  I  have some sympathy but for now, until we relook  at

the Standing Orders again, we leave it well and good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about reducing the notice period from seven

days  to two days, I think two days would not be fair  enough

for  a  proper  answer to be given, unless he just  wants  an

answer  that says "The Ministry will look into it."  That  we

can  give it to him perhaps with one day's notice or  on  the

spot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exempting the Standing Orders every time we need to go

beyond  4.30 pm is not a problem at all.  It is a very simple

thing.  I will stick to that because, if need be,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>



we  will move a motion.  By his suggestion, I still have  got

to come up and adjourn earlier.  So it makes no difference to

me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limit of speeches of Members to 20 minutes is a

good  point to consider.  At the right time, we may  consider

that.   But some may not totally agree with him because  some

may prefer a longer time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Committee of Supply dividing into two different

Committees,  I  think  all of us  want  to  be  in  the  same

committee.   I  think it is very difficult  to  say  that  my

interest  is only in this and not in the others because  some

of   our   interests  may  cross.   If  you   look   at   one

classification,  "Economic and Infrastructural  Development",

Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Manpower,  are

very different from public housing under Ministry of National

Development.   So they are totally unrelated.  The  Ministers

have  a responsibility for their own portfolios and we should

leave  it  to  them to decide how to answer  those  questions

instead of putting them into different Committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the title, I think the Clerk will not appreciate

changing  the  title.   I do not know his  sentiments.   This

title  has  been in existence for more than 600  years.   The

first  recorded term of "Clerk" was in 1363, 637  years  ago.

Fortunately,  other Members said that the  Speaker  does  not

need  to  change his name.  If we changed, I am sure you,  Mr

Speaker,   will take great offence because in  the  whole  of

Singapore,  no  official title is called the Speaker,  except

yours.   If we call you "President" or "Chairman", there  are

plenty around.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, seeing that I am quite

happy with the way things are, do you still insist on cutting

my  budget?   I  would  wisely advise  you  to  withdraw  the

amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I want to correct what the

Minister  had  said.   I did not ask  for  a  change  of  the

Speaker's  name.  I only ask for a change for  the  Clerk  of

Parliament.  I would like to thank the Minister and  although

his answer is not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1798</b></font><br><br>



very encouraging, I would like to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the height of Asia's currency crisis some 1 1/2

years ago, followed by the collapse of the Suharto Government

in  Indonesia, there were numerous  reports of illegal  entry

of   foreigners  into  Singapore  and  there   were   several

subsequent  busts  of enclaves of illegal immigrants.   Since

then, the issue has abated, thanks in no small measure to our

law  enforcement officers, the new immigration checkpoint and

also  of  course  the recent addition to our  fleet  of  fast

patrol boats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the issue has abated, it is by no means

over.   We  still  have substantial numbers trying  to  enter

Singapore illegally and right now there must be thousands  in

our  midst  even  as I speak today.  As long as  our  economy

continues  to  grow  and some other countries  face  economic

hardship,  this  problem will not go  away.   Without  proper

identification records, and sometimes taken advantage  of  by

some unscrupulous employers, it is inevitable that some of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>



these  illegals  will  resort  to  crime.   Apprehending  the

perpetrators  becomes  sometimes an impossible  task  when  a

crime is committed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like the Minister to give an update to this

House  on  the  situation  of  the  illegal  immigrants   and

overstayers.   We should continue to place high  priority  on

making  sure  that  our  borders  are  sealed  against  those

entering Singapore illegally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must wonder the extent of the problem. For every

successful  apprehension of smuggling of  illegal  immigrant,

there  must be a number who have got away scot free. We  read

in  the  newspapers  that everyone who has  been  caught  has

admitted to doing it more than once.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides depending on the Home Team for enforcement, we

must  also  do  more  by  way of  public  education.   In  an

urbanised  country  like Singapore,  there  must  be  several

instances  of  Singaporeans who are aware  or  suspicious  of

foreigners   living  in  their  midst  who  may  be   illegal

immigrants, yet they do not come forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is shocking indeed to read a New Paper report

of  4th March headlined "120 workers in one flat".  There was

a  6-room  flat  in Serangoon which housed some  120  foreign

workers.   The  report  highlighted  the  horrendous   living

conditions  of  these 120 foreign workers and  it  took  five

months   for   someone  to  alert  the  police   and   report

anonymously.  Although not proven yet that there are  illegal

immigrants  in  this  group, this is an ideal  situation  for

harbouring illegal immigrants.

Sir, we must step up public education that illegal immigrants

are  a  threat to our well-being and security and it is  also

the public's duty to be on the lookout.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider further measures to encourage

the public to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>



more proactive in seeking out illegal immigrants?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the Minister informed

the  House last year that the Home Team arrested about 23,000

immigration offenders in 1998, which was a 65% increase  over

the  14,000  arrested  in 1997.  This  increased  arrest,  of

course,  came at a time when the region's economies were  not

doing  well.   As such, it was logical to expect that  people

from  the  not-so-well  developed countries  come  and  flock

illegally  to countries that have weathered the crisis  well.

Singapore was one of these countries.  However, the situation

has changed.  Singapore and the regional economies have begun

to recover.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that Singaporeans may now have the

perception  that  we  no longer have an immigration  offender

problem.  I wonder whether the Minister can update us on  the

current immigration offender situation in Singapore.  I think

we cannot afford to be lax in our enforcement efforts against

immigration  offenders. We are not out of the woods  yet  and

cannot afford to let our guards down.  We should particularly

target those who trade in illegal immigrants, smuggle them in

or  who  are traffickers.  Perhaps we should see how  we  can

increase penalties to deter them from pursuing such trades.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the

immigration law in Singapore is very stringent.  It has to be

because  of  the size of our country.  However,  due  to  the

problem  that  we  encounter with the  slowing  down  of  our

population  growth  and the importance of attracting  foreign

talents, we have accepted more immigrants in recent years  to

fulfil   our  objective.   Otherwise  the  rigidity  of   the

immigration rule is still intact.  One such rule governs  the

return  of  single parents and their offsprings.   The  rules

state  that the children of single parents, father or mother,

who  return  to Singapore cannot be automatically granted  PR

unless  his  or  her single parents can prove that  they  are

gainfully   employed.    However,  many   Singaporean   women

especially, who married

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>



foreigners and who failed in their marriage and having gained

the  custody of their children, find it difficult  to  obtain

PRs for them because they may not be able to secure a job due

to  educational level or many other reasons that are  out  of

their control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dilemma faced by these single parents is that their

ties  have been severed by their former spouses and they have

no alternative place to settle but back to Singapore where at

least  they  have  the  support of their immediate  families.

Perhaps  the  Ministry  should be more compassionate  in  the

ruling  towards  these cases as, first, the number  of  these

cases  must be quite insignificant.  Secondly, at  least  the

child  has  cultural  and  social  ties  with  the  immediate

families.   Thirdly,  it  seems to  be  quite  hard  that  as

Singapore  citizens  their  offspring  cannot  be  considered

favourably to be PR.  Worse still, in case something  happens

to  them,  their  offspring cannot stay in  Singapore  to  be

looked  after  by their immediate families  but  have  to  be

repatriated  to the country where they are its citizen,  they

will  have no connection whatsoever by now and their  spouses

may  have  remarried or moved to other places and  cannot  be

located.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, this House has heard in

the past few days of debate many calls for civil servants  to

be  proactive, accountable and transparent.  I echo the  need

for  civil  servants to have all these attributes  and  would

like  to  focus on the Singapore Immigration and Registration

Department today.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR plays a key role in regulating the number of people

entering  and staying in Singapore.  It also has  a  role  to

play  in determining who should or should not be citizens  or

permanent  residents.   It shares a responsibility  with  the

Ministry  of  Manpower in relation to maids, foreign  workers

and the like, who are on work passes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that many Members of this House are asked

to help applicants to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>



the  SIR.  Whether it be an application for long-term  social

pass,  dependant's pass, or the extension of such passes,  or

the  application  for permanent residence or citizenship,  we

are  continually at a loss as to why a case is rejected or  a

decision postponed.  Usually there is a brief message  saying

that the application has been unsuccessful.  Within a day  of

receiving the letter, the unsuccessful applicant is  back  in

the  meet-the-people session asking the MP to  write  another

letter.   Huge  amount  of paper work is  generated  by  this

process,  let alone the man-hours spent in having  to  answer

what must be a mountain of letters every week from Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the applicants to all these various forms of passes

are  continuously puzzled by the rejection.  They  inevitably

have  stories to tell - their neighbours or their  co-workers

were  successful on similar facts, and so on.  I should  like

to  suggest  that SIR be more precise in their letters.   The

best,  of  course, is to give a reason or reasons  for  their

decision.   That  would  give  invaluable  guidance  to   the

applicant and he or she would be informed as to how he or she

can  improve  their chances of getting the appropriate  pass.

If  the  policy  is somehow veiled in secrecy,  the  official

letters  should  state  how long the  applicant  should  wait

before  his  or her case gets reviewed again.  The  MP  could

perhaps be separately informed about the problem in the case.

But  I  naturally hope that this would be more the  exception

than the rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans who are applying on behalf of

their  spouses  or family members frequently come  frustrated

and  angry  at  the seemingly mysterious rejection  of  their

applications.   And they get even more frustrated  and  angry

when the MP could not lift the veil of mystery.  I believe it

is  time  that SIR must be clearer in their communication  of

their decisions to those who are applying and their sponsors.

Very  often these decisions affect the happiness or otherwise

of  the families concerned.  At least they should be entitled

to  know why their applications are turned down.  I hope  the

Minister can elaborate on this matter.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Singapore Police Force Public

Perception Survey last year and a similar survey done by  the

Straits Times should make us proud of the Home Team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusions are similar: in the Straits Times

survey,  some  99% of the Singaporeans found this  country  a

safe  place to live in; and the Police survey, 95.8%  of  the

respondents  rated the general security of  Singapore  to  be

good  or  excellent.  The public's perception  of  safety  in

Singapore perhaps stems from the fact that Singapore has seen

a decline in crime rate over the past 10 years.  In 1999, the

Police had less than 3,500 cases recorded per month, compared

to  an average of some 4,000 cases per month in 1998.  It  is

heartening to see that almost all major categories of  crimes

have declined.  As a result, people feel safe walking through

a stretch of deserted road from the bus-stop to their homes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the image of a safe and secure Singapore has done

our  economy  much good.  Many investors see Singapore  as  a

place  where  they can do business smoothly, efficiently  and

safely.   Thus,  it  is no surprise that many  multi-national

companies see Singapore as an ideal business hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not however take the situation for granted.

If  the standard of our law enforcing agencies should go into

decline, there is no turning back the clock.  After years  of

being  perceived as a law and order country, today, Japan  is

plagued  by  a  series of scandals in the  police  force  and

public perception of the level of security has dropped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good public perception of the Police is a hard-earned

one.   To ensure that we maintain this high standard, we must

continue  the  high  standard  of  training  and  reward  our

officers well.  In the area of training, we must also improve

the training of officers handling the public as only some 64%

of  the  Straits Times survey rated the service of the Police

to  be  good  or  very good.  It could be  that  poor  public

relations is the cause of this perception.  It

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>



may  be  that  good crime busters may not be the best  public

relations   persons,  but  we  have  to  try.    Besides   an

improvement  in  training, we must also  improve  the  reward

system so that acts of exemplary conduct be well rewarded and

recognised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can highlight to the House how we

can continue to keep our Home Team in tip-top shape.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

on  24th  January this year, the Lianhe Zaobao  shows  a  big

caption that public confidence in the Police in Singapore has

declined.   It  gave me a shock.  Do not  tell  me  that  the

public  has lost its confidence in our Police Force. This  is

not  true.  This caption was very misleading.  If we had  not

carefully read the contents of the article, the readers would

easily get the wrong impression.  Therefore, I feel that  the

media  should  be more careful in dealing with this  type  of

news.   Because  public confidence in the Police  is  closely

linked  to  public order, law and discipline of our  country.

So  the  media  has the responsibility to avoid unnecessarily

and wrongly tarnishing the image of the Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-caption of this news was that more members of

the  public  feel  that  the Police  has  been  effective  in

maintaining public order in Singapore.  But this was the main

finding  of the survey in 1999.  Actually, there is  a  great

contradiction between the two captions.  If more people  feel

that  the  Police is effective in maintaining  public  order,

then  their  confidence in the Police should  be  increasing,

instead of declining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1999 Singapore Police Force Public Perception

Survey,  as compared to the survey in 1996, shows that  there

are  more  people who feel that the perception of the  Police

has  improved.   More people feel that the  Police  has  been

effective in maintaining public order and that the Police has

given  them  adequate protection, and are more  professional.

They  are able to solve crime cases in a better manner.  They

will  do  their  best  to go after the  criminals,  quick  in

response, and effectively enforcing traffic laws,  etc.   The

general overall

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>



impression  of this survey is that the vast majority  of  the

people feel that public order in Singapore is very good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past three years, there have not been great

changes.  As we all know, in 1997 and 1998, many countries in

this  region suffered from the financial crisis and  many  of

them had great political and social unrest, and we could  not

help  being affected, particularly when there were a  lot  of

illegal  immigrants coming here.  It cannot  be  denied  that

there were some cases where Police officers were charged with

corruption  and  they had tarnished the clean  image  of  the

Police  Force.   But  the  fact that  the  Police  Force  has

effectively discovered and dealt with these black sheep among

them  also  illustrates  that  the  Police  Force  itself  is

determined to safeguard its noble image.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maintenance of public order, the Police's

deterrent  effect is crucial.  The deterrent  effect  of  the

Police   Force,   to   a  great  extent,   depends   on   its

professionalism and effectiveness in solving cases.  In  this

respect, it is like paddling a canoe against the current.  If

you  do not go ahead, you will go backwards.  Therefore,  the

Police should work harder to further improve itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the society getting more and more

sophisticated, the Police has to face greater  challenges  in

dealing  with the criminals and in the investigation  of  the

various  types  of  crimes.  The social public  order  cannot

depend  on the Police alone.  The public should also  play  a

very important role to cooperate with the Police.  Therefore,

I will take this opportunity to urge members of the public to

actively  participate in the Community  Safety  and  Security

Programme  launched by the Police Force, so as to  contribute

towards the overall social security.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, if I can take it where

Mr  Chng and Mr Goh have left.  It appears from time to  time

that there is a disjoint between the public perception of the

Police Force and the general crime situation on the one  hand

and the actual state of affairs on the other.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the facts, the Police Force has come a

long way in terms of professionalism, in terms of the quality

of  its manpower and in terms of the general crime situation.

Yet,  the Police Force comes in for an unfair criticism or  a

bum rap, as some would say it from time to time.  Why is that

so?  There appear to be several contributory factors. One  is

occasional   media   reporting;   the   other   is   personal

experiences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can elaborate, although the general statistics on

crime have been improving, occasional crime occurrences, such

as  some recent ones in Bukit Batok, loom large in the public

psyche  and  fundamentally affect their  sense  of  security.

Secondly, personal experiences with the Police.  Although, in

general,  one might be pleased with the state of  affairs,  a

particular episode with an individual officer may  leave  one

with a different impression. And thirdly, a few bad apples in

the  Force may also give the entire Police Force an  unfairly

bad  image.   These occasional episodes can affect  adversely

the general sense of security and therefore public perception

of  the  Police  Force.   And this  may  also  hinder  public

cooperation  with  the Police's efforts,  which  I  think  is

fundamental for the success of the Police's efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is being done

to  maintain and enhance the Police Force's standing  in  the

public  eye.   The Police Force, like any other organisation,

public  or private, needs strong public relations because  it

must  do  a good job and it must be seen to be doing  a  good

job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I would like to know whether the

Ministry  and  the  Police Force, in  particular,  has  a  PR

programme  in general with the national level,  in  order  to

maintain  and  sustain the public's confidence and  sense  of

appreciation for the Police Force.  Second, whether there are

specific programmes that can be put in place in the aftermath

of  particularly dramatic incidents, so that  people  in  the

neighbourhood  can rest assured and their confidence  can  be

restored quickly.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>



And, third, what programmes there are at the individual level

for  particular officers to be trained in order to deal  with

the general public and also with grassroots leaders?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the recent spate of

high  profile  prosecution  of  corrupt  officers  from   the

Singapore  Police Force, the Civil Defence and the  Singapore

Immigration Department (collectively called the "Home  Team")

has  caused  much  concern and dismay to  Singaporeans.   The

prosecutions  would  appear  to  have  had  the   effect   of

undermining  public confidence in the integrity of  the  Home

Team.  Needless to say, Singaporeans take great pride in  the

fact  that  our  society is relatively free from  corruption.

The  fact  that these cases have now come out to light  is  a

matter of concern indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many Singaporeans who continue to express

these  concerns, even though a recent report  from  a  survey

commissioned by the Police Force and published in the Straits

Times  revealed  that  most  Singaporeans  believe  that  the

Singapore  Police Force is doing a good job  in  keeping  the

country   safe   and   that  the  Police   are   respectable,

approachable, well-trained, disciplined and capable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such reaction is only natural, as the public has rightly

come  to  expect the highest level of integrity  and  honesty

from  the  people  whom  they have  placed  their  trust  and

confidence in to look after their safety and security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even though their concern is natural, it is not

the  only way to react to the recent publicity.  On the other

hand, the publicity may be seen from a different perspective.

One way of looking at this is that the prosecution of corrupt

officers shows that we do not cover up such cases.  In  fact,

Singaporeans  should take comfort in the knowledge  that  the

Government  goes  all  out to prosecute  errant  officers  of

whatever  rank.   And  indeed, those tempted  to  follow  the

footsteps of the errant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>



officers  would  know that far from providing any  protection

against  detection  and punishment,  the  Home  Team  and  in

particular the Police Force,  is ever more determined to keep

its own house in order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics given by the Straits Times as to the

exact   number  of  errant  officers  who  were  caught   and

prosecuted  in  recent  years  have  shown  a  rising  trend.

Statistics,  however,  Sir, must be  read  in  context.   The

figures must be seen in the light of the total composition of

the  Home Team.  Compared to previous years, the Police Force

is  now  7,500 strong.  If out of the 7,500 police  officers,

only 35 have been prosecuted as of September 1999, the figure

seems  quite  minuscule indeed.  We must bear  in  mind  that

there  is  an overwhelming number of officers from  the  Home

Team  who  maintain  the  highest  standard  of  conduct  and

decorum.   To  pass poor judgment on the Home Team  would  be

manifestly  unfair to the others who have served the  country

faithfully.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question is whether those who were caught and

prosecuted only represent the tip of the iceberg.  Sir, I  do

not  think so.  Since last year, we note that the police have

put  in  place  a  series  of measures  to  ensure  that  the

integrity  of  the Home Team is maintained.   These  measures

include   job   rotation,  zero  tolerance  for   corruption,

psychological screening and emotional and financial help  for

police officers in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above such measures put in place by the Police

Force,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  whether   the

Government  would consider it necessary to prescribe  heavier

penalties  in  law for police officers who  have  broken  the

trust  of the public by engaging in corrupt practices.   What

this  means  is that the law specifies special  penalties  on

such  officers as opposed to leaving it to the discretion  of

the  judge  as  a  matter  of  sentencing  policy.   This  is

important as it sends a clear signal to members of the public

on the seriousness with which we treat such breaches.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, police officers are not ordinary civil servants.

Together with members of the Home Team, they are entrusted by

the members of the public to protect life and property and to

uphold  the  law.  The Home Team has a very high and  onerous

duty.   A breach of the trust that the public placed on  them

is  very  serious  indeed.  Accordingly, the punishment  must

also  be considerably higher than the rest of society.   With

more  severe  penalties,  it would  perhaps  add  as  another

deterrent to discourage police officers from even thinking of

stepping in the direction of errant ways.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the objective of the Community

Safety   and  Security  Programme  (CSSP)  is  to   encourage

communities  to take active responsibility in solving  safety

and  security problems at the local level, supported  by  the

Home  Team.   Sir, the approach in implementing the  CSSP  so

far  is  to mobilise the community through grassroots leaders

in  the CDCs, CCCs, RCs and neighbourhood committees.   These

grassroots leaders have been instrumental in crafting CSSP in

reaching  out  to  the  residents  and  encouraging  them  to

participate  in their activities.  Although an integral  part

of the community, schools have largely been operating outside

the CSSP framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a number of benefits for us to send the

CSSP to the schools.  These are (1) the focus in dealing with

safety and security concerns.  Sir, different schools have  a

different safety and security profile.  The CSSP allows every

school to tailor-make measures to zero in on the most present

safety and security problems.  For example, some of the  CSSP

activities  may  include  the  refinements  to  the  school's

conduct  of  fire drills, with the assistance  of  the  SCDF,

implementing  a  scheme to enrol students  in  policing  busy

roads  and junctions leading to the schools, etc.  This  will

ensure  that  our  traffic safety rules are  observed  during

school  assembly  and  dismissal  hours.   (2)   Working  out

programmes  to  address  the issue of delinquency  in  school

children loitering in our void decks.  The main point is that

there is a single point of contact for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>



schools.   Schools  currently conduct  individual  Home  Team

contact,  individual Home Team department to seek  advice  in

systems,  in  areas, such as crime prevention,  fire  safety,

drug abuse, prison visits, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the CSSP framework in place, schools can work with

the  Home  Team on all safety and security issues  through  a

single  point of contact represented by the Police.  I  think

this  arrangement  will  also help  to  reduce  inconvenience

workload of the schools.  It will also allow the Home Team to

have  a better understanding with the school's overall safety

and  security  problem and thereby enable the  Home  Team  to

coordinate joint assistance programmes to effectively improve

the safety and security vision of the schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, inculcating community spirit. Through the

CSSP,  the school can educate our students on the community's

role  in  resolving safety and security issues by  roping  in

students  to  participate in the CSSP  activities.   Students

learn  the  concept of community self-help and they  need  to

take up responsibility to look after the community.  Sir,  it

is  timely  that we do more work and take some  comprehensive

steps  to  bring  the  schools to win the  CSSP.   Would  the

Minister  highlight to the House what are the plans  in  this

area?

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, CSSP has been in force for some time

now.  I would like to ask the Minister what the progress  has

been,  in  particular, what the response has  been  from  the

grassroots   organisations  who  have  been   approached   to

participate in the programme.  In particular, I would like to

know whether the Ministry adjudges the programme to have been

a  success so far and how it has measured the success of this

programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as Mr Chng has highlighted, the question is

whether we can build on this platform and extend the CSSP  to

other  organisations  or  other areas  of  concern,  and  the

schools are a logical extension in this respect.  However, my

concern  is  also that, if a school participates  in  a  CSSP

programme, does it risk

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>



attracting an audience that is involved because of a problem,

or  that it is rife with a crime or criminal elements  rather

than  the  fact  that  it  is proactive  and  forthcoming  to

participate in this activity.  So I would ask the Minister to

explain how such programmes, if they intend to be extended to

the  schools  and  other  agencies, will  be  done  and  what

criteria and perhaps, more importantly, how the right message

can  be communicated that this participation is proactive and

not because there are problems rife within the organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, with this general effort to involve the

community  in policing and in the maintenance and enhancement

of  general security in our communities, the question that is

often  asked is whether this augments or whether it  replaces

or  is  a  substitute for activities by  the  Police  on  the

ground,  in particular, patrolling and the manning levels  at

neighbourhood  police  posts,  etc.   So  I  would  like  the

Minister's  assurance that indeed, the CSSP is to  complement

the  existing police activity on the ground and that it  does

not lead to any scaling back of such activity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the speed in which

the  Singapore police officers solve cases is well  known  to

all.  For example, they have done very well in arresting  the

kidnappers, secret society members and robbers. This is  very

heartening.   However, recently, I heard some  comments  from

ordinary  citizens in Singapore that when the police arrested

the  illegal  workers and  loansharks at the coffeeshops  and

hawker centres, they could only arrest the "tua pek kong" but

not  the  "heads".  At first, I did not understand what  they

meant  by  tua  pek  kong.  Later on, I found  out  that  the

ordinary citizens were referring to the runners.  They cannot

get hold of the syndicate leaders, but managed only to arrest

the runners who were really the scapegoats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that with the wisdom, experience and

efficiency of the senior-ranking police officers,  they  need

just to spend a little more time and effort.  And

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



they  would be able to catch hold of these syndicate  leaders

and  not just these runners to be the scapegoats.  Otherwise,

if  our  policemen  can  only nab these  runners,  while  the

syndicate  leaders stay at the back and laugh at  the  police

for  their  incapability, it will be an insult to the  entire

police  force.   From what I know,  even after these  runners

were arrested and sent to prison, the gang would continue  to

collect the protection money, which could be as high as  $500

per  month  from the hawkers.  But of course,  the  syndicate

leaders  will  look after the runners and every  month,  they

will  pay money to family members of these runners to support

them.  What I am worried is that if the police is not able to

catch  hold  of the syndicate leaders, then we would  not  be

able to eradicate these criminal activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, foreign workers

and   domestic  maids  come  from  different  countries  with

different   language,  religious  and  cultural  backgrounds.

Although  statistics  reveal that there are  cases  involving

foreign  workers, it is fortunately not on an  upward  trend.

But  the  number  of cases involving foreign  domestic  maids

seems to be going up and recently, in the media, we read  the

report  of  various  types of cases like rape,  outraging  of

modesty, abuse, theft, etc.  So the impression given to us is

that cases involving foreign domestic maids are on the upward

trend.  Perhaps, their cases may be more complicated than the

cases  involving  our  local citizens and  the  investigating

officers will require some specialist skills for that.   Some

people  feel  that the police should have a special  unit  to

deal  with such cases and the new crime situation.  I do  not

know  whether the Minister would consider setting up  such  a

special unit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> I

thank the Members for raising their points.  Let me deal with

a few of the cuts and then I will ask my Minister of State to

answer the others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the illegal immigrant situation,

raised by Mr Chng Hng Kok and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



Prof.  Chin,  let me report to this House that in  1999,  the

Home  Team  arrested about 17,000 immigration offenders.   By

"immigration  offenders"  we  mean  illegal  immigrants   and

overstayers,   people  who  have  overstayed  in   Singapore,

overstayed  beyond the period stated in their  visit  passes.

This figure of 17,000 is actually a decrease of about 26%  of

the  1998's figure of 23,000.  But this figure is still  much

higher,   about  21%  higher  than  the  14,000   immigration

offenders   arrested  in  1997.   The  immigration  offenders

arrested  in 1999 came from all over the region - Bangladesh,

China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of illegal immigrants arrested in 1999, ie,

those  who  sneak  into Singapore either  by  car,  boat,  or

whatever  means, was about 11,500.  This is  a  22%  decrease

from  the 14,800 compared to 1998.  But it is still 51%  more

than  the 7,600 arrested in 1997 and I consider this  a  very

unacceptably high figure.  As for the overstayers,  5,400  of

them were arrested in 1999 and this is also a decrease of 35%

from  the  8,300 overstayers arrested in 1998 and  a  further

decrease of 14% from the 1997's figure of 6,300.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that the immigration offender problem

remains  in  check, the Home Team has taken  a  multi-pronged

approach  to  deal  with this problem  comprehensively.   For

example,  we  have  enhanced our  border  control.   We  have

continued  with  intensive enforcement  efforts  against  the

traffickers,  the  employers  as  well  as  the   harbourers.

Police  and  Immigration have also conducted raids  in  areas

where  immigration offenders are likely to gather to work  or

live.  Let me elaborate on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, the Police and the Singapore

Immigration   and  Registration  raided  various  immigration

offender  haunts,  including construction sites,  workplaces,

forested  areas  and known congregation  areas.   The  Police

conducted  15  major island-wide operations throughout  1999,

resulting in the arrest of 1,400 illegal immigrants  and  185

overstayers.  In addition, 17 operations were conducted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



in  the  forested areas, with 195 illegal immigrants  and  27

overstayers arrested.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police also targeted the employers of immigration

offenders  and the harbourers at their residential  premises,

such as our HDB flats and also in private estates.  Since  we

stepped  up  enforcement  in  early  1998,  it  is  now  more

difficult  to find congregations of immigration offenders  at

any particular location. The Police has therefore widened its

net  to  include  entertainment outlets in the  crackdown  on

immigration offenders. For example, in October last year, 100

immigration  offenders  were arrested  in  a  discotheque  in

Orchard Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Coast Guard has stepped up both sea and

shore  patrols to detect those who attempt to enter Singapore

illegally  by  sea.   The  Police Coast  Guard  also  deploys

monitoring  posts  equipped with surveillance  equipment  and

systems  at  strategic  locations  to  detect  these  illegal

landings.  The  Police  Coast Guard's enhanced  presence  has

thwarted  many illegal immigration attempts.   In  1999,  the

Police  Coast Guard foiled 52 attempts and arrested close  to

240  illegal immigrants.  To stay on top in its fight against

immigration  offenders and the smugglers,  the  Police  Coast

Guard recently added 20 high speed patrol boats equipped with

the  latest surveillance and digital communication  equipment

and   six   highly  manouverable  speedboats  or  interceptor

speedboats  to its fleet.  Illegal immigrants and traffickers

who try to sneak in by sea will therefore be up against these

high performance boats.  The Police Coast Guard will continue

to  upgrade  its  fleet  to ensure that  it  is  sufficiently

equipped to handle the threats and the challenges it faces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, the new Woodlands Checkpoint or land

checkpoint  came  into  operation.   To  address  Mr   Chng's

question,  the  facilities at this new  Woodlands  Checkpoint

have enabled the immigration to conduct more stringent checks

on  the  people  who  come in, to prevent illegal  entry  and

departure through the land

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>



checkpoints,   without  adversely  affecting  traffic   flow,

because  if  it  starts to check everybody, then  I  am  sure

people  will complain that there are long queues of  vehicles

and long lines of people queuing at our immigration counters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and the immigration also intensified the

intelligence gathering to curb the trafficking of immigration

offenders through the land checkpoints and these efforts have

yielded  positive results. For example, 60 illegal  immigrant

traffickers  were arrested and 52 vehicles  seized  in  1999,

compared  to  only 42 illegal immigrant traffickers  arrested

and  23  vehicles  seized in the year 1998.   Many  of  these

illegal  immigrants who were arrested were  trying  to  enter

Singapore or leave Singapore by concealing themselves in  the

car  boots  or  in  special compartments of  travel  coaches,

lorries  or  bus  kilangs.  The media have  highlighted  some

enforcement successes.  In a widely reported case last  year,

SIR  arrested 35 illegal immigrants who tried to  sneak  into

Singapore  on the 30th of July, which was the very  last  day

when our old checkpoint was in operation. They were all in  a

lorry  under  the canvas sheet and mattresses.   This  tragic

case  resulted  in  four of the illegal immigrants  dying  of

suffocation. This case clearly shows the ruthless  nature  of

the traffickers of these immigration offenders. They will  go

to  no end just to earn a quick dollar without caring for the

safety of the people in the vehicle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and immigration are also now focusing on

crippling the syndicates that are responsible for trafficking

these immigration offenders and giving these offenders forged

documents. With the stringent checks in place, the syndicates

have  been  finding new ways to send these illegal immigrants

through  the land checkpoints.  From using lorries and  buses

or  hiding in car boots, the syndicates are now resorting  to

using  special compartments in the vehicles or ferrying these

illegal  immigrants  by car or lorry to  somewhere  near  the

checkpoint  and  then ask these illegal  immigrants  to  find

their own way into Singapore, or out of Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>



Such action by the syndicates is a sign of their desperation,

in  view  of  the  stringent checks and  enforcement  by  the

authorities.  The evolving nature of the problem  means  that

the  Home Team has to be alert and stay on top of the problem

and  be  responsive to the new methods of operation of  these

syndicates.   We will seek deterrent sentences against  these

syndicate members who are arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the responsibility for tackling the immigration

offender problem does not just lie with the Home Team  alone.

The  public, too, has a role to play. Singaporeans should not

create  the  demand  for immigration offenders  by  employing

them.    That   is   very  important.   And  neither   should

Singaporeans  harbour  them by renting  out  their  premises,

flats,  private apartments or houses to them.  In  1999,  388

employers were arrested, compared to 270 arrested in 1998 for

hiring these immigration offenders.  306 harbourers were also

arrested  last year compared to 166 in 1998. All  these  were

because of stepped-up enforcement by Police and immigration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-owners with premises to let out should be more

careful  when  selecting their prospective  tenants,  because

many  of  these home-owners claimed that they did  not  check

this or that, or they simply checked the copy without looking

at  the  original copy.  What they should do is to check  the

prospective  tenants' original copy of  the  immigration  and

work  passes  and  then cross-check to  make  sure  that  the

particulars  on the passports tally with those  of  the  work

passes.  In addition, where the names of the employers appear

on  the  work passes, then the home-owners should also  check

with the employers to verify that the prospective tenants are

indeed  employed by these employers. If not, they  will  find

themselves in great difficulty explaining to the  court.   If

the  home-owners are in doubt of the genuineness of the  pass

or  about  the status of the person, or even about  his  work

status, then, they should contact the immigration authorities

during  office  hours  or  check  with  the  information  and

services  counters  of  the  Work Permit  Department  of  the

Manpower Ministry to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>



verify the genuineness or the authenticity of these passes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we amended the law, all work permit holders or

foreign  workers must carry their work permits with them  all

the  time. So there is no reason why foreign worker would not

be able to produce the original copy of their work permits on

demand.   Landlords should be suspicious if their prospective

tenants  say that their employer kept the original  and  that

they  have only a photocopy, or that their passports are with

the  employer  and  they  have only a  photocopy.  When  they

receive  such  papers,  they should question  and  insist  on

seeing  the original copies.  A home-owner may lose  his  HDB

flat,  if he or his spouse or any authorised occupier of  the

flat  has been convicted of harbouring immigration offenders.

14  such  errant owners had their flats re-possessed  between

1st January 1995 and 31st October 1999.  So be careful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental point I wish to make here is that, like

our  Members who have suggested, Singaporeans should take  an

interest  in  their own safety and security  and  the  public

should  report any suspected immigration offender as well  as

harbourers and employers of such immigration offenders.  I am

told by the Director of Singapore Immigration that there  was

a  recent instance where a member of the public came  forward

to report a suspected immigration offender who had produced a

forged  blue identity card. The member of the public saw  the

forged blue identity card and he suspected that something was

not  quite right.  He called the SIR to look at that identity

card  and SIR confirmed that that foreigner was, in fact,  an

immigration  offender.   Such public spiritedness  is  to  be

encouraged.  This  will further deter  anyone  who  wants  to

employ or harbour such immigration offenders and in the  end,

these immigration offenders will find that they have no place

to live, work or hide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the case brought up by Mr Chng of the 120 persons

found  living in a boarding house in Serangoon  Road,  I  had

followed  up and checked it out, and I was told that  all  of

them are here with work passes. So

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>



they  have  work permits.  But the owner of the property  has

misused his property.  He did not have the permission of  the

proper  authority and I believe URA or BCA has taken  action,

and so has the Civil Defence Force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me also talk about the Immigration Act which

deals  with  immigration  offenders.  We  have  reviewed  the

Immigration Act quite a few times already to make  sure  that

it  is  effective in dealing with this problem  and  now  the

Ministry   is   reviewing  the  Immigration  Act   based   on

operational   experience  to  ensure  that  this   piece   of

legislation  continues to remain effective.  For example,  we

are considering introducing new provisions to ensure that the

housing   agents  also  play  their  part  in   curbing   the

immigration  offender  problem. To deter  the  harbouring  of

immigration  offenders, the current Immigration  Act  imposes

due diligence on the person letting out the accommodation  to

check  and  make  sure that the prospective tenants  are  not

immigration  offenders.  But my Ministry  will  now  consider

extending  this  legal requirement for due diligence  by  the

landlords to those who act as facilitators or middlemen in  a

transaction to rent out the premises as well.  But  this  new

provision  will  not  absolve or reduce the  home-owners  and

landlords to conduct due diligence checks as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my colleagues spoke on the public perception

of  the  police  force  and  Mr Goh Choon  Kang  specifically

referred to the headline in the press report in Lianhe Zaobao

and  he  also  explained  that  the  second  headline  better

explains the public perception of the Police Force.   Let  me

say  that  I  am the first person to be concerned  about  the

public  perception of the Police Force because, if the public

has  a  poor impression of the police force, I think it  will

make  it  very  difficult for the Police to operate  in  this

environment. They cannot recruit people to join them  because

it is a lousy outfit or people think it is a lousy outfit and

they  cannot do their job well because the public  would  not

cooperate with it.  But we must look at the problem  that  is

currently   highlighted  or  reported   in   the   press   in

perspective, in the total context of the Police Force.  From

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>



what  you  read in the papers and what you read  about  other

countries  like in the United States, whether it  is  in  New

York or Los Angeles, or whether it is in Japan or in Britain,

I  think  the  problems  we face pale in  significance.   But

still,  I am concerned because any black sheep that  we  have

will  cast a black mark on the whole force and will  make  it

difficult for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the survey mentioned by Mr Goh Choon Kang

first.  Generally, the survey has been positive and  many  of

the  positive points have been highlighted.  This survey  was

done by a private survey agency, Forbes Research, and it  was

commissioned  by  the  Police Force.  That  survey  was  also

reinforced  by the results of the Straits Times  survey.  The

significant  attributes of the survey were that  90%  of  the

people  surveyed  felt  that  the  Police  is  effective   in

maintaining law and order, and this is an increase of 6% over

the  previous survey.  78% of the people surveyed  found  the

Police  is rational in discharging their duties, and this  is

also  an increase of 5% over the previous survey.  82%  found

that the Police has done well in solving crimes, and this  is

also an increase of 3% compared to the previous survey.   76%

felt  that the Police provides high quality service, and this

is  also an improvement of 7% over the previous survey.  When

the  respondents  were asked to select five  out  of  the  13

statements, whether they are positive statements or  negative

statements  of  the  Police,  the  five  top  attributes   or

descriptive   terms  of  the  Police  were  that   they   are

respectable,  approachable,  well-trained,  disciplined   and

capable.   So, the public perception of the Police  is  still

generally  positive.  The fact that the public is willing  to

come  forward  and  help the Police in solving  a  number  of

crimes  is testimony to the public's confidence in the Police

Force, that Police will act when they make a report.  In  the

instance  of  snatch  theft, motor  vehicle  theft,  robbery,

housebreaking, outraging of modesty, murder and rape, 45%  of

the  arrests of people who committed these offences were  the

result of public cooperation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>



<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop referred to in the headlines in Zaobao was in

response    to    respectability,   and    reliability    and

trustworthiness, both registering falls to 77%,  down  by  6%

for  respectability; and for reliability and trustworthiness,

down  4%, at 57% compared to the previous survey.  But  these

reductions,  I  believe,  were due to  the  recent  spate  of

reports  of Police corruption in one major case   -   the  Ah

Long  San case.  But one must not let this one case  mar  the

whole perception and whole performance of the Police Force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put in context, more than 99.9% of our Police Force

officers  conduct  themselves well.  Less than  0.1%  of  the

Police  Force  officers are charged in court every  year.   I

think  we must look at the numbers in perspective.   And  the

Police  is  serious in weeding out all these errant  officers

whenever they are found, and although the Police knew that it

would attract adverse publicity, it does not hesitate to take

these  officers to court, even though it may attract  adverse

publicity against the Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Sin Boon Ann's suggestion to raise the

penalty for Police officers who commit criminal offences such

as  corruption, yes, I will take note of his suggestion.  For

now,  I  believe the courts have enough discretion to  impose

the maximum penalty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng asked how does the Police make sure that it

keeps  up  its  image and the performance  of  its  officers.

Training  is  the  key,  as Mr Chng  himself  has  said,  and

supervision and management.  There are various measures  that

the  Police  has  put in place to ensure  that  its  officers

continue  to  remain on top of the job.   Basic  training  is

definitely a must, and they take a multi-pronged approach  in

training,  inculcating  the  right  values,  competencies  in

discharging  their  duties, and they  also  do  psychological

tests.   In  other  words, before people are  recruited,  our

Police  Psychological Unit actually interviews them  and,  as

far  as possible, try to sieve out those who are not suitable

for the Police Force.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also continuous training on the job, and the

training  for  the supervisors who, I believe, are  the  most

important people in making sure that the officers under their

charge  do  the job properly.  Because without good managers,

without  good supervision, then I think something will  give.

So  it  is  important that we also train our Police  managers

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Iswaran's concern about the public sense of

safety,  let  me assure him that generally the  public  still

feel  very  safe.  Otherwise, the results of the survey  will

not hear this out.  But the question he also raises is: do we

have a good PR strategy to deal with these problems that crop

up  from  time  to  time?  The Police meets  the  press  very

regularly.   It  briefs them on the major cases.   It  briefs

them  on  how it handles its cases.  And I think  the  public

know  from these cases and the handling of the cases and  the

speed in which the Police solves some of the problems and the

cases  show  the Police has been quite proactive in  engaging

the  media  and  in sharing with them as much information  as

possible.   But sometimes the Police cannot  tell  the  press

everything  because  some  of  these  are  operational  trade

secrets.  We also do not want the people on the wrong side of

the  law to learn about them and find new ways of beating us.

So,  sometimes we have to reserve a bit of our  position  and

not  tell  everything.   But as far as possible,  the  Police

tries  to  manage it and get to the public and tell  them  as

much  as  they  can.  By informing the public about  what  is

going on, even by reporting the crimes that are committed, it

also  serves a purpose to remind the public that although  we

have  a  low crime rate in Singapore, it does not  mean  that

there is no crime.  So please take the necessary precautions.

So,  highlighting  all these cases is not  at  all  bad,  but

sometimes  we  have to hold back some of the information,  or

even  have  to ask the press to cooperate not to release  the

information, as it may jeopardise a case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's kidnapping case is a good example. I know

that some journalists got wind of that and, fortunately, they

cooperated and did not put out the story.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



Otherwise, I think the Police operation to catch the culprits

would  have been in jeopardy.  It is only after the  culprits

were  arrested that the story came out.  I think that is  the

way  we should manage all these cases.  I suppose if you have

read  about  cases in Taiwan, I think the press got  to  know

more  than  the  police, and I do not think  that  helps  the

victim  at  all in solving his or her problem.  That  is  the

kind  of  approach that we want to take.  But, of  course,  I

would say also that we can be a bit more proactive and we can

find new ways of marketing ourselves.  And I have always told

my  officers  that while they may have a good story,  a  good

product, if they have not told people about how and why  they

do  it, then I think they have not won the public  over.   It

is  not that we want to brag about what we do and gain credos

and  applause, but really if we have done something  good,  I

think the public ought to know it, so that they know that the

Police is actually working hard for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Iswaran that we take safety and

security  very  seriously.  But I also want  to  stress  that

safety  and security is not just the job of the Police Force,

or  the job of the Home Team only.  In fact, the idea that we

are trying to propagate is that every one of us living in our

community,  living  in  our HDB flats  and  private  estates,

actually  has  a  role  to play in ensuring  that  the  place

remains  a  safe  and secure one for us.  So  this  programme

called  the  Community Safety and Security Programme  is  one

such  programme that we put out to engage the community.   It

is  not  a programme to pass responsibility to the community,

as  some  would  like to believe.  The Police will  carry  on

doing  its  job, so will CNB, Immigration, Civil Defence  and

all  the  other departments.  But if the residents themselves

do  not  play a role, because they are the ones on the ground

who know exactly what goes on, and if they do not play a role

in  helping to ensure that the place is safe and secure, then

it is very difficult for the Police to be there all the time.

It is impossible for the Police to be everywhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Community Safety and Security Programme, which Mr

Goh Choon Kang also said that we should promote and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



encourage,  is indeed something that we ought to  do.   Since

the programme was launched in October 1997, we have, to date,

<br><br>450&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Safety and Security Programmes already drawn up

by  the various committees  -  RCs, neighbourhood committees,

and  they are doing it even in private estates.  I think this

is  quite encouraging.  The fact that individuals and parents

are coming forward, eg, to make sure that the zone around the

school is safe for the children, is a good sign.  But I think

more  should  be  done, not just keeping this programme  only

within  the  grassroots  committees or  only  within  certain

concerned  citizens, but all residents who want to make  sure

that  their place is safe and secure should play a  role.   I

think  that is the only way for us to drive out the  would-be

criminals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, in fact, I take a deep interest

in this because wearing both hats in the People's Association

and  the  Police,  I think there is a lot of  synergy  to  be

derived  between  the community organisations  and  what  the

Police, the Civil Defence and the CNB want to do.  It is  not

just  using the vehicle of the grassroots organisations,  but

because the People's Association is also an organisation that

helps  to  promote community bonding, cohesiveness and  self-help  among the community.  We thought that this is really  a

practical  example  of  active citizenship.   We  talk  about

Singapore  21 and active citizenship, and I think this  is  a

concrete  example  of  what  active  citizens  can   do   for

themselves, for self-interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion to extend this programme to

schools,  we are already thinking about that, but I  want  to

tread a bit cautiously here.  Because some may feel, like  Mr

Iswaran  said,  that the schools may attract the  odium  that

they have a problem.  Let me assure them that this is not the

case  to  highlight a problem in the school,  but  really  to

encourage  the  school community to also care for  their  own

safety and security, within their own neighbourhood.  And the

students will also, in a way, be involved with the community,

not just within the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



school  itself, but also the neighbourhood around them.   But

we can work with the

school,  with the parents, teachers and the students, whether

it is on juvenile delinquency, street gangs or bullies and so

on.   I think it is good that they themselves play a role  in

identifying  and  finding solutions to solve these  problems.

And the Home Team will give them the necessary support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tread cautiously here because some teachers

may  not  fully  understand this now.   Some  principals  may

wonder  whether  we are giving them more work.   So  we  have

taken  the first step to brief the cluster supervisors.   Let

them understand it.  Then we are going to have a meeting with

some  principals so that they can understand what it  is  all

about, and those who are willing can experiment on this, just

as  we  did on the anti-drug campaign.  We have got  all  the

schools  involved in preventive drug education  now,  and  no

school  is  saying that just because it has got an  anti-drug

campaign  or it has a group of people coming to talk  to  its

students  on drugs or drug prevention, the school has  got  a

drug  problem.  I think that kind of perception is no  longer

so  visible any more.  I want to take CSSP one step closer to

the  schools but, at the same time, I will move it at a  pace

that the schools are comfortable with.  The CSSP is really  a

project  to complement the community with all the  Home  Team

departments, including the Civil Defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system of working together with police posts,

working  together  with the police centre,  is  certainly  an

improvement  over the normal community policing concept  that

we  have implemented for quite some time.  We have now  moved

from  NPP  to  NPC in two of our Police Divisions.   The  NPC

will, since Mr Iswaran asked, let me say to him and all of us

here,  actually provide more time for the Police officers  to

do  patrols on the ground, because the NPCs can deploy  their

resources  better.  The results in the two  NPCs  have  shown

that  the  crime rate is actually lower, and Police time  for

patrols  has  actually  increased,  and  the  residents   are

generally  happy with the system.  And in time, by next  year

or a year after that,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



we  shall have all our Police Divisions converted to the  NPC

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to Mr Peh Chin Hua's question whether we

are  only catching the Tua Pek Kongs and not the masterminds.

The  Police must be also interested in syndicate leaders, not

just  only the runners of the syndicates.  Wherever possible,

they  will  go  after  them.   The  Police  has  indeed  been

successful in a number of such cases.  One recent example was

in  December  last year when the Police smashed  a  syndicate

which  supplied  immigration  offenders  as  labourers.   The

syndicate  leader and his associates were all arrested.  They

were  all responsible for managing the illegal workers.  They

were  deploying them to the various companies  and  worksites

and  they  were also collecting the payments.  The  syndicate

leader has since been charged in court and the case will come

up for trial.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Police also busted two illegal

moneylending  syndicates that were active  in  Circuit  Road,

Geylang  and  Changi  areas.   The  two  masterminds  of  the

syndicates  who are responsible for providing  money  to  the

runners  to  operate the illegal money-lending business  were

also  arrested.   Both  masterminds  have  been  brought   to

justice.   But breaking up syndicate operations and arresting

and prosecuting the leader of the masterminds is not a simple

and  straightforward issue because it  will  take  time.   It

involves  careful  planning, careful intelligence  collection

and  elaborate investigations.  You do not just rush in there

and  catch  somebody and say he is the mastermind,  otherwise

you  might  catch the wrong guy and the real fellow  may  run

away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me assure Mr Peh that police does pay a great

deal  of attention on the mastermind, just as we also  do  on

those who traffic illegal immigrants or who traffic in drugs.

I  think the most important thing, of course, is to go  after

the mastermind. As far as possible that will be done.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



But  let me also say that it is more than one person who will

be  involved and if we chop one head, new heads will pop  up.

Some  of them may not even be here to be found.  I will  tell

you  that  in  many instances the masterminds of the  illegal

immigrants are actually not in Singapore. They are not  based

in  Singapore. They might be Singaporeans but  they  are  not

based in Singapore.  So it is not that easy to catch them.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I will now take the three cuts of Mr Kenneth

Chen, Prof. Chin Tet Yung and Mr Goh Choon Kang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen said that the Government has made it

difficult  for  Singapore citizen mothers,  including  single

mothers,  who  have lived abroad and divorced  their  foreign

spouses, to get Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) status for

their children when they return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first say that it is not true that the

Government  has  made  it  difficult  for  Singapore  citizen

mothers  who  have  lived abroad to get PR status  for  their

children  when they return.  These Singapore citizen  mothers

would be assessed no differently than if they had resided  in

Singapore  all  the  time,  in  other  words,  they  are  not

penalised for having lived or worked overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Chen that the Government adopts a

compassionate approach towards female Singapore citizens  who

sponsor  their children for PR.  Generally, as  long  as  the

female Singapore citizen is able to provide evidence to  show

that  she is able to support the family financially, we would

grant PR to her children.  This is a justifiable requirement.

In  some  cases, it might take some time for her to establish

her  income.   So  if the Singapore citizen mother  continues

working, it should be a matter of time before her child  gets

PR.   In  the  event  that the child  cannot  be  granted  PR

immediately, the child is normally issued a long-term  Social

Visit Pass or Student's Pass so that he or she can remain  in

Singapore  with  the mother. In any case,  where  a  case  is

marginal, we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



prepared to exercise flexibility in granting PR to the child.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin Tet Yung has asked whether Singapore

Immigration and Registration (SIR) can be more transparent in

its replies to unsuccessful appellants.

Prof. Chin would be pleased to know that this is indeed  what

SIR aims to do.  SIR regularly reviews the way it replies  to

appellants.   Over  the  years, the department  has  in  fact

become   more  forthcoming  in  providing  the  reasons   for

rejection.   More efforts would be made in this direction  in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR would as far as possible disclose the reasons for

rejection  to the appellants.  For example, in certain  cases

where  the  foreigner does not have a stable employment,  SIR

would  inform  the  appellant that more  time  is  needed  to

monitor  his income and employment track record.   There  are

also  cases  where SIR would advise the appellant to  produce

the necessary documentary evidence to substantiate the claims

in  the  application,  such as the relationship  between  the

sponsor and the appellant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the point to note is that in striving to be

more  transparent,  SIR  has also  to  be  careful  that  the

provision of reasons for rejection does not lead to abuse and

circumvention of the evaluation criteria.  SIR would continue

to  strike  an  appropriate balance between transparency  and

prevention of abuse, based on the merits of each case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I go to Mr Goh Choon Kang's cut. Mr Goh Choon Kang

has  expressed concern over cases involving maid  abuse.   He

has  asked  for  a  response  of the  Ministry  to  a  recent

suggestion in the Lianhe Zaobao that a unit be set up to deal

with  allegations  made by foreign domestic  maids.   Let  me

assure  the  House  that the maid abuse  situation  is  under

control.  The number of maid abuse cases is small relative to

their  population  in  Singapore.  In  1999,  there  were  82

substantiated  cases of maid abuse.  This was  slightly  less

than the 89

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



cases  in 1998.  However, the figures for 1999 and 1998  were

significantly lower when compared to the 1997 figure of  157.

This  is  due  to  the fact that in April  1998  we  enhanced

penalties  against maid abusers in the Penal  Code.   So  the

situation has certainly improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his question whether or not there is a need to set up

a  special  unit to look after or investigate such cases,  my

Ministry has considered the suggestion but we feel that there

is no such necessity.  The reason is that these investigators

are professionally trained and equipped to deal with the wide

range  of  offences, including maid abuse and in  some  cases

false  allegation cases.  All complaints and  accusations  by

maids are treated seriously and thoroughly investigated,  and

where  there  is a need, interpreters are used.  The  current

system  is  working  well.  There is no  need  to  set  up  a

separate unit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, last year, a few high

profile  drug  busts were reported.  Only  yesterday  it  was

reported that another drug ring has been crippled.  This  was

indeed  good  news for Singaporeans.  We should  congratulate

our  drug  enforcement officers' tremendous effort.  However,

we  have  not  been  informed of how this  has  affected  the

statistics of drug offenders.  Can the Ministry release  some

figures   of  drug  abuse  in  year  1999?   Was  there   any

improvement  or  did  any such busts cause  the  drug  abuser

numbers to be decreased?  I would also like to request for an

update  of  the rehabilitation effort. What is the percentage

of drug abusers who have been successfully converted?  At the

present  moment, the law is harsh on drug consumers.   It  is

rightly  so because when one starts to consume drugs,  it  is

likely  that he would become a drug addict and we must  spare

no effort to ensure that this would not happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like the Ministry to consider, instead

of  harsh punishments such as jail or DRC detention for  long

periods  of  time, whether there are more effective  ways  to

deal  with  first time offenders so that they  would  not  be

stigmatised and put themselves in a position

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



where they will have no opportunity to go back to normal life

because of a moment of weakness.  I think it is important  to

try our best to help them to get away from this vicious cycle

of  drug abuse as the more they are isolated and outcast  the

more difficult it is to rehabilitate them.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I echo Mr Kenneth

Chen's  request  for more details on the drug  situation  and

also  join  with  him  in  congratulating  our  CNB  for  the

successes  in  fighting the drug problem.  In 1998,  we  were

informed  of  the improving drug situation.   They  both  had

dropped  in  the  number of arrested and improvement  in  the

relapse rate of drug addicts over the corresponding figure in

1994.   It  has  been  two years since,  and  besides  abuses

involving  traditional drugs such as heroin and cannabis,  we

also  learn  with concern from the media that abuses  of  new

forms of drugs such as Ice and Ecstasy have been on the  rise

in  the  region.   It has also been reported that  these  new

drugs  no longer have to be supplied from traditional sources

like   the  Golden  Triangle  but  can  be  manufactured   in

laboratories here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must ensure that we continue to maintain our

tough  stance against drug and drug traffickers and to ensure

that  our young people are adequately informed of the  danger

of  drugs  and  not experiment with them.  I would  therefore

like  to ask the Minister to provide the House with an update

on  the  local drug situation since 1998 and to let  us  know

what his Ministry has done or will do to ensure that the drug

menace remains under control, particularly in relation to the

newer drugs that have come on to the market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the strict

enforcement of law in Singapore is well-known throughout  the

world. That is why our public law and order, as well as  drug

control, is much stronger than in many other countries.  This

is something that we are very proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully admire the police force and the various law

enforcement  agencies  for their spirit  of  professionalism.

However, recently, I discovered that some law

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



enforcement  agencies have been too rigid  enforcing  certain

types  of  offences  and they have forgotten  that  sometimes

within  the  law  we  should also  exercise  some  mercy  and

compassion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in my meet-the-people session, I came across

two  cases.   In  the first case, a resident in  my  GRC  was

retrenched during the financial crisis.  For quite some time,

he  was unable to find a job to support his family.  In order

to  make  ends  meet,  he was stupid  enough  to  succumb  to

circumstances and resorted to sell uncensored VCDs.  Although

the  VCDs  he sold were neither pornographic nor religiously-sensitive, they were nevertheless illegal.  During a raid  by

the  police, he was arrested.  He pleaded guilty in court and

was  sentenced to two years' imprisonment, even though he was

a first offender with no previous conviction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second case involved a female resident in my GRC.

Because  of  family  and  some financial  problems,  she  was

induced  by  somebody to take  drugs and the very first  time

when  she  was  taking  drugs, she was  arrested  by  Central

Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers, and charged in court.   Upon

conviction,  she  was  sentenced to one year's  imprisonment,

albeit a first offender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, selling uncensored VCD is an offence. But for

a  first offender, the sentence of two years in prison is too

heavy.   In  order  to earn a living, he did  not  resort  to

robbery  or secret society activities, but was merely selling

some uncensored VCDs.   As a first offender, a sentence of  a

few months' imprisonment would have been adequate to serve as

a  deterrence  to  him.  To  me,  a  two-year  jail  term  is

manifestly  excessive.   He had given  an  assurance  not  to

repeat  the offence.  After interviewing him, I was convinced

that  he was truly repentant.  I made representation  on  his

behalf to the relevant authority, but it was rejected by  the

prosecution  and  the judge.  I wonder if we could  sometimes

temper  justice  with  mercy,  and  give  these  first   time

offenders with good mitigating circumstances a chance to turn

over  a  new  leaf.  Likewise, this female resident  who  was

arrested for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



consumption of drugs was fully remorseful and promised not to

consume drugs again.  I have written four or five letters  to

the  various  departments and even with all  the  counselling

that she had undertaken, her mitigation plea was not accepted

by   the  authorities.   She  was  sentenced  to  one  year's

imprisonment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt, they were guilty of the offences that

they   had  been  charged  with.   They  were  sentenced   to

imprisonment.  There is nothing we can say about it.  But for

first  offenders, can we not be slightly lenient and be  more

compassionate to them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, with the rapid advances in

technology  and  DNA testing and accuracy of the  results,  I

think  it  is  timely for us to develop a  DNA  database  for

convicted  criminals.  Presently, this  is  done  in  several

developed  countries and the results have  been  positive  in

solving  crimes  committed by known   criminals.   I  do  not

intend to go into the technical merits of DNA testing and the

results  and  so on, but I am confident that  building  up  a

database will help in the long term in solving crimes and  of

course in improving our crime fighting abilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the Minister to update the House on what are some

of the concrete plans that we are doing in this direction.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, since the introduction of the

Neighbourhood Police Centres last year, a number of temporary

NPCs were built to serve residents in various constituencies.

As  the NPC is a new concept, there is not much provision  to

integrate the siting of NPCs in both new and existing  towns.

Thus,  not  much  priority is given to  NPCs  when  they  are

selecting  suitable sites for development.   In  many  cases,

NPCs   were  simply  asked  to  co-locate  with  many   other

organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, I would like to make the following

clarifications:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can the Ministry incorporate the planning of NPCs in the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, a Singapore citizen complained

the theft; yet he was made to pay $100 for the replacement of

his IC.  That incident brings up the following issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it shows that the Government bureaucracy is

totally inflexible.  In that case, the Police had caught  the

thief and the thief had admitted that he had disposed of  the

complainant's IC.  There was indisputable evidence  that  the

complainant's IC was stolen and not negligently  lost.   Yet,

he was made to pay $100 for the replacement of his IC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the money collected is excessive. If it is a

genuine  case of having one's identity card stolen,  at  most

the  Government should only charge an administrative fee  of,

say,  $5.   The local banks only charge that amount  for  the

replacement  of  lost  ATM cards.  The  amount  of  $100  for

replacement of an IC is definitely not, I believe,  to  cover

for  the  administrative  cost, but  as  a  punishment  or  a

penalty.  The end result, of course, is that the Government's

coffers  will  become even more with money.   The  Government

should  not ingrain in its civil servants to be so inflexible

when  it  comes  to  imposing  penalties.   They  should   be

compassionate.  If there is a good explanation or good reason

why  the IC was lost, they should not blindly just force  the

complainant   to   pay   $100  but   look   into   his   case

compassionately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, this case shows that if there is no check on

the  Government's bureaucracy, it can abuse its powers.   Not

only  the  bureaucrats in that instance took  $100  from  the

complainant  but threatened to charge a further $300  if  the

next time he lost his IC, although, in the first instance,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



that  person  had indisputable proof that his IC was  stolen.

Contrasted with the civil servants, the people in the private

sector must be given top marks.  Happily for the complainant,

the POSBank and DBS did not charge him the $5 replacement for

the reported loss of his ATM card.  In fact, the officers  of

those banks waived the $5 replacement fee when he showed them

the police report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that this matter will be looked into by the

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen and Prof. Chin

asked about the drug situation in Singapore.  Since the  peak

of  the  drug  problem in 1994, MHA has taken a multi-pronged

approach in dealing with this problem.  This was done through

preventive   drug   education,  very  rigorous   enforcement,

rehabilitation  and  aftercare of those abusers  arrested  or

detained in the DRCs.  This strategy has worked well and I am

pleased  to  report  to  the  House  that  the  drug  problem

continues to be well under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of drug abusers arrested fell by a marked 15%

from  4,500  in  1998 to about 3,800 in 1999.  The  continued

high  price and the low purity level of heroin in  the  local

market  also  confirm  that  the  drug  situation  here   has

improved.  The purity level of the heroin, the main  drug  of

abuse, has fallen to an all time low of less than 3% compared

to 7% in 1996.  Over the same period, the price of heroin has

actually increased from $10 a straw to $20 a straw.  For  the

second  consecutive year since 1998, the number of  new  drug

addicts arrested has also remained below 800.  The last  time

it  fell  below 800 was in 1986.  CNB's enforcement,  as  you

read  from  time to time in newspapers, continued  to  remain

rigorous.   It  conducted  48  major  operations  last  year,

crippling  30  drug trafficking syndicates  in  the  process.

Approximately 50 kg of heroin and about 7 kg of cannabis were

seized  last  year.  About 100 kg of opium  and  over  17,000

Ecstasy tablets were also seized.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Council Against Drug Abuse has continued to

play a crucial role

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



in preventive drug education.  The Council works very closely

with   the   CNB,   with  the  schools,   voluntary   welfare

organisations  as well as the private sector corporations  to

run  programmes  to  specifically target at-risk  youths  and

there was a mass awareness programme highlighting the dangers

of  drug abuse.  For example, the Council works closely  with

SANA  (Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association) to put  together

an  outreach  programme targeting out-of-school youth  called

the  Peer  Alliance Liaison or PAL programme.  Many voluntary

welfare  organisations have since joined  this  programme  to

turn at-risk youths away from abusing drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council also works very closely with advertising

agencies  under  the banner of Partnership  for  a  Drug-free

Singapore.   This  Partnership  devised  innovative  ways  to

spread  the  anti-drug message.  Last year,  the  Partnership

organised  an  anti-drug song writing  contest,  published  a

parents'  guide  to drug prevention and developed  innovative

advertisements showing the dangers of heroin, Ecstasy and Ice

abuse, and these agencies actually put in a lot of their  own

time and resources and expertise in helping in this effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, I briefed Members on the rehabilitation and

aftercare  measures  undertaken  by  my  Ministry.    And   I

highlighted  the  community-based  programme  which  releases

addicts  into  the community to continue their rehabilitation

in  supportive environment, such as half-way houses  and  the

offer  of  employment opportunities for addicts  through  the

SCORE's job placement service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides continuing with these measures, we also offer

more educational and vocational training for drug addicts  in

the  past years.  The commencement of the Prisons school this

year also gives better facilities and more opportunities  for

drug  addicts to study.  Information technology classes  have

also  been  introduced to the drug inmates  last  year.   And

these   measures  have  contributed  in  some  way   to   the

reintegration of the addicts into our society.  As a  result,

we saw a decline of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



the relapse rate from 81% in 1994 to about 52% last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For first-time abusers, Mr Chen has asked whether there

are  better or more effective ways of dealing with them.  Let

me  assure  Mr  Chen  that we do try to help  the  first-time

abusers who are earnest in wanting to kick their drug  habit.

The  Prisons  Department actually runs a treatment  programme

called  the Voluntary Treatment Programme which is  basically

intended for first-time abusers.  Under this programme, first-time abusers who confess and volunteer to go for treatment in

Changi  Hospital  will  be given the opportunity  to  undergo

detoxification  and follow-up counselling  sessions,  without

being  committed to the DRC and therefore have no record,  so

to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the number of first-time abusers who actually

successfully complete this programme is dismally  low.   Many

of  them  just  do  not have the stamina,  determination  and

discipline to go through with it.  Out of the 137 abusers who

signed  up  for this programme since 1996, only  44  of  them

eventually completed the programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to help the first-time abusers to help

themselves.   But,  ultimately, they  must  help  themselves.

Because if they do not, nobody can help them.  If Mr Chen  or

anybody else can think of better ways of rehabilitating them,

I would be very happy to look into them.  But let me tell him

and  everybody here, that nobody enjoys sending a drug abuser

to a court or to the DRC, because ultimately we would like to

have  our  society rid of this problem.  But if he  does  not

heed  the  law,  then, of course, the law  has  to  take  its

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Chng's question about the DNA technology,

let  me  say that my Minister of State has already  mentioned

something  like  that the last time he spoke  on  this.   The

Police is already beginning to study this to find out how  it

can make better use of DNA technology for its investigations.

And it is looking at the practices

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



in other countries, such as UK and US which have successfully

set  up  such databases.  The setting up of the database  for

DNA is indeed a strategic thrust of the Police.  For forensic

and  intelligence-led investigations, DNA  should  become  an

important  tool for criminal investigation as  the  criminals

are   now   becoming  more  sophisticated,  and  conventional

investigation  methods  will  become  inadequate.   But   the

setting  up  of a DNA database is not a straightforward  task

because  it  will  take time, as operational,  technical  and

legal  issues need to be looked at.  We are now working  with

the Health Ministry and AG's Chambers on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the NPCs and the criteria we

use  for  selecting the sites for the NPCs.  We want to  site

the  NPC where the community is.  Where else can it  be?   It

cannot  be  tucked  in a corner somewhere in  Singapore.   It

ought  to  be convenient, central and easily accessible.   As

far  as  possible, we will also try to site the NPC  together

with the community clubs, community centres.  We already have

done  so in a couple of the community clubs and centres where

the  NPCs  are co-located.  Over the years, we are  going  to

have  another  10  or 12 more such NPCs co-located  with  the

community clubs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a policy of the Government, and here I am wearing

my  two hats as People Association's Deputy Chairman as  well

as  the Minister in charge of Police, that we would have  the

NPC co-located with the community club as far as possible. We

have  to  maximise the land use.  It is a luxury  to  have  a

stand-alone  community club occupying 0.4 or 0.5 hectares  of

space.   I think in land scarce Singapore, we should maximise

the land use, put as much of our communal facilities together

as  possible, so that they can share in the use  of  land  as

well as become convenient points of contact for Singaporeans.

Quite a number of other organisations are co-located with the

community  clubs,  such  as  the library,  NTUC  child  care,

Council of Social Services and some corporate members of  the

People's Association.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me take Mr

Peh  Chin Hua's cut.  I would now respond to his concern that

there  should be greater compassion when the Police  and  law

enforcement   departments  enforce  our  laws,   particularly

against first-time offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the Police and the Attorney-General's Chambers

already  exercise compassion whenever appropriate,  before  a

decision is made to prosecute offenders.  If the offence is a

minor  one and the offender has a good record, indeed he  may

be let off with a warning, instead of being charged in court.

For  example, in 1998, over 1,800, constituting about 40%  of

shoplifters,  were  let off with a warning.   However,  being

forced by circumstances as an excuse is not acceptable and is

not  a justification for committing an offence.  Sir, neither

should  a  person be exonerated nor spared punishment  merely

because he is a first-time offender.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cases of the sort that Mr Peh mentioned must have

been  serious enough for the offenders to be charged in court

in  the  first place.  The court then takes into account  all

the   relevant  facts  and  mitigating  circumstances  before

deciding on the appropriate punishment in accordance with the

law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our laws and enforcement approach are tough but

fair.   Our  enforcement agencies will continue  to  exercise

compassion  where justified.  In line with this approach,  as

Mr  Peh  would know, my Ministry is working with the relevant

Government agencies to put in place a range of new sentencing

options  such  as  community service orders,  front-end  home

detention,  boot  camps, and probation for  adult  offenders.

These  sentencing  options  carry  a  greater  rehabilitative

element  and would be suitable for persons who have committed

relatively  minor  offences and first time  offenders.   They

will complement existing forms of punishment and broaden  the

court's sentencing options.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now take Mr Chiam's cut. Mr Chiam has commented

that persons who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



are  victims  of  crime are also penalised by  the  deterrent

replacement  fee through no fault of theirs.  He  feels  that

our  civil servants are bureaucratic and Government is unfair

in  levying the replacement fee of $100.  First, let  me  say

that  the  deterrent  replacement fee  complements  Singapore

Immigration and Registration's (SIR)  public education effort

to  get Singaporeans to take good care of their ICs. So it is

not    a   blunderbuss   approach.    Indeed,   before    its

implementation  in  July 1998, there was  a  public  campaign

advising Singaporeans of the situation which was bad at  that

time and in fact giving prior warning to Singaporeans that if

the  situation  did not improve, tougher penalties  would  be

imposed.  Before the fees were implemented in July 1998,  the

number  of lost ICs was not only high, but was on an uptrend.

The monthly average of about 3,300 cards lost in 1997 rose to

about  4,000 in the first half of 1998.  The number has since

dropped  to 2,600 monthly for the whole of 1999, which  means

that with the deterrent regime people have been reminded that

it is important to take good care of their ICs.  This figure,

although lower, is still a serious problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure Mr Chiam that SIR, like I have said

just  now,  does not take a blunderbuss approach  because  it

does  exercise discretion in waiving the deterrent  component

of  the replacement fee carefully on the merits of each case.

For  example, SIR waives the penalty where the IC  holder  is

not at fault, such as in the case of break-ins, robberies, or

losses  due to fire.  Indeed, between July 1998 and  February

2000,  SIR waived the penalty for about 7,000 cases.   Hence,

these  IC  holders only have to pay the recurrent replacement

fee of $60 which incidentally is just above the cost of a new

IC  which is about $50.  So the Government is not levying the

fee to make money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onus is on the IC holders to explain the

circumstances in which the loss occurred.  In cases where the

circumstances of the loss were dubious, for example,  persons

are  unable to recollect how the IC was lost, the request for

waiver of the penalty fees will not be acceded to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Chiam  referred to a writer in the Straits  Times'  Forum

last  year  and I believe there were also one  or  two  other

writers.   Let me tell him that, following further interviews

and  clarifications given by the IC holders in  those  cases,

SIR gave them the benefit of the doubt and waived the penalty

fees for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point is that Mr Chiam compares the

approach  taken  by banks to SIR.  Banks do not  charge  very

high  administration fee for an ATM card.  Is he  serious  in

comparing an ATM card with an IC?  If one loses an ATM  card,

perhaps  at  most, he loses his money in the  bank.   If  one

loses  an  IC and if enough Singaporeans lose their  ICs,  it

will  impact  on Singaporean's sense of safety  and  security

because you may have people who get hold of these ICs and, in

fact,  there are syndicates who do that, and they  will  fall

into  wrong  hands.   That is why I think  we  must  be  very

careful with them.

Industry.  Mr Leong Horn Kee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, actually there are two key imperatives in the

economic  development  of modern day Singapore.   One  is  to

ensure  that  we devote sufficient resources  and  effort  to

build Singapore into an advanced knowledge-based economy that

can compete with the rest of the world.  The second

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



imperative is to mould and build our local people  and  local

capabilities that could measure up against the  best  in  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, within the framework of Singapore, we are

actually  faced with many constraints.  First, we are  small.

Second,  we  have  no resources and, third, we  have  limited

manpower.  But remarkably, despite these handicaps,  we  have

managed  to  work  together  as a nation  that  has  achieved

phenomenal  stability and growth in the last  30  years,  and

ranked as one of the most competitive countries in the world.

No mean achievement for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to discuss in big broad strokes some of

the  major issues and actions that the Ministry of Trade  and

Industry  has  to  address as the key  national  agency  that

oversees  economic development of Singapore.  Given our  well

known constraint, this is not an enviable task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on cost competitiveness, because of our shortage of

land and manpower, our cost of doing business continues to be

high  and  not competitive versus the neighbouring countries.

The  Government  has been vigilant over business  costs.   We

cannot artificially suppress business costs, but we should at

least  ensure that such costs do not escalate, or unnecessary

costs  or  time  be  wasted  due to  bureaucratic  rules  and

regulations.   Many of my fellow GPC colleagues have  touched

on this point.  Some, such as Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua,  have  conjured  the vision of an entrepreneurial  civil

service.   I  support their vision, but I despair  that  this

vision  will  only  remain as a hope  unless  there  is  more

urgency  in  the declared plan on infusion of entrepreneurial

blood  in  the  top  ranks  of  the  civil  service  and  the

leadership, and a major paradigm shift in the mindset of  our

civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, maximising the use of our resources. We have to

maximise the use of our limited resources.  The land  use  in

Singapore  can be intensified by allowing higher plot  ratios

for  land  development and more flexibility in the change  of

use

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



and the type of use of our land.  For example, Sentosa Island

is one of our main tourist attractions, and the playground of

the  residents living in the main city.  Hence, I  feel  that

Sentosa  Island should have been more intensively  developed,

and  the infrastructure should be improved.  More attractions

can be added.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also do a review of our electricity, gas and

water  supply and the usage policy so as to ensure that these

precious  resources  are efficiently  produced  and  used  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, maximising the use of our limited manpower. As

it  is  now,  we  have to bring in large numbers  of  foreign

professionals  and  workers  to supplement  our  local  pool.

Hence, we have to create an environment where both local  and

foreign  manpower can give their best.  By this,  I  mean  we

have to actively promote technopreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from my professional occupation as a director of

a  local firm that is interested in e-commerce investments, I

have  recently met with and come across many local firms  and

young  persons who want to start up new businesses.   Sir,  I

can  feel  in them a strong sense of purpose and  urgency  in

them  wanting to venture out and start up companies based  on

their  ideas  and  dreams.  The Government  has  started  the

Technopreneurship  21  programme.   I  fully   support   this

programme.   In fact, I would like to urge the Government  to

do more, such as providing more funds, support facilities and

create a conducive environment for enterprise, and for  those

daring to dream and daring to venture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall elaborate on each of the above ideas in

more detail as I speak on each of the subjects later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support

efforts  to promote our external economic wing by encouraging

companies   and   Singaporeans  to  invest   overseas.    All

Singaporeans are representatives of our country when we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



are abroad.  We are all ambassadors of Singapore.  Therefore,

how Singapore companies manage and how Singapore managers and

workers   conduct  themselves  will  affect  the   impression

ordinary  people of the host country will have of  Singapore.

It  is  therefore  in  our national interest  for  people  in

countries  receiving  our  investments  to  have  a  positive

impression   of   Singapore.   To  cultivate  this   positive

impression,  we  need to look beyond sheer  profits  for  our

companies.  Local people who work in Singapore companies  and

with Singapore managers are in the best position to act as  a

conduit for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many examples of countries with poor record.

The  United States has a terrible record of human  rights  in

Latin America which is still being repaired.  There are  also

records  of  some East Asian countries with  poor  record  of

human  and  labour relations in some of the South East  Asian

countries.   Therefore,  Singapore  companies  and  Singapore

managers  will  have to realise that it is not  just  profits

that   make   for  successful  business.   Beyond  maximising

shareholder value and pursuing economic efficiency, companies

will  need the human face and human values, ie, the  need  to

sustain families, treat men and women equally, look after the

environment,  to  respect natural justice,  to  give  workers

dignity  at  the workplace, respect the rights of workers  to

form trade unions and to conduct collective bargaining and to

comply with the laws of the land of the host country, and the

list can go on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this context, Sir, I like to ask the

Minister  that  while encouraging investments  overseas,  his

Ministry   should   also  advise  Singapore   companies   and

Singaporeans  to be aware of social issues and  sensitivities

like  labour  rights, human rights and environmental  issues.

This  is  especially needed when operating in countries  with

repressive  regimes  in  power.  It  is  better  that  we  be

proactive  in  this area before someone does  something  that

damages Singapore's good name.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, allow me to begin my cut with an

illustration.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



was   once  a  contract  manufacturer  which  began  a   very

successful operation in Singapore.  It was able to  meet  the

needs  of  a huge multinational electronics corporation  that

had   decided   to   outsource  some  of  its   manufacturing

activities.  As time grew, more MNCs became its customers and

in  Singapore, capacity was gradually added.  Every employee,

including the non-production worker, could see and  feel  the

pace  of growth.  Because the company's track record  was  so

good, when its biggest client decided to produce in China, it

was  invited  to  set up supporting manufacturing  facilities

there.  Growth there was soon exponential, well in excess  of

that in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the Singaporean employees were focusing only on

the  hive of activity at their own plant, they would not have

shared the excitement of growth in China.  Likewise, if there

was  a  structural  change  which led  to  the  MNCs  ceasing

production  in  China, they also would  be  none  the  wiser.

However,  if  they  had  had a total picture  of  the  entire

network of operations, they would be better informed of their

company's  plight through thick or thin.  Sir,  I  hope  this

illustration  will  convey the need  to  plug  the  following

information  gaps  in  the  measurement  and  assessment   of

economic activity for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to enable Singaporeans to embrace the global

nature of our economic being, we should also highlight  Gross

National  Product  (GNP),  or  its  equivalent,  instead   of

stopping  at  Gross  Domestic Product (GDP).   This  gives  a

broader  reflection  of our reach outside  of  Singapore.   A

quick  look at the 1999 Economic Survey shows some  differing

trends,  granted that comparison only in current price  terms

is available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even though services, including financial

services,  constitute a substantial pillar  of  our  economy,

measures  are  few, perhaps inherently so.   Nonetheless,  as

services are crucial to us, I would like to urge the Minister

to continue seeking out appropriate measures and indicators.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



Trade statistics abound and are available on a monthly basis,

but  they  do not form a complete picture.  Hence,  they  may

overstate the deterioration in the economy, as was  the  case

for some months in 1998.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, business cycles have shortened through the

judicious application of technology. Therefore, frequency and

timeliness   of  economic  statistics  are  key  to   helping

companies  and individuals project ahead.  Can  the  Minister

explore how far this can be done?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, first I would like to declare

that  I  am  a  Director  of a company involved  in  property

development.   We  have to maximise the use  of  our  limited

land.   I  like to propose the following suggestions  on  how

land can be used more intensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to allow the use of higher plot ratios for land

development.  Compared to the major cities around  the  world

like  Tokyo,  Hong  Kong  and New  York,  Singapore  is  less

developed  in  terms  of land use.  In  these  cities,  their

buildings are definitely higher and land development is being

used more intensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to allow more flexibility in the usage and

change of use of existing buildings and built-up areas.  Some

buildings or areas were constructed for an original  approved

usage.  However, over time, the demand or the nature  of  the

location  changes. Hence, there may well be a need to  change

the  usage  to  another type so as to match  the  surrounding

developments. For example, a building may originally be built

as  an  industrial building.  But as it turns out,  there  is

more  demand  in  the  locality for use of  the  premises  as

showrooms,  offices or even as residences. The owners  should

therefore  be  allowed  more flexibility  in  the  usage  and

conversion.  Otherwise, the building will remain  vacant  and

unused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the possibility of co-location and mixed use of

different types of premises will enable more intensive use of

a building.  Subletting and renewal of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



leases  will enable the existing premises to be better  used,

or re-developed for other purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce Singapore, I feel that within

certain broad rules and guidelines, it is very critical  that

land use be more flexible and intensified.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, we are familiar about the

current  interest and the type of industries we want for  our

economy  to  grow  and we have focused a  lot  on  the  info-communications     area,     electronics,     semi-conductor,

pharmaceutical  and chemical industries and  I  believe  that

some  of  us will start planning about the type of industries

we want 20 to 30 years from now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister as to what, in his

opinion, we should be focusing on in the longer term. Are  we

doing  enough in promoting life sciences, bio-technology  and

genetic engineering in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to my next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Many Members have expressed their

concern  that  by  rolling back some of the cost  containment

measures,  it  may  affect the cost  competitiveness  of  our

manufacturing sector and businesses in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a few of these issues. First

of all, I am concerned that the JTC rentals of factories will

go  up as a result of the property tax rebate reduction  from

55%  to  25%.   Similarly, the rental rebates implemented  in

1998  will eventually be removed, bringing land cost back  to

pre-crisis  levels.   If this happens,  we  will  once  again

become   uncompetitive  as  compared  to   our   neighbouring

countries where permanent reductions in prices have occurred.

I  therefore feel that through land intensification measures,

we  can  keep  our future land and rental costs low  and  any

future  increases  will  continue to be  benchmarked  against

world  prices so that we remain relevant in these industries.

Mr Leong has given some excellent

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



examples of how we can keep land cost low in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we should watch out against any drastic

increases  in  Government fees and charges in  the  next  few

years.  These too should be benchmarked against global prices

before increasing any of these in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have been pre-occupied by cost issues in

most  of  the measures that we have implemented in  the  past

couple of years and I think we should now go beyond cost  and

focus  on value-added activities as the focus on how  we  can

become competitive in the future.  One possible concept is to

encourage  more  assetless companies who can outsource  their

make  functions to any part of the world, while  focusing  on

the  value creation activities with the limited resources  we

have here in Singapore.  This will require a different set of

incentive  schemes and I suggest the Ministry study  possible

options  to  encourage  the  growth  of  such  companies   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I have a concern that there will be increases

of utility charges as we go on.  In fact, electricity charges

have  already gone up by almost 20% recently while prices  of

water  will  be going up later this year as was announced  by

the Minister for Finance. While I understand that we need  to

price  water  realistically, I believe  that  the  Government

could  have  held  back  any increases  by  another  year  to

minimise any increases during this transition year and  which

we  can continue increasing as we go along in the future.  On

the  issue of the cost of electricity, I feel that the  power

generation and distribution infrastructures in Singapore  are

not  operating efficiently enough.  In fact, I  believe  that

the  cost  is  about  two to three times  more  expensive  in

Singapore  as  compared to the United States  of  America.  I

strongly  feel  that  we  need to  completely  privatise  the

current  power  generation and distribution services  and  to

open up these to true foreign competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, still on the issue of power, there have been

too many instances of power

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



dips, causing serious disruptions to our high-tech industries

like  wafer  fabs and also some semi-conductor  manufacturing

facilities. These dips and disruptions cause money and I feel

that the company should not bear the full burden of this cost

and that the power distribution company should also be liable

for part of the cost incurred by the affected companies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the projection of

the  World Bank and the Asian Development Bank made  in  1997

for  environmental infrastructural projects  such  as  water,

sewerage, power and waste management in South East Asia alone

was about US$20-US$30 billion annually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the countries in this part of the world become more

affluent,  demand for such environmental related  businesses,

together  with  non-infrastructural products  and  processes,

will,  in  fact,  be  much larger.  And if  we  consider  the

countries  of  China  and India and  South  Korea,  if  these

countries  are included, the size of the potential market  in

such  businesses  in this region could be as  high  as  about

US$50-US$60 billion annually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a small country and we are constantly

on  the  lookout for suitable business and industrial  niches

and,  therefore, I think Singapore, being right in the middle

of  Asia,  cannot ignore this potential niche. We  have  been

successful  in  niches  such  as  finance,  electronics   and

specialty    chemicals.    We   are   now    promoting    IT,

telecommunications and the life sciences.  Surely, given  the

potential of the environment-related industry, we should also

promote this particular sector to be located in Singapore.  I

hope that the Ministry sees such a potential and gets EDB  to

have  a  serious look at these businesses.  I also hope  that

the  Minister,  when  he  asks EDB, will  also  consider  the

following  initiatives  to  help Singapore  develop  into  an

environment industrial park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there should be schemes to support and

encourage environmental

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



technopreneurs  to start up new companies  similar  to  those

given to IT entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an Exim-type of financing facilities to be

made  available to support projects in emerging economies  in

the  region.   In  this particular business,  such  financial

assistance  is quite common. In fact, one of the reasons  why

the  South  Korean  companies  and  the  Japanese  companies,

amongst  the  Asian  countries, are very successful  in  this

business  is  because of the Exim-type of loans  provided  by

their  respective countries or by institutions  supported  by

the Government.  This will certainly help Singapore companies

to  compete  with  companies like  the  Japanese  and  Korean

companies.  And, more importantly, it will put us on the same

footing as a lot of other western companies too and, in fact,

some  form  of  equal partnership can be formed  between  the

Singapore companies and the foreign companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, financial incentives for Singaporeans and

companies  in  Singapore should be  given  for  them  to  use

environment  positive products and processes.  This  type  of

financing  incentive  will certainly  encourage  the  greater

usage  of  environment  positive products  and  processes  in

Singapore   leading,  I  believe,  to  a  very  much   better

environment here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to share my

thoughts  on  how we can participate in the Internet  economy

and  what all of us, both the public and private sectors, can

do   in  order  to  compete  successfully  in  this  economy,

especially in the area of e-commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the barriers to entry in the e-commerce

arena  are  typically very low and we will  see  many  almost

similar businesses sprouting all around the world as compared

to  those  that  we  start here in Singapore.  One  important

lesson  to  learn  is that while we may  have  thought  of  a

seemingly unique idea and business model, there are many more

smart  people around the world who have probably also thought

of it at about the same time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



Therefore, the first mover advantage is going to be  the  key

and  the first mover is the one who introduces the idea first

to  the marketplace. Having become the first mover, speed and

constant  innovation and improvement will help  us  keep  the

lead and I will not belabour on the Internet speed again.  It

is crucial in this area if you want to be successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for our companies to be successful, they will

need very good and cheap infrastructure which, in my opinion,

is  still  an  issue  in Singapore.  Some Members,  in  their

earlier  speeches during the MCIT debate, have  compared  the

cost  of  using broadband network here with those around  the

world.  We  are  still  not competitive  and  while  for  big

businesses,  the cost may not be a major issue, for  many  of

our start-up companies, the cost is still very painful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, my concern is that in our eagerness to promote

the  information  communications  industry,  many  investors,

including the National Science and Technology Board,  may  be

disbursing  funds  a bit too liberally.   In  fact,  we  have

already  used about half a billion dollars of the $1  billion

fund  in  these  last six months.  While I am not  advocating

that we should slow things down, I do, however, feel that  we

need  to  inject some realism as to what the Internet economy

is  all  about. At the end of the day, a business is still  a

business, and a sound model and strategy are still needed  in

order  to  compete effectively globally. So I hope  that  our

young  and  aspiring  technopreneurs  will  look  beyond  the

initial  hype and the short-term possibilities and  focus  on

building  sustainable  businesses for  the  long  term.   The

typical terms used in the Internet economy are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The "burn rate" which refers to the rate at which

you spend the money in sustaining the business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The "last man spending" which refers to when the

money  eventually runs out at the rate at which it  is  being

burnt.  The last company that remains in business is the  one

that is going to be the winner.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are very interesting terms but every entrepreneur

should  treat his every cent as his or her own and he  should

not  develop the attitude that someone else's money is  being

burnt,  and  this  is the danger of liberal  availability  of

funds in trying to promote such an Internet economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to be successful, we need to focus on building

businesses  that  have good or unique technology  content  or

unique   technology  applications  or  those  who  make   our

traditional  brick and mortar businesses more efficient  with

the use of information technology.  I therefore urge both the

private  and public sectors to focus in these areas  if  they

really want to be successful and, in the long term, when  the

bubble  bursts and the hype goes away, only the fundamentally

strong companies are the ones that will be left standing.  So

there  are  portals that we see developing which will  be  in

danger  if  they do not build fundamentally strong ideas  and

strategies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, one useful role I believe that the National

Science  and  Technology  Board  can  play  is  to  regularly

organise  lessons, sharing seminars or gatherings,  where  we

can  invite  both  the  local and foreign  technopreneurs  to

impart  their experiences, both good and bad, so that we  can

avoid  making the same mistakes others have made in the past.

Up  to now, we have been painting too rosy a picture and have

highlighted  mainly  the successful companies  and  very  few

failures have been highlighted. We should, in fact, celebrate

both  failures  and  successful companies,  especially  those

failures who eventually made it again after they have  failed

the first time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no choice but to participate in this new

economy and, in doing so, we should be well-prepared and play

with the desire to win big.  We therefore must ensure that we

build a conducive environment for this to happen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, whether we like

it  or  not,  employment of e-commerce as a  means  of  doing

business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



in the Internet economy is increasing with each passing day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a global player, Singapore has no choice but to

embrace  its  widespread use.  I am happy to  note  that  the

acceleration of the e-commerce usage has been identified as a

key  strategy under one of the three pronged approach to  SME

development  in  the  recent  SME  21  launch.   While  I  am

encouraged   that   the  Minister  for   Communications   and

Information  Technology has spoken in this House about  swift

liberalisation of the telecommunications industry and  keener

competition  which  will benefit consumers,  I  am  concerned

about  the  preparedness of businesses to face this  dramatic

change expected in the near future.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several of my MP colleagues yesterday, and Mr

Inderjit  Singh a moment ago, also spoke at length about  the

rapidly  increasing e-commerce trends and the urgent need  to

educate  and reach out to various constituent groups of  this

impending change.  My primary concern is the urgent  need  to

get  Singapore SMEs to exploit e-commerce to enable  them  to

effectively compete in the global marketplace.   We  need  to

quickly  plug  them on to existing B-to-B and B-to-C  portals

and,  wherever necessary, facilitate the development of  more

portals for various sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to propose that e-commerce

development  initiatives  undertaken  by  SMEs  are  strongly

supported  by  the  Government,  and  that  such  support  be

incorporated in current Government assistance schemes such as

VTAS and LEFS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to facilitate speedy development and

implementation, several Government agencies such as the  IDA,

EDB,  PSB,  NSTB, etc, should be identified to play catalytic

and  lead roles in strategic e-commerce development projects,

such  as  the  grooming of selected promising  SMEs  and  the

promotion of adoption of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



locally available portals.  Their roles and activities should

be  coordinated to ensure efficient deployment  of  resources

and no duplication of efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, recognising that only 4-5% of our local SMEs

currently  adopt e-commerce, we should get more  SMEs  to  e-invent  themselves, and also set a target  for  a  reasonable

number  of  SMEs  to  be using e-commerce in  their  business

activities  by a certain  period, say, about five years  from

now.   The  goal should be not only for our business entities

to  use e-commerce as a tool, but also to get them to embrace

e-commerce as an integral part of their business strategy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, under the Technopreneurship 21

Plan,  the  Government has allocated US$1 billion to  promote

technopreneurship.  Recently, Deputy Prime Minister  Dr  Tony

Tan  announced that over half of this sum has been  committed

for  start-up companies and venture funds which promote  such

technopreneurship development in Singapore.  Dr Tan announced

that this investment fund will be fully invested by June, and

the Government is considering launching a second fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the funding support from the Government

and  the  drive  towards technopreneurship is being  felt  in

Singapore.  As I have said earlier in my speech, in my recent

meetings  with  young founders and managers of several  local

start-up  companies, I can discern a strong sense of purpose,

drive   and  direction  amongst  them.   There  is  a  strong

emergence  of  heightened energy level  amongst  these  young

people  who  ventured  to found new  start-up  companies.   I

strongly  feel that we should continue to harness and  propel

this  growing  energy by providing more funds,  more  support

facilities   such  as  incubation  centres  and  creating   a

conducive  environment  where our  local  technopreneurs  can

flourish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue with this Technopreneurship 21 drive, I

would  like  to  suggest that the Government should  allocate

more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



money,  say,  another  US$500 million or  even  a  full  US$1

billion  towards  the  new Technopreneurship  programme.   In

addition,  instead  of  channelling  the  new  funds  to  the

existing   two  agencies,  ie,  the  National   Science   and

Technology  Board  (NSTB) and the GIC, to  allocate  out  the

funds,  I  would like to suggest that some part  of  the  new

funds  be  assigned  to  a third agency  which  has  a  large

proportion  of  private-sector trained executives  to  be  in

charge.   The two existing agencies, NSTB and GIC, have  done

an  excellent job.  The idea of a third body to  have  a  new

high  number of private sector staff agency, maybe a new one,

would serve as a third body to provide more avenues for start-up companies and technopreneurs to seek funding support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget debate, I also proposed that

pioneer  status, ie, five years' tax free status, be accorded

to start-up companies.  These companies are pioneers in their

own field such as info-com and biotechnology, and they should

be  encouraged.   They  will form a new  wave  of  pioneering

changes in upgrading the industrial development of Singapore.

Sir,  I am particularly keen on this idea of a pioneer status

for  high-tech  start-up  companies,  not  so  much  for  the

incentive  as not many of them will make money in  the  first

five years to enjoy this tax benefit, but for the recognition

that  we  give  to  them,  and  in  the  process  create   an

environment  whereby more high-tech companies are  encouraged

to  be  formed,  just like in the early days  of  Singapore's

industrial  development, pioneer companies  were  given  this

special status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the proposed additional fund and a

third  agency  to  channel through  the  funds  and  awarding

pioneer status to selective start-up companies will serve  to

give another boost to Singapore's technopreneurship plan.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, as part of giving the promotion

of  technopreneurship a shot in the arm,  the  Government  is

establishing  a Science Hub.  For the Science  Hub  to  fully

realise  our objectives, the least of which is to  provide  a

conducive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



and  vibrant  environment  for the  nurturing  of  knowledge-intensive capabilities, I would like to ask the Minister what

economic model would be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially interested in how the Government will

drive this effort as there are multi-faceted needs to be met,

such  as nurturing, social and leisure requirements,  if  one

were to use the Silicon Valley as a model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to ask the Minister to

indicate what the concentrations are likely to be.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Technopreneurship 21

Committee launched by the Government is one excellent example

of  how the Government and the private sector can play  their

part    in    trying   to   promote   entrepreneurship    and

technopreneurship  in Singapore.  Today,  in  the  knowledge-based  economy (KBE), Singapore, more than at any time before

in its history, has a best chance to compete with the world's

best countries on a level playing field.  We have no lack  of

ideas and talent but we need a more conducive environment and

motivation  factors that can be created  by both  the  public

and  the private sectors.  While I am not advocating too much

of  Government  interference, I do feel that  in  making  the

transition from a paternalistic approach of governance to one

of an entrepreneurial governance, the Government can become a

catalyst and a facilitator, and once we have taken off,  they

should take a few steps back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Science and Technology Board's role needs

to  be  one  of  a facilitator and incubator, and  perhaps  a

funding  agency  to  do  well in promoting  entrepreneurship,

rather  than being the main driving force.  The NSTB,  to  do

this  role  effectively, will need to hire as  many  industry

experienced  people as possible, so that it can be  effective

in executing its role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the governance with a lighter touch will help

us create a more conducive environment.  I have heard of many

cases of restrictive Government practices

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



like  the  sub-letting of JTC and HDB premises, the  Building

and   Control  Authority's  and  the  Fire  Safety   Bureau's

stringent   requirements  and  restrictions  make   it   very

difficult for setting up such offices, especially for a small

group  of  entrepreneurs who need to spend more time focusing

on  the real value added activities.  But sometimes they  get

distracted  in  trying to fulfill the  requirements  of  such

agencies, and this is really a waste of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the proposed Science Hub at Buona Vista is an

excellent   start  of  how  we  can  create  this   conducive

environment.  And I suggest that in this Hub, we should allow

some  amount of untidiness, some chaos and practise  as  much

flexibility  as  possible,  as compared  to  what  we  cannot

practise out in Singapore, in general.  We should try to,  as

much  as  possible,  duplicate the  Silicon  Valley  type  of

environment in this area.  In fact, once we have learned from

the  Buona Vista Science Hub, I think we can afford  to  make

the  whole  of Singapore a science hub where we can  practise

all  of  the  things that we have learned from  Buona  Vista.

This is one way that we can become the Silicon Valley of  the

East.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to support the Industry 21 programme which the

Economic  Development Board announced last  year,  I  suggest

that  we  set  up permanent industry groupings.   Instead  of

relying on ad hoc groups, I believe that if we have permanent

industry groupings, this should allow us to focus a lot  more

on  the  various sectors that we want to promote.   I suggest

that  these  permanent  groupings be funded  jointly  by  the

Government  and  the  private sector,  and  through  this,  I

believe  a  more  focused approach will help  us  succeed  in

achieving the Industry 21 programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, to promote more cottage industries, I suggest

that  we  liberalise  the  use of HDB  shophouses  for  info-communications type of companies.  This can be  an  extension

of the home-office scheme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



that  we have implemented recently.  In my opinion, this will

make our housing estates more vibrant, allow entrepreneurs to

have  their  offices  near their homes, and  also  become  an

integral  part of the community where they work.   I  believe

this  will  also help alleviate the problem of excess  retail

space that we are facing in our housing estates today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, to bring in more talent has always been a big

issue  for  Singapore.   I  would like  to  ask  whether  the

Government  is  willing  to consider setting  up  centres  of

excellence  in  a  few  countries,  like  in  India,   China,

Philippines,  Thailand, the USA and  a  few  other  countries

around the world, where some of our activities, whether it is

private sector or Government activities, can be outsourced to

these areas.  And these are the areas where we can groom  and

identify  talent who could in turn flow back into  Singapore.

We  will  have a better chance of attracting the best  talent

this way and, at the same time, have access to as much and to

a bigger pool of people as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, we need to strengthen the generation,

maintenance  and  the  use  of  intellectual  property  as  a

competitive tool in promoting our high-technology industries.

Currently,  I believe that we do not have enough intellectual

property lawyers nor a strong infrastructure to support  this

important  area.   And I think we need  to  spend  some  time

developing this if we are very serious about starting up many

more technology companies in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, in recent years, big has

become  beautiful.  The bigger, the better to participate  in

the  global economy.  Hence, there seems to be a race to make

the next merger bigger than the last.  Very quickly, the mega-merger  of  AOL and Time Warner was eclipsed by the Vodafone-Mannesman mega-merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the merger of the two banking giants of

DBS  and  POSB  became history with the  merger  of  SIA  and

Virgin,  a  merger  of sorts.  And then there  was  the  near

merger of SingTel and C&W HKT.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



Even  so, our mammoth SingTel is actually only 26th  in  size

compared  to  the  telco giants currently existing,  and  the

merger  would have them up only by a few notches if they  had

been successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global monopolies and cartels wield much power. Witness

the  De  Beers monopoly of diamonds and the OPEC oil  cartel,

which is still a force to reckon with.  Local monopolies  are

treated  differently in different countries, of  course.   In

the  OECD  countries, monopolies are theoretically prohibited

by  anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws.  The philosophy behind

these  laws date back to the 1930s, when big was regarded  as

bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monopolies and cartels are bad for the consumer, because

of  their  power to control prices and manipulate markets  to

the  great inconvenience and disadvantage of the consumer and

smaller  businesses.   This is particularly  so  in  consumer

products  and  services which for the most part  function  in

imperfect  and  captive  markets.  Hence,  the  Internet  and

global  competition will ensure that the power  of  localised

monopolies  is  reduced or nullified.  This  is  because  the

Internet  allows  the consumer to buy not just  from  MPH  or

Times   Bookshop,   but  also  from  BarnesandNoble.com   and

Amazon.com.  It allows the consumer to get information  about

prices,  quality  and availability of products  and  services

more readily and thus makes for a more perfect market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this brave new world, it becomes increasingly

difficult to enforce or to justify laws regulating monopolies

and   cartels.    Even   countries  with  supposedly   strict

competition  laws  close an eye to the realities  which  have

resulted  in the mega-mergers I have mentioned and  to  those

like  DaimlerChrysler, PriceWaterhouseCoopers  and  the  Citi

Group.    In   this   light,   it   will   be   fundamentally

anachronistic,  it  would seem,  to ask for  laws  protecting

consumers from monopolies and cartels.  But I shall try.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make a case, Sir, for limited regulation in

situations where the market is effectively closed; the market

for petrol

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore, for example, or the market for household goods

and  consumer equipment.  Then there are the public transport

and  public  utility  sectors.  In these  situations,  market

dominance is still possible because the consumer has no  real

choice when it comes to alternatives.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy, of course, that in public transport and

utilities, the monopolies, duopolies and cartels are  closely

monitored by the regulators - who indeed are also looking  to

create  competition wherever they can.  Witness the  telecoms

and  the  power supply industries, and the beginning of  free

competition in public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deregulating and liberalising previously closed sectors

is not good enough, Sir.  Closed markets cause our businesses

to  be  complacent and cumbersomely inefficient, stifle their

growth  and  hamper their ability to survive  in  the  global

economy.   Look at our banking industry and legal profession,

for example.  Hence the beginnings of change there also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to urge the Ministry to look into monopolistic

conduct  and  business practices and make these illegal.   We

may  not break up our relatively small companies in the  name

of  competition  but  we certainly can discourage  them  from

unconscionable  conduct.  Much  of  this  market   unfriendly

conduct  may  even  look innocuous.  A  market  leader  could

resort  to  predatory pricing to kill off  competitors,  deny

access  to smaller competitor on the pretext of its inability

to  pay on time; collect deposits from customers on all sorts

of pretexts and not return the money promptly or at all; clog

up competitors' distribution channels with massive numbers of

small purchases; set so-called recommended retail prices with

severe  contractual penalties for breach of  that  price;  or

quietly collude with other service or goods providers  in  an

unwritten pact, therefore no evidence, which obliges them  to

maintain  the  same price levels whatever the  true  economic

costs of doing business.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not hypothetical situations. They have

actually all happened in recent months and even for years  on

end   -   in   the   telecoms  industry,   petrol   stations,

supermarkets, car dealers, the list goes on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when are we going to stop closing an eye to such

inequity?   These situations can be nipped in the bud  if  we

had  a Fair Trading Act.  CASE will be submitting a paper  to

the  Ministry on such an Act after our visit to Australia and

New  Zealand  in  May.  We will bring a  team  of  consumers,

businessmen   and  officials  to  observe  the   impact   and

effectiveness of such a law and make recommendations  on  our

return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give the paper careful

consideration when it is submitted.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, much has been said already in

this  House about the role of Government-linked companies  or

GLCs  in  driving economic growth in Singapore.   Also,  many

Members,  including myself, have exhorted the  Government  to

constantly  review and identify candidates for  privatisation

where private sector pressures would make sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst privatisation may provide the best models in many

cases,  GLCs  who prove their worth can continue  to  justify

their existence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, GLCs may well be a good intermediate step or

model  for  certain Government-run operations.  Specifically,

the  Government  should review the extent to which  sea  port

services  should  be deregulated and whether  certain  ports,

such  as  Jurong  Port which supports the  Jurong  industrial

estate,  should be corporatised or even privatised.  I  would

like  to  ask  the Minister to comment on the feasibility  of

such a transition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, competition and the free market

represent  an  important  ideological  underpinning  of   our

society.  It is a trite statement to say that competition

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



allows  for greater variety and therefore freedom  of  choice

for  the consumers in the market place.  Without competition,

a wide array of goods and services  available to the consumer

would  not  have  been  possible.   Until  recently,  we  are

confronted  with an alternative choice to the free  market  - the  command  economy.  We have seen that  command  economies

produce excesses that result in great inefficiencies  in  the

market place.  Someone once joked that the East Germans under

the communist regime, could only choose between a red Trabant

or  a  white  Trabant,  a  three piston  car  with  polluting

exhausts.  I will not be surprised if that were true.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, Sir, free competition without regulation also

produces  excesses. Starting from the premise  that  not  all

firms are of equal ability, extreme competition would feed on

the  predatory instincts of businesses seeking to survive  in

the  market  place.  Just as in the natural world,  only  the

strongest  will survive and the weaker ones will perish  into

oblivion.  What happens is perhaps a growing dominance of the

market  place by a few major producers of goods and services.

In  the  hands  of these few major producers or  even  single

producer  of  goods and services, the consumer is  left  very

much at their mercy because of their extensive power over the

price which they charge for their goods and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is for this reason that many countries in the

West have passed laws that regulate against the formation  of

monopolies  or cartels and anti-competitive practices.   Such

entities are, by its tendency, an antithesis to this idea  of

freedom of choice for the consumer.  The Americans understood

the  benefits  of the market early and have  since  the  19th

century  enacted such legislation as the Sherman Act and  the

Clayton  Act and other legislation.  Many European countries,

including Australia, have also adopted similar legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore becomes a mature economy, it is perhaps

timely that the Government should look to comprehensive anti-trust laws to check against

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



the  excesses  of firms that dominate the market  place.  The

advantage  of these policies is obvious.  Recently,  we  have

seen  that  as  a  result of competition, overseas  telephone

charges began to fall dramatically.  As another example, when

StarHub introduced free Internet services in a bid to attract

subscribers.    Almost  overnight,  another  rival   Internet

service provider responded by offering free services as well.

The  move  by  the  ISP  to  save customer  accounts  is  not

surprising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, it is not seen by many as a sincere move on its

part to provide best service for its customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the IDA plays the role of

regulator  in checking, amongst other things, the competition

among  telecommunication  companies.  However,  there  is  no

watchdog body like IDA with respect to the other parts of the

industry at the market place.  One question that I would like

to ask the Minister therefore is whether the Government would

seriously  consider introducing legislation  like  the  anti-trust  laws  which  are applicable in the United  States  and

elsewhere.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the support for small and

medium  enterprises (SMEs) has always been a topic  discussed

by  many  Members in this House.  The real issue is  that  we

have not been able to find the right formula to help our SMEs

effectively.   The  many  schemes  available  are  not  fully

benefitting  the smaller companies and we need to  relook  at

how   best   to   incentivise  such  companies.   While   the

Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) is working hard at it,

I believe there is a serious misalignment of the needs versus

the help available for such SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SME 21 is a good plan but, in my opinion, the

implementation is not going to be easy and we may end up with

just  incremental  changes but what we really  need  is  some

revolutionary  changes if we are serious about creating  many

more world class companies out of these SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, we need an EDB-style organisation which

is able to grant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



incentives  like pioneer status or other incentives  that  Mr

Ong  has talked about earlier on.  This agency should,  first

of  all,  have  a focused look at growing local  world  class

companies  while  EBD  should continue  to  focus  on  multi-national companies.  In my opinion, with the current set  up,

the EDB cannot effectively focus on both sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an organisation will also have the flexibility to

select, groom and help grow companies from the start-up stage

to  the  time they become world class companies  or  MNCs  in

their own right.  Such an approach where some agencies follow

the  life  cycles of a company will allow faster  action  and

support  to  the  specific needs of such companies.   Because

such agencies will know the needs of such company well having

followed them throughout their life cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in my opinion, the selection criterion for

promising local enterprises is outdated.  The question I have

for  the  Minister is, how many of these PLEs  have,  in  the

past, actually made it as world class companies and in return

how  many  of  the  world class companies that  come  out  of

Singapore  were  identified as PLEs  before.   I  suggest  we

induct  the private sector to help determine and choose  PLEs

for  these  Government agencies.  This is an example  of  the

outsourcing of Government of Singapore to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, we need the focus agencies to

nurture,  groom, grow, guide and launch local companies  into

the  global market place if we are serious about creating the

100  or  so  world-class companies that we talked about  last

year.    So  my  previous  suggestion  of  these  independent

organisations should be considered seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest we spin off the PSB or part of PSB into a

jointly  managed consortium managed by both the  private  and

public  sectors with complete independence of management  but

perhaps guided by a board consisting of people from both  the

public  and  private sectors to provide strategic  direction.

This can be jointly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>



funded  again by the public and private sectors and there  is

an organisation called the SEMATECH in the USA.  With such an

independent  body, the SME 21 will have a much better  chance

of  success  because of the direct private sector involvement

to allow faster decisions to be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that we devise some incentives to

encourage the merger and consolidation of our SMEs.  Many  of

them  may not be able to operate, given their small size  and

inefficiencies they may have.  The feedback that  I  have  is

that   current  regulations  in  Singapore  create  too  many

obstacles for companies to merge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, while many things have been said about the

practices of GLCs, I do however feel that the GLCs  can  play

an   important   role   if  they  are  privatised   and   run

independently.   GLCs could also partner our local  SMEs  for

global  projects as is being done by a number  of  countries,

for example, in the UK and Japan.

GLCs should therefore be given appropriate incentives to help

such  SMEs  to secure overseas business together  with  their

projects.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

share  a  lot  of  the views expressed by Mr  Inderjit  Singh

earlier.  I want to go into some practical points but, first,

in my view, SMEs today face very exciting challenges but very

frustrating problems also.  Exciting challenges in the  sense

that  never before have they been able to see lower  barriers

of  entry.  Technology and Internet allow them to open  their

market  and allow them to  make network and connections  with

many  people  in  the  world without  even  having  to  leave

Singapore.   But  what is very frustrating to  them  is  that

there is a great demand for intellectual capacity for them to

take  advantage just presented before them. That is for  many

reasons.  But  one of the reasons is that in Singapore,  when

you  start to compete with the best and the brightest in  the

world,  you are faced with great odds.  Because in  Singapore

the best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>



and the brightest join the Government.  Maybe the second-best

join  the  MNCs  and then you are left with a  very  deprived

intellectual pool in the SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to go into very high leading edge

practices, sometimes it is very difficult.  This is  where  I

feel  we  can  do a lot more to help them because  while  the

workers  can do many things, they can get new graduates  from

the  universities and polytechnics, it is the leaders of  the

companies  themselves that must keep up with  the  speed  and

changes in the economy.  I see the case of Hewlett Packard in

Singapore  and they have spawned many public-listed companies

like Omni Industries, Venture and NatSteel and so on, because

when they start to outsource business to these people they do

take  a  personal stake in these companies in the sense  that

they get their engineers and their planners to be involved in

the  entire outsourcing process.  So they are not  just  some

sub-contractors  but  they  are  themselves   investors   and

personally  involved in this.  They have spawned  world-class

companies like Venture, NatSteel in the world.  This is where

a  working model is available in Singapore.  So they can have

large  GLCs. They get business and give it to sub-contractors

and some MNCs complain, "I can do what the GLCs can do except

that  I do not have a name like GLC."  To overcome this, what

we could do is GLCs starting to take an interest and stake in

small companies, take it through mergers and acquisition.  In

this  way, you tap on the entrepreneurial skill but  you  can

also  help  translate leading edge technologies and practices

that are available to GLCs to these small companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that perhaps we can do is that at the

centres  where  there  is  a lot of leading  edge,  like  the

universities  and the polytechnics, we should encourage  more

of that to get out and work directly with some of these small

companies.  These small companies sometimes find it very hard

to  invest  in training.  They do not train as  well  as  the

MNCs.   But if you can tap on to the R&D of universities  and

polytechnics and get these academics to work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>



on  areas  other than business, in engineering  or  in  other

research work, we can avail these best practices to small and

medium  enterprises, otherwise they may not be able to afford

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think GLCs can also benefit because one of the things

that may be problematic in the future is that as GLCs try and

go  into the region, how they are perceived by people in  the

region may be problematic because they do not just see  their

commercial presence but they see the Singapore entity  behind

it  and  people are very nationalistic. They may not  welcome

some   GLCs.   If  you  could  collaborate,  bring  in   more

entrepreneurs  to be involved in some of these  projects,  we

can buffer some of the nationalistic sentiments that some  of

these  countries  may respond to when Singapore  Incorporated

tries  to  expand to the region. Certainly, I share  with  Mr

Inderjit Singh the other incentives that we need to offer  in

terms of taxation and incentives to provide training to these

companies.  I say again that training is not just  for  those

who  are  already at risk.  New technologies are  putting  at

risk  a  whole host of people who may not be aware that  they

are  at risk today, but certainly it will be too late by  the

time  companies  start to move out.  By  the  time  companies

start  to  move out, they find themselves completely  out  of

sync with the needs of the economy and technology.

<br>6.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think we need to really look far ahead and see who

are  the people - the receptionists, the tellers, the  little

managers  -  who  will  be  made  virtually  extinct  by  new

technologies.  How do we help them before they really  become

virtually  extinct  or  redundant?  This  is  where  I  think

further  collaboration and specific attention given to  SMEs,

understanding their weaknesses, can help.  GLCs  can  play  a

great part here to help SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister could give some attention and direct

some resources to help these SMEs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, the recent launch of SME 21

and its broad range of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



strategies and programmes appear poised to well position  our

SMEs  in  the  21st century.  In fact, the  SME  21  document

distributed  during  the launch is so well  regarded  that  I

understand  it  is  officially requested  by  many  countries

worldwide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I believe, while the ideas and strategies

have  been  well conceived, there was no reference  whosoever

being made to benchmarking or learning from the experience of

others.   I am not suggesting that this is not already  being

done,  but  I  am  sure  we  are  aware  of  the  merits   of

benchmarking  against  others, in this  case,  against  other

countries which are more experienced and are ahead of  us  in

promoting  SMEs.  In the United Kingdom, for  example,  where

there  are  more than 3.7 million enterprises, of which  only

7,000  are  large  establishments,  the  government  acts  as

catalyst    to   encourage   collaboration   for   corrective

competitiveness.  As a result, one in 10 SMEs is able to  set

aside 10% or more of their sales turnover on new products and

process development.  Australia is quite ahead in government-led  strategies  to tap the vast potential of  e-commerce  by

creating    a   dynamic   business   environment,   promoting

transactions  via  the Internet, and also conducting  regular

dialogues  with  the  business community to  discuss  on-line

business  issues.   Taiwan and Korea,  while  having  a  more

liberalised  business environment, implement  policies  which

are   designed  to  strengthen  the  quality  framework   and

technological competitiveness of their SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although some strategies adopted by these countries

may  be  unique  to  their local and specific  situations,  I

believe many are also generic and applicable as well  to  us.

I  would  therefore like to urge the Minister for  Trade  and

Industry  to  consider  putting  in  place  a  barometer   to

benchmark  ourselves against what some of  the  best  in  the

world are doing to promote SMEs.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, the SME 21 is a comprehensive

effort  to  develop  the  role and  contribution  of  smaller

companies to the growth of Singapore.  At the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



same  time,  it  also  addresses the issues  that  vulnerable

sectors,  such  as retail and construction,  are  facing  and

recommends   some  strategies  for  survival,  for   example,

consolidation  for  small operators to achieve  economies  of

scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, as my colleagues Mr Singh and Mr Magad have

observed,  we know that whilst a lot of effort has gone  into

formulating the blueprint, it is the follow-up, in  terms  of

rendering  actual assistance to target SMEs, that  will  make

the difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how the relevant

agencies can proactively help such vulnerable businesses.  In

particular,  will  their efforts extend to the  neighbourhood

shop   operators,   especially  those  who  are   non-English

speaking, or who may be unaware of the existence of  the  SME

21  altogether?   Sir, many neighbourhood operators may  have

been  running  chronic losses but still  feel  they  have  no

alternatives.   For  such  operators,  where   cessation   of

business  could well be the only solution, can placement  and

retraining assistance be extended as well?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, based on its

Desired  Outcomes, the Ministry of Trade and Industry appears

to  be  only interested in nurturing only the more successful

local  enterprises and forging a strong partnership with  the

MNCs.  If this is its main direction, how could we expect MTI

to  channel adequate resources to give priority attention  to

achieving  the aim of the SME 21, which is to  build  up  the

capability of the SMEs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs are indigenous to Singapore and are important

constituents  of  the Singapore economy.   The  SME  21  plan

launched  in  January has given due recognition to  this  and

wants  to  make a concerted effort to assist SMEs  keep  pace

with  the  rest  of  the economy as a critical  part  of  the

national plan to sustain Singapore's economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given its importance, I feel that this should have been

given and reflected

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Budget Statement or budget provision  for  MTI.   In

fact,  there  is not a single provision for the promotion  of

the  implementation of SME 21 in the Budget.  How  could  the

local  business community react positively to the  objectives

of  the SME 21 without a very clear and strong commitment  on

the part of MTI?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the lower-income group among the heartlanders in

HDB  estates,  who  have been assisted  to  move  on  to  the

mainstream  of life through substantial help and  support  by

both  the Government and the community, the SMEs who  can  be

classified  as  the  lower-income group  in  the  competitive

business  world,  would also require greater  care  and  help

before  they can be singled out as successful enterprises  in

their  own  right, and thereon to be nurtured as  world-class

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forging a strong partnership with MNCs, the

Government ought to guard against creating a misconception of

favouring  the  MNCs at the expense of our  indigenous  SMEs.

The  Government must find ways and means to encourage or  get

our  MNCs, as well as GLCs, to contribute their part  to  the

general well-being of the local business community, with  the

principal  objective  of creating a pro-business  environment

for all enterprises in Singapore, both big and small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MNCs and GLCs have ample resources with the

facilities,  direct access to information  or  even  relevant

authorities  for their business operation and expansion.   As

such,  they  do  not  feel the compelling  need  to  join  or

contribute to the local trade and industry associations.   On

the  other  hand, many of our trade and industry associations

exist  to  serve  the needs of SMEs.  And  with  the  limited

membership  dues collected, they find it extremely  difficult

to make a strong commitment of their limited resources to the

implementation of any national economic plans such as the SME

21,  or  even  to promote IT applications among the  SMEs  in

support of Singapore's IT plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation calls for Government funding as well as

more voluntary or even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



mandatory  contribution of resources from the MNCs and  GLCs,

and even our very successful local enterprises, to enable our

local  trade  and  industry associations to draw  up  various

schemes  and  programmes to effectively service the  business

community.   I  therefore  urge  the  Ministry  to  take  the

initiative,  together  with  the  major  trade  and  industry

associations,  to  draw up some concrete measures,  including

certain  financial and technical assistance schemes  for  the

SMEs  and  their  trade associations as a  big  step  towards

building a vibrant, resilient and cohesive business community

where  all enterprises, big and small, can contribute to  the

growth of the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not here. Mr Ahmad

Magad.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, much has been spoken in the

last several days and today about the importance of promoting

entrepreneurship  and technopreneurship as  one  of  the  key

activities  for  Singapore  to  focus  on.   We  need  a  new

generation of home-bred wealth and value creators  who  could

play  a meaningful role in continually improving the standard

of living of Singaporeans as we hop on the global stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awareness created and the many schemes we have put

in place have encouraged many younger Singaporeans to want to

jump  on the bandwagon.  However, as adrenalin begins to flow

and  ideas  begin to sparkle, many are discovering  to  their

dismay  that funds availability represents a major  stumbling

block to execute and market their ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we consider setting up an

agency  where  technopreneurs and high-tech  aspirants  could

readily  come  to  and  meet  with  venture  capitalists  and

interested  angel investors who, at the same time,  are  also

looking  for investment opportunities.  The agency's  primary

activity  is  to  marry ideas which could potentially  strike

big,  with funds to bring the ideas into reality.  I envision

an  agency,  Sir,  where the technopreneur aspirants  present

their ideas and business

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>



plans  to  interested investors where technopreneur marriages

are solemnised and hopefully live happily ever after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, Sir, I believe the availability of such an

agency would help to increase the momentum of entrepreneurial

activities.   To  widen  its  scope,  such  an  agency  could

simultaneously  act as a one-stop agency for SMEs  to  obtain

information  on  the  multitude  of  Government's  assistance

schemes and other forms of help available for both new start-ups and existing entrepreneurs to grow their business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, there is a perception that the

Government and the Economic Development Board are  no  longer

considering  trading  as an important  economic  activity  in

Singapore.   In fact, I have heard a number of  good  traders

who actually have left Singapore for trading cities like Hong

Kong  and  Dubai,  citing cost, support  and  also  financing

ability as reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, for us to promote the e-commerce industry

in the future, the trading community actually can play a very

important role to promote this concept of a click and  mortar

concept  where the traditional businesses are made  efficient

by  the  use of information technology to compete effectively

in  the  world  arena.  The traders probably,  having  traded

around the world, are the best people to promote this portion

of the growth that we want in the Internet economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, I also spoke about possibilities of

implementing  trade financing schemes, similar  to  the  LEFS

scheme  for  the  manufacturing sector.   After  speaking  in

Parliament  last year, I discussed some potential  approaches

with the Trade Development Board officers.  I think they have

come up with some possible plans. And I would like to ask the

Minister  whether he will consider implementing them  because

these plans will not incur too much of Government funds.  But

what  we need is for someone to get it started and, I  think,

if  it  has  started, the Government can  take  a  step  back

because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>



the  scheme  will run by itself - run by the private  sector,

the banks and the insurance agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I would like to talk about is trade

exhibitions  and  shows.  I believe since 1994,  the  subsidy

given  to  our  companies in attending shows and  exhibitions

overseas has been reduced drastically from about 70% down  to

about  35%.   I  would like to ask the Minister  to  consider

increasing this back again to around 55% and to fund some  of

the industry organisations, like the Chambers of Commerce, to

actually help such companies attend such trade shows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe the infrastructure costs in Singapore

still  need  to  be  addressed.  PSA charges  are  still  not

competitive compared to the best ports around the world, like

in  Rotterdam.  Telecommunication charges are still an issue.

If they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>



serious about promoting this industry, we should look at  all

these things.
