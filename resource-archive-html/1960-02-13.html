<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 62-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> An amendment has been proposed*:



<hr size="2" noshade>

* An amendment proposed by Tun Lim Yew Hock on

12th February, 1960.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 26, to leave outlines 3 to 7 inclusive

and  insert  "but  may  be  represented  by   an

advocate and solicitor if so desired.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to

be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> There was

an oblique reference yesterday by the Member for

Tanglin, that perhaps Government may have

infamous intentions to prevent the resuscitation

of dead men. Sir, we do not require a

steamroller to crack such little nuts as ex-Chief Ministers who have disgraced themselves.

As a matter of fact, -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Present company excepted!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The present company always

excepted. We are all honourable men here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is more likely to expose the hypocrisy

of  one's  political convictions than  continued

demands on one's time for no monetary rewards. I

can  assure  Members on the other  side  of  the

House  that, whilst there may be a, lot of  hard

work and maybe some political kudos, there is no

money in this. I can only say, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  my friend and colleague, the Minister  for

Labour  and Law, has assured me that it  is  his

consistent  experience  that  things  are   more

quickly  resolved, and issues are  more  quickly

and honestly joined without garnishing, when two

parties face each other across the table without

the  assistance of skilled advocates. It is  our

sincere  hope that this, in fact, will  continue

to  happen  in  these Courts when employers  and

unions  are made to present their cases, in  the

case  of  the employers through their officials,

and  in the case of unions of employees, through

the Industrial Relations Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For myself, I would like to add that I think

it  is  a  matter for some regret that what  was

once   believed   to  be  the  royal   road   to

acknowledgment  as a champion of  the  cause  of

labour,  should now be trodden by those who  are

prepared  to he champions not Only for  the  few

weeks  that they may be in the Arbitration Court

but  for an extra period of six months prior  to

arbitration. I am quite sure there  will  be  up

and coming, earnest, dedicated men and women who

will,  in accordance with the provisions of  the

Industrial  Relations Bill when it  is  enacted,

make  the  sacrifices  necessary  in  order   to

qualify co be champions of labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, before I

speak  on  the amendment, I would be obliged  to

the  Minister for Labour if he would inform  the

House  what exactly is meant by "intervener"  in

line  40,  page 25 of the Bill, in reference  to

these proceedings? Does it just mean anybody who

intervenes,  arid  what interest  must  he  have

before he intervenes?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, "intervene" means to

intervene.  Any party who can show an  interest

or  any person, who can show an interest in the

intervention, intervenes. And it will be up  to

the  Court  to  decide whether to  accept  that

interest  as a legitimate intervening  interest

when such intervention is made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I submit, with respect, Sir, that

"intervener" probably had a meaning when "trade

union"  meant a trade union of employers,  too.

But  so  far as "employer" is concerned at  the

moment,  I do not see how anybody can intervene

on  his  behalf.  Maybe an  intervention  could

still  take place with regard to a trade  union

of  employees, but with regard to the employer,

I  do not see how anybody can intervene on  his

behalf  except he himself - he is left  to  fight

his  own  battle. But if an employer  has  been

served  under  clause 16 by a  trade  union  of

employees,  then  a  trade union  of  employers

could  intervene under clause 62.  Now  that  a

trade  union of employers is out of the picture

entirely, and the employer is left to fight his

own  battle, I do not see who would be  foolish

enough  to intervene on his behalf - in a  losing

battle anyway.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has this anything to do with the

amendment before the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, Sir, it will have something to

do with it when I speak later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for

Farrer Park has not envisaged a situation which

very  often  can arise. Let us  say  a  dispute

arises between the Aerated Water Workers' Union

and  the  Phoenix Aerated Water Company  as  to

what  would  be the fair rates of pay  for  the

workers.  The  decision on  that  would  affect

Fraser &Neave, and members of the union who are

in  Fraser & Neave. Therefore, it is quite open

for  another  firm, also in the  aerated  water

business, to want to intervene and say, "Whilst

the Court is considering the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



wages  and conditions of service and the  state

of   the   industry,  I  would  like  to   give

evidence." It is true that the award would only

be  binding on the immediate parties before the

Court, but a party in a similar industry  might

want  to  come in and say, "Let me  present  my

facts  as  I  see  them."  In  that  case,  the

employer would be an intervener. Or vice-versa,

it might be that the workers in Phoenix Aerated

Water  Company might belong to one trade union,

and  the  workers in Fraser & Neave in  similar

occupations might belong to another,  and  they

might want to come in and give evidence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the latest

submission by the Member for Farrer  Park  adds

considerable    weight   to    my    suggestion

earlier - that  the Front Benchers opposite  have

taken  very  little trouble to  understand  the

meaning of this Bill. If the Member for  Farrer

Park would look at clause 61 (1), he would  see

that there is provision for the State Advocate-General  to  intervene in any  dispute  in  the

public interest. Going on to sub-clause (2), it

expressly provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where the State Advocate-General has

intervened in proceedings before the Court  the

Court  may  grant leave to any trade  union  or

person to intervene in those proceedings."

<br><br>

Surely  that must have some reference to clause

62 - there  is  the provision of intervention  in

addition  to what the Prime Minister  has  just

indicated to the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I would point out to the Minister

for  Law,  in  regard to his interpretation  of

"intervener",  that  the  "intervener"  I   was

thinking of was the "intervener" as it  appears

in  line  40 of page 25. However, I  will  come

back to that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is on the Order Paper

a notice of amendment on page 26 of the Bill in

respect  of the definition of "officer"  in  so

far  as  this  particular clause is  concerned.

Sir,  may  I  be allowed to dwell on  that  too

while  I  address the House on this  particular

amendment, because it would be relevant  to  my

submission?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, as I said yesterday, whether or

not  clause 62 is a fair clause depends entirely

on  the concept of the Bill. In the Bill  as  it

was  originally,  the concept was  to  hold  the

balance   evenly  between  the   two   disputing

parties.   In  my  view,  clause   62   is   not

unreasonable in trying to shut out advocates and

solicitors, because it also shuts out  everybody

else,  so  far  as  the union of  employees  was

concerned.  The clause says that only  a  person

who   is  a  full-time  secretary  or  assistant

secretary may appear for a union. That  is  fair

enough. But after representations have been made

by  trade  unions of employees to the  Minister,

the   Minister   now  proposes  to   alter   the

definition,  Mr Speaker, Sir, as  appearing  in

page  54  of  the  Order Paper Supplement  [12th

February, 1960] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on the new

Supplement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Anyway, the proposed new paragraph

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) "officer", in relation to a trade union

includes  for  the purposes of  any  proceedings

before the Court a person appointed by the body,

by whatever name called, to which the management

of  the  affairs of the union is  entrusted,  to

represent the trade union in those proceedings.'

<br><br>

As  I  understand it, a trade union of employees

could  appoint anybody, other than  an  advocate

and  solicitor,  to represent  them  under  that

paragraph.  So  that X union could  appoint  the

secretary  of  Y union, or vice-versa.  Or  they

could  appoint  a  complete  outsider  who   has

specialised in trade union activities. So far as

the trade union of employees is concerned, there

are  two  additional weights  in  their  favour.

First,   they  have  been  given  the   use   by

Government,   at  government  expense,   of   an

Industrial Relations Officer, who is himself  an

officer trained in such matters and who would be

able  to  plead for the trade union of employees

in  a  manner perhaps even better than can  some

advocates  and solicitors, because he  has  been

trained  in that particular branch of Government

work  or trade union work. Over and above  that,

there  are also persons at the disposal of trade

unions   of   employees   who   themselves   are

specialists. Mr Speaker, Sir, recently  we  had

an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



instance  where one Political Secretary attached

to the Government was given leave of absence. He

went  and so ably conducted the case for a trade

union of employees that they won the case.  Such

a  person would be available to all trade unions

of employees who find themselves in difficulties

with their employers. Now, the balance has again

been upset.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as a trade union of employers could

take  up  the cudgels on behalf of an  employer,

there were some reasons to exclude advocates and

solicitors, because the trade union of employers

themselves might have secretaries who were  well

versed  in  these  matters, and therefore  those

persons  would have been able to appear for  the

employer in question. But now that too has  been

shut out. An employer must stand on his own.  He

cannot go to a trade union of employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you get the position, Sir, where two

weights  have been added in favour of the  trade

union of employees, and one weight which was  in

favour of the trade union of employers has  been

taken  away. It is not always true, Mr Speaker,

Sir, that an employer is a very rich person.  An

employer might be just struggling along like  an

employee. There are several very small employers

in Singapore- persons who run a sewing business,

a  tailoring  business, or a little  coffee-shop

-and   they  might  have  employees.   And   the

employees  might  have a dispute  with  such  an

employer.  The  employer might be an  illiterate

person.  Though  very keen  and  clever  in  his

business,   he  might  be  quite  incapable   of

presenting his case to the Arbitration Court  or

even  before a conciliation officer. Do  we  not

know  of  instances,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  where

people  who are so voluble outside dry  up  once

you ask them to stand on their feet and talk? It

is  a  gift  to  be able to talk sensibly  under

pressure, and not all persons can do that. So at

every  point,  the  employer  is  faced  with  a

disadvantage. How then can this be  weighted  in

his favour again? If he cannot avail himself  of

somebody, then who could plead his case  without

fear  or  favour? Would not that  person  be  an

advocate  and  solicitor? Why is he  being  shut

out?  Originally, Sir, there was some point  and

purpose   in  the  Bill,  because  things   were

balanced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



Only  secretaries and assistant  secretaries  of

unions could appear for the unions. But now that

has  been  extended to cover everybody, provided

he  is  not  a  paid agent or  an  advocate  and

solicitor.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister for Labour and Law,

the  main objection to employing an advocate and

solicitor was that it was an expensive business.

Sir,  if an employer wants to engage an advocate

and  solicitor  at his expense, why  should  the

Minister  object to that? Also,  why  should  a

trade  union of employees object to an  employer

incurring  expense  in order  to  put  his  case

correctly?  If, as the Minister says,  advocates

and  solicitors charge high fees  appearing  for

trade unions of employees, well, the unions  are

not interested in advocates and solicitors. They

have got the Industrial Relations Officers,  who

would  be  doing these jobs and doing them  very

well,  available to them. So the unions are  all

right. Therefore, to say that because of expense

an  employer should be deprived of the  services

of  an  advocate and solicitor does not  somehow

seem right to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said, Sir, that skilled and

orderly  presentation of a  case  would  give  a

trade  dispute a forensic character.  I  beg  to

defer with the Minister on that point, because a

good  administrator can present the  facts  with

skill and order. He need not be an advocate, and

because  he  is  doing that, is his  Ministry  a

place  where forensic matters are being thrashed

out?  All that is needed is somebody to put  the

points succinctly and clearly to the Arbitration

Court. That is what is normally expected  of  an

advocate arid solicitor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think another point the Minister made was

that  if  an  advocate  and solicitor  appeared,

there would not be that informality which is  so

essential  in  the Arbitration  Court.  I  would

submit to the Minister with respect that if  the

Minister wanted the Court to be informal,  I  am

sure an advocate would make it very informal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further point that advocates tend to

become   technical.  Advocates  do  not   become

technical on their own, Mr Speaker, Sir. I take

it that the President



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Court  would  lay down  rules  for  the

guidance   of  the  Court,  and  advocates   and

solicitors  would be guided by those  rules.  So

why  then  is it necessary to shut out advocates

and   solicitors,  particularly  now   that   an

employer has been deprived of the assistance  of

a trade union of employers, and the employer has

to stand on his own feet?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may come to clause 62 (1) (a) again, it

says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"being a trade union may be represented by an

officer of the trade union;"

<br><br>and with the amendment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"or, in the case of a trade union of employees,

by  an  officer  of the trade union  or  by  an

Industrial  Relations Officer selected  by  the

trade union."

<br><br>

As  the Minister himself has said, a trade union

must now exclude a trade union of employers, and

paragraph  (a)  refers  to  a  trade  union   of

employees. And paragraph (b), Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"not being a trade union," -



<br><br>I take it this now refers to an employer



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"may be represented by an employee of that

party" -



<br><br>in other words, an employer may either

appear himself or get his employee to appear for

him, or an intervener. Sir. "represented by an

intervener" means, I take it, somebody who

appears on his behalf. Who could appear on his

behalf? Not a trade union of employers -

they are shut out. And not the State Advocate-General. So it must be somebody for and on

behalf of the employer and at his behest! If

that is an intervener, I do not know whether we

have got the right meaning of "intervener".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole objection to an advocate and

solicitor, in the first instance, Sir, was  that

he would upset the balance, because the employer

would  be able to employ him, but not the  trade

union of employees. Now that the trade union  of

employees  has been sufficiently and  adequately

protected, in so far as their representation  is

concerned,  why then should they now  object  to

the  employer  seeking to get what he  considers

adequate representation for himself?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid, in

the  course of the debate, we would be teaching

others!  As the definition of "officer" appears

in  clause  62  (2)  (a),  you  will  see  that

representation is restricted to persons in  the

employment  of  a trade union  as  a  full-time

secretary or assistant secretary. We felt  that

that  was unduly restrictive against the unions

as    far   as   representations   before   the

Arbitration Court were concerned. You will  see

in clause 62 (1) (b) (ii) that employers can be

represented by officers of their trade  unions.

I  have  mentioned  this  before:  although  an

employer is not a party to the proceedings,  an

employer  may  nevertheless be a  member  of  a

trade union. For the purpose of representation,

therefore,  an  employer can make  use  of  the

services of an officer who is employed  by  his

trade  union.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  in

Singapore   the   experience  of   seeing   big

organisations of employers employing specialist

officers as trade union experts. I do not  wish

to mention any names to the House, but it would

sound  a bell in their memory when I say  that.

The  employers  can get the services  of  trade

unionists who sell their skill to the employers

as  specialists. Mr Speaker, Sir, in  view  of

that,  it was considered unduly restrictive  to

limit  the representation on behalf of a  trade

union of employees to a full-time secretary  or

assistant  secretary  of  a  union.  For   that

reason, we have proposed this amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park

has  overlooked the provisions of clause 62 (1)

(b)  (ii), where it is provided that  all  paid

agents  are excluded. What is a paid  agent?  A

paid  agent can be an accountant or a  firm  of

accountants. If we allow them to advertise  the

fact  that  they  are experts  in  trade  union

matters,  they could then assist the  employer.

For  that  reason,  we have excluded  all  paid

agents  from espousing the cause of  disputants

before the Arbitration Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the clause originally stood, you will see

that  it was unduly weighted in favour  of  the

employer,  and we have sought to  redress  that

balance.  That  is  why  we  have  amended  the

definition  of  "officer" for the  purposes  of

representation  to give the  committee  of  the

trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



union the right to appoint any person whom they

consider competent to represent them before the

Arbitration Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park

said   that  the  services  of  advocates   and

solicitors are also available to trade  unions.

Is  that so? Out of the whole Bar in Singapore,

I know of very, very few lawyers who are really

interested  in trade union work, and  who  will

offer  their  services to trade  unions  for  a

nominal fee. They can be counted on your finger-tips.  As against that, the employers have  got

the services of the whole Bar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see quite clearly how everything is

weighted  against the trade union of employees,

and  it is for that reason that Government  has

proposed  a further amendment to clause  62  to

provide  for  the  appointment of  conciliation

officers   as  well  as  Industrial   Relations

Officers, whose services will be available to a

trade  union  of  employees.  On  balance,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  can   not   be

charged  with  favouring  the  trade  union  of

employees at the expense of the trade union  of

employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of legal representation before

the  Arbitration Court, I have repeatedly  told

this   House   that  there  is  a  very   great

difference   between  the  functions   of   the

Arbitration Court, which we propose to set  up,

and   the   ordinary  Courts.  The  Courts   of

Arbitration are not Courts of Judicature - I have

repeatedly said that. Their functions are  more

like  those  of bodies which concern themselves

with  delegated legislation. At  a  glance  the

process of arbitration and conciliation is  not

a  judicial process. By conciliation,  a  third

party   tries  to  bring  the  two   disputants

together, and to narrow down their differences.

It  is only when he cannot get them to reach an

agreement  that  the  question  of  arbitration

arises.  And  when the question of  arbitration

arises,  it is proper, to our way of  thinking,

that there should not be a formalistic approach

The  training of lawyers is such that they  are

prone  to  think  in terms of precedents;  they

tend to stand on their rights. Far from helping

to  bring  the  parties together, lawyers  more

often than not make them drift apart.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our purpose right through has been an honest

purpose. We have repeatedly said that, though we  want

both  sides  to  accept  the principle  of  compulsory

arbitration,  it  is  our intention  that  as  far  as

possible they should try to reach agreement, and  that

only  in  the  last  resort,  when  agreement  is  not

possible, will they submit the dispute to arbitration.

That surely is reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the intervener, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have indicated that the State Advocate-General  can

be  an  intervener  in arbitration proceedings.  There

might  be  reasons  why he should intervene.  When  he

does,  he  would be looking to the public interest  in

that  dispute.  If he comes in, then we  have  allowed

legal  representation. It is not  true  that  we  have

excluded  all legal representation, as the  Opposition

Front  Benchers have charged. If this clause is looked

at carefully, it will be seen that we also allow legal

representation  when  the Court is  looking  into  the

question of contempt of Court under the provisions  of

clause 54. In the case of ordinary disputes, where  no

legal  problems  are involved, where  no  question  of

contempt is to be looked into, and where there  is  no

intervention  by  the  State Advocate-General,  it  is

right and proper that lawyers should not come in.  The

Prime  Minister  has already made the  point  that  if

lawyers are interested in this kind of work, they  can

give  up  their legal practice. If they give up  their

practice  six months before they get themselves  mixed

up with these matters, praise be to them.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  just  one  little point to  add,  from  personal

experience  too. The Prime Minister has said  that  he

has  been informed by his colleagues that it has  been

his  experience  that when parties are represented  by

advocates  and solicitors, matters are not so  quickly

resolved and not so honestly joined. I am sure he does

not mean that, because when he was representing one of

the  parties  during my time, I paid  him  a  tribute,

since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



it was because of his presence that the  issues

were  joined  more quickly and more honestly.  Now  it

seems to me that he is of the view that if he had  not

been there, matters might have been still more quickly

and still more honestly resolved!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am glad that the Member for

Cairnhill  appreciates  that  there  are  lawyers  and

lawyers! I can assure the Member for Farrer Park  that

in  my personal experience - this is not hearsay - I  have

as  yet  to  meet  an  employer  who  has  not  got  a

managerial  staff to put his case across. The  problem

of  an  orderly and disciplined marshalling of  facts,

figures, and arguments arises, in most cases, with the

unions.  It  is  in  the nature  of  things  that  the

managerial side has always the intellectual talent  to

put   facts,   figures,  and  reasons  logically   and

succinctly.  In the unlikely event of an employer  not

being a member of a trade association or a trade union

of    employers,   and   himself   being   bereft   of

intelligence, then I say that, far from the employees'

union worrying about how to get more money from him, I

think they will be worrying about where they are going

to get jobs when their employer's firm goes bankrupt!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on Supplement No. 14. We are

on clause 62. Will the Minister move formally? I think

we have had a debate on this amendment already, unless

any Member wishes to speak further on it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, I want to speak on the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 26, lines 9 to 11, to leave out "a person in

the employment of a trade union as a full-time

secretary or assistant secretary" and insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"for

the purposes of any proceedings before the Court a

person appointed by the body, by whatever name

called, to which the management of the affairs of

the union is entrusted, to represent the trade union

in those proceedings".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I

understand it right, the Minister said earlier in

the  debate on my amendment that the trade unions

had objected to the limitation on a secretary  or

assistant secretary, and therefore, in  order  to

widen  the  provisions of  paragraph  (a)  he  is

tabling  the amendment. But I would like to  say,

Sir, that the wording of the amendment throws the

gate  wide  open. Not only does  it  make  it  an

offence,  but it is also not meant  to  meet  the

objection.  If it is meant to meet the objection,

I  am sure the amendment should allow for a full-time  officer, by whatever name called. He  could

be  a  clerk,  a general affairs officer,  or  he

could  be  anybody. But the amendment as proposed

by  the Minister could mean anyone, it could even

mean  a  Political Secretary. He  could  even  be

anyone   not  connected  with  the  trade   union

movement. I think the unions' objection  is  that

they  are  being  tied down to the  secretary  or

assistant  secretary. Why cannot it be a  general

affairs  clerk?  Why cannot it be  an  organising

secretary? Why cannot it be a full-time  official

who  does  not  carry the title of  secretary  or

assistant  secretary? I am  sure  the  Government

will  have  no objection if I amend the amendment

to  read,  "full-time officer, by  whatever  name

called", if that is actually the intention of the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the

amendment  is to enable the trade unions  to  get

the   services  of  people  in  the  trade  union

movement  who are skilled in the presentation  of

arguments before an arbitral body. The Member for

Cairnhill must realise that the purpose  of  this

legislation is to set up an industrial court, and

it  would  be necessary for the unions to  obtain

the  services  of  people  who  are  skilled   in

presenting  their arguments before the industrial

court. Now one union may not have an official who

is so skilled. Surely it cannot be wrong for that

union  to look around for some other union  which

has  a conciliation officer, to enable it to have

an  official skilled in the type of service  that

it  wants.  If  you  write into  the  clause  the

provision that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so and so is to be full-time, will you really

achieve your purpose? There is nothing to prevent

any union committee from deciding that X, who  is

a  stranger to the union, will, for the  purposes

of  the  arbitration, be employed  full-time.  It

means  nothing. It does not add anything to  what

you  are  trying to do. The mere  fact  that  you

employ a person to represent your case before the

Arbitration  Court suggests that he  is  employed

full-time  for that purpose. Because  arbitration

proceedings take a long time, they are  not  over

in  the  course  of  one day. I  know  that  some

arbitration proceedings take as much  as  two  or

three  weeks before they are concluded. We  leave

that  latitude  to the unions.  Surely  there  is

nothing wrong in that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Did the Minister say that the

union is free to employ any person to help it  to

negotiate? Did he use the word "employ"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, or engage if you like, or

obtain the services, or what have you. What we do

not  want  is  a paid agent. A paid  agent  is  a

person  who  sets up business to  assist  parties

before  the Arbitration Court. We do not  want  a

group  of undesirables unconnected with the trade

union  movement  putting  up  notice  boards  and

saying  that  they  are,  for  the  purposes   of

arbitration, paid agents whose services would  be

at  the  disposal  of any union  which  wants  to

employ them. That would make a farce of the whole

proceedings.  You can leave the  unions  to  look

after  their own affairs. We are trying our  best

to develop a sense of responsibility. We think it

unfair  that those persons who are in  the  trade

union  movement  should spend  so  much  time  in

conciliation proceedings, and when  it  comes  to

the   presentation  of  their  case  before   the

Arbitration  Court, to see lawyers coming  in  on

various pretexts to cash in. We are not trying to

make  it  impossible for the  employees  to  find

persons who are skilled to assist them. All  that

is not our intention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  think  it is one of the aims of both sides  of

the  House that there should be industrial  peace

with justice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



not  only for the workers but for the employers.

The  other  aim,  as  given by  the  Hon.  Prime

Minister,  is to establish conditions  conducive

to  industrial expansion, so that that will lead

to  further  employment of  more  workers.  That

really  is  the ultimate aim of this  Bill.  The

intention  of setting up this Arbitration  Court

is to create an atmosphere of confidence in this

country  so  that  employers will  expand  their

business  and  there will be more  opportunities

for  employment. If this clause is amended, then

the question is, will it give the employers that

confidence  so  that  they  will  expand   their

business  and employ more people? Let us  regard

these  two  groups as human beings. We sometimes

take  sides.  If you are workers, you  naturally

take  the  side  of  the  workers.  If  you  are

employers, you take the side of the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which side are you on?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am a paid man. In

this  particular case, the Government in  a  way

are  employers. When they drafted  the  Bill - and

remember,   this   is  a  Government   Bill - they

balanced competing interests. With the  help  of

their expert draftsman, they produced this Bill,

and,  all of a sudden amendments are made  which

show   that  they  have  retreated  from   their

position.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member is

probably  going a bit too far from the amendment

before   the  House,  which  is  to  amend   the

definition of "officer" in sub-clause  (2)  (a).

Let us not go back to the whole principle of the

Bill.  Let us try and confine ourselves to  this

particular amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to

refer  to  the principle because this particular

clause  goes against that principle. By  opening

the door so that anybody and everybody could  be

brought  in,  it will bring into  the  field  of

trade disputes irresponsible people who might be

interested   in   prolonging   disputes,    and,

therefore,  the object of creating an atmosphere

which will promote industrial expansion would be

lost. For that reason,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



Sir,  if the Government feels that the paragraph

could not be limited to a full-time secretary or

assistant secretary, then it could amend  it  so

that  it could include a further class, such  as

their own legal officers or their own Industrial

Relations Officers, without opening the gate  to

every Tom, Dick or Harry and every trouble-maker

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not

objecting to this amendment at all. But what  we

fear  is that the wording, as it is now,  throws

the   gate  wide  open.  We  have  already   had

experience of Political Secretaries being  given

leave  to  appear before a court to represent  a

trade  union. I think what the Minister actually

aims  at  is to see that a trade union can  have

any  member of that trade union or a  member  of

any  other trade union of employees to come  and

help.  If it is limited to a member of  a  trade

union  or  a member of any other trade union  of

employees, then I think that could be understood

by   all.  It  is  just  that  the  trade  union

movement,  as a whole, can be depended  upon  to

come to the assistance of one union in regard to

arbitration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill  is  referring to the intervention  of

Political  Secretaries in trade  union  affairs.

May  I remind him that the Political Secretaries

he has in mind are Political Secretaries who are

also   members  of  trade  unions?   When   they

intervened, they intervened on behalf  of  their

respective  trade unions. That is  exactly  what

can   be  done  under  the  provisions  of   the

amendment that we propose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>

to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 27, line 32, after "which", to insert "he

knows".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a person who makes a statement to an officer is punishable if his statement is false or

misleading.  But  it does sometimes  happen  that  the

statement  which  he  makes  is,  according   to   his

knowledge   and  belief,  not  false  or   misleading.

Therefore, I think it but fair that you only punish  a

man  who  makes  a false statement knowing  it  to  be

false.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we must not try to place

an  undue burden on the prosecution to prove knowledge

that  the  statement  is false. Anybody  who  makes  a

statement   to  an  official  when  he  is  inspecting

premises - in  this  case  the  person  who   would   be

inspecting the premises in relation to a dispute would

either  be  the President or a member who  constitutes

the   Court,   or   a   person   authorised   by   the

President - must  ensure  that  he  is  careful  in  the

statement  that  he  makes.  If  he  is  negligent  or

careless, or if he does not give sufficient  care  and

attention  to  his  replies,  I  think  he  should  be

penalised. The question of knowledge and so  on -   that

he  did  not know, and that he did not understand  the

question that was put - is one which he can very  fairly

put to the Court if he is charged with an offence.  If

the  Court believes that, in fact, he did not know the

question that he was asked, then it could be  left  to

the  Magistrate to acquit him. But I can see no reason

why   this  extra  burden  should  be  placed  on  the

prosecution,  if  proceedings are  brought  against  a

person   for  making  a  false  statement  under   the

provisions of this clause.

appointment or promotion of a person to a managerial

position that that person shall not continue to be an

officer or member of a particular union.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Opposition Front Bench has charged that we have been very unfair in the amendments that

we have made. They have said that we have given due

regard to the representation of the unions of

employees, but have paid very little attention to the

representation of the employers. Mr Speaker, we are

moving this amendment to clause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



77  because  of the representation we  received

from  the  employers. Clause 77 deals with  the

case  where skilful employers hold out  carrots

in  a general way before employees who seek  ad

vancement  in  their service. In the  terms  of

clause 77, an employer is committing an offence

if he says to an employee:

"If  you sever your connections with the union,

I  will  in due course see to it that  you  are

promoted  to a superior post in my employment."

That sort of inducement is penalised under this

provision.  But the employers said  that  under

the  terms  of  this clause, if  they  in  fact

genuinely  wanted to promote anybody  in  their

employ  who is a member of a trade union  to  a

superior  post in their employment, they  would

still  be  committing  an  offence  under  this

clause.  That  was a reasonable  submission  to

make,  and we have therefore provided  in  this

proviso that where, in fact, an employer offers

an  employee  a promotion, he can  say  to  the

employee  that  the condition of the  promotion

will be that he severs his connections with the

union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Corruption!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not

corruption. In Government service,  in  private

employment and elsewhere, there is such a thing

as   management.  We  feel  that  it  is  quite

improper, if a person wants to seek advancement

to  the  position of management, that he should

continue  his association with any trade  union

movement,  particularly in the  position  of  a

committee  member  of  a  union,  because   the

functions  of management are such that  if  the

employer is to pay him for the services that he

is  to render in the position of management, it

is  essential  that he severs  his  connections

with  the trade union to which he belongs. That

is  a  reasonable request for the employers  to

make.  It is for that reason that we are moving

this amendment.

by  the  Government,  it  was  found  that  the

provisions   of   this   clause   would   cause

embarrassment to the trade unions of employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was very concerned to see in the memorandum

of the employers that they urged the Government

that  not only should the officers who  incited

the  go-slow or the work-to-rule be  punishable

under  the provisions of this clause, but  that

all  those  who  participated  in  the  go-slow

should also be punishable. They went on to  say

that  the  Trade Disputes Ordinance  should  be

amended so that any go-slow would be considered

to he an illegal strike.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we find that the amendments

which  have already been made to this Bill  give

the   President  of  the  Court  of  Arbitration

sufficient powers to deal with situations  where

the    provisions   of   awards   are   wilfully

disregarded. In the circumstances, where  a  go-slow  can  be  considered to be a breach  of  an

award,  it will be open to the President of  the

Court  to  proceed under clause 53 of the  Bill.

You will note, Mr Speaker, Sir, that clause  53

provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Court shall have power-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to order compliance with an award

proved   to  have  been  broken   or   not

observed; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to enjoin a trade union or person from

committing  or  continuing a contravention

of  any provision of this Ordinance  or  a

breach or non-observance of an award."

<br><br>

So  that if there is any evidence that an  award

is  being  disregarded, then the  Court - in  this

case  it will be the President - will summon those

who are responsible and will make the order that

the  provisions of the award be  obeyed  and  be

carried   out.   If  there  is  further   wilful

disregard  of the Court's order, then the  Court

can  proceed under the provisions of clause  54.

As  you will see, under the provisions of clause

54,  the  Court can fine the unions and  it  can

also  place  the leaders of the  union  who  are

responsible    for   these   activities    under

restriction  against  participation   in   union

activities for a period of up to two  years.  We

say,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that there  is  already

ample  provision in this Bill for the  Court  to

deal with such situations should they arise.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill

had  been described by the Opposition as a  good

Bill,  because they were not fully aware at  the

time  of the Second Reading that there had  been

proposals  to  negative  this  clause  and   the

following  clause. Sir, the Prime  Minister  has

said  that what the Government aims at achieving

by this Bill is industrial stability, industrial

peace and confidence. This particular clause has

been inserted by the Government, and because  it

has   been  inserted,  those  people  who   have

suffered   the  disadvantage  of   the   go-slow

policies of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



some  trade  unions in the past are relieved  to

learn  that  the  Government is  aware  of  this

industrial pest in their midst and is  making  a

genuine and honest effort to see to it that this

industrial  pest shall not  rear  its  head

again.  I do not see any reason why this  clause

should  be  deleted when it is in  regard  to  a

breach  of an award. If there has been no award,

it  is  a different matter. The trade union  can

take  whatever  action it desires  in  order  to

achieve  its  aims to improve the conditions  of

employment of its members. But once an award has

been  given by the Court of Arbitration to which

that  trade  union is a party, surely,  for  the

confidence  of the parties in the Court,  it  is

necessary  that  any attempt to  advise  persons

found by the Court not to be observing the award

should be punishable. If the Government had  not

inserted  this  clause in, one could  understand

why they had felt that it was not necessary. But

after  having  put  it in  in  order  to  instil

confidence in the public, to withdraw it at this

juncture is going to shake the public's  feeling

of confidence in the Government's aim to achieve

industrial stability and peace.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

sorry  that  the  confidence of the  Member  for

Cairnhill has been badly shaken and that he  was

misled   during  the  Second  Reading.   To   my

recollection,  Sir, notice of  these  amendments

was  given  before the Second  Reading.  If  the

Opposition  leaders subsequently  chose  to  say

that,  at the time when they were commenting  on

the principle of the Bill, they were unaware  of

the position of the Government, that surely is a

matter  for  regret that they did not  give  the

Order Paper and the Notices of Amendments to the

Bill the consideration which they warranted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to go into the rather long-winded argument as to how confidence was first

created  and  then shaken by the  withdrawal  of

this  clause.  All I want to do  is  to  explain

briefly  why  we  accepted  the  arguments   put

forward by a committee consisting of many  union

representatives, to delete clauses 82 and 83



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the principles on which this Bill was

based is a balance of interests and balance  of

responsibilities, duties and punishments. There

is already sufficient power under clause 54 for

the  Court to see that its awards are honoured.

and to impose penalties on the unions and union

leaders  if  the terms of an award were  to  be

flouted.  Clauses  82 and 83 deal  specifically

only  with unions of employees, because it  did

not  occur to the human mind that employers can

go-slow.  Employers  either  lock-out  or  they

close  down  altogether. Therefore, the  unions

argued  that clauses 82 and 83 were, in effect,

an  extra  penalty  against  unions  for  being

unions. I would just like to point this out  to

Members  on  the other side - that,  as  drafted,

clauses 54 and 55 can adequately deal with  the

situation where union officers are flouting the

terms  of  an award by going slow. I  am  quite

sure  that  the Member for Farrer Park,  if  he

applies himself to the wording of clause 54  as

now  amended - penalties on trade  union  leaders

for  flouting  an order for compliance  by  the

Court - will  see that there is sufficient  scope

there  to  ensure compliance by punishment,  if

compliance is, in fact, negatived by a go-slow.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But, Sir, the punishment is

going  to  be  meted out to those  persons  who

listen to the agitator coming along and saying,

"You  should not do this and you should not  do

that."  It  is not the agitator only  who  will

himself  be punished, but also the persons  who

are  foolish  enough to listen to him  will  be

punished.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill,  I  think,  has  paid  very   little

attention to what I have just said. I draw  his

attention to the provisions of clause 53.  When

there  is  evidence  that  an  award  is  being

disregarded, what the Court would do is to send

for   - in   the  case  of  a  trade  union   of

employees - the  leaders of the trade  union  who

the Court thinks are responsible for the breach

of  the award. It would then take evidence, and

if  it  was satisfied that there was  a  wilful

disregard of the award, it could make an  order

that  the terms of the award be carried out  by

the   union  of  employees.  If  there  was   a

disregard of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



the  order  of the Court, then the Court  could

proceed to punish as in clause 54, that is,  to

fine   and  to  place  the  leaders   under   a

restriction. The persons who would be bound  by

the order of the Court would be the persons who

were  summoned before the Court  and  who  were

ordered by the Court specifically to carry  out

the  terms  of  the award. That  order  clearly

would  not apply to the other committee members

of the union who knew nothing about the matter.

So  I  cannot see the point of what the  Member

for Cairnhill has just said.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does not clause

82  take  in the person who goes and encourages

them  to  go  slow? Clause 54 only  deals  with

officers  of  the union who do not comply  with

the award. I think the gentleman who should  be

dealt  with more severely is the gentleman  who

is outside the union but goes along and incites

them to go slow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

now  delving  into niceties and intricacies.  I

think  it  is  by implication admitted  by  the

Member  that  the  powers  of  enforcement  are

there,  and that is basically what we  want  to

achieve. If by the deletion of clauses  82  and

83  we  deprive  the Court  of  the  powers  of

enforcement, then I would say we are  departing

from  a  point of major principle. By  debating

whether or not we should so draft the clause as

to  get  the man who may not have been  brought

before the Court, who has incited them, and who

is  not an officer of the union, then I say, by

implication,  it  is admitted  that  there  are

sufficient powers in clauses 53, 54 and  55  to

compel  compliance. That basically is  what  we

intended to do. The reason why clauses  82  and

83  were agreed to be deleted from the Bill was

that   there  was  no  similar  provision   for

employers  because, by the  nature  of  things,

they  cannot  go  slow but the  employees  can.

Therefore,  having to hold the  scales  against

competing  interests, we decided,  since  there

was  no  competing interest on the  other  side

which   would  merit  similar  or  commensurate

punishment, to delete clauses 82 and 83.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of

information. As the debate has been  on  clause

83 as well, I would like to point out that what

is  mentioned  in  clause 83,  that  is,  union

activity in working time, really does not  form

part  of  this Bill. It has got nothing  to  do

with  collective  agreements  as  such  or  the

course    of    arbitration.    That    weighed

considerably when a decision was made that  the

provisions of that clause be deleted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member going to

speak on clause 82 or 83?

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Clause 82, Sir. Mr

Speaker, Sir, do I understand from the Hon, the

Prime   Minister  that  clause  82  has  become

superfluous,  because the powers  are  provided

for in clauses 53 and 54?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The niceties of the

argument which were advanced by the Member  for

Farrer  Park  should, I think,  convey  to  the

Member  for  Tanglin that the  clauses  do  not

exactly duplicate themselves. They are slightly

distinct.  Clause  82 deals  specifically  with

situations where there is a go-slow. Clause  54

deals  with  general situations. Unlike  clause

82,  a  person to be punished under  clause  54

must  be  a member of a trade union of  persons

that  is  continuing  a  contravention  of  any

provision  of  this Ordinance, or committing  a

breach of non-observance of an award. If one of

the ways in which an award is being defeated is

by  a  go-slow,  then  the  officers  who  have

incited the go-slow, the leaders and maybe some

of  the men, or the shop stewards may be called

up  before  the Court and warned in the,  first

instance.  Subsequently, if there is a  breach,

then clause 54 springs into operation and there

is  contempt  of court, and the penalties  come

into  being.  All  that I wanted  to  draw  the

attention  of the Members of the  House  to  is

this,  that  if it is complained  that  by  the

deletion  of  this clause 82 we are,  in  fact,

making  awards unenforceable because the unions

can flout them by going slow, then I accept the

stricture that they have passed. But if  it  is

conceded that all that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



we  are  doing  is to hold the balance  between

unions  and  employers  by  not  putting  in  a

special provision for the-punishment of  unions

for going slow, when we cannot put in a similar

provision  for  punishing employers  for  going

slow,  then I say there is no point in carrying

this debate any further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition to

what the Prime Minister has just said, I should

like   to   draw  a  distinction  between   the

procedure  in  clause 82 and the  procedure  in

clauses  53 and 54. You will see, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that  the punishment for go-slow  is  the

punishment (as clause 82 stands) which is meted

out  by  the ordinary Court - the District Court.

It  is  our  view that this sort of  punishment

should be handled by the Court which makes  the

award.  But  under the procedure in clauses  53

and  54,  it is the Court of Arbitration  which

makes  the award and which also supervises  the

execution or the carrying out of that award. If

there is to be a punishment, it is but fair (if

the  punishment is to be meted out on a  charge

that  the  award is wilfully disregarded)  that

the power to inflict that punishment should  be

in  the  hands  of  the Court which  makes  the

award.  If  you  bring it before  the  ordinary

Courts,   they   may  not  be  aware   of   the

circumstances  which led to the award,  and  it

will  be  unduly penalising the  unions  if  we

allow this clause to stand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, we are

interested in seeing that, when the Arbitration

Court makes an award, it will be enforceable on

both  sides  and respected by both sides.  Then

only  can  we have industrial peace. Therefore,

Sir,  we felt very perturbed because we thought

that  if these provisions were negatived,  then

it   would   mean  that  the  award  would   be

practically unenforceable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

one  thing  for  which  Government  cannot   be

responsible,  and  that is  the  feebleness  of

comprehension  of  those who  are  expected  to

apply themselves to these matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 82 accordingly disagreed to.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 83-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 83

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister wish to add

anything further?

<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have nothing

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 87 and 88 ordered to stand part of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have a postponed

clause. It is clause 4. There is an amendment

moved by the Member for Farrer

Park:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 27 and 28, to leave out "not be

deemed to be a public servant but" and insert "be

deemed to be a public servant and".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question before the Assembly was, "That the

words proposed to be left-out, be left out.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the point which

troubled  the Member for Farrer Park is  that  the

clause,  as drafted, would enable the Minister  to

appoint a Member of this Assembly. Since he  would

not be deemed to be a public servant, the argument

was  that he might continue to be a Member of  the

Assembly.  I had not paid sufficient attention  to

the  formula used, but I have since inquired  from

the  legal draftsman, and I am informed  that  the

way  in  which it was drafted would make it  quite

clear that if a Member of this Assembly should  be

appointed to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



post  of  President,  then he would  automatically

vacate  his  seat  as a Member  of  the  Assembly.

Further, the reason for the emphasis that he shall

not be deemed to be a public servant is to take it

out  of  the Public Service Commission. Otherwise,

there would be considerable argument as to whether

or  not  the appointment to this office is covered

by  the  general  provisions in  the  Constitution

which require all public officers to go before the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the only point

which  troubled  me  about this  clause  was  that

anybody  who is in Government service is a  public

officer. Anybody who is paid from the funds of the

Government  is  a  public officer.  If  the  Prime

Minister assures the House that from that point of

view  the President of the Court will continue  to

be  a  public  officer just like  the  High  Court

Judges  (High Court Judges are not public officers

for  the  purposes of only a certain part  of  the

Constitution,  but  in respect of  other  matters,

they  continue to be public officers) and  if  the

Government say that that is the intention and that

they  will  carry  it  out, then  I  have  nothing

further to add. That is the only difficulty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Farrer   Park   has,  I  think,   overlooked   the

provisions  of  the  Constitution,  where  "public

service"  includes  "service ... after   the

appointed  day ... under the Government of Singapore,

or  service as a Judge of the Supreme Court."  The

provisions of the Constitution lay down  that  all

public  offices must be filled through recruitment

through the Public Service Commission. It is  only

for  that  purpose that the Judges of the  Supreme

Court  are  deemed not to hold public office.  But

they are in the public service. We have got to  so

provide  that  the  President of  the  Arbitration

Court  is not deemed to be a public servant if  we

want   to   shut   out  the  provisions   of   the

Constitution   with  regard  to  his  recruitment;

because  clause  3 (1) of the Bill  indicates  the

manner  of  his recruitment, that is, he  will  be

appointed  by  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  after

consultation  with  the Prime  Minister.  To  give

effect to that intention, we have had to use these

words, that he "shall not be deemed to be a public

servant". That is all there is to it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish the Minister for

Labour  and  Law  would  not  try  and  pooh-pooh   my

objection, it is a very genuine objection  that  I  am

taking. According to the Constitution, a Judge is  not

a  public servant for the purposes of Part IX  of  the

Constitution.  In  every other part  he  is  a  public

servant and in the public service. Section 75  of  the

Constitution reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Except for the purposes of sections 83, 84 and 85 of

this  Order,  and  except where the context  otherwise

requires, in the interpretation of this Part  of  this

Order-".



<br><br>That  is Part IX. In so far as this Part is concerned,

the  office  of  a  Judge  of  the  Supreme  Court  is

excluded,  merely because that appointment should  not

go  to the Public Service Commission. It is only  from

that  point of view. But as drafted in this  Bill,  it

would  appear that for all purposes he is not a public

servant. Section 42 of the Constitution says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(1) Every Member of the Assembly shall cease to be a

Member  at the next dissolution of the Assembly  after

he has been elected, or previously thereto if his seat

becomes vacant under the provisions of this Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The seat of a Member shall become vacant -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) if he is appointed to or to act in any public

office;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without this section, Sir, if a Member of this House

were  appointed  to  the post of  President  of'  this

Arbitration  Court, then he would have  to  leave  the

Assembly: but with clause 4 as it stands, I am  afraid

that he need not have to resign his seat. That is as I

read it, Sir, If my reading of that is incorrect,  let

the  Minister for Labour and Law say it.  If  he  will

assure  the  House that that was not the intention  of

the  Government and that the Government  will  not  do

that,  then  I am satisfied, But I do not want  to  be

made a fool of by the Minister for Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What I have indicated to the

Member  for  Farrer Park is that the legal  draftsman,

who  is  an expert in these matters, and on  whom  the

Government must rely, has given us the assurance  that

the  clause, as drafted, would automatically cause any

Member  of the Assembly to resign his seat if he  were

appointed.  While  I myself had not gone  through  the

intricacies  of the argument, I would suggest  to  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



for  Farrer Park that whilst we can, in the  Order  in

Council,  make an exclusion in certain parts  of  that

Order in Council with respect to Judges, we cannot  in

this legislation get out of the comprehensive terms of

the  Order in Council unless we say that the President

of  the Arbitration Court is not a public servant.  To

leave  the  matter in any doubt whatsoever means  that

the over-riding provisions of the Constitution prevail

and  that the person is deemed to be a public servant,

that  this  is a public office and it must go  to  the

Public Service Commission.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, might I suggest that

<br><br>or something to that effect?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Ordinance cannot over-ride

the  over-riding  powers  of  the  provisions  of  the

Constitution by saying, "But, nevertheless,  it  shall

not  go to the Public Service Commission," because the

Constitution overrides the Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now back to

clause 2. Under the provisions of Standing Order

71(11) , which reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After all clauses and schedules have been gone

through,  any Member may, with the leave  of  the

Chairman,  move  an  amendment  to  a  clause  or

schedule   already  passed,  provided  that   the

amendment is made necessary by an amendment  made

to any other clause or schedule."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point that arose on clause 2 was on

the  definition of "trade union". The term "trade

union"  means  "a  trade  union  of  workmen   or

employers  registered under any written  law  for

the   time  being  in  force  relating   to   the

registration of trade unions." I understood  that

the  Minister wished to alter the word  "workmen"

to read "employees".



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is so. Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, line 9, to leave out "workmen" and

insert "employees".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7-

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The next point that

arose  was  on  clause 7 regarding  consequential

amendments which have been made to other clauses.

amendments standing in his name?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of motion -[10th

February, 1960]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the Bill be now read a Second time". -

[Mr Low Por Tuck].



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

aims  of  the Bill are, firstly, to enable private

investors,  commercial banks, insurance companies,

investment  trusts,  statutory  bodies  and  other

similar  financial institutions  to  invest  their

surplus  funds  in  Treasury deposit  receipts  at

attractive rates of interest for periods of two to

five  years and, secondly, the Bill will also give

the Government authority to make productive use of

funds so deposited for development purposes.  Some

of   our   financial  institutions  in  Singapore,

especially foreign incorporated institutions, hold

a fairly high proportion of their assets overseas.

For  example, banking statistics for  the  quarter

ending September, 1959, show that the net overseas

assets of commercial banks in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  was  $410.5 million, or nearly  25  per

cent  of the total assets of $1,693 million. These

financial  institutions have, in  the  past,  been

able   to  claim  that  they  hold  such  a   high

proportion  of their assets overseas by necessity,

that  there are insufficient opportunities locally

to  invest their surplus funds in short or  medium

term liquid and safe or gilt-edged securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated earlier, it is the intention of the

Treasury that a variety of such securities  should

be   available  to  investors,  whether  they  are

looking   for  short  term,  medium  or  long-term

investments. Treasury deposit receipts should meet

these  investment criteria and enable institutions

to  divert  their surplus funds invested  overseas

for  depositing  locally in such receipts.  By  so

doing,  they are killing two birds with one stone.

These  receipts  earn interest for the  depositors

and  at  least as an interim measure until longer-term monies are obtained, they also make available

funds for the economic development of the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> There are two points, Mr Speaker,

Sir, which strike me on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point, Sir, is that the Bill enables

the  Minister to fix the rates of interest and  as

you,  Mr  Speaker, know, once the Minister  fixes

the   rates  of  interest,  then  this  House   is

committed  to  the  payment  of  those  rates   of

interest  under  the Constitution and  nobody  can

query    their   payment.   In   the    particular

circumstances of this Bill, could the Minister say

whether it would be desirable to consult the House

before  he fixes the rates of interest or  whether

the  nature  of the transaction is  such  that  it

would  be undesirable to consult the House on  the

fixing of the rates of interest?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is under clause 8 (1) of the

Bill, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Treasury Deposit shall be repaid on maturity

to the holder of the Treasury Deposit Receipt...".



<br><br>And clause 8 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No Treasury Deposit shall be repaid except upon

the  surrender  of  the Treasury  Deposit  Receipt

relating  to  such  deposit to  the  Treasury  for

cancellation."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



What  would  happen to such a receipt if  it  were

lost?  Supposing the holder of a receipt  makes  a

statutory  declaration that he has lost it,  would

it  be possible for him to get payment? Or if  the

receipt is lost for good, does it mean to say that

the  holder  of that receipt will not get  payment

from  Government  even though  the  Government  is

satisfied that there has been a genuine loss?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think probably those two points

could,   with  convenience,  be  dealt   with   in

Committee.  The  hon.  Member  knows  that  having

spoken once on the Second Reading he cannot  speak

again. It would probably be better if the Minister

would answer those points in Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill-[Mr Low Por Tuck].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3-



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 4, to leave out "one hundred"

and insert "fifty".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment will enable investors to deposit

funds  in a smaller and therefore convenient  unit

of   $50,000  rather  than  the  original  sum  of

$100,000, which would be too large a sum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendment made:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 5, to leave out "one hundred"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 7stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Under both the Constitution, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  and  clause 9 of  this  Bill,  any

interest  payment is a charge on the  Consolidated

Fund  and, as you know, once an amount is  charged

to the Consolidated Fund, the Assembly will not be

able  to  raise any queries on it. Therefore,  any

rate of interest fixed by the Minister as a charge

on  the  Fund would have to be payable.  In  those

circumstances,   I  was  wondering   whether   the

Minister   would  consider  that  the   House   be

consulted  before he fixes the rates of  interest,

or  whether the nature of the transaction is  such

that it would he undesirable to consult the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I think there is a

difference  between  the  normal  loans  from  the

public,  which  are in the nature of  fixed  bonds

redeemable   at  so  many  years,   and   Treasury

deposits. The idea of Treasury deposits is to cash

in  on  surplus cash, which is available for short

periods - it might be six months, nine months or one

year.   For  that  reason,  it  is  not  possible,

technically, to ask the House to approve the rates

of   interest.   The  Minister   must   have   the

opportunity to seize the right moment to  cash  in

on  those  surplus funds at the cheapest  rate  of

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 8

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> At first sight of this clause, Sir,

it  would  appear that anybody who  has  lost  his

Treasury  deposit  receipt  could  not  be   given

payment so that if that receipt was, shall we say,

for  two  years and if at the end of 12 months  he

had  lost it and could not find it and on maturity

he  went  to  the Treasury, the Treasury  official

would  ask, "Where is your receipt?" And he  would

say, "I have lost it." The Treasury official would

say,  "I am very sorry, but under clause 8 of  the

Bill,  I cannot pay you." Is there any remedy  for

that?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, if the Member for

Farrer  Park  loses $100 in cash, I  am  sure  the

Treasury  would not make any payment to  him.  The

idea  or Treasury deposits is that they should  be

transferable  under  clause 6 by  endorsement  and

delivery.  In other words, they would be  more  or

less in the nature of currency notes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every country in Asia and Africa, which has

recently  obtained self-government,  finds  itself

confronted with the twofold problem of finding the

wherewithal to provide a formal education for  its

children  and to eliminate illiteracy amongst  the

majority  of  its  adult  population.  During  the

budget  session of this Assembly, I  outlined  the

Government's plans to deal with the first half  of

the  problem.  The  Bill before  the  Assembly  is

designed  to establish the machinery by which  the

Government  hopes  to implement  its  policies  to

tackle the second half of the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past few years, the running of adult

education classes has been largely the work of the

Singapore  Council  for Adult  Education,  a  body

established in 1950, which received exemption from

registration  under the Societies  Ordinance.  The

Council   received  an  annual  grant   from   the

Government,  which  in recent  years  amounted  to

$500,000.  Its  work has been  satisfactory  in  a

limited  way. But as I told the Annual  Conference

of the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



Council  for  Adult Education held last  December,

private and voluntary agencies, which in the  past

had  catered to the needs of education, health and

social services of all kinds, have today given way

to  much wider and more extensive state enterprise

in  these fields, not only in Singapore,  but  all

over the world. Clearly, state enterprise in these

fields   is   essential   if   the   benefits   of

civilisation  and of knowledge are  to  reach  the

greatest number of people in the shortest possible

time.  The time has now come in Singapore for  the

State  to  assume  full responsibility  for  adult

education.  This must be regarded as an inevitable

development, if adult education in our society  is

to  attain yet greater heights. A country  engaged

in  the  task  of nation building must  rally  all

forces  which  can assist in this work  under  one

banner,  so that there can be proper direction  of

policies  and utilisation of limited resources  of

finance and manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the Assembly is designed to set

up  a corporate body on which there will be strong

Government  representation  and  which  will  work

closely with the Ministry of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill is designed to establish

the  Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa, which  will

be  a corporate body to promote adult education in

Singapore.   This  Board  will   take   over   the

functions,  assets and property of  the  Singapore

Council for Adult Education. Clause 4 of this Bill

is designed to effect this. Discussions have taken

place   with  the  Singapore  Council  for   Adult

Education,  and the Council passed  the  following

resolution  at  its  38th  Meeting  held  on  23rd

December 1959:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Council for Adult Education

resolves to dissolve itself on 1st March 1960, and

hand  over  its assets to the new Statutory  Board

for  Adult Education to be appointed in  1960.  In

the  event of the Board not being appointed by the

said  date, the Council shall hand over its assets

to  the Ministry of Education to be held in  trust

by them for purposes of adult education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One property, which will pass to the new Board,

will  be the building known as the Cultural Centre

at  Fort Canning. This Centre, which has been used

by the Council as its headquarters was built on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



State  land  with  financial assistance  from  the

Colonial   Development  and  Welfare  Fund.   When

transferred,  the  Centre will  become  the  focal

point  for  use in connection with adult education

and  for  the promotion of cultural activities  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the constitution of

the  Board, which will consist of eleven  members.

The  Chairman  and  Deputy  Chairman  are  to   be

appointed  directly by the Minister for Education,

together  with  one  other  member,  while   three

members are to be appointed on the nominations  of

the  Minister for Culture, the Minister for Labour

and Law, and the Minister for Finance. Another two

members  are  to be appointed by the Minister  for

Education  on the nominations of the Trades  Union

Congress  in  Singapore, and there will  be  three

members  from the tutorial staff of the  Teachers'

Training College, the University of Malaya and the

Nanyang  University respectively. The  Board  will

therefore have strong Government representation as

well  as a leavening of professional opinion  from

the  higher seats of learning; while Trades  Union

Congress  representation  will  ensure  that   the

education of workers will not be overlooked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out the powers of the Board, the

most  important of which are to receive fees  from

students  and  contributions from  Government  and

other  sources as well as to raise funds by lawful

means.  The  Board is also empowered to administer

these  funds  and to acquire and sell movable  and

immovable  property  with  the  approval  of   the

Minister  for  Education. It is not intended  that

the  Board  should  engage  in  any  political  or

religious  activities, but the Board will  not  be

precluded  from  organising  classes,  talks   and

debates pertaining to politics or religion if this

is  considered  desirable in the public  interest.

Clause 11 is to ensure this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will not involve the expenditure of

additional public money, there being provision  in

the  1960 Estimates for half a million dollars for

the  promotion of adult education. It is pertinent

to mention here that in the 1959 grant of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



half a million dollars, the Singapore Council  for

Adult Education were conducting 549 classes with a

student  enrolment of 15,947. With the  absorption

of  these  classes by Government  this  year, the

total  number  of adult classes now  conducted  by

Government  is 1,088 with a student population  of

nearly  37,000.  In  other  words,  Government  is

already   doing  twice  as  much  work  in   adult

education than before on the same budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the creation of the new Board, it is

intended  that adult education will be brought  to

the  masses  not  only in the City  areas  but  to

kampong  folk in rural areas as well. I  wish  to.

announce  that  although it was  originally  hoped

that  the bulk of literacy classes would be  borne

by  teachers  doing  the extra half  session  work

gratis,  it has now been decided that with  effect

from Monday, 15th February, 1960, all teachers who

are required to do extra half session work outside

of  their normal schools either in the day  or  in

the  night  would be eligible for a  flat  $2  per

session   for   transport   and/or   out-of-pocket

expenses.  This will work out at roughly  $25  per

month.  As there are about 3,000 teachers involved

so far, 1,000 for night sessions and 2,000 for day

sessions, the total cost is estimated at  $750,000

per annum. Since no provision was made for this in

the  1960  Estimates, it will mean that  this  sum

will have to come out of the Education Development

Estimates, and therefore the loss of four  primary

schools  for  1961.  Needless  to  say,  the   201

voluntary  teachers from the Police Force  in  our

adult  classes  will  also  be  eligible  for  the

allowance mentioned above. It would not be fair to

leave  them out of the scheme of things or for  us

to  take  advantage of their inspiring example  to

offer  their  voluntary services in teaching  work

which   is  outside  the  scope  of  their  normal

employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning at this stage, Sir, that

undue  publicity given to the so-called strain  on

teachers in respect of extra session work  is  not

justified.  In  1959,  1,017  teachers   obtained.

permission to do additional paid employment, which

was  then  limited to six hours per week.  Despite

the imposition of extra session work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



this  year,  up  to  date  we  have  in  hand  122

applications (29 from the English stream, 38  from

the  Malay stream and 55 from the Chinese  stream)

for  additional  paid employment,  also  with  the

limit  of  six hours per week, which  we  are  now

considering. We are expecting more applications to

come, which will be duly considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is confident that the

establishment  of  the Lembaga  Gerakan  Pelajaran

Dewasa will bring about a co-ordination and  unity

of  effort towards early attainment of the  object

of   universal  literacy  in  Singapore.  May  the

illiterate  half  million,  or  one-third  of  our

population,  be  wiped out so that  suspicion  and

fear  will  be banished, and in their  place  will

come a true understanding and appreciation of  our

democratic system based on adult franchise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the history

of  education in Singapore and Malaya  shows  that

private  enterprise has very often played  a  very

great part in starting endeavours in new fields of

education,  and that the State comes  in  to  give

encouragement and help and gradually more and more

help.  Naturally,  Sir, as the one  who  pays  the

piper,  Government  wants to have  more  and  more

control. It is only natural. However, we must  not

forget that too much control can deaden the spirit

of the individual, so that if he has a new idea he

may  not be able freely to express that idea to  a

superior officer, or even if he expresses the idea

freely the officer may not be receptive enough  to

be willing to accept that suggestion and that idea

becomes still-born.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister for Education himself has

had  experience  sitting in  the  Council  of  the

University as an unofficial member. He  must  have

seen how Government official nominees were working

under  a  great  handicap,  and  that  very  often

revolutionary suggestions had to come  from  these

so-called unofficial nominees. Therefore, Sir,  we

felt when we read the Bill that the composition of

the Board is too heavily weighted on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



side of Government appointees. Even in the case of

the  members  who  represent  the  University   of

Nanyang and the University of Malaya, they are  to

be  appointed  by  the  Minister  from  among  the

tutorial staff of these institutions. It does  not

say  here that the members are to be appointed  by

the  Minister on the nomination of the University.

The  public  will thus think that those  appointed

are  just  part  of the Government  rubber  stamp.

That,  Sir,  would make the Board less respectable

in appearance in the eyes of the public.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>   [Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel, Sir, that in order that the Board might

have  the support of all those interested in adult

education and are willing to help in it, it should

be  so composed that at least half the members  of

the  Board  should  be freely elected  by  outside

organisations  interested  in  the   project.   My

suggestion  would be along these lines:  that  the

Minister for Education could appoint the first two

members,  and the various Ministers could  appoint

as  stated  here,  one each. In the  case  of  the

Teachers' Training College, if it is regarded as a

purely  Government  institution,  of  course   the

appointment  may have to be made by the  Minister.

But  if  it  is regarded as not quite a Government

department,  then  the  tutorial  staff  could  be

allowed   to  nominate  and  the  Minister   could

appoint.  But  in the case of representation  from

the  University of Malaya, the Nanyang  University

and  the Trades Union Congress, I definitely think

that nominations should come from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice there is no reference made to

unions,  such as the Singapore Teachers' Union.  I

take  it  that  it  is  implied  that  the  T.U.C.

representation   should   include   a    teachers'

representative.  But  unless specified,  it  could

well mean that in the operation of this Bill,  the

T.U.C. might not want to appoint teachers who  are

respected  or  who  have  the  support   of   the

Teachers'   Union.  In  that  case   then,   those

representatives will not be able to  give  to  the

Board the views of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



the teaching body in Singapore. We believe that if

adult  education classes are to function properly,

the  teachers  who have to play a  most  important

part  should have a say, a good say, in the Board.

So if the Teachers' Union or any national union of

teachers  recognised by the teachers in  Singapore

is  not  represented, then, Sir, the Minister  and

the  Board would not be able to hear what goes  on

at the ground level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the greatest admiration for the

Minister  for  his great energy. I know  he  works

long hours: but not all people can work as hard as

he  does. It has now come into the open that  many

teachers  cannot  stand the  strain.  The  Chinese

Schools' Conference apparently held a meeting  and

they wished to petition the Minister to allow them

to invite donations from parents to enable them to

secure  the services of those unemployed  teachers

to  teach  and thereby prevent some of  them  from

having   a   breakdown.  Sir,  this  is   not   an

exaggeration. We have lost teachers  who,  because

they cannot stand the strain, in addition to a six-day  week,  of having to teach in adult  education

classes, have tendered their resignations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We welcome the Minister's offer to pay transport

expenses  to  those teachers who  teach  in  these

evening classes. But we would be glad also  if  he

could  give an assurance that there should  be  no

compulsion in the case of those teachers  who  are

unable  to bear the strain, and on medical grounds

ask  to be excused from performing the extra hours

per week. Sir, in implementing the principle which

he  has  stated,  maybe  not  in  this  House  but

outside,  that these 4� hours include  extra-mural

duties,  sometimes  one  branch  official  or  one

official in one section, not knowing the needs  of

another branch, allocates to certain teachers  the

full quota. If these teachers are already involved

in  important  duties  in organisations  like  the

scouts  organisation, then they find they  are  on

the  horns of a dilemma. If they do the 4�  hours,

they  have  to give up their duties in the  scouts

organisation. If they do not do the 4� hours, they

would be regarded as negligent or showing a spirit

of  insubordination. The result, Sir, is  that  in

sports work in the schools these teachers have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



not  been able to find the time. We are told  that

for  certain sports activities, they could  deduct

one  hour;  so  the head masters in  one  district

studying the question say, "It is impossible." Let

us  take  the case of football and ask the teacher

to  devote that one-hour per week to it.  But  the

preparation  and training of the students,  taking

them  out to the match, watching them through  the

match,  and after that again giving them  tips  on

how  they could improve themselves, take more than

one  hour a week. I hope the Minister will go into

the  details if they are asking too much, but this

is one of the causes which have made many teachers

feel  that  the burden is becoming too  great  for

them.  I would not say all of them, because  there

are  some  of us who, for the sake of the country,

are  willing to work all out. But there  are  many

who  definitely  cannot stand the strain.  If  the

Teachers'  Union  were  well  represented,   those

members on the Board could express their views and

be  able  to plan a programme so that the teachers

who  do teach in these classes will be able to  do

so   physically  fit  and  also,  you  might  say,

emotionally at one.



<br><br>4.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know what

views to express to the Minister concerned.  I  do

not  wish  to  bring allegations.  However,  I  am

prepared to be accused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we study this Bill, in my opinion, it can be

said  to  be  discriminatory. The  composition  of

members of the Board provided in this Bill is  not

reasonable.  However,  I hope  there  will  be  an

opportunity  for  the Minister  for  Education  to

reconsider  this  point, which I  think,  is  very

important. I believe this is not the way to  bring

about  unity  or  to achieve the building  of  one

nation,  one language, one State, because  in  the

provisions of this Bill there are bound to be slip-ups or oversights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay Education Council has not been

mentioned anywhere in the Bill at all, if we  want

to educate half a million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



of  our  population who are illiterate, I  believe

that  a  representative  of  the  Malay  Education

Council  should sit on the Board. He  can  express

his views and work together with other members  of

the  Board. There is in the Bill opportunity given

to  the Trades Union Congress representation,  but

the  opportunity is denied to the Malay  Education

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome

what  has  been  announced  by  the  Minister  for

Education  this afternoon that a  fee  of  $2  per

session  will  be  paid to those  who  work  extra

hours, and also to members of the Police Force who

have volunteered to teach in night classes. It  is

proper  that the fees be paid to them, because  of

all  the  trouble they take. However, I hope  that

the  Minister  for Education would  consider  such

payments  retrospective  to  the  time  the  extra

sessions  began.  It will then show  the  definite

stand of the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I neither wish to support the previous-Government nor pay tribute to the present

Government,  but I feel that it is-not  surprising

that  being a self-governing State, we should  all

work  and  achieve results two-fold.  I  hope  the

Ministry of Education or the Board will work  even

harder  than those in the past. But I do not  mean

to  say that I do not agree with the work that has

been  carried  out by Government. We should  adopt

the motto "Talk less, work more". Therefore, I  do

not expect that full results will be achieved, but

it must nevertheless be achieved in the true sense

of the word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of what I have said, I plead with the

Minister  for Education to give an opportunity  to

the  Malay Education Council to be represented  on

the Board. That is all, Mr Deputy Speaker.

<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

from  the 1st of March 1960, the Singapore Council

for  Adult  Education will cease to exist,  and  a

statutory  board will be set up to take  over  the

assets  and  property  and the  functions  of  the

Council  consequently. While  realising  the  fact

that  the  achievements of the Council  for  Adult

Education cannot and should not be measured with a

yardstick  with  what similar  organisations  have

done  elsewhere in their work, it is necessary  to

state  that the scope and extent of its  functions

have  been  limited. It is a  fact,  as  has  been

stressed  by those responsible for adult education

hereto,  that  lack  of funds  had  prevented  the

Council  and  other  voluntary organisations  from

making  the  literacy campaign large and  wide  to

extend  to all organisations and institutions  for

the  masses,  to  provide adequate facilities  and

conditions for the requirements and furtherance of

knowledge  of  the educationally under-privileged.

This has been one of the factors, and perhaps  the

most  important factor. But apart from this,  lack

of  self-sacrifice for the organising and teaching

of  literary classes has also contributed  to  the

limitation.  Aided  by  an indifferent  Government

with  an  incompetent Minister whose interest  lay

elsewhere, perhaps far, far away in the tin  mines

of Perak, this made matters much worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council, gathering from its final report,

had roughly on the 30th September, 1959, just over

560  basic  literacy classes. They were  known  as

basic  education classes with student strength  of

about  15,000. In any case, not more than  17,000.

Sir,  in  an  island  of one and  a  half  million

people,  where  roughly  about  50  per  cent  are

adults, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>





evident  that  this  student  strength  does   not

represent   even  a  sizeable  proportion.   These

figures  are  what were officially  known  to  the

Council  and they therefore appear in the records.

But  it has been clearly known to people who  have

been  associated  with  adult  classes,  in  their

organisation and function, that in numerous  cases

the  strength of the classes was not what  it  was

recorded  to  be. For example, if the teacher  had

about  10  regular  students  in  his  class,  his

register  had  been  found  to  show  an   average

attendance of about 30 students. I do not say that

that  was the case with all teachers in all  adult

education classes. But there have been cases.  The

significance  of  this is clear.  If - and  we  know

that - teachers were paid $7.50 per hour,  and  they

taught  a  class with a minimum number of students

as  stipulated  by  the Council or  its  affiliate

organisations, it became imperative that they,  at

least on paper, had to maintain a class above  the

minimum  strength required, otherwise  they  would

have  to lose their $7.50 as their class might  be

dissolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further elaborate on this, I must say that

when  the  Ad  hoc  Committee on  Adult  Education

appointed by the Ministry took over the management

of the S.C.A. night classes, it was found in quite

a  few  cases  that the student strength  was  far

below what it was officially recorded to be.  Sir,

there is no need for me to explain in great detail

why  it  is necessary for the Government  to  take

over   and  unify  the  running  of  the  literacy

classes,  because I am sure that  the  Government,

particularly   the  Ministry  of  Education,   has

expounded on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will suffice if I say that if we are

seriously  to put into effect the drive  for  mass

education and mass literacy, then it is absolutely

necessary that the planning, the organisation  and

the  implementation of these classes must not  and

should  not  be  entirely left  in  the  hands  of

voluntary  organisations. This does not mean  that

the  Government  does not recognise  the  valuable

work  that  has been initiated and  done  by  such

organisations. What I do mean is that, in addition

to unifying the system of teaching



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



adults,   it  is  necessary  to  have  the   whole

machinery   of   the  State  fully   backing   the

objectives.  Just now, when the  hon.  Member  for

Tanglin  was  speaking, I gathered the  impression

that  he was afraid that if the Government  is  to

take  over  the running of these classes,  it  may

limit the scope of spreading literacy, and tie the

hands  of  people  who  are  responsible  for  the

management  of the literacy classes. But,  Sir,  I

think  to  the  contrary. If you  want  the  night

classes  to be effective, if you want our campaign

to  provide  facilities sincerely and honestly  to

the bulk of the people who are educationally under-privileged, then it is an absolute must  that  the

Government   throw  its  weight  behind   anybody.

instead  of  the  Government just  supporting  the

Council  of  Adult  Education,  I  think   it   is

imperative that the Government should seek  to  do

what it is seeking to do by this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps this is the

appropriate   moment   to  examine   the   popular

conception  of adult education here  in  Singapore

with  that  of  adult education  organisations  in

other  parts  of  the world, and  to  examine  the

existing  conception of adult education  with  the

objectives  of  a Party that is dedicated  to  the

cause  of the masses. In Singapore, Sir, our adult

education  has  actually meant, at least  so  far,

providing facilities for basic education.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member gives the

distinct impression that he is reading his speech.

I  know that he is not. But the impression  he  is

creating  in my mind and perhaps in the  minds  of

other  hon.  Members is that  he  is  reading  his

speech.  Perhaps he could refrain from lifting  up

his  file,  which  makes  it  appear  that  he  is

reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> As a matter of fact, Sir, I was not

reading.  As I was saying, in Singapore, at  least

up  to now, adult education has meant the teaching

of  languages - basic education. If one goes  around

to the various centres, one will find the teaching

of A, B, C in the various languages. One will find

men and women learning to speak, learning to write

and learning to read the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



languages. But in other parts of the world, things

are  quite different. In countries like India  and

Indonesia, for instance, besides what is popularly

known  as  workers'  education,  they  have   mass

literacy  classes  spreading far  and  wide;  they

extend  to  all the institutions of the  masses - to

the farms and to the slums. Workers' education  as

such  is  perhaps not as wide as it  is  in  those

countries, which I am about to name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries, which are highly industrialised

and  developed,  like those in  Europe,  the  term

"workers' education" has a historical distinction.

Whatever workers' education is interpreted to  be,

it has often been debated, and it has been a point

that  is still in dispute. Various countries  have

got  various  interpretations for the  meaning  of

"workers' education".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to define in one way or

another  what actually workers' education is.  But

what I do intend to point out is this. Quite apart

from  just  teaching the A, B, C  of  the  various

languages,   in   countries   like   Denmark,   in

Scandinavia   and  other  countries   in   Europe,

workers'  education has meant providing facilities

for professional training. They provide facilities

to  enable the workers to attend work in their own

organisations,  and  to  be  able  to  carry   out

effective  functions  in  organisations  like  the

trade  unions and other societies. But  I  am  not

here to elaborate on what workers' education is. I

am  not  suggesting  that in Singapore  we  should

disregard the literacy classes, and start teaching

technical subjects to workers in classes organised

by  the  trade  unions and by the Government.  But

what I do say is that a start must be made in this

direction,  as a start has already been  made:  in

countries like India and Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, as I have said, it is true that

basic education classes are necessary for the time

being,  because without basic literacy, you  could

not  provide  technical education to  improve  the

professional knowledge of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education is first and foremost the

transmission  and  acquisition  of  language.   It

should  be  our  purpose  to  enable  students  to

acquire  comparatively complete knowledge and  not

incomplete



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



knowledge. The education must provide an all-round

development  and be the medium of producing  fully

developed  human beings. Facilities and conditions

must  be  provided  for  the educationally  under-privileged  in Singapore with this in  mind.  Just

because  adults are grown-ups. I think  we  should

not disregard this fundamental requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to state that if and when

the  Board  is  instituted and starts functioning,

the  success  of  the literacy campaign  will  not

entirely  depend  on the Board. To  a  very  large

extent,  the voluntary organisations, the cultural

bodies, the various associations will have to play

their part in contributing to the substance of the

drive.  Especially  in  the  initial  stages,  the

devotion and dedication of the teachers will be  a

must.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, until recently, teachers of adult classes,

as  I  have said earlier, received $7.50 per hour,

and   more  often  than  not,  the  incentive  for

teaching  adult  classes had  been  the  lucrative

conditions  that  prevailed.  Under  the   present

circumstances,  it  is  extremely  necessary  that

teachers  should  come  forward  with  a  national

consciousness  and  self-sacrificing  attitude  in

trying to aid the Government to make this campaign

for  mass  literacy a success, and to  help  their

brethren  by providing and teaching languages  and

the   rest   in  order  to  achieve  the  ultimate

objectives of the campaign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the most important factor for the

true  transformation of a society, and  therefore,

at  this  stage in Singapore, it is  completely  a

necessity that there should be every force  turned

and united to bring about a revival of our greater

values and our educational values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would end by saying this. Although the

teachers  may be missing the $7.50 very badly,  it

must  be  brought to their minds that what  is  at

stake  is  the  national interest - an interest  far

above the financial interests of the teachers as a

whole.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I appreciate the  Government's

effort  to improve and unify the system  of  adult

education.  However, the community's  contribution

towards the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



promotion  and improvement of adult  education  in

the  country  is  valuable, and  that  is  why  my

colleague,  the Member for Tanglin, has  advocated

that  the  Board should not be too  heavy  on  the

Government  side, but should be as  representative

as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is all very well for the

Government  authorities to work out a  formula  on

the  number of hours of teachers' work. But  as  I

have always tried to impress upon the Minister for

Education,  it  is  the  implementation  and   the

practice of it that is the most important, because

in  practice, it is not always what it appears  to

be  on  paper. I will give one example. A  teacher

who  is  supposed  to  do an  extra  hour  in  the

afternoon  actually does two hours,  if  not  more

because  it takes half an hour to go and  half  an

hour  to come back. Therefore, it takes two  hours

of  his  time,  and sometimes one hour  of  travel

takes  more  out of him than one hour's  teaching,

especially  if there is a traffic jam. The  reason

why we want the Board to be representative is that

people who have gone through the mill are the best

people  to draw up this formula. The Minister  has

indicated  just  now  that  the  publicity   given

concerning  the strain on the teachers  caused  by

the  imposition  of these extra hours  is  grossly

exaggerated. He has quoted as proof  of  this  the

number of teachers that were doing extra paid jobs

last  year and this year. It must be pointed  out,

however, that in the instances quoted, it was open

to the teachers to choose, and it was the teachers

who can stand the strain who applied for the extra

hours  of  work. Not everybody is capable  of  the

same  amount of work. There are some who are  full

of energy and for whom the number of normal hours'

work  was  not sufficient, and they wanted  to  do

more.  There  are  others who did  it  because  of

financial pressure. If I remember right, the  fact

that  about  one-tenth of the number  of  teachers

applied  for permission to do extra teaching  this

year as compared with that of last year shows that

the strain is telling on them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister for Education will take

a serious view of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



this  matter.  He  is going to offer  a  transport

allowance. But, nevertheless, I would say that  if

it  is possible for him not to make it compulsory,

probably  some  teachers who could not  stand  the

strain may not apply for the extra allowance to do

the extra job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has mentioned that a

necessary  quality of a teacher is  dedication  to

his or her job. It is very true, and one cannot be

dedicated to his or her job when one is forced  to

do what one feels is more than humanly possible in

his or her particular case.

of  the  story of the Polish patriot. When he  was

asked  to write an essay on an elephant, he  began

by  saying:  "Now, let us start  with  the  Polish

question."  Similarly with the  Members  opposite.

This  is a Bill dealing with the problem of  adult

education,   and  we  have  had  very   passionate

discourses on overworked teachers and back pay for

teachers, which have nothing to do with this Bill.

I  therefore  feel that perhaps -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nobody said this!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Member opposite did not

listen  to  the  speeches of  his  colleagues.  He

probably focused his attention on what happened op

this  side of the Bench. But there was a plea made

for back-pay. I feel that it would, therefore,  be

appropriate to draw the attention of this House to

the importance and purpose of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is, as the Minister for

Education  has indicated earlier, that  there  are

about  half  a million illiterates. I  would  say,

Sir,  in  view  of the fact that we have  accepted

Malay  as the national language, perhaps the  term

"illiterate"  should be extended to include  those

persons  who  have  not become proficient  in  the

national  language, and today, there  are  half  a

million  illiterates. It would be most  unwise  to

let  them  remain illiterate, in view of the  fact

that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



have   now   ventured  into  this  new   political

experiment of having a Government elected  by  the

people. So if you are going to have half a million

illiterates  - although that does  not  necessarily

mean  that  they  have no political  wisdom  - then

certainly if you provide them with the opportunity

to  be  able to make political decisions to  elect

candidates  from  time  to time,  perhaps  with  a

greater  increase in literacy, there will be  more

Members  on  this side of the House  than  on  the

other  side. But if it is necessary for  democracy

to  function  efficiently, then we should  provide

people  with the means of acquiring the  necessary

knowledge  to  be  able to choose  wisely  and  to

ensure that democracy succeeds. That is one of the

purposes of this Bill, and to that extent it is an

important  Bill; because if we do not educate  the

half  million  illiterate people in this  country,

then  we  are  going to weaken the  foundation  of

democracy. It is not only a question of  educating

them.  The  illiterates must  also  include  those

adults  who  terminate their education  once  they

leave  school.  It  is a fallacy often  propagated

that because a person has been to school for 15 or

16  years  of  his  life, he  will,  once  he  has

finished  his schooling, remain a literate  person

for  the  rest  of  his life. Literacy  should  be

something going all the time. People should always

be  learning, especially in a complex society like

ours  where knowledge is advancing and the  issues

become  more  complex. It is necessary  that  even

those who have had the benefit of education should

be  continually educated, and one of the functions

of  adult education would also be to enable people

who  have  left  school  to  keep  up  with  their

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points, which was stressed, by one of

the  Members opposite was that there is not enough

representation   for  teachers.   Another   Member

indicated  that  there was no  representation  for

this  or  that  community. Obviously,  Sir,  every

community   group - from  bricklayers  to   mothers,

artists  and  musicians - can  make  claims  to   be

represented on this Council. But obviously we have

to   draw  the  line  somewhere  as  far  as   the

composition of the Board is concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



We  have to choose a limited number of people, and

obviously  a great many will have to be left  out.

But  that does not preclude, for example, teachers

from  participating in the work of  this  Council,

because   there   will  be  various  opportunities

afforded to them to help in the work of the  Adult

Education Council. Therefore, the claim that  this

group  or  that  group is not represented  on  the

Council is one, which can be made by any body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the claim that Government will be more

than well represented on the Board, may I draw the

attention  of Members opposite that, if they  look

back   to  the  history  of  the  adult  education

movement  in Singapore during the last  10  years,

they  might  have had occasion to read stories  of

some  peculiar  goings-on in the  field  of  adult

education?  There  were  investigations  into  the

accounts   of   adult   education   organisations.

Certainly when you are dealing with half a million

dollars which the Government is paying out, it  is

necessary  for  the  Government,  because  of  the

importance   of   the  work  of  providing   adult

education,  and  in view of the  past  (I  am  not

referring to what has happened in the recent past,

but  to  the  early  days of the  Adult  Education

Council when money obviously was treated in a very

cavalier fashion and was never accounted  for)  to

have  a  tighter control over this Board.  But  if

members of the public, whether they be teachers or

musicians  or  artists or the Member for  Tanglin,

wish  to  contribute to the work of  the  Council,

there  is  nothing to prevent them from doing  so,

and  certainly  there is nothing  to  prevent  the

Minister from inviting them to participate in  the

work of this Council.



<br><br>6.05 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, while debating this Lembaga

Gerakan  Pelajaran Dewasa Bill, which  is  a  very

important Bill for adults if they wish  to  get  a

proper  education, we may recall that in the  past

no  progress could be seen in adults who  received

their education through the Singapore Council  for

Adult  Education. Since the progress  achieved  by

the Singapore Adult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



Education Council was negligible; the Ministry  of

Education   under  the  present   Government   has

therefore  laid  emphasis on giving  education  to

adults.  With  this aim in view, the  Ministry  is

introducing this important Bill, which is  one  of

the  means  whereby education for  adults  can  be

provided. At the moment, there are adults who  are

in  need of education. I can say that every active

labour  organisation is running adult classes  for

the purpose of providing education to its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, while debating this Bill, the Member for Kampong Kembangan initially argued that

he  did  not  know how to debate it. He  continued

further  by  saying that it is a  Bill  for  which

credit  could be given but that he regretted  that

in clause 5, there is an element of discrimination

because  the  Malay  Education  Council   is   not

represented. Mr Speaker, as far as  I  know,  the

Malay  Education Council (and I believe the Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan is a member of  the  Malay

Education  Council)  has  no  interest  in  giving

education  to adults. The Malay Education  Council

concentrates  only  on Malay  education  in  Malay

schools. Under the circumstances, Mr Speaker,  it

is not true to say that the Minister for Education

is  treating  the  Malay Education  Council  as  a

stepson.  The  Malay Education  Council  has  been

invited. There is a representative from the  Malay

Education  Council who sits on the Malay Education

Committee of the Ministry of Education.  There  is

also one member who sits on the Education Advisory

Council.  Quite recently, Mr Speaker, the  Member

for  Kampong  Kembangan referred to an appointment

to   replace  an  outgoing  member  in  the  Malay

Education  Committee suggesting  that  the  person

should sit on the Malay Advisory Council as  well,

because  the  other  member  had  left  for  Kuala

Lumpur.  On account of the fact that the  Minister

for  Education had given his full attention to the

Malay  Education  Council, this  matter  was  left

entirely  to the discretion of the Malay Education

Council  to  appoint  a suitable  nominee  to  the

composition of the Malay Education Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Board is to provide education

for  adults. Its composition is fitting and proper

because   the   Teachers'  Training   College   in

Singapore  provides education  for  teachers;  the

Nanyang  University and the University  of  Malaya

are also institutions, which provide education for

adults;  and  there  are two members  representing

trade  unions.  I  mentioned  earlier  that  every

active  trade  union  is running  adult  education

classes  for  its  members.  The  appointment   is

therefore proper, Mr Speaker. The accusation  was

levelled by the Member for Kampong Kembangan  that

as the Malay Education Council is not mentioned he

considered  that  this  was  treating  the   Malay

Education Council like a stepson. In the report of

the  Malay Education Council, there is no  mention

whatsoever  of its object for giving education  to

adults.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> On a point of

explanation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi:</b> Afterwards, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Did the Member say afterwards?

Afterwards may be too late.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Yes,

Sir.  The  memorandum  from  the  Malay  Education

Council sent to the Minister for Education in 1957

made  no  mention  of adult education.  The  Malay

Education Council concerned itself only with Malay

education  in  Malay  schools.  The  Minister  for

Education   has   given  an  opportunity   for   a

representative of the Malay Education  Council  to

sit on the Education Advisory Council and also  to

sit  on  the  Malay  Education Committee.  If  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan fears that the Malays

are not represented on this Board, this is because

he  has  not made a thorough investigation.  Among

the  representatives of trade unions, there are  a

number  of Malays who are actively taking part  in

conducting Malay classes. These members  are  well

versed in the Malay language. I believe the former

teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



also  teach  in these special classes run  by  the

trade unions. I know that the T.U.C. will nominate

suitable persons to represent the workers  in  the

Lembaga Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa. I hope that with

the enactment of this Bill, the Member for Kampong

Kembangan   will   not  have   fears   about   the

composition of the Board.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I believe nobody

who is of sound mind will say that this Bill is no

good, or that its objects are bad, because we  all

know the importance of knowledge and education  to

the  people as a whole. Therefore, I rise  to  say

that  the aim of the Government is good. I  am  of

sound mind and I know the meaning of education and

the   value  of  knowledge  to  society.  We  have

listened  to many speeches made by the  Government

side   comparing  the  work  done  by   the   past

Government  with the present Government's  efforts

to  unify  the education system so as to inculcate

into   the   people  of  Singapore  a   sense   of

responsibility  towards  the  State  through   the

medium of education and knowledge, which they have

gained. But we must not forget, Mr Speaker,  that

these  efforts  require  a  tremendous  amount  of

manpower  and  entail sacrifices, especially  from

the  Government side and from those who have  been

entrusted with the task of implementing this Bill.

They must have a full sense of responsibility  and

a  love for the work, which they are doing, in the

interests of the State of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been said by the Opposition Bench is

that  persons who will be assigned to  fulfil  the

tasks  must also be given opportunities to express

their  opinions,  which  will  be  useful  to  the

Government.  In  clause 5, on the composition  and

constitution  of  the  Board,  the  Government  is

concerned about the administration and expenditure

of moneys. This Government need have no fear about

this.  This  is  not an essential  factor  of  our

criticism. It can be said that, on the whole,  the

appointments are all agreed to by the  Government.

What  I  mean is that no nominee can sit  on  this

Board  without the sanction of the Government.  If

we need the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



co-operation of those who will be responsible for

implementing  the policy of the  Lembaga  Gerakan

Pelajaran Dewasa, then I feel, Mr Speaker,  that

work  through pressure or coercion will not bring

about  the  desired results, unlike  the  results

that  could  be achieved from persons who  fulfil

their  task with a sense of dedication  to  their

job  and  a sense of self-sacrifice. Such  people

are prepared not only to work for eight hours but

they  are prepared to work longer and, therefore,

they  must  be  given an opportunity  to  express

their views on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reverting to what the Member for Ulu Pandan has

said  on  the  Malay Education  Council,  and  as

mentioned  earlier  by  the  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan,  Mr  Speaker, I am  afraid  that  the

Member for Ulu Pandan himself does not know  what

the  Malay  Education Council is. Indirectly  the

Malay  Education  Council  does  not  merely  lay

emphasis  on  Malay education. But  from  what  I

know,  it  has  affiliate  bodies  of  about   30

associations.  They  form  the  Malay   Education

Council for the purpose of Malay education. There

must  be  some  connection in the work  they  are

doing  with  the  Board, which  is  going  to  be

initiated   by   the   Government.   Surely   the

Government will also include Malay as a  subject.

It  is  essential, therefore, that  the  Council,

which  is  recognised by many  Malay  educational

bodies, should be given an opportunity to express

its  views concerning the implementation of  this

Bill.



<br><br>6.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I should

like  to answer the Member for Tanglin who  fears

that  the  proposed composition of the Board  for

Adult  Education  and the taking  over  of  adult

education  by the Government through a  statutory

Board   might  stifle  the  efforts  of   private

enterprise.  One  would  have  thought  that  the

manner  in  which Government has been  conducting

its  affairs  would  have been sufficient  answer

that such fears are unjustified and that, if any,

the  Government is afraid that when it  comes  to

work there will not be enough people around to do

the hard work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members of the Opposition have raised

the  point that the Board, as proposed,  has  too

heavy    a   Governmental   representation.    My

colleague, the Minister for Culture, has  already

indicated  that  some years ago the  public  were

shocked  at  the  report  that  was  released  on

investigations into funds which were  handled  by

the   then   Council  for  Adult  Education,   My

colleague,  the  Member  for  Thomson,  has  also

disclosed   certain   facts   that   records   of

attendances in classes for 30 or 40 students  had

actually  10 students. It is, I think,  essential

that  the  Government should ensure  that  public

funds are properly spent and accounted for.  This

Adult Education Board, when established, would, I

think, be handling funds to the tune of a million

dollars,  for besides the half a million  dollars

which  the Government would grant to this  Board,

it would also be in receipt of fees which, on the

present enrolment of 40,000 at $1 a month,  would

be  $480,000  a year. So I think it is  essential

that  the  Board  should have  reasonably  enough

Governmental  representation to ensure  that  the

Government's   policy  on  adult   education   is

properly conducted and that sufficient care would

be  taken to ensure that the classes are properly

held.  As  you  can see from the clauses  in  the

Bill,  there would be properly audited  accounts,

copies  of  which  would  be  presented  to  this

Assembly for their information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the criticism that there is no

representative  of the teachers'  unions  on  the

Board,  I  expect  that  teachers'  unions  would

ultimately come within the purview of the  Trades

Union    Congress   and   that   the    teachers'

representative  would  then  come  through   that

nomination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Ulu Pandan, has

already answered the Member for Kampong Kembangan

as  to  why the proposed Bill does not include  a

representative from the Malay Education  Council.

I  am  only  sorry  that the Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan should consider it discriminatory  just

because there is no representative from the Malay

Education  Council.  I  suppose  if  there  is  a

representative from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



the  Council then it is not discriminatory.  I  am

afraid  I am not inclined to follow that  line  of

argument.  The  Member for Kampong Kembangan  also

asked about back pay. It is not the policy of this

Government  to  talk  in terms  of  back  pay.  My

announcement this afternoon did indicate that from

Monday onwards, which is only about 48 hours  from

now,  all  so-called volunteers will be reimbursed

at  the rate of $2 per session. I think it is  not

too  long  a  time  for  them  to  wait  for  this

transport allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Member for Tanglin and the Member for

Mountbatten  raised the question of  hardship  and

strain on the part of teachers in respect of extra

session  work. I think the Member for the Southern

Islands  also mentioned that coercion or  pressure

would not bring about the desired results. If  the

Government could be confident that teachers  would

volunteer  in their thousands to do  the  work  of

adult   education,  then  I  am  sure   that   the

Government would be prepared to forget the idea of

the extra session work and let the work be done by

voluntary  teachers. But let us be realistic.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I have already mentioned  that  we

have  an  illiterate population of half a  million

people  and that, despite the fact that Government

is  now conducting classes for 40,000, we are only

scratching  the surface. We are not even  handling

ten  per cent of what we intend to handle.  As  an

example  of  the nature of voluntary work,  may  I

refer to the call for blood donors started by  the

Ministry   of  Health?  The  call  was  made   for

volunteers   to  donate  blood.   I   was   rather

disappointed when the final returns came to  hand,

because  out  of  the  10,000 teachers,  only  741

volunteered. If we call for volunteers  for  adult

education and other aspects of education  and  the

same  result should come to pass, then I am afraid

that  our illiterate population in Singapore  will

remain as it is five years from now. I agree  that

in  the matter of implementation, hardships may be

caused  but  these  are  details  which  could  be

arranged.   If  names  of  teachers   in   schools

responsible for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



despatch of teachers miles out could be mentioned,

surely the Ministry of Education and its officials

are not that irresponsible in that they refuse  to

see  reason or to discuss the matter. If,  as  the

Member for Tanglin suggested, certain teachers are

not  sufficiently strong to stand  the  strain  of

extra  sessions and would be so medically advised,

surely  the Ministry of Education is not going  to

ignore the medical certificates to that effect and

exempt  the particular teachers when even  in  the

course  of  their  ordinary  duty  they  are   not

supposed  to  teach  in schools  if  they  produce

medical certificates. I would have hoped that  the

Members  for  Tanglin  and  Mountbatten,  as   ex-teachers  or as people who are so much  interested

in  education, would appreciate the problems  that

face  this Government; but we welcome constructive

criticisms  from  them, who  are  Members  of  the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the strain on teachers, the Member for

Mountbatten,   I   am  afraid,   has   ungallantly

misquoted  me  when she says that I stated  in  my

speech  that the publicity given to the strain  on

teachers was grossly unjustified (I took  it  down

exactly  as  she stated it). What  I  said  in  my

speech was that undue publicity was not justified,

and I am afraid she has introduced words, which  I

have not used. If, instead of beating the big drum

about  the strain on teachers, the Members of  the

Opposition would see the problem as it  faces  the

Government, and our endeavours to do what  we  can

to  make Singapore a shining example in the  whole

of  South-East Asia, they will then appreciate why

it  is necessary to call upon teachers to do their

little bit for their country. In this respect, the

speeches  made by the Member for Kampong Kembangan

and  the Member for the Southern Islands strike  a

different  tone. The first Member said that  there

should  be  less  talk and more work.  The  second

Member   also  spoke  about  sacrifices  for   the

country.  That is exactly what we are asking  for.

In  nation building, one does not relax in a chair

and  let  others do the work. Let us, by  example,

show what we can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



contribute to the well-being of the country. I say

that  those who are fortunate enough to have  been

educated  have  a  greater responsibility  to  the

country,  and  especially to those who  have  been

denied  the opportunity of education and  who  are

blind  to  all  the wonders which  literature  can

offer.  Therefore, I say that the burden of nation

building is greater for teachers and I hope - we all

hope -   that  they  will be able  to  rise  to  the

occasion.

<div align="center"><b>PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>6.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prevention of Corruption Bill is in keeping

with  the new Government's determination to  stamp

out   bribery  and  corruption  in  the   country,

especially  in the public services. The Government

is  deeply  conscious  that  a  Government  cannot

survive,   no  matter  how  good  its   aims   and

intentions are, if corruption exists in its  ranks

and  its  public services on which it  depends  to

provide the efficient and effective administrative

machinery to translate its policies into action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have only to look at post-war Asia to realise

how  evil and damaging the scourge can be.  K.M.T.

China   collapsed  principally  because   of   the

demoralising influence of bribery and  corruption.

The collapse of constitutional governments and the

chaos  and  confusion  in  certain  of  the  newly

independent  countries  in  South-East   Asia   is

largely  a  result of the prevalence of corruption

in  the  governments. No country in the  resurgent

Asia  can  survive if the political leadership  is

corrupt;  much  less, if corruption  has  corroded

into  the roots of the public service as well.  It

is  of  interest  to note that in  post-war  Asia,

where  the  public service in a country  has  been

undermined and demoralised by corruption, the rule

of  dictatorship follows inevitably. If we do  not

wish  to  see  the same pattern being repeated  in

this country, then adequate power must be given to

deal effectively with the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigour and the clean leadership of the

P.A.P. makes possible the elimination of the evils

of  corruption. The clean record of the P.A.P. in

the  last City Council was a striking contrast  to

that  corrupt  old regime under the leadership  of

the  Member for Farrer Park and had won  all-round

acclaim from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government has, during the first eight

months of its period of office, given ample  proof

of  its  dedication  of purpose,  its  honesty  of

action and its abhorrence of corruption. Its civil

service  is on the whole a well-trained, efficient

and  honest one and compares favourably  in  these

respects  with  those of other countries  in  this

part of the world. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



it would be dishonest to deny that corruption does

not  exist  and  that  there  is  no  problem   of

corruption in the public services. Although it may

not  be  so  rife  as to create public  alarm  and

despondency,   yet  it  nevertheless   calls   for

unceasing  vigilance  and  all  possible  remedial

measures. Corruption on the part, of some must not

be  allowed to smirch the good name of the present

Government  and the large majority  of  its  civil

servants. Therefore, this Government is determined

to  take  all  possible  steps  to  see  that  all

necessary legislative and administrative  measures

are   taken   to   reduce  the  opportunities   of

corruption,  to make its detection easier  and  to

deter   and   punish  severely   those   who   are

susceptible to it and engage in it shamelessly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this Bill, the Government is

asking  for new and wider powers to fight  bribery

and  corruption.  As  stated  in  the  Explanatory

Statement,  the object of this Bill is to  provide

for the more effective prevention of corruption by

remedying  various  weaknesses and  defects  which

experience has revealed in the existing Prevention

of  Corruption Ordinance. The Bill, while directed

mainly  at  corruption in the public services,  is

applicable  also to corruption by private  agents,

trustees  and  others in a fiduciary capacity.  To

those  who corrupt and those who are corrupt,  the

warning  is  clear - take heed and mend their  ways.

Just retribution will follow those who persist  in

corrupt practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Ordinance, consisting as it does of

only  12  sections, has been found from experience

to  be limited in the scope of its provisions  and

inadequate  for the more effective prevention  and

detection of corruption. There have been instances

before  where  offenders have been able  to  evade

prosecution or escape conviction because  of  some

weakness  or  defect  in  the  provisions  of  the

Ordinance.  The  existing Ordinance  is  therefore

being  repealed and replaced by the present  Bill,

which is much more comprehensive in its scope. The

Explanatory Statement has gone to some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



length

and  detail  in  explaining the principal  changes

made by the Bill and therefore I do not propose to

describe  the  Bill  clause by clause,  I  should,

however,  like to draw the attention of the  House

to  some of the new provisions which will help  to

remedy  the  weaknesses of the existing Ordinance,

and to the additional powers which are to be given

to the Director of Corrupt Practices Investigation

Bureau  and his senior staff in order to help  the

Bureau  to carry out its primary objects,  namely,

the prevention and detection of corruption and the

prosecution   of  offenders,  if   corruption   is

committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that end in view, clause 27 now provides

that  all  offences  under the Ordinance  will  be

deemed  to be seizable offences instead  of  being

non-seizable offences under the existing law. This

would  enable  the Bureau to deal  with  offenders

more speedily and effectively under the Ordinance.

In   a  non-seizable  offence,  a  police  officer

investigating a case cannot use his special powers

of  investigation of requiring witnesses to attend

before  him  and  taking statements,  nor  can  he

arrest  or search premises without a warrant.  The

Bureau's practice at present is to proceed against

a  person initially under sections 161 to  165  of

the  Penal Code, and later amend the charges under

this  Ordinance. This will no longer be necessary.

Also by virtue of clause 15, powers of arrest  and

search of arrested persons are now granted to  the

Bureau's special investigators, whereas at present

similar  investigators employed in the Bureau  are

not so empowered. Another procedural provision  is

that  made  in  clause  20, which  enables  police

officers where delay would frustrate the object of

the  search without a warrant. At present,  police

officers and Bureau officers have to fall back  on

the  provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code  in

order to take such action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other additional powers given to the Bureau

which  will  `be very helpful in  the  course  of

investigation are contained in clauses 17, 18 and

25.  Clause 17 empowers the Public Prosecutor  to

authorise   the   Director  and  senior   special

investigators  to investigate any  bank  account,

share  account or purchase account of any  person

suspected of having committed an offence  against

the   Prevention  of  Corruption  Ordinance,  and

clause  18  empowers  the  Public  Prosecutor  to

authorise   the   Director  and  senior   special

investigators   to  inspect  a   banker's   books

relating to a public servant, his wife, child  or

agent, if he considers evidence of the commission

of an offence of corruption is likely to be found

in  such  books. These two clauses will  be  very

useful  and  make for less dilatory procedure  in

the  investigation stage in dealing with  corrupt

public    servants,    particularly    in     the

investigation of their money and property in  all

forms.  Clause 25 makes it a legal obligation  on

any  person  to  give  such  information  on  any

subject  which it is in his power to  give,  when

required to do so by a special investigator,  and

failure to do so is punishable on conviction by a

fine   or   imprisonment,  or  both,  under   the

provisions  of  clause 24, which is  also  a  new

clause providing for penalties for obstructing or

assaulting    police   officers    and    special

investigators in the execution of  their  duties

under  this  Ordinance, or refusing or neglecting

to furnish them with any information which a person is required by them to do so and which he  is

able to give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now draw the attention of the House to

some of the other new provisions, which will help

to  plug the loopholes and strengthen the  attack

on  corruption. Clause 2 lays down  a  wider  and

more embracing definition of "gratification".  By

virtue  of clause 9, it is now provided  that  an

agent accepting an illegal gratification shall be

guilty  of such offence notwithstanding the  fact

that  he  did  not  have  the  power,  right  nor

opportunity  to do the act required  of  him  and

also  where he mistakenly believes that  the  act

required   of   him  was  in  relation   to   his

principal's  affairs or business.  Corresponding

provisions are made with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



respect  to a person giving or offering a  bribe.

This  new  clause  would make it  unnecessary  to

prove  that  the acceptor of a bribe should  have

been in a position to carry out the act or favour

required  of him. Clause 13 empowers a  Court  to

order  a  person  found guilty  of  accepting  an

illegal  gratification to pay a penalty equal  to

the  amount of that gratification in addition  to

any  other  punishment imposed, and such  penalty

shall be recoverable as a fine. This will act  as

a  deterrent because, in addition to the  penalty

for  the  offence, the culprit is called upon  to

pay the amount he had taken as a bribe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 19 and 22 are two important clauses,

which will strengthen the hands of the Bureau  in

its   work   of   detection  of  corruption   and

prosecution  of  offenders.  Under   clause   19,

suspected  Government servants and  employees  of

public  bodies  can  be  made  to  furnish  sworn

statements  enumerating  property  belonging   to

them, their spouses and children and any property

sent outside Singapore. Other persons can also be

made  to  furnish  similar statements  where  the

Public  Prosecutor  has  reasonable  grounds   to

believe  that  the information  will  assist  any

investigation  into corruption  by  a  Government

servant   or   employee   of   a   public   body.

Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  any   other

written   law   to  the  contrary,   the   Public

Prosecutor   is   also   empowered   to    obtain

information  from the Comptroller of  Income  Tax

relating  to  the  affairs of such  servants  and

employees and their spouses and children  and  to

require  bank managers to supply copies of  their

bank  statements and, to obtain any documents  in

the   possession   or   control   of   Government

departments and public bodies. Clause 22 provides

that  where an accused person is found to  be  in

possession     of    property    or     resources

disproportionate to his known income for which he

cannot give a satisfactory explanation, such fact

which  appears to show that at or about the  time

of  the alleged offence he has been bribed or  is

in  the  habit of receiving bribes may be  proved

and  may  be  taken by the Court as corroborating

the testimony of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



any  witness.  Similar evidence can  be  tendered

against  him in respect of property or  resources

in  the possession of relatives or other persons,

who are reasonably believed to be holding them on

his behalf or as a gift from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 is designed to relieve the Court of

the restrictions of the accomplice rule, that is,

that the evidence of an accomplice is held to  be

unworthy  of credit unless corroborated. Offences

of  bribery and corruption are usually  committed

in  secret and not in the presence of any  person

other  than the giver or receiver, and  therefore

this  accomplice rule has been a stumbling  block

to many prosecutions in the past. It is felt that

the  reasons for treating accomplice evidence  as

tainted, for example, the accomplice is generally

of  bad  character or acting to escape punishment

himself or working off a grudge, need not  always

apply  to the giver of a bribe, and therefore  it

could  be left to the Court to form its own  view

as  to whether, by his bearing, demeanour and the

substance of his evidence, the giver of  a  bribe

is a witness of truth or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clause 30, power is also now given to the

Court where two or more persons are charged  with

an offence under this Ordinance to require one or

more  of  them to give evidence as a  witness  or

witnesses for the prosecution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, by clause 27, it becomes an offence for

a  public servant if he fails to arrest a  person

without  reasonable excuse at the time when  that

person  has  given or offered him a  bribe.  This

provision will stop offenders from making excuses

when   arrested.  For  instance,  instances  have

occurred  where offenders have been acquitted  in

Court on the grounds that they were walking  away

to  go  and  report to the Police when they  were

arrested. This clause will at least make them try

to  arrest  the giver of a bribe or at  least  go

straight to the Police and report their inability

to effect the arrest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other clauses, which the House will be

interested in, are clauses 11 and 12, which  make

it  an offence to offer a bribe to any Member  of

the Legislative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



Assembly,  or of a public body and for  any  such

Member to solicit or accept a bribe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, owing to the importance and

comprehensive  nature of this  Bill,  it  is  the

intention  of the Government to commit  it  to  a

Select Committee of the Assembly, where it can be

studied  in  greater  detail.  I  would  like  to

conclude  by  saying that the present  Government

will  do  everything  in its power  to  eradicate

bribery and corruption in the country, especially

in  the  public  services. But it  must  also  be

realised  that  the attitude  of  the  public  is

perhaps  an  equally  important  weapon  in   its

elimination. We are striving to have in Singapore

a  public service which will be second to none in

ability,       efficiency,      honesty       and

incorruptibility,   and   I   therefore    appeal

confidently  to the Members of this Assembly  and

the  public to play their part in achieving  this

goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on Second Reading resumed.



<br><br>7.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support my  colleague,

the  Minister  for Home Affairs, who  has  clearly

stated  the  aims of the Prevention of  Corruption

Bill. Although previously in Singapore there  were

provisions  for the prevention of corruption,  the

Ordinance and its provisions are now out  of  date

and   not   applicable.  Therefore,  it  is   very

necessary to amend it and make it a more effective

legislation, to plug the loopholes so that we  can

eradicate corruption in the public services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have fully studied the 1950 Ordinance of the

Federation of Malaya, and it can be said  that  we

have  incorporated in our Bill the merits  of  the

Prevention  of  Corruption  Ordinances  of   other

countries. Although we cannot say that our Bill is

perfect, it can be said that, on the side  of  the

Government,  we  have tried our  best.  Therefore,

with  the  passing  of this  Bill,  we  can  fully

implement  Government policy in this respect.  The

eradication of corruption is one of our programmes

set  out  during the election. And today's  Second

Reading of this Bill indicates that we are  trying

to  fulfil  our  promise.  We  are  determined  to

eradicate corruption. Previously, in the  eyes  of

the people of Singapore, the public service was  a

corrupt  and  inefficient bureaucratic  machinery.

Because  of this, bureaucracy is just a by-product

of   corruption.  Whenever  someone  went  to  the

Government  office,  more  often  than  not   they

experienced   some  unnecessary   difficulty   and

trouble.  Sometimes the dishonest public  servants

referred them to some other department instead  of

their  own department, and said that such a  thing

was  not  workable. Therefore,  the  people  under

those  circumstances had to offer bribes  so  that

everything could be solved. Even then it  was  not

practical, and they would try some other  ways  to

solve  the problem. Therefore, in the eyes of  the

majority  of the people, the Government  machinery

was just a place of exploitation on a large scale.

I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



mean  to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  in  the

Government  service every member was  corrupt  and

that  he  tried to oppress the people. There  were

also  many  clean, honest and able  officers,  but

they were smirched by the corrupt ones. Since  the

P.A.P. Government came into office, the atmosphere

of  corruption  is now very much less  noticeable,

because  the  corrupt officers have realised  that

the  P.A.P.  Government would  not  tolerate  such

illegal practices existing in the Government; and,

secondly,  the  people  are courageous  enough  to

convey  their  grievances to their representatives

who  will  take effective steps to look into  the

matter. Therefore, these irresponsible officers at

present  do  not so openly try to  take  too  much

advantage.  It does not mean that the  problem  of

corruption   does  not  exist   in   the   present

Government  service. There are some  officers  who

still  continue with their illegal  practices.  To

these people, we will take unsympathetic steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the aim of this Bill is mainly

to  extend the power of investigation and to widen

the definition of "corruption". The corrupt people

previously used to take too much advantage of  the

loopholes  in  our  law,  so  much  so  that   the

Government were unable to take steps against them.

The  provisions  in  this Bill are  practical  and

essential.  Only thus can we deal with  corruption

in the Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Minister for Home Affairs has drawn the

attention of this House to clause 11. This  clause

deals with Members of the Legislative Assembly  in

the  matter  of bribery. They will be  subject  to

imprisonment  and  fine.  The  inclusion  of  this

clause  in  the  Bill is essential,  and  must  be

attributed to the efforts of the Minister for Home

Affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in China there is a proverb

saying,  "Promotion and getting prosperous."  This

proverb  since recorded history up to the  present

is  still  applied. This does not  mean  that  the

scholars have widened its interpretation. In fact.

in  the  history  of the world and  even  in  this

twentieth  century,  we  find  many  instances  of

"promotion   and   getting  prosperous"   in   the

Government   service.  If  a  government   servant

becomes an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



officer  and  does  not become prosperous,  it  is

rather  surprising.  In our primary  or  secondary

school  textbooks there is such a  record  of  the

proverb  and  in  addition  we  have  it  in   the

newspapers  too. The people can see for themselves

that the public service in the previous Government

enjoyed  all  sorts  of benefits.  And  when  they

retired, they left lots of riches and property  to

their generation, so that the latter too can enjoy

a  higher  standard  of living.  At  present,  the

people can also see for themselves that those  who

retire  from Government service can still continue

to  enjoy life without having to work. So much  so

that some of them can afford to leave this country

and lead a very happy life in other countries. All

this  gives the people the impression that  public

officers must be selfish and corrupt, but we  must

try to understand their psychological make-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the P.A.P. Government we do

not allow such things to exist. We not only do not

allow  them  to  exist, but we  are  determind  to

eradicate them. In the meantime, we have  also  to

make  every officer an honest and obedient servant

of  the  public. I believe that this Bill, studied

by the Select Committee and subsequently passed in

this   Assembly,  will  really  prevent   corrupt

practices in the Government service.



<br><br>7.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, just now our Minister for  Home

Affairs moved the Second Reading of the Prevention

of  Corruption Bill. This is an appropriate  time

to  present this Bill, as it meets with the desire

of the people of Singapore. En the old Government,

corruption  was  rife. This is very  bad  and  the

people thought it was a part of their daily  life.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, we know that if the  people  of

Singapore  were  under a bad rule  and  corruption

prevailed, and they were aware, of this, then they

would  rise  and  try  their  best  to  eradicate

corruption.   We  know  that  under   the   clean

leadership  of  our party, the P.A.P.  Government,

the anti-corruption movement has become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



widespread.   Contrasting   the   Lim   Yew   Hock

Government with the P.A.P. dominated City  Council

in   1957;  the  people  of  Singapore   saw   for

themselves that the City Council only could really

prevent  corruption. The Lim Yew  Hock  Government

also  had  the work of eradicating corruption  but

without  any result. Therefore, we can put  it  in

this way - in Singapore corruption once prevailed in

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new Government have, since

assuming  office  for  the  last  seven  or  eight

months,   taken   positive  steps   to   eradicate

corruption.  We  have seen that  during  the  last

election campaign, the Singapore Improvement Trust

was   the  most  corrupt  Government  office.   We

therefore made this the object of our attack  when

we  came  into  office. We have taken  a  positive

attitude towards the prevention of corruption. The

people of Singapore are fully aware of this.  When

the  new  Government  began  working  on  the  old

Ordinance,  they found that they  had  to  plug  a

number   of  loopholes,  in  order  speedily   and

effectively to prevent corruption. Therefore,  the

moving  of the Second Reading of this Bill by  the

Minister for Home Affairs is further proof that we

are  determined  to  plug  the  loopholes  in  the

Ordinance,  and be in a better position  to  carry

out our work of preventing corruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see for yourself that

in  Singapore, if there is to be prosperity, there

must  be  a  clean  and efficient Government.  The

machinery in the Government offices must be clean,

honest  and dedicated to the service of the people

and the country. If we have no good legislation to

carry  out these aims, that means that we have  no

better  method  of eradicating the  previous  evil

practices. I fully support the Bill introduced  by

the Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not intended

to  speak on this, because we have all agreed that

corruption  must  be eliminated,  and  because  no

question  of principle is involved. But  the  Hon.

the Minister for Home Affairs, while he was moving

the  Second  Reading of the Bill, thought  it  was

part  and parcel of the principle of the  Bill  to

mention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



the  City Council in the past and during his time?

I  am  sorry  that the Minister for  Home  Affairs

exhibited  such  a  pathetic  ignorance   of   the

Constitution  of the City Council under  which  he

worked and the constitution under which I worked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the Council, I worked under the

Municipal  Ordinance,  and  under  that  Ordinance

leadership  of  the Council most definitely,  most

certainly,  and  most inexorably rested  with  the

President of the Council. He was a civil  servant.

He   was  the  leader  of  the  Council.  All  the

statutory  powers of the Council  were  vested  in

him,  and the Council merely assisted him  in  his

work.   Whereas,   under  the   Local   Government

Ordinance,  when  the Hon, the Minister  for  Home

Affairs   was  in  the  Council  under  the   able

leadership  of the Mayor (he is now  the  Minister

for National Development) who made such a good job

of   the   City  Council,  things  were   entirely

different.  The  leadership under  that  Ordinance

passed to the majority party, or the party,  which

could  command the confidence of the House.  Under

those  circumstances, the Hon, the Home Minister's

then  leader,  the Mayor, was the  leader  of  the

Council.  He  led  the Council, and  it  certainly

would have been correct to say that the leadership

was  with the Mayor. Leadership of the Council was

certainly  not with me when I was in the  Council,

or  for that matter, Mr Speaker, when you were in

the Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose the purpose of the Hon, the Minister

for  Home Affairs in mentioning that fact  was  to

tarnish  me with the brush, which he so  willingly

and  so  readily seems to wield. But might  I  say

this  to  the  Hon, the Minister for Home  Affairs

that  I  would  like to give him the  same  answer

which  I  gave  to  his  ex-leader  once  in  this

House - the remedy is entirely in the hands  of  the

Minister  for Home Affairs, or should I have  said

the Hon. the Minister?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed the Member

for  Farrer Park to make those remarks  which  are

completely  irrelevant to the Bill merely  because

the  Minister for Home Affairs chose  to  make  a.

remark  which was equally

irrelevant in so far  as the Bill is concerned. And that is as far as I  am permitting hon. Members to go.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have heard the speech just now

of  my  colleague on the Prevention of  Corruption

Bill.  At  the outset, I thought that  the  Member

from the opposite side was not pleased to talk  on

this  Bill, because in pursuit of the discussions,

previous  unpleasant things in  the  City  Council

might be revealed to this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already ruled on that

subject. There can be no reference now to the City

Council and its past.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I am sorry. My  colleague  has

just now indicated clearly the stand of the P.A.P.

Government. We move this Bill with this purpose - to

implement     our    task    and    fulfil     our

responsibilities, which were given to  us  by  the

mass  of the people. Our desire is to satisfy  the

aspirations  of the people. That is  why  we  have

solemnly  introduced this Bill in  this  House.  I

personally support this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not like to repeat the

points and arguments put up by my colleague. But I

would  like to tell the House what the P.A.P. did

in  the general election. Mr Speaker, if you  had

come  to our mass rallies you would have seen  for

yourself  that there were many brushes and  brooms

at  our  meetings. All these brooms were presented

to  us  by the people. This gesture signified  the

aspirations of the people because they  knew  that

in  the Government under the leadership of Lim Yew

Hock, there was corruption everywhere and all  the

time. Therefore, when the P.A.P. took part in  the

election,  the people wanted a clean and effective

Government to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



put  in.  At  that time, we clearly accepted, the

aspirations and the demands of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today when we put this Bill before the House, our

purpose is to make the aspirations of the people a

reality. I do not like to go into details. What  I

would  like  to  say is that I fully  support  the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Opposition  strongly supports the Bill.  Any  Bill

introduced  by the Government to wipe out  bribery

and corruption will have our full support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is always the people of the country who

suffer if we have a corrupt Civil Service,  or  if

we  have corrupt people in power. Therefore,  what

the  Bill  seeks to do is to prevent  such  things

from  taking place. I do not think it can  totally

be prevented. This Bill is to see to it that there

is  less  opportunity and less  freedom  for  such

malpractices being carried out. It is a Bill  that

should be fully supported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is fond of saying, "We are a clean

Party. We are a clean Government." I would like to

tell  them that it is not for them to' say whether

they  are clean or good. It is for others to  pass

judgment.  If you are clean, the people will  know

it.  If you are not clean, so will the people know

it.  But  corruption,  Sir, is  not  only  illegal

gratification.   There   are   other   forms    of

corruption,  and  I do not think  these  forms  of

corruption  are included in this Bill,  nor  could

they be prevented from being practised, even if we

were  to  amend  this  Bill.  I  refer,  Sir,   to

political corruption.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill has made only a very short sermon to us,

on  this Bill today. The pity of it is that he did

not  take the trouble to introduce a similar  Bill

when  he led the Government. Mr Speaker, Sir,  in

all  these things, it is always better to practise

what  you  preach. If he had taken the trouble  to

practise rather than to do what he did -  to try  to

preach to us today - then possibly things might have

taken a different turn. Mr Speaker, Sir, we  know

what has happened in the past. This Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



is different from other Governments, because it is

determined to stamp out corruption not only in the

Civil Service but also in public affairs. That  is

why  we  have discussed penalties for Legislative

Assemblymen who misbehave themselves, and I  think

those  provisions have been particularly  inserted

so  that  we can be sure that the Members  of  the

Opposition behave themselves.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think I should

permit  innuendoes of that nature in this  debate.

The  hon. Member does know that in so far as  that

particular   section  is  concerned,   a   similar

provision is already contained in our law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I am glad to know that

the Opposition have associated themselves with the

Government   and   praised  the   Government   for

introducing  this Bill. As the House  has  already

been informed by the Minister for Home Affairs, it

is  the intention of the Government to refer  this

Bill  to  a  Select Committee on which I  have  no

doubt Members of the Opposition will be serving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to eliminate the

opportunities  for corruption both  in  our  Civil

Service  and in our public life, and also to  make

it  possible  for  the State to detect  corruption

whenever  it occurs. The power therefore  must  be

given  to State officials to enforce the  law.  It

must be as wide as it can be, and we would welcome

participation  by  both sides  of  this  House  in

making  this Bill a really effective  Bill  to  do

away with corruption in our Civil Service and  our

public life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is really

gratifying  to  note  that  the  Members  of   the

Opposition have expressed their support for  this.

Bill. With the strengthening of this Prevention of

Corruption  Bill,  and with the  support  and  co-operation  of  the  people, I am  sure  that  this

Government will be able to eliminate corruption in

the course of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>Third Reading</b></div>



<br><br>7.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has been very

exhaustively dealt with in the Select  Committee,

and  I  do not propose to waste the time  of  the

House by referring to the voluminous report  that

is  already  before them. I would be prepared  to

reply  to  any observations, which the Opposition

might care to make with regard to this report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this is one

of  the  cases where the Minister for Labour  and

Law   will  admit  that  the  Government,  having

maintained  the principles which they  sought  to

establish  in  the  amendments,  have  had   them

maintained,  and  yet when the Bill  has  emerged

from  the Select Committee, it is certainly in  a

better form and shape than it originally appeared

in  this House. I think the Minister will  accept

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to burden the

House  with  much  of a statement  on  this.  The

report  has been before the House, and I take  it

that they have read the report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill generally can be

divided into three sections. The first part of it

deals  with the giving of extended powers to  the

inferior  Courts; the second part deals with  the

admission  of caution statements; and  the  third

part  deals  with trials before  the  High  Court

without  a  jury. Those are the three parts  into

which the Bill could approximately be divided.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first part, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Opposition  does not object to those  provisions,

but  feels  that in view of the present  staffing

position of the Courts, perhaps this is  not  the

opportune moment to implement those provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as caution statements are concerned, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  here again the Opposition  feels

that  the  time  is  not ripe to  implement  that

particular aspect of this Bill. And  so  far  as

the third section is concerned, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  is, trials before the High Court without  a

jury,  the Opposition is entirely opposed to  the

idea, and the Opposition feels that trials in the

High Court before the jury should be maintained.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are there any other amendments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all those

observations  have been made by  the  Member  for

Farrer  Park and by witnesses who appeared before

the  Select  Committee, and I do not  propose  to

waste any more time. I have only got to say  that

we have moved the Third Reading of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>EVIDENCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>Third Reading</b></div>

<br><br>7.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read the Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is only one point that I

wish  to  mention  here.  It  arose  during   the

discussions in the Select Committee  on  the  new

section  54  that  we proposed  to  the  Evidence

Ordinance.  At  the last meeting  of  the  Select

Committee, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park raised

an  objection  to the terms of clause  3  of  the

Bill  which amended section 54 of the Ordinance.

He maintained that under the provisions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



of  sub-clause  (2) of the amendment  proposed  to

section  54  of the Ordinance, the accused  person

would  put his character in issue if either he  or

his  counsel were to impugn the character  of  the

prosecution  witnesses,  and  would  therefore  be

liable   to  cross-examination  as  to   his   own

character. The Member for Farrer Park then went on

to  point  out further that, in his opinion,  once

the  accused had thereby put his own character  in

issue,   there   was  nothing   to   prevent   the

prosecution from giving independent evidence as to

the bad character of the accused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that on that

occasion I agreed that there appeared to  be  some

merit in what the Member for Farrer Park said, but

since  then  we have both had the benefit  of  the

advice  of the State Advocate-General who  pointed

out that under the provisions of sub-clause (1) of

the amendment which we had overlooked then, it  is

quite  clear that the prosecution would be stopped

from  putting in independent evidence of  the  bad

character of the accused in circumstances where he

is  cross-examined as to his own  character  after

making   imputations  on  the  character  of   the

prosecution   witnesses.  I  am  mentioning   this

tonight, Mr Speaker, Sir, to complete the record.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I also confirm that

I  have had the benefit of consultations with  the

State Advocate-General and the Minister for Labour

and  Law on this, and I am now satisfied that what

I  said  in  the Select Committee was probably  an

over-statement. It was not "probably", Sir; it was

an overstatement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one observation, which I wish to

make  on the amendment to section 54, Mr Speaker,

Sir. It is that the present amendment brings  our

law  into  line  with the English system.  My  own

view,  Mr Speaker, Sir, for what it is worth,  is

that  our  section,  as it  now  stands,  is  much

superior to the English law on this. It is much in

advance of the English law, and English writers in

England  have criticised the English  system,  and

they  wish to bring about the state of affairs  in

England  which  we  already  have  it  now   here.

Therefore,  in my own view, this is  a  retrograde

step.  But the Minister does not think so, and  he

has   given   us  an  assurance  in   the   Select

Committee - you  may  remember  it,   Mr   Speaker,

Sir - that if the law in England is altered, then he

will most certainly give consideration to amending

it  here.  With that assurance, I remain satisfied

for the moment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the

House that once we have dealt effectively with the

problem  of gangsterism, we will be very happy  to

fall  in  line with the new English  law  on  this

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.
