<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(First Allotted Day)</b></div>

<br>12.44 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the

President be agreed to:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our thanks to the President for the Speech which  he

delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening  of  the

Second Session of this Parliament."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Speech neatly captures the vulnerability

of   our  economy.   Just  two  years  ago,  when  the  Ninth

Parliament  opened,  Singapore was prospering.   We  are  now

barely  emerging from an economic crisis, which has left  the

region badly scarred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to overcome our difficulties because

of  the  strength and integrity of our political  and  social

institutions.  More importantly, because of the rational  way

with which we deal with our problems. This, coupled with  the

unwavering support from employers and workers, has helped  us

score top marks with investors.  Singapore has earned nothing

but praise for its resilience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the good times, some Singaporeans had the benefit of

sharing  in the prosperity while being critical of  the  very

Government  whose  policies made for that  prosperity.   They

felt  that growth was in the natural order of things and that

this  Government was undeservedly immodest about what it  had

achieved for the country.  But the regional crisis has forced

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



them  to  reassess their cynicism.  It is painfully  apparent

that  different countries suffered differently in the  crisis

and  there is a good reason.  The greatest pain was  suffered

by those with the weakest systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now very few people harbour doubts about the wisdom of

the  Government's  policies.  Very few  people  believe  that

there  will always be good times, whether or not  we  have  a

good  Government.  Singaporeans are experiencing  first  hand

the  positive  effects  of  the  close  relationship  between

Government, employers and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the most significant result of this crisis is

that  while  other  Asian  countries  are  channelling  their

resources to restructuring their economies, we have moved on.

We  are  already talking about developing our  people,  about

strengthening our "heartware".  That is a luxury which  today

other  Asian countries can only dream about.  They  have  too

many political, social and economic problems on their plate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Speech is aptly entitled "Building Our

Future  Together".   It is about the responsibility  that  we

have  to  share  to  shape the future of this  country.   The

centrepiece of the Government's programme is the people.   It

signals  a  gradual  shift  in emphasis  from  infrastructure

development to people development.  The hardware which  makes

Singapore work is already in place.  It is now time  to  make

Singapore special.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Speech is an invitation to all

Singaporeans to consider how we can achieve that  goal.  This

is  an  opportunity for us to construct a new model.  By  its

nature,  the model must be flexible so that it can evolve  in

changing  circumstances.  It must also be  realistic.   There

must be serious debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place in the debate of such an issue for

cliches  and  platitudes.  In this respect, I  refer  to  the

NCMP's proposed amendment to the motion which, in my view, is

a  perfect  example of a cliche.  He laments the  absence  of

measures in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



President's  Speech.   But  he  knows  that  the  President's

Address is, by convention, a mission statement.  Details  are

left  to  the  Addenda  and to this  debate.   Unless  he  is

constructive,  he will contribute very little or  nothing  to

the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the Government's aims? The Government has said

that  it  wants  to  promote active citizenship,  independent

creative  thought  and constructive disagreement.   They  are

noble  aims.   But  first,  we  have  to  settle  some  basic

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in my view, three threshold issues. First,

what  are  the  basic  terms on  which empowerment  can  take

place?   Second, do Singaporeans know what they want?  Third,

is   the   Government   prepared  for   the   changes   which

liberalisation will bring in its train?



<br><br><i>The terms of empowerment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue turns on the meaning of active

citizenship.   A  close  reading of the  President's   Speech

suggests  that, true to form, the Government has no intention

of  giving  handouts.  Active citizenship is  not  about  the

transfer   of  rights  and  power  to  the  people.    Active

citizenship  encapsulates a bargain.  It is premised  on  the

simple  principle that there cannot be greater rights without

greater  responsibility.   Put  simply,  Singaporeans  cannot

expect  to sit back and ask for more "space" or the right  to

engage in "constructive disagreement" without contributing to

the system which can accommodate those rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always said that contribution to the

community  is  an integral part of active citizenship.   This

idea  is  reinforced in the President's Speech which balances

the  development of the individual with the abiding  need  to

maintain social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are the ingredients of our cohesiveness?

Singapore's  success  is  due  to  certain  basic  strengths:

teamwork, religious and racial harmony and a strong sense  of

family and community.  But these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



have  come  at  a price.  Singaporeans have had to  sacrifice

some  of their individual rights for the larger interests  of

the  community.   For  example, we do  not  make  disparaging

remarks  about  race or religion, language or  culture.   The

result  is  stability.  We do not defame without basis.   The

result  is that reputations which are painstakingly built  up

over years are protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model that we seek to construct cannot ignore these

basic  values.  There is no point in demanding a larger voice

if we are not prepared to maintain the fundamentals that have

made  this  place  work.  The sooner we recognise  this,  the

better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as in all bargains, the Government too has an

obligation.  It has a duty to spell out its vision as clearly

as  it can.  While I accept that by its nature, the issue  of

empowerment  is  difficult  to  define.   It  is  nonetheless

incumbent on the Government, as part of the quid pro quo,  to

be as clear as it can about what it has in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not only fair, it is wise. Fair because people

are  entitled  to know what they can legitimately  expect  if

they  take  up  the  challenge of active  citizenship.   Wise

because it is a dangerous business to hold out the promise of

greater   participation  in  public  life  without  a   clear

explanation  of what that involves.  If people  do  not  know

what the Government has in mind, they will have all sorts  of

expectations.  They will feel let down if their  expectations

are  not  met.  That, from the Government's standpoint,  will

defeat the entire purpose of this exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very different from a programme to upgrade the

infrastructure or grow the economy.   Those tangibles can  be

measured.   But an undertaking to give people a greater  role

in  the  affairs of the nation is an intangible one.   People

must  believe  that it is not an empty promise.  Singaporeans

must,  in  due  course, be told in clear  terms  what  active

citizenship entails in terms of rights and responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must have a road map with clear pointers

and markers.  An

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



ambiguous   policy  can  be  counter  productive.   Perceived

retreats from the pledges in the President's Speech  will  be

magnified  many times over, as will the disillusionment  with

the Government.



<br><br><i>What do Singaporeans want?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue which we need to address is what do

Singaporeans want.  There are a number of dimensions to  this

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not always easy to gauge public opinion.

It  is  particularly difficult when the concept of "political

space" is being discussed.  There is a significant section of

loyal  Singaporeans which will welcome a  relaxation  of  the

norms.   But there is a large and equally committed group  of

conservatives  in this country which is very comfortable with

the  status  quo. Their interests and aspirations  cannot  be

ignored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These conservatives cross racial and religious

boundaries.  They come from different backgrounds and  strata

of  society.  They have grown up in and are accustomed  to  a

system  where  in  return  for  their  contribution  to   the

community  they  receive the benefits of a safe  environment,

steady jobs, good health care, good education.  They may  not

want change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often the debate between those who do not want

change and those who do is reduced to whether the East or the

West  has  the  better  model.  But that  is  unhelpful.   It

distracts  us  from the issue of what is right  for  us.   We

should  design our own formula.  In doing that, we must  take

account of the views of all Singaporeans, not only those  who

are  vocal.  It is bad governance to cater only to those  who

want  more  without regard for the anxieties and the  comfort

levels of those who do not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second dimension to this question is this. There

has  been  very little debate about what we want, even  among

those   who  want  change.   Perhaps  this  is  due  to   the

unfortunate   turn   which  the  argument  takes   sometimes.

Attempts to push at the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



limits have been met by vigorous and robust reactions.   This

has  resulted  in different signals being sent  to  different

people.   But  at the end of the day, we are no  wiser  about

what  the  Government and the people should aim to construct.

Unless we identify what we want and what we are prepared for,

we cannot sensibly advance these discussions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we have to ask ourselves whether we are prepared

and  ready  for  an  increased  transfer  of  responsibility.

Today, we rely on the Government for almost everything.   For

example, the Government decides what we can and cannot  watch

or  read  in  Singapore.  Many people find it  convenient  to

abdicate these difficult decisions to the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But empowerment is not only about having more rights.

It  is  also  about greater responsibility.  Are Singaporeans

prepared to take more responsibility for their lives and  the

lives  of  their children?  The Internet is a  good  example.

How  many parents are prepared to tell the Government to stop

censorship  of  the Internet because they  will  decide  what

their children can and cannot access at home, I suspect  that

you  will  find  that many Singaporeans are  happy  with  the

status quo.  It is neither easy nor popular to be a watchdog.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, and perhaps the most important question is, can

we   take   the   heat?   Friction  will  be   generated   by

"constructive disagreement".  Debate means give and take.  If

we  want to criticise, we must accept that the Government has

a corresponding right to rebut.  We know this Government.  It

is not known for the subtlety of its replies.  The  moment we

say we want  more participation but not the embarrassment  of

having  our arguments torn apart, then the debate about  this

debate ends.



<br><br><i>Is the Government prepared for the change?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third issue we have to consider is whether the

Government  is prepared for the changes that will  come  with

its policies.  The recent debate about whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



we  are ready to have the equivalent of a Hyde Park has  sent

mixed signals.  That is interesting because it tells us  that

at  the very top level, we are still grappling for some  form

of  consensus  about the desirable pace  of  change.   It  is

encouraging  because it reflects an active discussion  and  a

deep interest in the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other forces are at work which will soon test the

Government's  resolve  to  embrace change.   The  President's

Speech  reiterates the need to encourage individual  creative

work.  That  is  an admirable objective.  It  will  have  the

support of all Singaporeans.  But it will take time.  We need

to  change  the  mindset  of a whole generation  of  parents,

teachers  and  children.  But in time, we will  see  a  large

group of highly creative people in our country, and that will

be positive for our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it will also mean a new generation of Singaporeans

with  expectations and aspirations very different from  ours.

One cannot encourage creativity and then compartmentalise it.

Creativity   will   dramatically   affect   an   individual's

worldview.  A person who is trained  to think for himself and

to  think  out of the box may well have little tolerance  for

rigid  structures, whether political or social.  He may  have

no  sympathy for a government which tries to think  for  him.

He is likely to reject the concept of OB markers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new generation will want a say in everything that

concerns  or interests them.  The Government must be prepared

for  their quirks and aspirations.  Our institutions must  be

sufficiently  tolerant  and flexible to  accommodate  a  wide

range  of  different and sometimes, extraordinary, views.   A

knee-jerk rejection of these views would be disastrous.   All

the  good work will come to nought.  It will trigger the very

migration  of  talent  that  our  policies  are  designed  to

prevent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be surprised if, over the next 10 to 15

years,  young adults begin to insist on having their  own  OB

markers; "space"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



where  the  Government  cannot intrude.   Is  the  Government

prepared for this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the issues which we must confront

squarely and honestly if we are to have a meaningful  debate.

I  have  not  touched on the other aspects of the President's

Speech.  I am sure Members will do so.  I look forward to  an

interesting debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  thank you for the opportunity to speak in this  debate.

I  rise  to  support the motion standing in the  name  of  Mr

Davinder Singh.  Together with him and other Members of  this

House,  let  me  also  add  my  congratulations  to  our  new

President, and to thank him for his Address to this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address fills me and, I believe, many

Singaporeans with a sense of pride and anticipation.   Pride,

in  that  as we approach the dawn of the new century,  we  in

Singapore could enjoy a sound economy, which is admired by so

many.   Besides being a prosperous place, it is also a  place

of  calm, of safety and security in a stormy sea of political

and social turmoil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anticipation, in that the Government is going to focus

on   the  people,  on  providing  the  means  to  help  every

Singaporean  to develop according to his or her ability.   In

terms of strengthening civil society, the people sector  will

take  centre stage.  The more vulnerable groups will also  be

specially targeted for more care and assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the message and the vision are clear - this

is  the  Age  of the Active Citizen.  It brings with  it  the

signal  that the Government is intent on strengthening  civil

society.   Civil  society  occupies  the  space  between  the

community  and the state.  Politics is not the  only  way  to

become   involved  in  public  life.   Active  citizens   can

contribute to public life, and still remain, if they so wish,

outside politics.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the UN recently did an excellent study on the

prospects for social development in Asia and the Pacific into

the 21st century.  With your permission, I wish to quote from

the part on "Strengthening civil society".  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Civil society, being the range of non-government

associations  in  which  people .  come  together  to  fulfil

certain  needs, pursue certain goals and participate actively

in  the  affairs  of the state is an essential  component  of

social development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take but a few examples of its role: civil society

mediates  the  people's  concerns  to  the  state,  so   that

government in its work can reflect the realities of  people's

situations  and their concerns; . civil society reflects  and

upholds  the  cultural  values on which  the  functioning  of

society  depends; and . civil society is the stage  on  which

the different ethnic, religious and cultural groups that make

up  a  society  learn to understand and live in harmony  with

each other."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the role of government towards civil

society,  the Report continues that civil society  will  only

play a crucial role "if it is enabled by the State to play  a

central  and constructive role in society."  It concludes  by

saying that  "It is ultimately up to the state structures  to

incorporate a place for civil society, and hence the  people,

within the system of governance."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has already touched on several of the

fundamental  issues  that refer to  the  role  of  government

versus the civil society, which I shall not speak on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is so heartening about the President's Address

is  that the Government has committed itself precisely to the

purpose  of  incorporating  a  place  for  civil  society   - indeed,  it  hopes  to  expand and  strengthen  it,  so  that

Government  can  be  more  responsive,  so  that  people  can

participate in the governance of their communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of this approach cannot be overstated. I

hope  that  every Singaporean will realise its  significance.

Everyone should embrace it.  Everyone should want to make  it

work.   How  quickly a strong civil society can  be  achieved

depends  on the receptiveness of the people to this approach.

If  the  "silent majority" remain silent, or worse, take  the

attitude (as reported in Saturday's Straits Times) that  they

will just rely on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



Government  to  do everything, then all the  good  intentions

will come to nought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I was disappointed to read in Saturday's

Straits  Times several negative views from those interviewed.

One  believed that the approach would not last,  because  the

Government would soon decide, according to him, not  to  have

the  hassle  and go back to the old ways.  Yet  another  felt

that there is not sufficient empathy for others in need,  and

that  few Singaporeans will step forward.  One mentioned that

the    perception   is   that   volunteering   is   a   "side

preoccupation".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that in time to come, Singaporeans will

regard  volunteer  work  not as a "side  preoccupation",  but

rather  as  an avocation, that is, a calling.  One  can  plan

one's  vocation  together with an avocation, and  one  should

start early.  For example, if one were in business, one could

diversify and cultivate an interest in the arts or the media.

It  would be a fulfilling experience, and one can be seen  to

contribute  to  the  advancement of the  arts  in  Singapore.

There  are  many  other ways and many other volunteer  groups

that one could join in pursuing such avocations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the coin would be the

responsibility of the Government.  The Straits Times reported

that  there  is a perceived lack of trust between people  and

Government,  as  well as Singaporeans' over-reliance  on  the

state.  I actually find these views to be inconsistent  -  if

Singaporeans do not trust the Government, then it is unlikely

that  they  would want to rely on it, let alone  "over-rely".

The  inference must be that some may feel that the Government

does  not trust them, and therefore they should avoid getting

involved  in  civil  society.  This is a  misperception  that

should be immediately corrected and thrown aside by those  in

authority.    Many   volunteers  we   know   in   the   civil

organisations now do not belong to any political  party,  and

they   contribute  substantially  to  the  success  of  these

organisations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I end on a personal note. I came to Singapore in

the mid-70s, recruited by the University.  To me and my wife,

Singapore was the preferred choice, and still is.   Then,  as

it  is  now, an island of opportunity, a place where we could

raise  a  family  and have good careers.  We  have  not  been

wrong.   Some friends pointed to America - the United  States

still  remains  the  Promised Land for many,  including  some

Singaporeans.  I believe strongly that soon, with  programmes

such  as  that outlined in the President's Address, and  with

the  commitment by all sectors - the public, private and  the

people sectors - Singapore too will be regarded by all as the

Promised  Land.  Let us try not to be negative and  all  work

together to make it so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin</b>

<b>Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while we celebrate our achievements

over the last four decades, we should not forget how just  34

years  ago,  a  small country with no natural  resources  was

suddenly  cut  off from its natural hinterland  and  made  to

struggle  for  survival.  Neither should  we  forget  what  a

divisive   society  we  used  to  have,  with  the  communist

insurgence  and  communalist riots of the  1950s  and  1960s.

Reflecting  on  the  past  34 years  of  nation  building,  I

conclude  that  our  current  success  is  built  on  careful

management  of our strengths and vulnerabilities and  on  our

ability to adapt and adjust to changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vulnerabilities have not disappeared, and it is to

our  own  peril  if we choose to ignore them because  of  our

current  success.   While history offers useful  lessons,  we

have  to recognise that what has gone before cannot be simply

extrapolated  into the future.  The 21st century  will  bring

more   changes  and  new  challenges,  both  internally   and

externally.  As we move into the new millennium, we  need  to

understand  our  fundamental fault lines and vulnerabilities.

We need to respond to constant changes and, at the same time,

come  out with creative strategies to further strengthen  the

Singapore heartware, which the President

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



in  his Address said, was "what really makes Singapore tick".

I ask a question: What constitutes the Singapore heartware?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is the trust between the Government and the

people.  The people need good government.  But the Government

cannot succeed without a cohesive and responsive people.  The

people must feel and believe that the Government has governed

the country in their own long-term interest and for their own

benefit.   It was over time that the people saw the  concrete

results that the Government had delivered, and it was  during

a  serious crisis and how we had overcome a crisis, that  the

Government established its authority and credibility, and the

people developed its trust and confidence in the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent economic crisis once again demonstrated to us

and  to  the rest of the world the strength of the  Singapore

heartware.   Our economy is able to turn around more  quickly

than  the  other  economies, because the people  trusted  the

Government  to provide the leadership and to make  the  right

decisions,  and the people cooperated with the Government  to

make  the  necessary sacrifices to get us out of the economic

crisis.   Together, we did it in 1987; we have done it  again

in 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, over the past 40 years, a strong unspoken social

contract has developed between the Government and our people.

As  our  society  develops, as our  population  becomes  more

educated  and  sophisticated, and as our environment  becomes

increasingly  complex,  this social contract  would  have  to

evolve accordingly.  Greater involvement of, and consultation

with  the  people,  would help deepen the trust  between  the

Government and the people, and help strengthen the  Singapore

heartware.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, another component of the Singapore heartware is

the  trust  between  the people of Singapore,  despite  their

differences  in  race,  language, religion,  age,  income  or

education.   Singapore is a young nation.  Our  people  trace

their roots

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



to  the  great civilisations and religions of the world.   We

carry  with  us the heritage and history from our  ancestors.

It  is  not possible nor desirable just to discard these  and

say:  "Let  us start from scratch, let us all be Singaporeans

and  abandon our cultural roots as Chinese, Malays,  Indians,

or  Eurasians".   It will be tragic if we lose  our  cultural

roots  and values, as we will lose a stabiliser in the  midst

of   rapid   changes.    National   identity   and   cultural

consciousness are not in conflict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have enjoyed harmony over the past 35 years.

Partly,  this is because the Government has institutionalised

various  safeguards  such  as the  Presidential  Council  for

Minority  Rights, the Maintenance of Religious  Harmony  Act,

and the Group Representation Constituency (GRC).  Partly,  it

is   because   many   organisations  and  the   majority   of

Singaporeans  value this harmony and have made an  effort  to

preserve  it.  I believe that today, for the heartlanders  in

the  HDB  estates, there is a greater level of tolerance  and

acceptance among the different races and religions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But race and religion are deeply rooted, emotive issues.

It  was  not  so  long ago that we last had a  race  riot  in

Singapore.   For many of my generation and older generations,

the 1964 racial riots are still vivid in our minds.  While we

want to build 'a united nation of our people', we need to  be

cautious  and  realistic.   It is one  thing  to  accept  and

acknowledge one another.  But to trust one another requires a

higher level of confidence.  This is not an easy task, and it

cannot be achieved overnight.  It takes time to build trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, as we draw in more foreign talents to

supplement  our local talents, help us grow our  economy  and

compete  globally, we will see more foreign  talents  in  our

community.   As we globalise, we will have some  Singaporeans

who  will become more cosmopolitan and other Singaporeans who

will  become  more heartlander.  To prevent the formation  of

new  divides, we need to build acceptance and trust early  by

providing    more    opportunities   for   interaction    and

understanding.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our population ages, we also need to maintain social

cohesion  between the young and the old.  Our  citizens  must

plan for old age, and make those plans early so that they can

gradually  ease into old age without a disruptive  change  in

lifestyle.    The  family's  role  must  be  maintained   and

reinforced so that the family continues to provide the  first

line of care for its older members.  Community organisations,

such  as  the  Community Development  Council,  can  help  by

putting  in place programmes to encourage senior citizens  to

remain  physically  healthy  and  mentally  active,  and   by

providing  them  with  opportunities for lifelong  engagement

through  employment and volunteerism.  The  community  should

work together to form an integrated community support network

to  ensure  that  senior citizens remain active  and  vibrant

members of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our meritocratic system, opportunities are open to

everyone   but  outcomes  and  rewards  depend  on   ability,

enterprise and hard work.  Not all will do equally well.   We

need  to  help those who are less successful in our community

so  that  they  do not feel marginalised or left  behind.   I

believe  that to the less successful, helping is  not  merely

giving away welfare and relief funds to them.  As a matter of

fact,  many  poor  people do not like  to  live  on  charity.

Helping  them  to develop their children, building  up  their

confidence  and  their sense of dignity and self-reliance  so

that  they  will  have the means to support themselves  is  a

better way to help these families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third crucial component of the Singapore heartware

is  the  affinity that individual Singaporeans  feel  towards

Singapore.   All  citizens  have helped  to  build  Singapore

through their hard work and commitment.  All deserve to share

in the country's success.  Over the years, the Government has

given  all  Singaporeans  tangible shares  in  the  country's

success.   These  include HDB home ownership, HDB  upgrading,

the  share ownership scheme, CPF and Medisave top-ups.  Apart

from  these  tangible  asset enhancement  schemes  that  give

Singaporeans a stake

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



in  our  success,  we  need  to look  into  intangible  asset

enhancement  by developing emotional anchors that  will  bond

Singaporeans to their country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These anchors can be strengthened if Singaporeans are

more  involved  as  participants in nation building,  feel  a

stronger  attachment  to their families, friends,  neighbours

and  community,  and  share a common destiny  and  future  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My generation and older generations of Singaporeans went

through the struggle for independence and the difficulties of

nation building in the earlier years.  Now, whenever we  hear

that  Singapore  has  come up tops in some  area  or  that  a

Singaporean  has  won some international award,  there  is  a

stirring  of the heart.  This is because we fully  appreciate

how  extraordinary it is for Singapore, a small country  with

no  natural hinterland, to survive, and not only survive, but

also  become a model of success for other countries.  We take

pride  in  our achievement as a nation.  We cherish  what  we

have  built over the years, our beliefs and our way of  life.

We feel bonded to Singapore because we took what was given to

us, our strengths and vulnerabilities, and worked together to

build  a  better future for ourselves, our families  and  our

country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of emotional anchors is particularly

important  for  the  younger generation who  has  only  known

stability, growth and prosperity.  It will become  even  more

important as Singapore becomes more international in the 21st

century.   Tangible asset enhancement ties a  person  to  his

country  with  a  purse  string.   On  its  own,  it  is  not

sufficient to draw Singaporeans back to Singapore when better

opportunities  offer  themselves  elsewhere  in  the   world.

Intangible  asset  enhancement, on the other  hand,  bonds  a

person  to  his  country with a heartstring.  While  physical

assets can be easily liquidated and capital and talents  will

become increasingly mobile, it is less easy to erase emotions

and  feelings  of  attachment that have  developed  over  the

years.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the role of Community

Development Councils (CDCs).  As Mayor of Tanjong  Pagar  CDC

District,  I would like to share my views with my  colleagues

on  how  I  think  the  CDC can help  develop  the  Singapore

heartware.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the trust between the Government and the

people,  the  CDC  can  provide  an  avenue  for  people   to

participate  in  the  nation's  affairs  in  a  concrete  and

practical  way at the community level.  The CDCs  are  coming

out  with  strategies to help prepare our residents  for  the

challenges  of  the  21st century posed by a  knowledge-based

economy  and  ageing population.  We welcome anyone  who  can

contribute  ideas and, more importantly, who can  walk  their

talk.  CDCs are not merely talk-shops.  There is real work to

be  done  and we need people, who will roll up their sleeves,

to  help their fellow Singaporeans meet the challenges of the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of the CDC lies in its community network

with     voluntary    welfare    organisations,    grassroots

organisations,  educational institutions,  self-help  groups,

clan associations and businesses, etc.  Through its extensive

network,  the  CDC can play a part in building trust  between

our  people.  Through its community activities, the  CDC  can

provide  more  opportunities  for  interaction  and  exchange

between  people  of  different races,  languages,  religions,

ages,  income  and  education levels.  The  more  our  people

socialise, the stronger the mosaic of our national cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDC can also run developmental programmes to help

the  less  educated  and  the less successful  improve  their

lives.   Development opportunities offer hope for the future,

for themselves and for their children.  Only then, would they

feel that they are still an integral member of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the CDC provides another focal point for

cooperation  between the public, private  and  people  sector

organisations  and individual citizens to  work  together  to

meet the needs of the community.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



through  working  together for a common good  that  a  common

destination  is  forged  and we feel  a  sense  of  emotional

rootedness to our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of heartware is a work for generations,

but  on the foundations that we have developed thus far,  let

us build a world-class home for ourselves and our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing me to join in the debate.  I  support  the

motion in the name of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed heartening to note that people will be the

focus  of  the  Government's policy in the  next  millennium.

Having participated in the parliamentary process for the last

three years, I see this Address by the President as the  most

significant signal by the Government in valuing people as the

most  important  resource  of the country  and  I  feel  most

excited  about this major focus on people as the  centre  and

the heart of the Government's policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rightfully, the governments of the past, since the

independence  of  our country, have consistently  focused  on

economic  development, sharpening our competitive edge  as  a

country  and on material and tangible things, and  while  the

past  34  years  have  been extremely  challenging  to  bring

Singapore  to where it is today, I feel that the  shift  from

economic  and  physical developments to  human  resource  and

emotional developments will be far more challenging and  will

require even stronger commitment and emotional involvement of

all  leaders  who must be prepared to look beyond  short-term

results and have the ability to feel the pulse of the  people

in a completely different way than our leaders have been used

to in the past.  While it was very easy to measure the result

of  our  economic  policies and physical  and  infrastructure

development policies in terms of economic measures  like  the

GDP,  purchasing  power,  ownership of  physical  goods  like

telephones, televisions and others and of physical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



development measures like the number of people owning houses,

the  educational attainment of Singaporeans and others, I  am

sure  even our well-qualified leaders of today are scratching

their  heads  as  to how we can measure the  success  of  our

attainment  towards the Singapore Tribe which Prime  Minister

Goh  Chok Tong hopes to develop for Singapore over the  long-term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have set the motion and are starting to gain

momentum  towards setting up the Singapore Tribe  and  in  my

opinion,  this  debate is the third major  milestone  towards

this journey, the first being when Prime Minister Goh in 1997

made  a  call for a vision focusing on heartware. The  second

milestone was the S21 debate in Parliament this year and  now

this  is  the third milestone, our debate on the Presidential

Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is one example of a success story of

early nation-building of a multi-racial, multi-religious  and

multi-ethnic society where everyone, no matter what  race  or

background, has equal opportunity to participate and  succeed

and  contribute.   However, we must be  willing  to  question

whether this will remain the same or further improve  in  the

next  one or two generations of Singaporeans. Sadly, the odds

are  against us as evidenced by the problems seen in  similar

countries around the world and Yugoslavia comes first to  our

mind. A strong government kept Yugoslavia together, but  only

after  45 years, the tragedy happened in that country  and  I

suggest three possible reasons why this happened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, possibly because people remained at peace because

of  government  policies  which compelled  them  to  maintain

racial  harmony without actually focusing on the  gelling  of

hearts  or  emotions. Second, because of the undue  advantage

one  race may have had over another and when everyone had  to

fight  for survival, tribe instincts prevailed, and  thirdly,

because  of the deep rooted mistrust that was never addressed

because  tough policies to ensure racial harmony  worked  and

complacency in government had set in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



and  there was a lack of focus on enhancing emotional  bonds.

Of  course,  the  second example closer to home  happened  in

Indonesia  recently,  and  similarly  where  racial   harmony

seemingly existed for slightly over 30 years, again  under  a

strong  government.  Once again, when the  strong  government

collapsed,  so  did  the weak thread that bound  the  various

races together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to question whether the same tragedy

will  face  us should Singapore one day see a weak government

in  office.  While I have full confidence  that  the  PAP  is

committed   to  promote  and  improve  racial  and  religious

harmony,  I worry that approach has been more skewed  towards

the  use  of  policies and legislation as the main  means  of

achieving these. While this must be the first right  step,  I

feel  that  we  have  not focused, as we rightly  should,  on

building   of  emotional  bonds  and  in  strengthening   the

heartware  of  Singaporeans.  Sir, we have been  touting  the

experience of hardships and the real example of racial  riots

that  happened right in our doorsteps as reasons for  caution

against  complacency and for the tough policies that we  have

in place.  I feel that this approach is increasingly becoming

less effective in driving home the intended message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister first talked about the Singapore

Tribe,  many  people doubted such a tribe  will  ever  evolve

using  history  as  a  reason.   In  fact,  I  was  a  little

disappointed  at the tone of caution against the  unrealistic

expectations  of the S21 vision which took us more  than  one

year to formulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, again I am a bit disappointed that no commitment

has  been  made  by  the Government in further  defining  the

structure  and  plans  for  a  Singapore  Tribe  that  is  so

essential in strengthening the thread that binds the  various

races  together.  No matter how difficult the task seems,  we

must start today. There are no concrete plans to maximise the

overlapping areas of the various races, as the Prime Minister

has raised the issue, and in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



the   eventual  blending  of  these  common  areas  so   that

Singaporeans  of  the future will see less  of  a  difference

among  each  other  in  these areas while  maintaining  their

distinctiveness in areas like religion and cultures that  are

quite impossible to blend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I see many more years of strong Government with

great  policies  that  make racial and  religious  harmony  a

reality  in  Singapore,  I do not  want  to  leave  the  true

emotional  bonding to chance because I feel complacency  will

set  in  among  all of us when a certain policy  or  approach

seems to work in good times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, complacency in Government could happen because

policies  and  legislation are easy to define  and  implement

while  working  on  the  more different  aspects  of  nation-building like building emotional bonds takes time and  cannot

show  results quickly.  Secondly, the population  taking  cue

from   Government  policies  that  a  superficial  bond   and

dependence  on  legislation  is  sufficient  and   hence   no

additional effort has to be put in to bond the softer  aspect

of  relationship building. Sir, during the economic crisis in

the past two years, we did see some signs of the strain where

racial  discrimination in employment and  the  issue  of  SAP

schools were raised.  I feel that these are two signals  that

we  still  have  a  long way to go to build  emotional  bonds

necessary to establish a true Singapore Tribe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the direction set by the President does focus on

people,  nothing has been mentioned on how we can  strengthen

the  common  elements of the various races  and  how  we  can

increase these common areas over time.  I too believe that we

can create a Singapore Tribe, not by legislation alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like next to focus on how we can

successfully participate in a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President mentioned about the need for every

Singaporean to benefit from the knowledge-based economy  that

is coming our way.  I would like to address two areas which I

feel are of utmost importance for us to succeed in this area.

Firstly, our system of education and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



selection  of  leaders; and secondly, on how  our  Government

agencies need to change with time for us to establish  world-class companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our system of selection based on academic

excellence  is in danger of creating an elitist and  a  class

system.   Slowly but surely, an old boys network may  develop

and  who  now hold positions in Government, in the  statutory

boards  and  in Government linked companies.  As I understand

it,  our  system selects people at a very early stage,  based

mainly on their educational attainment which was a result  of

doing well in examinations.  While the CEP (Current Estimated

Potential)  is  a  good system to classify the  potential  of

people  in  their  careers, I feel  we  have  failed  in  its

implementation.   Scholars are placed in an accelerated  path

that  is lined with gold.  They are assigned mentors and have

a  helping hand guiding them so that their chances of  making

mistakes  are reduced.  On the other hand, those who  do  not

have  such  a  good track record in academic  excellence  are

immediately assigned a ceiling and limits are drawn too early

on  how  far  they are assessed to be able  to  go  in  their

career.   This  is  especially  prevalent  in  our  uniformed

services  liked the Armed Forces and the Police  Force  where

there is a clear distinction drawn between the career path of

scholars and those of non-scholars, and the non-scholars call

themselves peasants or farmers because they think they are in

the  lowest rung of society in the Armed Forces or the Police

Force.   It is self destructive for people who are told  that

they  are not good enough to make it. Worse still, by  virtue

of  how  they are assigned their CEP ranking, they  are  told

immediately that they are not good enough to make it  to  the

top.  Logic tells us that the best soldiers need not be those

with good academic results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not criticising our current leaders or civil

servants, most of whom came through the same path.  In  fact,

I  feel  many  of  them  are sharp and  bright,  but  I  feel

collectively the team is not good enough to steer us  through

the  future where the challenges of a knowledge-based economy

need people of various talents,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



abilities  and  experiences to be successful  as  a  country.

Currently, we have too many people of the same mould  in  the

key decision making positions.  I feel that we need to change

the  system of selection and promotion in Government to  give

more  people opportunities and recognise that people of  many

backgrounds and talents can do better jobs than those of  the

same  background and that non-academic measures  are  equally

important as those of academic measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another system that is quite destructive,

especially  for the self-esteem of people, is  the  education

system  and how we stream our children at such an early  age.

I  am  glad  to  note  that  in his  Address,  the  President

mentioned  that changes will be made in the education  system

to  prepare  the  next  generation of  Singaporeans  for  the

knowledge-based economy. We have to recognise  that  the  KBE

will  require people of various talents getting  together  to

improve  our  competitive edge.  In my opinion, everyone  can

participate  in  the  KBE.   The new  Internet  economy  will

require  not  only  academic abilities but  also  creativity,

passion,  knowledge of the psyche of people and  communities.

As  such,  we  must recognise that every child  will  have  a

talent that we will need and collectively, we will be able to

compete  in  the world arena.  To enable such an environment,

we  have  to  either  do  away with the  early  streaming  of

children by ability levels based on academic excellence or to

modify  the  system to ensure that we allow our  children  to

interact  with each other, no matter how well they  score  in

examinations.  The  streaming  at  Primary  4,  while   well-intentioned, has, in my opinion, been negative in developing,

recognising  and  rewarding children  of  differing  talents.

While we pursue to achieve excellence as a nation, we have to

recognise that in the future, people whom we classify as  the

slower  track  learners  and  achievers  may  make  a  bigger

difference  on  how Singapore will compete as a  first  world

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we aim to give every child ten years of primary

and secondary school education, I hope we will make these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



10  years  the same for every child and if we have to  stream

them, I call on the Government to at least mix them up in the

same class so that each child will learn that not everyone is

the  same  and  that  a good team is made  up  of  people  of

different talents and abilities.  We must learn to give up  a

little efficiency in our system to allow for the blending  of

hearts   and   to  let  our  children  learn   from   other's

aspirations.   This  is  the  only  way  we  can  teach  each

Singaporean  to  be  a  little  cosmopolitan  and  a   little

heartlander.  Let us not allow our system of education create

a bipolar society of cosmopolitans and heartlanders that will

be destructive for nation-building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed heartening to see a focused effort to

help  nurture  Singaporean companies  to  become  world-class

companies.    However,  I  see  some  fundamental  structural

problems in our system and without changing these, I  am  not

sure  we  will  be able to achieve the target of transforming

100 of our local companies into world-class ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem I see is the way we select the

Promising  Local  Enterprises (PLEs).  As  I  understand  it,

companies  only make it to the PLE status after a  number  of

years of track record, focusing on revenue and profit growth.

Similarly,  there are a number of other traditional  criteria

like  the  number  of people, the number of  years,  physical

assets  and  so on used to select such PLEs.  In my  opinion,

the current criteria used are outdated and archaic especially

in  the  emerging Internet economy that spans across physical

boundaries.  Sir, companies with market capitalisation bigger

than   Singapore's  GDP  are  those  of  the   Internet   and

Information  Technology economies.  Such companies  are  also

capable  of  changing the way business  is  done  around  the

world.   My point is that by the current method of selection,

none of the 100 PLEs selected will include Internet or start-up companies of such nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is that while EDB has been given the

task in nurturing the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLEs into world-class companies, it is the NSTB that  is

given  the task of promoting technopreneurship and supporting

start-ups.  What we really need is one body focusing on local

start-ups  who  will  be able to follow the  growth  of  such

companies until they become global players.  Having seen  how

things  work  in the Government agencies, I am not  confident

that  we  will  be  able to identify the right  companies  to

nurture to become world-class.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have a problem of heavy dependence on

Government and in the bureaucracy in our Government agencies,

making  them too slow to react to changes and hence  becoming

too   slow   in  making  the  necessary  changes  needed   to

participate  in  the  knowledge-based  economy.  Sir,  global

players  do things differently and if we look at two distinct

examples  of  governance, my point is  quite  obvious  if  we

compare  the Japanese system of a strong bureaucracy to  that

of the American system of transparency and the private sector

driven  initiatives.   Looking  at  the  performance  of  the

Japanese  and the American economies, I think it  is  obvious

which  system  will work if we really want to  become  global

players.  My contention is that we need a group of people  in

the  Government  agencies  who  are  more  than  experts   in

Government policies.  They must also be knowledgeable in  the

workings  of  the knowledge-based economy and  they  must  be

willing to change things on the fly as opposed to our current

slow  pace  of  changes.  The ability  to  adapt  and  change

policies  fast  will  be  the  necessary  ingredients  to  be

successful in a knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, and finally, I notice that we have a self-fulfilling system where a safe approach is taken by many of

our  Government  agencies and also by  some  of  our  private

entities  like the press.  For example, I have seen  problems

faced by many new start-up companies in getting support  from

the  various  agencies.  Every one of  them  is  waiting  for

someone  else to make an endorsement for such a  company.   I

can  understand  that  such  agencies  do  not  want  to   be

associated with picking the wrong company, but I feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>







that  some of them are just too conservative and are not bold

enough  to  take the initiative to show support for companies

without  a track record.  More often than not, most of  these

Singapore  agencies are late in recognising  such  companies,

doing  so  only  after  some foreign agency  or  company  has

recognised the value of such companies.  This self-fulfilling

system  of  just  picking winners has to  change  if  we  are

serious  about  being  a  key player in  the  knowledge-based

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that while I am

encouraged by the broad focus of the Government on the people

sector, I however feel that we have not done enough to define

how  we  are  going to achieve success in these  areas.   The

areas  identified  do  not  go deep  enough  to  address  the

emotional  aspects  of nation building.  It  is  a  difficult

task, but we must make our first step now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>1.46 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I listened to the 20-minute speech of the

President, somehow the speech sounded empty to me.  Something

basic  was missing despite all the good things said   -   the

Government wanting to be people focused, to promote life-long

learning, to encourage a knowledge-based society, so  on  and

so  forth.  At the end of it all, to me, it was still  a  PAP

programme  and  not really a nation-building programme.   The

speech  sounded  more  like a PAP vote-catching  exercise,  a

programme  to preserve the PAP and to keep the PAP in  power,

rather than a programme to prepare Singapore to compete  with

the industrial western developed nations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not a word in the President's Speech which

says  that  his Government was going to promote democracy  in

Singapore, and to make Singapore a truly democratic  country.

To me, Singapore has to be a vibrant, dynamic democratic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



country  if  we  are  to  enter the league  of  the  advanced

industrialised  nations,  and  to  make  Singapore  a   truly

prosperous  country.  If the President  had  only  said  that

Singapore  wanted to be a truly democratic  nation,  then  we

would all know exactly where Singapore is heading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the moment I am still unsure where Singapore is

heading.  Are we going to have a more open democratic society

or  continue to have a closed paternalistic society?  If  the

Government  is serious on what it says about wanting  a  more

vibrant  and dynamic society, wanting the people of Singapore

to  be creative and innovative and to build a knowledge-based

economy  in  Singapore, then the Government must  opt  for  a

truly democratic society.  But the Government does not appear

to  be doing so.  One example was when soon after Mr Goh Chok

Tong  was made the Prime Minister, he said that he wanted  to

make  Singapore  a participatory democracy.  Many  people  in

Singapore  were  really excited about his  pronouncement  and

were  looking  forward to steps taken by  the  Government  to

implement  that policy, but nothing came out of it.   It  was

just  talk  and nothing else.  Singapore remains  a  tightly-controlled society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened was that the Government expanded the

Feedback  Unit.   That  was  all.   The  expansion   of   the

activities of the Feedback Unit cannot be said to be evidence

of  promotion  of participatory democracy in Singapore.   The

Feedback Unit is not a unit to promote democracy.   It  is  a

device  for  the  Government to get feedback, information  or

intelligence from the people.  The Government,  by  the  way,

had  to obtain information through the Feedback Unit, because

its  attempt  to get direct feedback from the  ground  proved

unreliable,  as  shown  in the 1991 general  elections.   The

Government  was told that the ground was sweet in that  year,

but  that  information was wrong.  The ground  was  not  that

sweet.   Four  Opposition Members were elected and  many  PAP

candidates won only narrowly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of the Government not promoting

democracy is to maintain its tight control of the people of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  The Internal Security Act (ISA) and all the other

harsh  laws are still intact.  People in Singapore have  seen

how  the  ISA  was  used  to  detain  a  Singaporean  in  the

opposition  for  about  23 years.  And  on  another  separate

occasion, how after the last general elections, an opposition

member was sued by PAP Ministers and was asked to pay damages

amounting to about $8.3 million.  On appeal, the damages were

reduced to $3.6 million.  Although the opposition member  was

successful  in  his appeal, the payment of  $3.6  million  is

still  a  very  large  sum of money by  any  standards.   The

opposition  member  did not pay the damages  and  he  is  now

living abroad in Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such harsh political conditions in Singapore,

there   must   be  some  element  of  fear  pervading   among

Singaporeans.   If  that is so, then there exist  restraining

forces which curb Singaporeans to be creative and innovative.

The Government must first remove those restraining forces and

abolish the Internal Security Act.  That harsh law is out  of

date.   We  are all progressing into the new millennium.   We

all  want  new  freedoms.   We  want  a  new  spirit,  a  new

environment  to  create,  to  innovate,  to  build  a   truly

prosperous  Singapore.   I wonder why  the  Government  still

needs  to  cling on to such a draconian law.  The  Government

did not use the ISA to deal with an opposition member when he

spoke  at Raffles Place without a permit.  The existing  laws

were  sufficient to deal with that problem.   I  believe  the

Government  was  quite  proud not to  use  the  ISA  on  that

occasion.   The Government has enough laws to deal  with  the

opposition.   The time for the abolition of the  ISA  is  now

overdue.  The ISA does not resonate with the new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another restraining force is our education system. Our

education system must be overhauled, so that our children can

be  placed  in  a democratic environment where  they  have  a

better chance to grow up to be creative.  At the moment,  our

education system is based on an authoritarian philosophy  and

not a democratic one.  The philosophy in Singapore is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



authoritarianism,  because  our  philosophy   is   based   on

Confucianism.  Confucianism teaches obedience.  Citizens must

obey the ruler of the state.  The children or members of  the

household  must obey the head of the family.   The wife  must

obey  the husband.  The younger must obey the older.  And  in

the  family,  there is a hierarchy.  This kind of  philosophy

smacks   of   authoritarianism.    If   our   philosophy   is

authoritarianism, then this philosophy shall  be  implemented

in our schools.  A system of education which is authoritarian

teaches  the  children  to obey and does  not  encourage  the

children  to question their teachers.  This type of education

system  is  a  one-way  communication  system.   The  teacher

teaches,  the  pupils  learn.  The teacher  is  the  one  who

imparts the knowledge, and the pupils receive them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the authoritarian system, the pupils' brains are

like  receptacles  which are stuffed with  knowledge  by  the

teacher.   There  is  very  little  interaction  between  the

teacher  and  the pupils.  Whereas, on the other hand,  under

the democratic system of education, the pupils are encouraged

to  question  their teacher.  The pupils are  told  that  the

teacher  is not always right.  Under this system, the  pupils

are   not   passive  recipients  of  knowledge   but   active

participants  of  the  process  of  learning.    Pupils   are

encouraged  to  do  research and their  learning  process  is

project based.  With this kind of system, the inquisitiveness

of  the pupils is enhanced.  Pupils are encouraged to reason,

to  think and to acquire knowledge for themselves.  They  are

not  spoon-fed.  This kind of system makes the pupils  to  be

more  creative  and innovative and encourages initiative  and

leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The West, in particular the USA, has this kind of

education system.  It would appear that if Singapore wants to

compete  successfully  with the western developed  countries,

then  Singapore  must  revamp its education  system  from  an

authoritarian  type of education system to a democratic  one.

Anything  less than that will not give Singapore a chance  to

enter  the  league  of  the industrialised  western  nations.

Democracy  is not a luxury for Singapore.  It is a  necessity

if it wants to be vibrant, dynamic and creative.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I regret that the President did not say that we

shall have first to achieve a democratic society, for it is a

democratic  society which is the foundation, the bedrock,  in

which  Vision  21  will  be built  on.   So  I  call  on  the

Government  to have more democracy to ensure that  Vision  21

succeeds.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  join  my  colleagues in thanking the  President  for  his

Address  which charts out the initiatives we have undertaken,

and  the  challenges we have to rise to, in order  to  enable

Singapore to succeed in the next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam has commented that the President's 20-minute Speech lacked substance or was too general. I think

we  have to be reminded by Mr Davinder Singh again that it is

merely  a mission statement, at best, a statement of an  end,

what  we  want  to achieve. We have to be reminded  that  the

Presidential  Speech  is supported  by  the  Addenda  to  the

Speech,  and  these are the means to an end, ie, the  various

Ministries' programmes.  And we are here to debate  not  just

the  end,  but  the means to an end, the various  Ministries'

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am greatly encouraged that there is a clear

emphasis on the importance of recognising and developing  our

people,  as  well  as  continuing our  open  door  policy  to

talented  people  from  abroad who  can  also  contribute  to

Singapore's development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two years, when Asia had been engulfed in a

financial  crisis, have been a testing time for Singaporeans.

Members  of this House would have personal experience  during

their regular meet-the-people sessions of increased incidence

of   residents   with   financial   hardship   and   domestic

difficulties,  as a direct consequence of this  crisis.   Our

newspapers  have reported retrenchments on a scale  not  seen

since 1985.  And we know personally of friends and colleagues

who, one way or another, have been negatively impacted by the

turmoil around us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are lessons that we can draw from these last

two years.  Indeed, in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



Presidential Address, we have recognised that the  sturdiness

and  resilience of our society, our political  structure  and

our  economic soundness had stood us well during this crisis.

Post  crisis,  we are now truly in a stronger  position,  but

where has the strengthening come from?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the financial crisis has embedded the trust

between  the  3 Ps - the public, the private and  the  people

sectors.   We have renewed the social contract between  these

three  sectors  and  have shown tremendous resilience  during

this  period.  We have used our community bonds and the basic

building  block  of  our society, ie,  the  family,  to  hold

together  the  fragile social fabric of a society.   We  have

worked   closely  together  through  the  tested   tripartite

structure of the Government, the employers and the unions  to

respond   efficiently   and  cohesively   to   the   economic

challenges.   We  have  not  taken  the  easy  and   painless

solutions,  but  instead  pushed  ahead  with  restructuring,

reform,  tightening of our belts and taking painful steps  to

regain  our  competitiveness.  We have also  sought  ways  to

widen the feedback channels and encourage development of  the

civil  society.  More importantly, these last two years  have

brought together the post-independence generation and  forged

many elements of bonds and trust across the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not often that societies have had to undergo

large  externally driven changes and come out better for  it.

By   taking  the  bitter  medicine,  and  not  shunning  from

difficult  decisions, we have built consensus  and  developed

bonds  of  trust  throughout our  society.   We  have  indeed

strengthened  the foundation for the next century.   This  is

the real success story of the last two years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need to do now, Sir, in going forward is to

ensure  that the trust developed between the  3  Ps   -   the

public,  the  private and the people sectors -  continues  to

grow.   As the President has pointed out, in the next century

we  can  only expect fiercer competition.  We have no  choice

but to constantly renew and maintain what we have.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has outlined a number of initiatives

to  continue  the  efforts  to  build  up  the  heartware  of

Singaporeans.  The proposals in the Singapore 21  Report  are

slowly  but  surely taking root among our  civic  and  public

institutions.   I believe the trust that we have  built  will

enable  us  to succeed in the knowledge based economy  as  we

continue  to energize Singaporeans to be active citizens  and

participate fully in nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the main challenges before us today is the

distinction  between the heartlanders and the  cosmospolitans

in  Singapore,  first  raised  during  the  Prime  Minister's

National  Day Rally this year.  Some people have objected  to

this labelling of Singaporeans, raising genuine concerns that

this could appear to be a divisive issue.  I beg to differ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we are not trying to typecast or create a

dichotomy   to  segregate  Singaporeans  or  classify   them.

Although  we are all Singaporeans, some of us inevitably  are

more cosmopolitan in our outlook because of the nature of our

training  and  work exposure.  Technology, the Internet,  the

various print and news media by association plug us into  the

global  economy,  the global culture and  society.   We  have

different   needs,  desires  and  benchmarks.   Others   have

different exposures in their daily lives and they may sing  a

slightly different tune.  Broadly classified as heartlanders,

they  are  as Singaporean as the cosmopolitans are, and  both

are as important to our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of Singapore is as material to both these

constituents  as  it is dependent on both.  As  Singaporeans,

the relationship is symbiotic.  There has to be trust between

all  Singaporeans in order to refine and develop  the  social

cohesion that we have currently.  There has to be recognition

of  the differences between the desires, ambitions and  needs

of different Singaporeans so that we can identify them, cater

to  them  and move ahead as a nation.  Globalization and  the

knowledge-based economy have the potential to widen  the  gap

between these two, those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



who  sprint on the technology and those who struggle with it.

We cannot run the risk of allowing this gap to widen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is unique in that we have had a meritocratic

system  without  the worst effects of inequality  developing.

There  has been concerted effort to enable those who  require

assistance the opportunity to move forward through a host  of

community,  Government  as  well as  civic  programmes.   Our

heartlanders  must also seize the opportunities presented  to

them  in  the  form  of  Government-assisted  and  community-assisted  skills upgrading programmes.   The  trust  we  have

developed  is  forged on the basic belief that the  best  and

successful  in our society lend a helping hand to  those  who

require  assistance.   This has to continue when we  consider

the heartlander and cosmopolitan distinction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we develop avenues for

heartlanders and cosmopolitans amongst us to interact so that

they  better  understand the issues and concerns that  affect

Singaporeans.  Mutual understanding and trust can  be  forged

so  that whilst we may march to different drums, we are  both

on  the  same plane and moving in the same direction  as  one

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to do this is to encourage more cosmopolitans to

participate in grassroots activities.  Through this way, they

could interact more with the heartlanders who, I believe form

the  majority of our grassroots leaders.  Perhaps the  PA  or

the  CDCs  could actively reach out and design programmes  to

cater  for more interactions.  Indeed, last Friday's  Straits

Times'  interview with the PA's new chief, Mr Ong Keng  Yong,

is  indicative  of the potential role that PA could  play  by

energizing  the  organisation,  broadening  its  ambit,   and

encouraging greater interaction between the cosmopolitans and

the heartlanders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also urge our Government-assisted organisations to

plan   more  activities  to  encourage  foreign  talents   to

assimilate into our society.  We understand the policy behind

the need to remain open and to attract the best human capital

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  in  our  quest to succeed in the next  millennium.

However, it is only through integration and personal  contact

that  would allow bonds of trust and understanding to develop

between   Singaporeans  and  these  new  additions   to   our

community.   It would provide opportunity as well  for  these

foreign  talents to establish roots and make Singapore  their

choice home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civic institutions such as the voluntary welfare

organisations,  the  arts  groups  and  even  the   religious

organisations,   should  also  attempt   to   broaden   their

membership  base  so that the breadth of ideas  and  thinking

would  be  crystallised with the interest of all Singaporeans

at heart instead of just voicing specific interests which may

be  inimical  to  society's interest as a whole.   We  should

encourage  participation but avoid  the  pitfalls  of  single

issue  lobby groups which, in some developed countries,  have

held  society's larger interest to ransom for myopic reasons,

such as the gun lobby in the United  States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the greatest levellers of society today is

the  arts  and culture.  As the GPC Chairman of  MITA,  I  am

heartened by the commitment and resources that the Government

is  putting into developing Singapore as a vibrant  city  for

the  arts,  and using arts as a catalyst to develop Singapore

into  the  Renaissance City of the future and yet maintaining

our Singapore identity and multi-cultural heritage.  Sir,  we

are  seeing  Singaporeans who are more  cosmopolitan-inclined

participating in our arts festival.  I urge MITA to  step  up

efforts to bring our arts activities to our HDB heartland  to

reach out to our heartlanders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is through these soft issues that a uniquely

Singaporean   heartbeat  would  develop.   This   Singaporean

heartbeat  and identity will transcend both the heartlanders,

the  cosmopolitans and the large number of  Singaporeans  who

will be living and working overseas in the new millennium.  I

further   suggest  that  organisations  like  the   Singapore

International  Foundation study and develop a brand  that  is

clearly identifiable as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans, that can gel all Singaporeans from afar and  at

home together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every extra helping hand counts. Singaporeans,

whatever their background, have diverse interests.   We  will

realise our full potential by contributing actively to  civic

and  community  organisations.  When  the  next  crisis  hits

Singapore, we would have developed a firm platform where  the

roots of trust and a shared vision for all Singaporeans  will

bind us together to weather the storm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I thank the President for setting the

stage  for Singaporeans to rise to the challenge,  and  I  am

sure we all will, to build our common future together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker

Sir,  I  support  the  motion standing  in  the  name  of  my

colleague, Mr Davinder Singh, thanking the President for  his

Speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that there was no democracy in Singapore.

When  we  were  preparing  the  Singapore  21  Vision,  6,000

Singaporeans were involved in the deliberations.  Besides,  a

number of committees were set up to tackle the various issues

of  an aging population, ranging from employment, healthcare,

transport, housing and so on.  A lot of people took  part  in

the  discussions. This is democracy.  When Mr Chiam mentioned

that  there was no democracy in Singapore, I do not know what

he meant by "democracy".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, when people met, they normally asked,

"Have  you taken your meal?".  This shows that  people  cared

for their jobs.  Without a job they would not be able to have

any  meal at all.  Even at the present moment, when  we  meet

people,  we  still  ask, "Have you taken your  meal?".   That

implies  job  security.  This is a matter that concerns  many

Singaporeans,  especially the middle aged  workers.   Without

job, what is democracy?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic crisis may be over and the number of

retrenchments is also reducing. But there are still a lot  of

people who are worried about their job security.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



When  we  talk with the workers and the residents,  the  main

thing they are most concerned with is  whether they can  keep

their rice bowls, especially for the middle-aged workers.  We

ask,  "Where  are  you working?  Are you all  right  in  your

work?"  Generally, the middle-aged Singaporean, whether he is

a  managerial,  technical or ordinary worker, would  normally

say,  "Now,  times are bad.  It is not easy to keep  a  job."

Why  is it not easy?  Everybody feels that the transformation

of  our  economy into a knowledge-based economy  has  brought

about  many  new  challenges.  Their jobs  no  longer  remain

static all the time.  Managers and technicians have to  worry

about  new  challenges  in their jobs.   Many  companies  are

streamlining and downsizing their operation.  To the ordinary

workers,  their  job  security is  threatened.   Middle  aged

people  have  a  sense of crisis.  When will  they  be  axed?

Where  are  they  going  to find new  jobs?   For  the  self-employed, the worry is lower business turnover, and they  may

have  to  give  up their business and look for some  form  of

employment instead.  A canteen operator in a factory told  me

that  the  factory had retrenched a lot of workers.  Business

at  his  canteen was severely affected. To carry on operating

his  canteen  business would mean carrying on  losing  money.

Giving  up  the  operation  would  mean  being  out  of  job.

Switching to another line of business?  Without capital, what

can you do?  This is indeed a big problem!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you reach middle age, you may have a lot of

adjustments  to  do.  Now, with the economic  transformation,

the impact on the middle-aged people is even greater.  How do

we  re-assure them?  How do we boost their confidence?   This

is a matter of immediate concern to all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his policy Speech, the President mentioned that there

was  opportunity for everyone in Singapore to  develop.   The

Government would  also implement the manpower policy for life-long  learning.   We must look at the aspect of  middle  aged

employment  so that the people can enjoy their jobs  and  the

country can prosper.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



Manpower 21, the Ministry of Manpower wants the retraining of

workers  to  be undertaken by ITE.  This is good  because  it

would  enable the workers to study and receive training  near

their homes, after work.  But for those middle aged trainees,

the  rate  of  progress must be slower  because  middle  aged

workers  cannot learn as fast as the young people.   We  have

also   to   take  into  consideration  the  language  barrier

encountered  by the older workers. No doubt, the contents  of

the  courses  are  mainly in English, but in  the  course  of

instruction, the instructors and lecturers may exercise  some

flexibility  in using the language which is familiar  to  the

workers so that they will be able to follow the instructions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we analyse a problem, we normally go to the

database  to  get  all  kinds of  information  to  study  the

problem,    and   find the solution.  We know  that  we  have

several  hundred thousand workers whose educational level  is

below that of secondary school. They have to be retrained  so

that they can fit into the knowledge-based economy.  But when

we  formulate  the  curricula for them, we  must  go  to  the

factories,  talk to them and  understand their feelings.   We

need to talk to them so that we will be able to hear what  is

in their heart.  They may face a lot of problems, and this is

what  the  President referred to as the "heartware"  for  the

21st  century.   We  have  good  plans.   We  have  hardware,

software;  but we lack heartware.  So that is the problem  we

are  facing.   The workers, especially those who are  middle-aged  and  above, are worried about their future.   They  are

also not interested in the retraining programme.  We need  to

depend on our heartware to solve this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when retraining the middle-aged

workers,  we should not confine ourselves to the training  of

only  the lower educated workers.   The crisis over the  past

two  years also serves to remind every Singaporean that those

days  whereby "a skill in hand, handy throughout a lifetime",

are   over.     So   to  retrain  the  middle-aged   workers,

technicians and managers, I think it will involve more than a

million people, and you have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



more  than  a  million people who will  belong  to  the  aged

population by the year 2020.  So, we must start right away by

paying  special attention to their retraining, in order  that

they will be able to handle the computer and face the IT age.

They  should be given more time to learn more skills to  help

them  to cope with more high-tech jobs.  In this way, we will

reduce  a lot of social problems when the time comes when  we

have a substantially aged population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When middle-aged people go back to the classroom, they

will  need  a  lot  of determination, courage,  encouragement

from  the  employers, and understanding from their  families.

In  this  way,  when  these middle-aged workers  carry  their

textbooks  and  go from the worksite to the  classroom,  they

will  not feel embarrassed.  On the contrary, they should  be

proud of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for   allowing  me  to  participate  in  the  debate  on  the

President's Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President has placed great emphasis on people

development in his Speech.  He has pointed out the importance

of  lifelong learning, the need for foreign talent, the  care

for  older people, and the assistance to the less successful.

The  Government  will also implement many  people-development

programmes   to   enable  Singaporeans  to   take   the   new

opportunities  in  the  next  stage  of  development.    This

blueprint for our development certainly holds great allure of

a fast growing and caring nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has also pledged to give all Singaporeans

tangible  shares  in Singapore's success.  Through  HDB  home

ownership and upgrading schemes, the majority of Singaporeans

have  benefited  from the Government's very generous  housing

subsidy.   They  also benefit from the public  transportation

system,  including public buses and MRT.  Most of them  enjoy

greater subsidy in health care if they opt for class  "B"  or

"C' hospitalisation.  All HDB residents do not pay for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



the  installation of cable TV reception.  The total subsidies

given  to  the residents of public housing sector  have  been

substantial.   This  is justifiable as the  majority  of  our

population,  which  is  about 86%, are  residents  of  public

flats.  However, private property residents, who account  for

the  remaining  14%,  enjoy very little  Government  subsidy.

Although  this  is  consistent with  Government's  policy  of

caring  more  for  the  majority, it  does  not  seem  to  be

perfectly equitable to deny the share of success and  subsidy

to  the  non-HDB residents.  Of course, the scope  of  public

assistance  in private housing estate is limited.  Obviously,

the  Government  cannot share the upgrading cost  of  private

properties.  But public amenity in private estates,  such  as

parks,  playgrounds,  roads  and  other  facilities,  can  be

improved more expeditiously.  This will alleviate the anxiety

of  private  estate  residents and give them  some  sense  of

sharing the success of our development, even though the share

could be small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated earlier, the heavy subsidy of public

housing  by the State is consistent with our national  policy

of  helping the majority and the less successful.  It is also

necessary  to satisfy the basic housing needs of our  people.

We  have been very successful in our public housing programme

that  about 86% of our population are living in HDB  estates.

However,  there are some who are singles and are not eligible

to  purchase  a  flat directly from HDB.  And their  numbers,

both  males and females, are increasing.  Although  they  are

allowed to purchase a flat if they jointly purchase one  with

another  single  when  they  reach  the  age  of  35,   their

individual's  right to purchase a flat of their own  directly

from HDB has been denied.  The rationale is well understood -that  it has been the Government's policy to encourage family

formation,  and  possibly that it is  not  economical  for  a

single to occupy a 3-room or a 4-room flat.  But a person has

remained  single is actually not his choice  in  many  cases.

But  rather it is due to a number of factors which are beyond

his or her control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most Singaporeans are sharing the fruits of our

success, it is unfortunate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



that  the  singles  are almost left out in  housing  benefit.

Although  they  are allowed to purchase a flat  jointly  when

they  are  35  years  old,  they  always  encounter  enormous

difficulties  in practice.  First of all, it is difficult  to

find  a  suitable unrelated party to share a life-long asset.

This  is  almost  equivalent to finding  a  partner  to  live

together for the rest of their life.  Secondly, even if  they

have found a joint purchaser, problems may arise later if one

of  the joint buyers decides to withdraw from the partnership

and sell his or her flat.  I have come across a case in which

two  sisters shared a flat, and when the younger sister found

a man to get married to, the older sister reacted angrily and

refused  to  sell their common flat.  This has created  great

difficulties for the people involved.  I would therefore urge

the Government to review the policy of eligibility for single

citizens,  and allow them to purchase a small flat.   Perhaps

HDB  should  consider building some 1-room  flats  or  studio

flats  for these single persons.  If these smaller flats  for

single  persons can be built and mixed with bigger  flats  in

the  same  block or in their vicinity, single flat  occupiers

can  stay  close  to their parents or relatives.   This  will

retain the family bonding and promote community stability.  I

therefore  request  the  Government  to  review  the   policy

concerning single person's eligibility for purchasing a  flat

directly from HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion expressing thanks

to the President for his Address.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, before I move my amendment, may I say,  let  it

not  be thought that it is out of churlishness that I do  not

wish  to  join the House in thanking the President.   In  any

case,  we  know  the  President is not  responsible  for  the

contents of that speech.  He was gracious enough to come  and

deliver  the speech, and I have no hesitation in joining  the

House  in  thanking the President for coming to  deliver  the

speech.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move my amendment. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move  that the motion before this House be amended by  adding

thereto, at the end, the words:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but regret that the Speech is significantly silent on

any measures to encourage citizens to take responsibility for

the future of their country."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the mover of the motion says one does

not look for measures in the Address.  I do not know what one

looks  for,  if  one does not look for the programme  of  the

Government  as  to  what it is going to do.   So  I  fail  to

understand  that.  But I see that one or two  other  speakers

have  said  that the Address was silent on concrete  measures

and concrete plans.  And Mr Chiam has said it was empty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that the Address is a great

disappointment.   One  would  have  thought  that  after  the

trouble  and  the  time  taken to prepare  the  Singapore  21

Vision,  one  would have found in the Government's  programme

for  this  session  of  Parliament  some  concrete  measures,

concrete steps, to achieve what is considered should  be  the

vision for Singapore.  But as has been said, you find none of

it in this Address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that, on the other hand, the

Address  is  all full of self-satisfaction, taking  pride  in

what  this  Government has done, and patting  themselves  for

what a wonderful Government they have been.  It has been said

that  our  Government  is now turning to people  development.

Are  we  talking  about  the  same  thing?   What  is  people

development,  Mr Speaker, Sir?  I should have thought  people

development is developing the people's faculties to take on a

greater  responsibility.  That is what we talk  about  people

development,  so  that their faculties are developed  to  the

fullest extent.  Is there anything here in this Address  that

say  something  about how the faculties of  Singaporeans  are

going  to be developed?  It is abysmally silent.  It is  full

of  pretence  at  what has been achieved by this  Government,

without  the  assumption in it of the need for  participation

from  the  people.   And  yet, there are  calls  for  greater

people's activity, people's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



participation.  All a pretence, Mr Speaker, Sir,  as  I  have

been saying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the great pretender should now

be  taken  off  the Singapore screen.  The script  should  be

changed  and  the people be seen as playing their  part.   So

what sort of a society do we have in Singapore today?  Is  it

a  society  where  the  people have the  responsibility,  the

people  contribute to the decision making?  Or do we  have  a

society  where everything is dictated by the Government,  not

so much the Government, but really by one man?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure I am going to encounter great

criticism  of  being  unfaithful when I say  that  the  truer

picture  of Singapore society was given by Mr Ian  Buruma  in

his  latest  criticism.   He takes a  quotation  from  D.  J.

Enright, the professor at one time in our university, in  his

book "Memoirs of a mendicant professor."  The quote is:  "The

PAP  have often treated the populace like naughty or backward

children."  Picking that up, Mr Buruma says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Backward children cannot be expected to think for

themselves for they are not responsible citizens.  It is this

official  attitude  towards its people that  makes  Singapore

such  a  depressing place despite its fine hotels,  excellent

restaurants  and shining shopping malls.  The  result  of  50

years  of  PAP Government is that most Singaporeans  are  too

frightened to think.  To call that Asian values is an  insult

to the rest of Asia."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one disagreement with Mr Buruma in his assessment

of the Singapore society.  It is not an insult to the rest of

Asia.   It  is an insult to the great Asian civilisations  of

which  we claim to be the inheritors.  As Prof D. J.  Enright

says  in  his  book, from its inception, at least  from  1965

onwards, the PAP mind has been hobbled by a mindset born  out

of  paranoia.  This is the siege mentality, that Singapore is

under  siege.   Not  only the country  is  under  siege  from

countries around us, but the Government itself is under siege

from  its people.  The fear of the people one day asking  the

Government,  the party that forms the Government,  to  leave,

that  they may one day rise up and say, "We have had  enough.

Thank  you very much for what you had done, but we  think  we

should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



now have a change."  So that is the siege mentality, not only

that  the  country  is under siege, but that  the  Government

itself  is  under siege.  Not long ago, President Habibie  of

Indonesia  was driven to remark that the Singapore Government

is afraid of its own shadow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paranoia that has afflicted the PAP has led to the

"nanny" mentality, the over-regulation of every aspect of the

people's  lives  and  to rule by fear.  The  Senior  Minister

himself, in one of his candid admissions, has said that  he'd

rather be feared than respected.  There you have it!   It  is

fear   that  is  most  important  in  the  thinking  of  this

Government.  To keep the people in fear and that, as I  shall

show,  has been alarming for the Singapore society.  It shows

no trust in our people.  There was again the recent utterance

by  the  Senior  Minister about the loyalty of  an  important

community in our midst.  It is a very unfortunate remark.   I

hope  he will come to this House and explain what exactly  he

meant and why did he say it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the PAP's actions and policies, Mr Speaker, Sir, have

been  warped by this paranoia.  The Senior Minister, not very

long  ago, at the last sitting, said that my mind was frozen.

If  anyone's  mind is frozen, it is the PAP's mind.   It  has

stood  still  from the 1960s and has not been able  to  think

clearly because of this paranoia.  The result is what?   What

have  we got in Singapore?  A result which is disastrous  for

Singapore as it gears up to meet the challenges of  the  21st

century.  We are always talking about the challenges that lie

ahead.   But how are we prepared?  If we propose to  go  into

21st  century  with a society too frightened  to  think,  the

Government  unable  to  think  rationally  because  of   this

paranoia, what have we?  A society where those who  have  the

charge cannot think rationally and those under the charge too

afraid  to think.  Is this the kind of society that will  fit

us  for  the  challenges that lie ahead?   It  is  a  totally

incompetent  society, however you look at  it.   And  who  is

responsible for this?  Again, one has to, if one  is  honest,

admit that one man is responsible for this image which Mr Ian

Buruma points out himself.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst other countries and societies around us march

towards  progress,  modernisation in people  development,  in

allowing  the  people to take greater share in  making  their

decisions,  we  are still mired in this society  of  ours  of

which  we are asked to be so proud, still mired in the  siege

mentality  of  the  1960s - fear, fear,  fear!   Mr  Geoffrey

Robertson, not very long ago, in addressing the court on  the

case  brought by the Senior Minister against the Far  Eastern

Economic  Review had to say this, "Mr Lee was  still  wearing

the  spectacles of the 50s."  So let us not pretend  that  we

are  a  society  which  is  marching  with  other  societies.

Practically,  as I said, some time ago, we are still  in  the

18th  century when other countries have moved forward and  we

seem  to be content to stay still simply because the PAP  are

frightened of losing their hold on the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 21st century and the millennium

will  soon  be upon us.  And if we are honest with ourselves,

our  people  must  be ready to face the challenges  that  lie

ahead.   If  we  want our people to think for  themselves   -what  they  should do to meet the challenges and  take  on  a

greater responsibility, not just accept whatever is done  for

them  or whatever is said on their behalf, but for themselves

to  take the responsibility, then we have to act fast.  There

is no time to be lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest a few steps. I have three. I could

suggest a lot more, but time does not permit my outlining all

those  steps,  that  the Government  can  take  to  give  our

citizens   greater   responsibility.    Mr   Speaker,    Sir,

responsibility comes with freedom.  You cannot expect  people

to  be  responsible  unless you give them  the  freedom.   No

amount  of  calling  upon them to be  responsible  will  help

unless  you give them the freedom.  It is not just a question

of  them having their rights.  I was surprised again  by  the

mover's  statement  that  active citizenship  does  not  mean

transfer of powers and rights.  What does it mean?  You must,

first  of  all, Mr Speaker, Sir, give our citizens  pride  in

themselves, pride that they belong to a society where they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



matter,  where they take the decisions, where  they  are  not

just  robots  doing everything that is told to  them  by  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to give our citizens the pride of

being  citizens  of Singapore, a pride that in  this  society

they  live  under  the  Rule of  Law.   That  is  very,  very

important  if you are going to give citizens the  pride.   No

citizen will feel proud if he feels that the Rule of Law does

not obtain in their country and the government can behave  as

it does without being taken to task.  The first imperative is

that   the  government  should  come  under  the  law.    The

government must be manifestly seen to be under the law, not a

government that is above the law, not a government that  does

what  it  thinks it can do and will do without any regard  to

what  the law is.  But that the government scrupulously obeys

and follows the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only recently, there was this report in the papers about

the  CNB knocking at somebody's house at 2 am in the morning.

No   one  questions  the  need  for  the  CNB  or  other  law

enforcement agencies to do their work.  But they have  to  do

their  work under the law laid down. No one expects  them  to

stay away and abdicate their duties and responsibilities.  We

were told that there was no search warrant produced. Why  was

no  search warrant produced?  Why were the occupants  of  the

house  not  first explained carefully before they broke  down

that they were officers from the CNB and unless they complied

with  the  request to open the door and  they can  see  their

warrant cards, the door would be broken down? That is working

under  the  law.   The  law is that you must  have  a  search

warrant  before  you can enter anybody's  house,  unless,  of

course,  the  circumstances are such that  valuable  evidence

will  be  lost  if  you go, first of all,  to  get  a  search

warrant.   An  instance might be where  you  see  a  criminal

running into a house.  Clearly, you have to go after him into

the  house and not wait till you go and get a search  warrant

from somebody.  But that was not the case here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is that Ministers must be seen to obey the

laws scrupulously.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



questioned  the Ministers' flouting of the law so  flagrantly

in  the last elections in the constituency of Cheng San.   To

us, the law was clear.  But apparently, the Ministers thought

that  they were above the law and went into the polling areas

when  the  law  is  that  only the voters  and  the  election

officers  and the Police would be allowed into the  precincts

of the polling station.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area is that our citizens must be told quite

clearly that law enforcement agencies can only act under  the

law   and  that  they  have  every  right  to  question   law

enforcement officers.  The position in Singapore  is  when  a

police  officer goes to arrest somebody, he is not told  what

the charge is.  He is simply told, "Come with us".  And if he

dares  to  ask, "Why do I have to come? What is it?",  he  is

told,  "Oh, you will hear all about this when you get to  the

station."   And  then,  in some cases, the  poor  citizen  is

charged in court with obstructing the Police in the execution

of  their duties. And what is his crime? Because he dares  to

question the Police as to the exercise of their powers.   All

these  must  go.   Our citizens must feel that  they  have  a

right,  a  right which the law will protect and no agency  of

the  Government, no officer of the Government can  take  that

right away from them.  Then, you give them pride.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second step that I would suggest to the Government

is  to  give  our citizens some say in decisions that  affect

their  daily  lives.  Let them feel that they are  heard  and

consulted and can make some decisions.  I suggested not  very

long  ago that there should be representation of our bus  and

MRT commuters on the Public Transport Council but was laughed

at.   It  is impractical.  Why is it impractical?  If you  do

have  that, then the people who rely on the public  transport

can  take  pride  in that they are being listened  to.  Their

views  are heard.  But that does not happen in Singapore.  So

they  cannot  take any pride. Then there is the  Housing  and

Development  Board.  The Housing and  Development  Board,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is a law unto itself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, you have used up

your 30 minutes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been proposed, as an amendment, to insert the

following words at the end of the Motion:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"but regret that the Speech is significantly silent on

any measures to encourage citizens to take responsibility for

the future of their country. "

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "the words proposed to be added be

there added."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question before the House is the amendment moved by

the  NCMP  and  Members who wish to speak  now  must  confine

themselves to speaking on the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

amazed  that  the NCMP regrets that the Presidential  Address

"is   significantly  silent  on  any  measures  to  encourage

citizens  to  take  responsibility for the  future  of  their

country."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues have pointed out, a lot of details have

been  spelt  out by the various Ministries in the Addenda  to

the  Presidential Address which are clearly worthy of all our

interest  and attention as Singaporeans.  And in addition,  a

lot  of debate and discussion had already taken place through

the whole S21 process over the last two years.  Many concrete

measures have been suggested on how Singaporeans can  partner

the  Government either as individuals or collectively as  the

people  sector as we progress into the next millennium.   And

these have been taken into account by the various Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to some of the charges made by the

NCMP.  Sir, the NCMP charges that the Government is unable to

think  rationally.  I find this to be a very  odd  statement.

For  the  recent financial crisis, the Singapore Government's

quick response had received high marks from key observers and

commentators  and analysts as well. The NCMP's allegation  is

clearly   unjustified.   The  NCMP  also  charges  that   the

Government  must be under the law.  The Singapore  Government

has  scrupulously  governed by the rule of  law.   Our  legal

system and judiciary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



have been highly rated.  In the recent CNB case cited by  the

NCMP,  there is no doubt that the CNB carries out its  duties

according to the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP has also charged that Ministers were openly

flouting election rules during the GE in Cheng San.   As  the

NCMP will remember, the matter was carefully investigated and

the  Attorney-General was of the view that the Ministers  did

not violate any law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My view is that the NCMP should not firstly discount the

substantial  inputs by Singaporeans into the  S21  and  other

consultations nor assume that all Singaporeans are waiting to

be  spoon-fed all the time.  Many have bothered to  take  the

time  to read and discuss the S21 report and now the Addenda,

and  to make constructive suggestions. This is what we should

be  encouraging  and not just expressions or cliches,  as  my

colleague, Mr Davinder Singh has highlighted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, the amendment by the NCMP simply

cannot stand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  in  support  of the  amendment  moved  by  the

Secretary-General of the Workers' Party.   In  my  view,  the

President's  Address is nothing more than  a  precis  of  the

"Singapore 21 Vision". There is nothing new, especially  when

it  makes no mention at all on enabling the people to  freely

and effectively exercise their political rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned in the President's Address that, "All

citizens  have helped to build Singapore through  their  hard

work  and  commitment. All deserve to share in the  country's

success."     The asset enhancement scheme was  cited  as  an

example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we must not forget that the HDB recently

introduced some new  regulations to punish those who  attempt

to  realise  the  profits  from their  asset  enhancement  by

selling  their  bigger flats to downgrade to  smaller  flats.

These

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



people  will  have to pay a higher interest  rate  for  their

mortgage loan. For those who sell their flats and re-apply to

HDB  for  another flat, a levy is imposed on them  for  their

profits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when the market is good, the prices of the flats go

up,  and  your assets, in the form of your flats, are  indeed

enhanced.   However, if you decide to take profit  by  taking

advantage  of the enhanced value, the Government  immediately

moves  in  and demands a share of your profit.   Taking  into

consideration  the  higher interest  rate  you  have  to  pay

subsequently,  all  the expenses and  the  levy,  the  actual

profit  derived  from  the asset enhancement,  the  so-called

sharing of the country's success for your commitment  to  the

country,  is simply negligible.  Much of your profit actually

goes  back  to  the  Government's  coffers.   Moreover,  some

people  are  forced  to  downgrade because  of  the  economic

downturn!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the HDB's upgrading programme, it is actually the

Government's  responsibility to keep the housing  estates  in

good  and  healthy condition, but it has now been used  as  a

means to "bribe" voters,  under the guise of enabling them to

"share  in the country's success".  Even then,  the residents

have to share in the cost of upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mentioned in the President's Address that, "those

who  do  well succeed, not simply through their own  efforts,

but  because  society has given them the opportunity  to  get

ahead.   They  have  an  obligation  to  serve  their  fellow

citizens."   Yet, we have to offer high salaries  to  attract

Ministers  and senior civil servants to stay on to serve  the

people.   Is  this  not a mockery of what the  President  has

said?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PAP's policy is "focused on the people to realise

the  S21  Vision"  as described in Lianhe  Zaobao,  then  the

Government  should  conduct studies on   how  to  create  the

conditions   and  environment  conducive  to   the   people's

participation  in politics in Singapore, and  not  to  depend

solely   on   Government  channels  such  as  the  grassroots

organisations like the RCs, CCCs, etc., and the Feedback

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



Unit,  to  make  the  people feel that after  voicing   their

views, they are already deemed to have taken part in national

affairs.   The  Government can then take the  opportunity  to

explain  their  policies and win support for  policies  which

they have already decided upon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bona fide participation of the people should not be

confined  to verbal participation only.  Legitimate political

actions  should also be included. If the Government continues

to stringently obstruct political actions, then the so-called

"vibrant people sector" is nothing but empty talk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the PAP must be realistic. If they

really want  to focus on the people, then it must attach more

importance to the people and respect their right to  exercise

the "people's rights".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PAP Government continues to change the election

laws  to  deprive the people of their rights  to  effectively

return the representative of their choice to  Parliament, and

to  threaten the people during election campaigns  by  saying

that  if  they  vote for the opposition, they  will  not  get

benefits  such  as  the asset enhancement and  infrastructure

like  the  MRT/LRT, and their kindergartens  will  be  closed

down,  etc., then all this talk about a people-focused policy

is simply lacking in sincerity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be added,

be there added."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now register

my support for the Motion to thank the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the role that all Singaporeans play in

determining the future of Singapore cannot be overstated.  As

such,  the  focus in the President's Address  on  people,  on

Singaporeans, strikes a common chord in many of our hearts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we know, Singaporeans today are already a much

sought after human

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



resource.  Head-hunters have often found Singaporeans  to  be

most  suitable for plum jobs in the regional, and  sometimes,

even  global market place.  This is because Singaporeans have

a  reputation  for being intelligent, reliable and  diligent.

This presents the challenge that has been discussed before  - one of mobility and a potential loss of able Singaporeans  to

economies elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can be argued that nurturing a sense of

ownership would be the best mitigating factor against  losing

such  Singaporeans.   Once Singaporeans regard  Singapore  as

home, mobility would translate into several postings overseas

for  a  more  rounded experience instead of a  search  for  a

permanent  home.   Singaporeans  at  all  levels  should   be

bringing home their experiences elsewhere to help enhance the

overall   well-being   of   the  economy   and,   eventually,

Singaporeans at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the need to foster a sense of identity is not

limited   to   the  more  able  Singaporeans,  but   to   all

Singaporeans.   For we are all on board the  large  Singapore

Ship and we each have our own part to play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, as captain, assesses the possibilities,

identifies  the  challenges and constraints, and  charts  the

course.   The corporate sector, as crew, identifies the  role

each  company  organisation will and can  play.   Unlike  the

conventional passenger ship, we Singaporeans on board are not

mere   passengers;   we   examine   the   opportunities   for

participation  and equip ourselves with the necessary  skills

to  fulfill  our roles as best as we can.  We  are  crew-cum-passengers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we were like small power-boats and were

able   to  make  nimble  changes  whenever  a  rock  appeared

unexpectedly or when we found a better route.   Now  that  we

are on a big ship, which requires substantial effort just  to

make   a  slight  correction  of  our  route,  we  need   all

Singaporeans  on  board to keep an ongoing  interest  in  the

course  we  are charting, ie, to help watch out for icebergs,

rocks or other obstacles, or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



suggest ways of ensuring a smooth and enjoyable journey.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we Singaporeans have to rise above being

mere passengers on this journey.  This means we cannot simply

seek to just equip ourselves with enough skills and resources

to  stay  on  board.  We should literally sink or  swim  with

fellow  Singaporeans.  We cannot afford to have  a  situation

where an unanticipated crisis emerges and all on board merely

fold their arms and ask for the way out.  Instead, we have to

assume active ownership of the vessel and both the challenges

and benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we assume active ownership and responsibility?

Allow me, Sir, to touch on an analogy here, that of parenting

or assuming active ownership of our children.  As parents, we

do  not  wait  to  be asked to be involved in our  children's

lives;  we  simply plan for the nurturing  and  care  of  our

children in the context of the environment we are in.  We are

pro-active.   We guide them in their educational  and  career

choices  as best as we can anticipate their roles in society.

We  plan our finances and accumulate enough resources to help

them along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In much the same way, we Singaporeans should build upon

our  sense  of  ownership of Singapore by  taking  an  active

interest  in  all  matters  on  board,  such  as  identifying

potential  pitfalls  and  challenges  for  our  economy   and

companies; isolating threats to our social fabric;  continual

upgrading of ourselves for a meaningful contribution; helping

the  less  successful  amongst us; and  even  adding  to  the

enjoyment of the journey itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for it is only when we have taken ownership of this

unique  Singapore  Ship can we enjoy our hard-earned  cruise.

Singaporeans have demonstrated positively through this recent

crisis our social cohesion, in  spite of our multi-racial and

religious composition.  It is my personal wish that  we  will

all   continue   to  foster  the  Singaporean  identity   and

contribute

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



towards a safe, steady, fruitful and enjoyable journey.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise in support of

the  motion standing in the name of the Member for Bishan-Toa

Payoh GRC, Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me, first, to thank the President for his

Address  which  painted  a  cogent vision  and  comprehensive

action  plan for our country and nation, as we are poised  to

enter into a new millennium.  The President remarked that the

economic  crisis  of  the  past  two  years  has  tested  the

sturdiness and resilience of our society.  Indeed,  Sir,  the

past  two  years  have been a watershed  experience  for  all

Singaporeans,  but  particularly so for  young  Singaporeans,

those  under the age of 30.  We saw it as a fundamental  test

of  not  just our economic, social and political  fabric  but

also  our character as a nation.  For many, it was an intense

personal experience.  Some lost their jobs, others had family

members  who lost their jobs.  And it brought home the  cruel

vagaries of the economic cycle and how big an impact  it  can

have on individuals and their dreams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also underscored in the minds of many young

Singaporeans the value of good governance, as attested to  by

surveys  conducted by the Feedback group in the  minds  of  a

whole new generation of Singaporeans.  In short, it has  been

a  unifying  experience and I think it  has  helped  gel  our

society  and  provided a firm foundation with  which  we  can

contemplate Singapore 21.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, active citizenship lies at the heart of the

President's Address and also Singapore 21.  For me, it  is  a

call to Singaporeans to take greater responsibility for their

lives,  a call to come forward and serve their neighbourhood,

their community and their country, and it is a call not  just

to ponder and pontificate but also to act.  It is a call that

I  hope  many  Singaporeans will heed.   Inevitably,  a  more

vibrant civil society is the corollary of active citizenship,

and  the  evolution of such a people sector has  implications

for all.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to just address the impact, I think, it will

have  for  the public sector and for the people  sector.   We

have  a capable and efficient civil service.  It has a  noted

ability  to discern long-term needs of the nation,  formulate

appropriate policy responses and action plans and effectively

implement  them.   In  fact, one could argue  that  that  has

indeed been one of the key plans for our economic growth  and

development.   But  there  is a need  to  adjust  this  modus

operandi   -   to  involve more Singaporeans  in  the  policy

process.   And it arises from a recognition of the fact  that

problems  are now more complex, knowledge and information  is

not  concentrated  but  quite distributed  and  there  is  no

monopoly  on wisdom.  And Government or the public sector  on

its own cannot address all these issues comprehensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was recently in Japan and I was struck by what I

sense to be a shift in the attitude of the people towards the

Japanese  bureaucracy, which has been shrouded in a  veil  of

infallibility  for a long time, but because of  the  Japanese

economic experience of the last decade, public confidence  in

the  bureaucracy has been shaken.  And many are now no longer

prepared  to  accept  the bureaucratic  centred  approach  to

governance in Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to have avenues for Singaporeans to

contribute  ideas.    The  process,  in  many  ways,  is   as

important  as  the  output  and  in  many  ways,  will   also

qualitatively  affect the nature of the output.   We  already

have  a  culture of tapping the private sector for its views.

This  should be systematically extended to the people sector,

and  this  should  be not as a mere swop  to  the  cries  for

additional involvement in policy formulation but as part of a

genuine  effort to integrate the people sector in our efforts

to  serve  the best interests of our country and to  build  a

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people sector has equally important

responsibilities if this work in progress is to succeed.   It

has  often  struck  me that not many people  appreciate  that

contributions to civil society can occur at different levels,

that it can be not just at the lofty policy debate level  but

also in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



more  mundane  and equally important municipal  or  community

issues.  For example, I think management of the neighbourhood

park  is  as  important as any debate on environment  policy.

Management   of   the  neighbourhood  school   is   certainly

fundamental to the neighbourhood's interests, and is  equally

important  to  any  debate on streaming and  other  education

policies.    So   I  would  hope  that  Singaporeans   regard

contributions  at the community level or the municipal  level

with equal respect and dignity, and not think it beneath them

and only confine their energies to lofty policy debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, I am struck that some

Singaporeans  exclude  Community Development  Councils,  Town

Councils  and other Government-related or, in some instances,

agencies  that enjoy some degree of Government support,  from

the  domain  of  civil  society.  I cannot  fathom  why  this

attitude   has  come  about.   Are  the  efforts   of   these

organisations  any less noble just because  they  enjoy  some

degree of Government support?  Or are they any less important

because  they  do  not adopt an adversarial stance  vis-a-vis

Government?   I  do  not think there is  any  room  for  such

cynicism  in  our Vision of Singapore 21.  To work,  we  need

every  Singaporean  to put his or her best  foot  forward  to

realise  that  dream.  I urge all Singaporeans to  shed  such

inhibitions  and doubts, discard such negativism and  instead

give  the system, the idea, a fair chance.  It does not  mean

you   have  to  confine  your  energies  to  Government   and

Government-related efforts, but certainly it  also  does  not

mean  that  you  have  to exclude them from  your  domain  of

possibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government perhaps has the most difficult task

in  guiding this evolutionary process with a deft touch,  and

not  a  heavy hand.  It has to cast an eye to the aspirations

of  Singaporeans who wish to be more involved and at the same

time  on  the  need for effective, efficient  and  responsive

governance.   In this process, the Government  will  have  to

constantly  review, as Mr Davinder Singh has said,  not  just

where such OB markers should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



lie, but even whether they are necessary in certain context.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am heartened by the Addendum to the President's

Address from the Prime Minister's Office which stresses  that

the  public  sector will do more to consult  the  people  and

private sectors, seek their active involvement as partners in

implementing policies and be more open, transparent and adept

at  explaining Government policies to Singaporeans.   I  look

forward  to the specific initiatives from the public  service

in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, active citizenship and civil society also require a

people  who  have  the creativity and the wherewithal  to  be

engaged  in  a  meaningful and productive  manner.   In  that

regard, I welcome the emphasis on people development and,  in

particular,  the  many initiatives outlined in  the  Addendum

from the Minister for Education.  In particular, I am pleased

that there is going to be increasing emphasis on not just the

products  of the output of the system but also on the  system

of  education, the practices and processes that are  employed

within our schools.  That is a welcome initiative and I  hope

we would hear more in greater detail from the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight one particular aspect of the

education  service, ie, the pre-primary education.   When  we

survey  pre-school education in Singapore, the terrain  is  a

stark  contrast  to  the organised and  structured  world  of

primary  and secondary education in Singapore.  In pre-school

education,  we have a plethora of options, full-day  care  to

two- and four-hour kindergarten classes.  We have a range  of

methodology employed from Montessori to other more curriculum-based  efforts.  We have a range in fees from a few  tens  of

dollars to several hundred per month.  Parents have to choose

from  this  sometimes bewildering array of  choices  but  are

often  unsure  or unclear about the standards,  the  teaching

methods  and whether they are in fact appropriate  for  their

children  and  whether  their  children  in  turn   will   be

adequately prepared for primary school.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the Ministry's announcement that it

will  be  more involved in pre-school education and  that  it

intends  to  undertake research to see how  the  Ministry  of

Education  can work with pre-school centres.  I  would  offer

two particular areas for the Ministry's active consideration.

The  first  is on curriculum design and teacher  training  in

order to ensure that a certain minimum acceptable standard of

education  is  provided across the country in our  pre-school

system  and,  secondly, to consider, and I know this  may  be

anathema  for  some involved, some kind of  certification  so

that parents who go to these centres have some assurance that

they have passed a quality control test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Trade  and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (In Mandarin):  Thank

you,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to take part  in  the

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main feature of the President's Address is the

people-focused  Government policy.   I  agree  wholeheartedly

with  it.   The  President mentioned all the relevant  issues

concerning  the  people:  to enhance  the  people's  quality,

revamping  our  education  system,  and  promoting   lifelong

learning;  to  strengthen our drive for  the  development  of

Singapore,  stepping  up  our  efforts  to  attract   foreign

talents; and to enhance the unity and social cohesiveness  of

our people, the various ethnic communities should respect one

another, and we should help those who are less successful.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Address, there is no mention of our economic

growth  nor  any  statistics.  This is a  big  change.   This

reflects  the  fact that we are now in a  new  stage  of  our

nation  building.   However, it does not mean  that  economic

growth is no longer important.  It does not mean that  we  do

not  have  to compete with other people in order to  enjoy  a

better  life.  On the contrary, the President's  Address  has

focused  on  our  long-term development, so that  we  may  be

prepared for economic development in the 21st century, and to

develop   a  masterplan  for  a  better  life  in  the   next

millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 21st century, we will encounter many challenges.

I would like to touch on three main challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first challenge is that a new international and

regional strategic situation is taking shape.  The

superpowers, like US, Japan, the European Union and China,

are re-aligning themselves according to their own strategic

interests.  And the nations in this region are undertaking

major political and economic reforms.  Indonesia will elect

its President on the 20th of this month.  In Malaysia, the

general elections are just around the corner.  In the not too

distant future, the region's political scene and

international relations will take on a new look.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country. We will have to re-orientate ourselves in the new situation, for our own sake.

In this connection, the people can be a deciding factor.  The

people must make sure that the Government leaders they elect

will have strategic foresight and that they can make a safe

arrangement for our future.  Otherwise, all that we have will

be wiped out overnight in a big "international strategic

earthquake", and all our so-called "world-class home" and

"Singapore-style social safety net" will come to nought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second challenge is the impact of ever-changing new

technologies.  We are very lucky to be living  in  this  era.

The  Internet  has  changed not only  our  pace  of  economic

development but our lifestyles

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



as  well.  New technology is coming fast and aggressive.   If

we  are not prepared, we will not be able to benefit from the

advent of new technology, and be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we have to examine the way we do things, the

way we do business, and to find out where we can make use  of

new technologies and new methods of production to enhance our

productivity and to better our life.  That is why we have  to

carry  out  reforms in our education system and to adopt  the

lifelong learning approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third challenge is to enhance our national

cohesiveness.   Among the three challenges, it  is  the  most

important.   The  Government will  create  opportunities  and

conditions for the people to fully develop their talents.  In

the  next  century,  if  there is  international  peace,  our

political  and  social conditions are stable, we  can  expect

another  lot  of Singaporeans to become wealthy.   They  will

venture  out of this country to go regional and  global.   We

hope  that  these  "new millionaires" will learn  from  their

ancestors.   They should adopt Singapore as  their  home  and

donate generously in support of the charities in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any society, there are failures and the less

fortunate.  We should help them.  Their progress and  success

will remove the impediments on our way towards progress.   We

give those who have gone bankrupt a second chance.  We should

also   adopt  the  same  attitude  towards  other   failures.

However, I feel that to enhance social cohesiveness, all  the

people  should share in the fruit of success.  The President,

in  his  Address, pointed out that, "So long as  the  economy

continues to do well, the Government revenues can afford  it,

we  will  continue to implement asset-enhancement schemes  to

give  Singaporeans stakes in our success."  This is certainly

a farsighted policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion thanking the President for his

Address.

<div align="center"><b>DEBATE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister without Portfolio) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister without Portfolio (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.  A friend asked  me:  Why

is  the  Government  so preoccupied with ratings  by  various

agencies?   Why is it not concerned with the people,  but  so

concerned about being Number One?  It made me pause.  Not  to

ponder over the question, but to ponder why the question  was

asked.  There is an obvious lack of understanding!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Government concerned about ratings?

Government wants to know how rating agencies see us,  because

that  is  how investors see us.  If rating agencies score  us

poorly,  we  will  be out of favour with investors.   A  poor

rating  will  mean  it  would be so much  harder  to  attract

investments  to  create  new jobs,  better  paying  jobs  for

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government looks at the factors rating agencies use, to

see  where we are trailing others, so that we can take  steps

to  improve   -  if those factors are important.   Only  then

will we get the quality investments we want, for quality jobs

for  our workers.  We have scored well in many ratings.   The

danger  is we can be blinded by our own success, and fail  to

note  how  others are improving.  When one who is Number  One

becomes  complacent,  others will overtake  it.   History  is

replete with examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happens to whole industrial sectors of countries.

Just  after  the  Second World War, the leading  shipbuilding

country was Britain.  By the late 1960s, she was overtaken by

Japan.   Why?  Because British shipbuilders did not recognise

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



greater efficiency of Japanese shipbuilding methods, and when

they  did, management was unable to get the support of unions

for the changes they needed to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It happens to companies more frequently. IBM was the

undisputed Number One in computers.  When the PC came on  the

scene, IBM thought it was a toy.  When the PC business  grew,

IBM belatedly went into the PC business.  Those familiar with

the  telecoms  industry know how MCIWorldCom  -   a  relative

newcomer  -  now challenges AT&T for top ranking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why management gurus say that a company must

start on a new growth curve before it reaches the top of  its

current  one.   So it is useful to know where we  are.   What

strategies  we  adopt depends on where we are on  the  growth

curve.  This explains why we have to make changes, even  when

things  seem  to  be  going well,  such  as  in  the  banking

industry.   But  it is not easy.  The attitude  is:   "If  it

ain't  broke, don't fix it!"  But if we do not start  on  new

growth strategies, we will be left behind in the dustbins  of

history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are some of our companies in danger of being overtaken?

We  are  Number  One  in  ship repair.   The  CEO  of  Jurong

Shipyard, Mr K K Tan, told me recently that he had visited  a

shipyard in Shanghai, China.  The orderliness of the shipyard

impressed  him greatly.  Obviously the shipyard was efficient

and  well run.  He asked his host where they had learnt  such

modern  management  methods.  His host replied:  "From  you!"

Mr  Tan  was taken aback!  How was that possible?   His  host

said:  "Do you remember 10 years ago you gave a talk here  on

5S?   You  told  us  about it, and we have applied  it  since

then."   That left an even deeper impression on Mr  Tan.   It

shows  how  bright, dynamic and hungry Chinese can learn  and

catch  up!   So  our  shipyards need to restructure  to  stay

ahead,  and  Mr  Tan will certainly want to do business  with

China, where land and labour costs are much lower.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIA regularly wins accolades. Recently, one of Mr

Charles Chong's constituents in Pasir Ris told him his  fears

by  e-mail.  He said that many countries stopped their clocks

when they threw out their colonial masters, and have declined

ever  since.   But  we  are in danger of having  stopped  our

clocks in the 1980s.  This constituent of his works for ICAO,

and had recently visited China to examine their standards and

procedures.   He  was impressed by how fast Chinese  airlines

have  progressed.  In the 1980s he thought it would take them

50  years  to catch up with Singapore.  He thinks  they  have

caught  up,  a  good system is in place.  Only  the  lack  of

expertise in marketing and selling was holding them  back  to

give us a run for our money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two examples, I hope, are sufficient to prod us to

change,   whichever  industry  we  are  in,  be  it  banking,

insurance, telecoms, air transport, sea transport, retailing,

healthcare,  construction,  ship  repairing,  chemicals   and

petrochemicals, or electronics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We operate in a global environment. The forces at work

elsewhere are present here as well. It is impossible  for  us

to be isolated and to shut out these competitive forces.  Our

own market is far too small.  We have to trade with the world

and  so  contend with the global forces at work.  Almost  all

countries embrace the market economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical question for us is: what kind of operating

system  is  best suited for us?  Which system will allow  our

companies  to be competitive and, at the same time,  maintain

social  harmony?  Which variant of the market economy is  the

more  efficient and bring about the most good?  Is it the  US

model, or the European one?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say the US model, because it is the most dynamic

and  competitive.  The US has been able to create  more  jobs

than  Europe.   So unemployment in the US is  lower  than  in

Europe.   But critics point out that many jobs are low-paying

ones.  Wage disparity in the US is far wider than in Europe.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, wage disparity is translated into substantial

differences in the quality of life, especially in housing and

education  of  children.   Richer Americans  have,  over  the

years,  retreated into their suburban enclaves and their  own

private  schools.   The inner city is a mess.   The  homeless

roam  the  streets at night.  Crime rate is high:  there  has

been a doubling of the adult population in prison since 1985.

Now  about 2.3% of the male adult population are behind bars.

The  US is large and diverse.  Civil society is strong.   The

US  can absorb the social discontent.  While the US model  is

attractive, can a small country like Singapore withstand  the

excesses the model brings?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we have a choice? In a global economy, the labour

market is becoming one, we have to change our sense of place.

But  in  every  country,  there is a spread  of  people  with

differing  abilities.   Low-skilled  workers  should  not  be

priced out of the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is better - a system that provides more people

with  the dignity of work, even low paying, or one where  the

unemployed  or unemployable live on the backs  of  those  who

work?   In  Europe, wage disparity is far narrower,  but  the

social  security systems are struggling.  Many people  choose

to  remain  unemployed, rather than take up jobs  with  lower

pay.  Immigrants from Central Europe and North Africa take up

those  lower  value and lower pay jobs.  Most recently,  many

jobs  of  lower value and lower pay have migrated to  Central

Europe.   The  unemployed are also voters, and  they  applied

political  pressure.   In  France,  the  unemployed,  led  by

unions, marched for higher unemployment benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan had taken a different path, using under-employment

to  keep  unemployment low.  Large conglomerates also  create

businesses  to "retire" their older executives.  After  eight

years  of  recession,  the system is  proving  unsustainable.

Cracks  and strains are showing.  Unemployment was 4.1%  last

year  and  estimated  to push past 5%  this  year.   Japanese

companies are chipping away at their seniority-based  system,

shifting towards

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



performance-based systems, closer to the US model.  This will

strain  social  cohesiveness and a new social  contract  will

have to be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So which way should we go? What measure do we have to

take  to make us even more competitive so that we can  create

good-paying jobs for our workers?  Obviously, we want to move

into  the  knowledge-based economy.   One  aspect  of  it  is

Silicon  Valley  type start-ups.  Another is  developing  our

companies  into  regionally  competitive,  if  not,  globally

competitive ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do to moderate the excesses of the

competitive market economy?  How can we strengthen our social

safety  net?   Some people, both Singaporeans and foreigners,

mistakenly think we are grossly lacking in not setting  up  a

social  safety net.  But that is because they see the  social

safety  net  as the one modelled by the West.  In  the  years

ahead,  as  the  harsh  pace  of globalisation  becomes  more

manifest,  there will be louder calls for the setting  up  of

social  safety nets.  We need not oppose such calls.  Rather,

we should contribute to the debate by pointing out that there

are  different solutions.  There should be a free market  for

ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain with an example. Some countries have

unemployment benefits, pegged to the last-drawn pay.   We  do

not - we only have provision for retrenchment benefits.  Does

it  mean ours is deficient?  Not necessarily.  Typically,  in

most  countries,  home ownership is 60%  of  the  population.

Ours  is 90%.  Therefore, one major household expenditure   - rents   -   is not an issue for most of our people.  What  we

need  are mortgage assistance schemes, like what we  have  in

the downturn.  For those who rent, why, we have rent vouchers

and utility vouchers, an idea which some in the West are only

now discussing!  Of course, our CDCs dispense those vouchers.

And  these  are  not  being  paid  for  by  social  insurance

contributions, direct cost to companies.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be calls for a minimum wage. It is an icon

of the conventional social safety net.  Yes, we do not have a

minimum  wage.   But we do  have subsidised  public  housing.

The  subsidised public housing scheme is actually another way

of delivering what the minimum wage concept tries to deliver.

The  minimum  wage adopted in other countries  aims  to  give

workers  at  the  lower end enough to pay for  housing.   Our

scheme  delivers  the  same, but does not  add  cost  to  the

employer.  So there should be no monopoly of effective  ideas

for social safety nets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also take care that we do not adopt new ideas

that appear to be great, but whose consequences are not fully

known,  like social security as developed in Western  Europe.

When  first implemented, everyone thought it was great.   Now

the  system  is breaking down and governments are  voted  out

because  they  try  to cut back benefits to balance  budgets.

Why  did a great idea turn out to be a millstone on the necks

of  society?  Because people did not appreciate social trends

-  people living longer and birth rates falling.  Instead  of

each  generation providing for themselves, it has become  one

generation living off the next!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies also get into trouble with their employee

benefits.   Take  pensions.  IBM  in  the  United  States  is

overhauling its employee pension scheme.  It says it must  do

so  to  stay  competitive with rivals which have  lower  cost

schemes.  But it is creating an employee backlash.   For  the

first  time  in its history, IBM may be unionised as  unhappy

workers turn to the union to redress their grievances!  So we

should  learn  from such experiences to know  that  at  first

sight the idea is great, it does not necessarily turn out  to

be great.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, one idea is in fashion - employee stock option

plans  (ESOPs).   Surveys show that American  companies  with

stock  option  plans out-perform those that  do  not.   These

plans are touted as 'cost free' for the companies except  for

the  dilutive  effect on shareholders.   Companies  here  are

plunging into ESOP.  I think ESOP is a great idea for new

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



start-ups  like  those  we want under  our  technopreneurship

programme.   It offers employees the attraction  of  becoming

millionaires  by  sharing risks with  the  company  founders.

Beyond  the  start-up phase, I am not so sure.   If  employee

numbers become very large and growth moderates, will there be

enough shares to go round, to be effective as a motivator?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mature companies seeking the services of top-notch

business leaders, ESOP is also a good idea.  It is a form  of

risks-sharing.   The  top executives are  rewarded  if  their

actions  do  bring results, take the company on a new  growth

curve.   But ESOPs widen the income gap.  The US trade  union

federation  AFL-CIO points out that thanks largely  to  share

options, the average American chief executive now takes  home

419  times the wage of the average factory worker.  In  1980,

he  made  42  times as much.  Other studies show  that  ESOPs

inflate reported earnings because options are not treated  as

expenses,  and  mask  employee earnings to  show  lower  wage

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others point out that shareholder value may well be due

to  bull runs of the stock market rather than the actions  of

management and employees.  Employees with stock options get a

windfall,  unless  stock options are  indexed  to  the  stock

market.  So let us study ESOP carefully and not end up with a

scheme  that will weigh down company earnings in the  future.

We  may  have no choice but to follow what other  people  do.

But let us learn from their experiences to avoid the problems

they run into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of change will be faster. Already the average

length  of  service of employees with a company  has  shrunk.

With  the  faster  pace  of change, this  average  length  of

service will shrink further.  It will not be because of  poor

work attitudes and job hopping.  It will be driven by shorter

life   cycles   of   products   and   services.    Therefore,

compensation schemes and provisions for employee-welfare will

have to take this factor into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employability, not employment, is the key issue. It is

fundamental to workers'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



welfare.   Skills  training must therefore  be  high  on  our

national  agenda.   So I return to where I started  -  rating

agencies.   We lag behind others in skills and work attitude.

This  shows  up  in all indicators of rating agencies.   They

tell  us our weaknesses, even if BERI rates our workforce  as

number  one.  Unless we correct these weaknesses,  we  cannot

move  up the new growth curve.  There will not be the  bright

future we want for our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have Manpower 21. It is a key blueprint

for the welfare of our people. Let us act on it!  Manpower 21

can  take  off  only if all three social partners  -  unions,

employers  and Government - work in tandem and support  these

schemes and enlist the support of the people.  Yes, all three

social partners have indeed made significant contributions on

what  needs  to  be  done to develop a  globally  competitive

workforce to support our economic vision.  It is time we  did

the  selling, the mobilising.  We have to do this in concert.

In pushing for Manpower 21, we must not forget that there are

significant  numbers within our workforce  who  do  not  have

basic  education.  So we need to give BEST another push.   We

must  initiate  other imaginative programmes that  give  such

people  hope that they too will benefit in a better Singapore

we  want to create. Then, we will move into the 21st century,

entering the knowledge-based economy and building our  world-class homes here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you  for  allowing me to join in  the  debate  on  the

President's  Address and I rise in support of the  motion  in

the name of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of sounding bland and making the Straits

Times  political  writer Chua Lee Hoong yawn,  I  must  first

confess  that  I agree with her that we can do  with  more  c

olour in our speeches, such as the one mentioned by her in Mr

S Rajaratnam's Harvard Club Anniversary speech in 1981.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hope she and others would not be too

disappointed  if  I  shun  the  example  of  the  happy  pigs

mentioned  in  Mr Rajaratnam's speech. I do not know  whether

that  will  make my comments more acceptable  today  or  more

halal, but I hope it would not lack the passion called for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, there are happier things to speak of too. If

the  President's Address was lacking in passion, as Lee Hoong

said,  it  was definitely not because President  S  R  Nathan

lacks  such a spirit.  I know Mr President as one  who  reads

widely  and  as  a man with a strong passion  for  Singapore.

When Mr Nathan was the Chairman of the Straits Times, he  had

at  times wished that our journalists write better, not  just

with colour, but with commitment and passion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion can come in many different colours. And in

different  forms  too.  But what about substance?   That  was

definitely  aplenty  in the Presidential Address.   Similarly

with the Addenda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matters most is that the Singapore Government

believes  in bringing home the bacon, the more succulent  the

better it is.  However, I am sure you would understand if the

Muslim  Singaporeans also ask for their fair share  of  halal

providence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is provided for in both the Presidential Address

and  the  Addenda.  In other words, lots of food for  thought

and  more,  if  we  do not belong to that class  of  pleasure

seekers,  who  only  believe in material  well-being,  to  be

arrived   at  without  toil,  sweat  and  tears  as   in   Mr

Rajaratnam's speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we Singaporeans believe in our people. Those

few words almost wax lyrical.  Like the passion in the Pledge

and the song, "We the citizens of Singapore, pledge ourselves

as one united people.". I will come back to that later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to focus on two

areas  which  I  think are critical as  we  prepare  for  our

future.  First,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



on  education. The wealth of Singapore lies in our  people  - our  values and our instincts, our courage and tenacity,  our

skills  and competencies. So says the MOE Addendum.  I  could

not agree more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in the future depends on how well we prepare

our  people  for the challenges ahead.  Singapore has  always

placed  a  premium on education, and it is worth  reiterating

why we must continue to invest heavily in our young. That  is

how  the MOE prefaced its role.  Almost a cliche perhaps, but

do  not  let that fool us, for the substance in that Addendum

speaks  volumes of the thinking and the mission MOE sets  for

the Ministry and for all of us Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, time does not permit me to belabour the

points  here  but suffice to say that the same Minister  also

chaired the Singapore 21 Committee which presented us with  a

vision  for a progressive and gracious Singapore,  living  in

harmony  with itself, the region and the world  in  the  next

century.   Allow me, however, to highlight just one point  in

the  Addendum  which,  to me, will bring  about  far-reaching

impact and I quote,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will be more involved in pre-school education,

investing   in   curriculum  design  and  teacher   training,

conducting  research  and  tightening  regulation.   A  pilot

research  will  be conducted to ascertain the most  effective

way  for  MOE  to  work with pre-school  centres  to  prepare

children for school learning."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, pre-school education is not under the direct

aegis  of  MOE, although the pre-school centres  need  to  be

registered with the Ministry.  There is ample evidence to say

that  in  preparing for our children's education,  we  should

start from as early as possible.  Some even say, pre-natal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know the extent to which MOE would get "more

involved", but I am sure that parents would be most happy  to

learn that the MOE's hand would be more visible in pre-school

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOE research should also look into how more of the

Ministry's budget and/or Edusave funds could be disbursed for

pre-school  education.  The PAP's Community Foundation  (PCF)

now runs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



classes  for about 70% of the nursery, K1 and K2 classes  for

each  cohort each year. The fees chargeable vary from $15  to

$100 a month, and even more in the private ones. Surely,  the

quality will also vary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an urgent need to do centralised

recruitment, training and deployment of pre-school  teachers.

The MOE might want to consider either doing it themselves  or

to  establish an independent agency to undertake  that  role.

This  will certainly reduce the headaches now faced  by  pre-school  operators and help to control the quality of teaching

at these centres.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.23 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read about certain pre-school centres producing

students whose quality is below par.  They get educationally-handicapped  even before they begin their primary  schooling.

This will have serious ramifications as the education deficit

sets in early, aggravating the situation as the students move

up  the  educational  ladder.  Pre-school education  deserves

more  attention and I am sure MOE will be well  supported  in

their move to do more for the pre-schoolers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, moving on to the bigger picture,

allow  me  now to touch on an equally important, if not  more

important  point mentioned in the President's  Address,  that

is, multi-racial harmony and social cohesiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an even more challenging task. The message is

the  same,  perhaps  just  as bland  and  boring  but  it  is

definitely  worth  reiterating.  We cannot take  multi-racial

and  multi-religious harmony that now exists in Singapore for

granted.   One can try to add more colour to that message  by

using different languages and imageries.  Yet the message  is

that  the  stark  and cold realities of primordial  instincts

still  linger  and apparently will continue to haunt  us  for

some time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History has shown us how difficult it is to tackle that

problem. There are enough

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



examples  to scare us. Just look around us, and  we  will  be

able to see enough of events that will continue to remind  us

that  the  ugly  heads  of  ethnicity,  racial  bigotry   and

religious fanaticism are as real in the past as it is today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gory scenes of Rwanda, Kosovo and even Timor, Ambon and

Kalimantan, in the recent past still remind us that we cannot

ever  take racial and religious harmony for granted.   Rwanda

and  Kosovo may be too far for us to really understand  their

vibes,  but  after more than 30 years of relative  peace  and

harmony in Indonesia, look at what could happen when a plural

society  stirs and unravels.  Domestic politics and  economic

ills  must surely have contributed to the problems  too.  And

these factors will continue to also feature in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These issues could have been on Senior Minister Lee's

mind  when  he  answered the Polytechnic student's  questions

about  Malays  in the SAF.  This issue has been haunting  our

minds,  I  am sure, not only the Malay minds, for  some  time

now.   And  it looks set to continue to do so for  some  time

more.   This is certainly not an issue that could be  settled

once and for all, at least not for now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue too drew the attention of the Straits Times

last  Thursday.   Ms  Irene Ng, born a Malaysian  but  now  a

Singaporean,  and who speaks Bahasa very eloquently,  as  the

Malays  say "macam air" chose two Malay sayings to  open  and

close the matter discussed in the papers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capturing the disappointment of many Malays over SM

Lee's  comment,  she said it was like "Sudah berputik,  balik

berbunga", meaning that the fruit has taken shape,  regressed

to  a  flower stage. She ended by using another Malay  saying

"Akar dah tumbuh, janganlah dibongkar" meaning what has taken

root, let it not be destroyed. Very appropriate indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding how sensitive the issue was and is, she

rightly  reported SM's full reply, in context.  SM's remarks,

set  in  that background, certainly make a more understanding

reading.  These are not simple

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



statements.   They  are laden with personal experiences  over

the  years  which show deep seated concerns  that  cannot  be

easily wished away by rational thinking. They are a matter of

life  and  death  that  are abounded  by  deep  emotions  and

primordial instincts.  Geopolitical realities might even make

it worse. The extremist and the fanatical ways of some groups

in  acting  in the name of Islam in some parts of the  Muslim

world  complicate  matters  further.   Non-Muslim  bias   and

stereotyping too add to the complexity of the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how does a Muslim Singaporean who seriously and

sincerely  believe in being Singaporean reconcile his  belief

in  being Singaporean with what he sees as being seen as non-loyal or not loyal to Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many a Muslim, being religious is also being

responsible  and  being  a good human  being.   Also  a  good

citizen.  Does an average Singaporean, especially  a  secular

Chinese, prefer Malays/Muslims not to be religious?  Is there

truth in what a Chinese gentleman once told me at a forum?  I

quote,  "The problem with you Malays is that you are Muslims.

If you are just Malays, you are all right."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that a problem of stereotyping? Are Malays/Muslims

cast in the image and shadows of some of the extremist Muslim

groups  elsewhere?  Muslim Singaporeans, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,

Sir, generally believe in moderation and pluralism. They  are

conscious of the multi-racial context they live in.  Most,  I

am  sure, believe in independent Singapore and will  die  for

Singapore as their "tanah tumpah darah" or motherland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that much water has passed under the bridge of

our  short  history.  But that is not to say that  the  water

will  remain  still  all the time.  We will  continue  to  be

tested  by  events and time, and sometimes  events  and  time

beyond our control and outside our area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a need to create a better

understanding all the time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



Co-existence  and  tolerance  are  not  sufficient.   Someone

described co-existence as a relationship between a turkey and

a farmer, until Christmas time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Thanksgiving!

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Is it Thanksgiving? My

apologies.  Until Thanksgiving.  One needs to be thankful for

such a correction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is definitely a need to create a better

understanding all the time.  We need more understanding  and,

even  more critical, trust.  In the future, it would not just

be  a  question of who handles the machine gun unit but  also

who has access to cyber warfare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In yesterday's Sunday Times, for example, we read about

how  cyber war will grow in presence.  The Pentagon has  even

set  up a centre to combat cyber war, which will not be  just

limited to the battle-front, but also on the computer attacks

on  foreign bank accounts, eg, as in the case of the war with

Yugoslavia.   Cyber war could even be waged from  the  living

room  of your home.  In other words, without trust, more will

be at stake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To establish trust would take an even longer time than

it  would  to work on better understanding.  But we  have  to

work hard at it.  This is something we owe to our Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collectively, we must continue to nurture and strengthen

the  network of institutions we have established in Singapore

to  promote multi-racialism.  We have to find ways to monitor

and  appreciate  the  changes taking  place  in  race-related

matters, including in public housing and our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundations established by our pioneering fathers of

independence  in promoting greater multi-racial  harmony  and

political  stability,  as  achieved  through  our   form   of

parliamentary democracy, must be strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, as we approach

the new session and the new century, first, let us count our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



blessings on what we have achieved.  Let us build on them and

in the process enhance trust among our people.  Education and

knowledge continues to be the key to our future.  As we  live

the  future  together, with a sense of common destiny,  trust

will  grow.   It  will take time but we will need  to  do  it

together.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I rise to thank the President  who  addressed

this House on behalf of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the emphases of the Speech was developing social

cohesion.   I  am  glad  to  note that  there  is  an  Inter-Ministerial Committee which is looking into the issue of  the

aged    population.    Recently,   I   attended   an    Asian

Parliamentarian   meeting   on  the   issue   of   population

development.   With  the  help of the Ministry  of  Community

Development,  I presented the model of Singapore  in  dealing

with  the  aged  population.  In response to  our  model,  we

received  very favourable comments from the participants  who

were  parliamentarians in Asia.  Some even jokingly  wondered

whether they could retire in Singapore.  In fact, we are  one

of  the  Asian  countries  which have  a  comprehensive  aged

programme besides Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aged population issue involves the families,

the  community, the employers, the health service  providers,

the housing authority and those who provide public amenities.

This  is not an issue that only one Ministry would adequately

deal  with.   The  Inter-Ministerial  Committee  with  inter-Ministry  involvement and participation would be  the  proper

way  in dealing with the issue, and to ensure that our people

would  be  properly  looked after when  they  join  the  aged

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of inter-Ministerial cooperation, my

experience  is  not very positive from what I encountered  in

the  past.  The Ministry of Community Development might  have

aggressive plans in dealing with community issues.   However,

the  progress  of  the  plan  will  depend  on  the  physical

implementation  by other Ministries.  Due to the  differences

in the priority

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



set by the respective Ministries, some projects will drag  on

for years before they could be implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite an example for building a childcare

centre in my constituency by a charitable organisation.   MCD

gave  the  approval very promptly.  However, another Ministry

which is supposed to build the centre dragged their feet  due

to  shortage  of  resources.  In my view, the two  Ministries

have different priorities on the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aged population issue could also face a similar

problem if each Ministry sings a different tune on the  issue

of  priority.   I hope the poor experience I had  encountered

will not be repeated on this very important issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the development of a cohesive society, MCD will be

one  of  the main bodies to spearhead the various programmes.

Besides  the  emphasis  on  the  CDCs  in  promoting   social

cohesion,  the community centres and other various grassroots

organisations like the RCs are equally important in promoting

social cohesion among our people.  So far, all the programmes

carried  out  by these organisations are either self-financed

or   through   community  donations.   The   Government   has

relatively  negligible financial involvement  except  payment

for  the  administrative  staff and  the  premises  like  the

community centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to strengthen the social cohesion of our society is

an   enduring   and   open-ended  task  for   the   community

organisations.   Endless educational  programmes  and  social

projects  will be launched in order to qualitatively  achieve

the improved cohesion of our people.  In my view, funding for

all these projects will be very essential.  For the community

organisations who are well funded by their well wishers, they

should  have no difficulty in participating strongly in  this

long   enduring   project.   However,  for  those   who   are

financially  weak  they  might have to  place  the  community

cohesion  promotion programme in lower priority.   We  should

enhance  the  funding  to  provide  adequate  funds  for  the

grassroots organisations, so

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



that  they  could  respond  fully to  the  national  call  in

developing  community  cohesion.  So far,  I  know  that  MCD

always  receives  one of the smallest budgets  in  the  past.

With  this new emphasis, I hope more funds could be allocated

to MCD in the coming budget session.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry

of  the  Environment  mentioned about  the  issue  of  water.

Besides  developing  the  water catchment  in  Marina  South,

widening  the  sources  of  water  supply  and  desalination,

industrial water was mentioned.  In fact, recycled water will

be  one of the important sources of water supply in our water

scarce  island.  Our sewer system throws away more than  what

we   have  consumed,  in  terms  of  the  amount  of   water.

Considering the fact that our catchment could produce half of

the  water we consume, with the water entering into the sewer

system being recycled once, we will be self-sufficient in our

water  needs at the present stage, except that the cost would

be higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that the Jurong industrial area might

be  using recycled water for certain industrial applications.

I  hope  that the experience we learn from this project  will

lead to a wider application in recycled water and an increase

in its volume of production.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are developing newer HDB townships and Marina

South,  we  should consider the dual water supply  system  to

cater  for  both the recycled water and potable water.    The

deep  tunnel sewer system we plan to build should  also  take

the   recycled  water  into  consideration.   If   practical,

separate industrial effluent, which is contaminated by  heavy

metals  and toxic substance, from the non-polluted sewer,  so

that the recycled water from the cleaner source could be used

for producing water for better application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Ministry of National Development is

considering to increase the production of food in meeting the

local  demand and reduce the excessive dependence on  foreign

supply.  In my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



view,  this  is  a healthy approach to ensure food  security.

The  recent  experience  of  animal  diseases  and  excessive

pesticide used in farm products taught us to be more cautious

about over dependence on foreign imports.  Besides increasing

our  food  production using mechanised and intensive  farming

technologies,  we  should also take  pains  to  develop  more

foreign sources of supply to cater for the shock due  to  the

shortage of supply, like the recent shortage of pork supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For increasing the local farm production, I am concerned

about  the shortage of manpower which we already face in  the

present  high-tech farms.  At present, the high-tech  farmers

are only allowed to hire foreign workers from the traditional

source,  meaning Malaysians.  The Malaysian workers  are  not

very  keen  to  work  in  the farms  due  to  the  relatively

unpleasant working environment and the reward is not as  good

as   those   involved  in  the  renovation  and  construction

industries.  The farmers are really desperate in looking  for

manpower  supply  from  non-traditional  sources,  but  their

applications were not granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Ministry is contemplating increasing food

supply  as  a  means  to  achieve a  stronger  food  security

position, I hope that this matter of foreign workers from the

non-traditional source could be properly dealt  with  by  the

Ministry of Manpower.  Otherwise, in my view, it is difficult

for  us  to  realise our dream of reducing our dependence  on

foreign food supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion standing in the

name of Mr Davinder Singh.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  thank you for the opportunity to speak in this  debate.

I  rise  to  speak  in  support of the motion  to  thank  the

President for his Speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most encouraged to hear the President identify

people  as  the  major focus of Government's  policy  in  the

coming years, and of Singapore 21 as a key programme of  this

Parliament.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 identifies the family as one of the five

pillars that will enable us to build on what we already  have

and  create a strong and vibrant nation, and a home  that  we

will all dearly love in the next millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President also spoke on the ageing of our

population.  Notwithstanding all our initiatives and  efforts

to  keep  the  majority  of our senior citizens  healthy  and

active contributors, as our population ages, there will be  a

growing number of older persons who will need care.  The main

care  givers  of  these dependent older persons  will  remain

their families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent MCD-IPS Conference on Ageing in Singapore,

the  invited  speaker shared that in the UK,  families  still

remain  strongly committed to caring for their older members,

but   are   increasingly  struggling  under  the  burden   of

discharging  these  responsibilities, with  the  increase  in

longevity and the co-existence in families of three  or  even

four  generations.   He  argued that leaving  the  family  to

struggle  on  its  own unaided is to take a  very  short-term

view,  as  not  only might a good portion of  these  families

break  under  the  pressure, there might be adverse  economic

consequences,  such as the cost of providing health  care  to

exhausted carers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our families in Singapore are, fortunately,

generally not yet under such pressure at the moment,  as  our

population is currently still much younger than that  of  the

European countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the study on the Singapore Family, commissioned

by MCD, which was recently released, presents a happy picture

of  families largely in good and healthy condition.   But  as

the  President  himself has stated,  we  must  start  now  to

prepare  to address future needs.  And Government has  always

had a tradition of planning very long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study did identify five sources of stress in our

families.  Of the five, the two main stressors are related to

livelihood which includes, amongst other things,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



financial situation and employment, and role obligations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to focus attention today on the care givers in

our  families,  addressing these two main stressors.   It  is

important for us to keep our care givers strong and sound and

whole, as only through this can we, in the longer term,  keep

our  families  strong and sound and whole.   Care  givers  in

families  can be both men and women, although at the  present

time, they are very largely the women in families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 Labour Force Survey it is reported that

women make up 42% of our 1.9 million work force in Singapore.

Of  these  806,000 women, 449,000  are married and  therefore

definitely needing to balance work and home responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the single women who are working doubtless have

also  family and home responsibilities to shoulder, but  that

is another subject for another day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Survey reports there are 390,400 economically

inactive persons aged from 25 to 54 years.  Of these, 360,000

of  them or 92% are women, and the reasons they give for  not

working  are  housework (69%), child care  (23%),  and  elder

care,  at this point of time, only just a bit below  1%.   Of

these  economically  inactive persons  in  Singapore,  49,000

indicated  that they would want to return to work within  the

next two years.  Of these, almost 37,000 are women in the  20

to  49  years  age group.  Interestingly, 51% of these  women

have  at least secondary education, in other words, they  are

what we would classify as skilled workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we help preserve the energy and the well-being of

these  care  givers in the family, at the  same  time  enable

their continued contribution to the nation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 Committee has obviously studied these

numbers, and has outlined some proposed solutions in  one  of

its   strategies,  Transforming  the  Work  Environment.    I

strongly   support  the  points  raised  in  this   strategy,

particularly  the encouragement of flexible work arrangements

and job redesign, and I would like to expand a little on this

idea.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Manpower 21 Report indicates that we have a long way

to  go  with  regard  to  flexible  work  arrangements.   The

percentage  of  our  workforce in flexible work  arrangements

stands at less than 1% compared to the US at 28%, the  UK  at

12% and Japan at 8.7%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me paint the spectrum of options it is possible to

offer  individuals so that they may try to match  these  with

their  particular requirements in balancing family and  work,

and  to  draw  on some actual working examples to demonstrate

that these arrangements are in fact eminently do-able.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, when the care giver needs, wants, and can

manage  to work full-time hours, flexibility in starting  and

ending times in the work day can facilitate balancing of work

and home schedules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, flexibility in how these hours are

organised can compress the work week and, for example, enable

more  days  off  in the week to attend to family  chores  and

still perhaps have a day left over for a breather.  If I  may

give  a working example, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from my  own

workplace, we have nurses, all of whom work 42 hours a  week,

but  in different units, work on a six-day, five-day or four-day  rotation.  The staff on the four-day rotation  work  12-hour  shifts  but get three days off in a week to  attend  to

other matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the duties at home are more onerous and the

care  giver  cannot manage a full-time job, making  available

part-time jobs or job sharing.  Certain jobs are very  easily

structured  for  part-time staffing or job sharing,  and  all

that  may be required may simply be a willingness to consider

doing  things differently from the past.  Other jobs are  not

so  obviously  suitable, and this is where some job  redesign

would be most helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, for those, usually young mothers who wish to take

a  period,  perhaps a few years, off to see a  child  through

infancy and early childhood, there are examples

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



how  this  can be facilitated, and the woman helped to  phase

back  into the job and workplace.  For example, Lombard North

Central,  a finance house in the UK, allows parents  extended

leave of up to five years to care for babies and toddlers, on

the  condition that they spend at least two weeks a year back

in  the  office, to maintain contacts and update  skills,  so

that the transition back to the job later becomes simpler and

smoother.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, our Civil Service has set a fine example of

allowing  no  pay leave after childbirth for child  care  for

mothers  of  up  to  four  years  per  child,  and  part-time

employment  for married women who are not able to work  full-time due to child care and family commitments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who have been out of the workplace for a long

while,  and  become very out of touch, who are  afraid  their

skills  may  have become obsolete, or just do  not  have  the

confidence  to  go  back to work, the investment  in  putting

together  a short refresher course, with no strings attached,

for such potential returning employees yields enough in terms

of the recruitment of good candidates to be well justified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again a real working example - albeit just a small

pilot  programme  -  of  a  two week refresher  course  which

attracted six participants out of 15 nurses contacted who had

stopped  work  some years prior, of whom five felt  confident

and  competent  enough after the course to  return  to  work.

This  is  quite a promising outcome for such a rare commodity

as experienced nurses!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, of course, there are jobs that will allow

teleworking  from  home, particularly with the  possibilities

now as Singapore becomes more and more a fully wired island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we could marry this palette of options with the

availability  of workplace on-site or near-site multi-service

child  and  elder care centres, we will have a picture   that

will surely brighten the homes of our families in the future.

And in this instance,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



hopefully  as near a future as we can possibly make it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully recognise of course that all of this is far

easier  said  than done, and certainly not  all  options  are

possible  for  all  jobs  in  all companies.  Companies  will

understandably  hesitate and need convincing that  these  are

initiatives that will be well worth the effort, and  in  fact

make sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where Government has a role to play, and should

take the lead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it can give encouragement in terms of tangible

support,  as indeed I believe the intention is under Manpower

21,  in  the  sourcing of consultancy in  job  redesign,  and

grants to defray the costs incurred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Government can commission local cost benefit

studies  relating to the retention of skilled and experienced

staff.  Companies need to be convinced to make the effort  to

engage   in   job  redesign.  Down  to  earth   bottom   line

considerations  are far more likely to move  them  than  warm

fuzzy arguments about keeping the family whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies in the US and Europe have studied the

situation  and  have been convinced enough to implement  many

such family friendly practices.  They are surely no less hard-nosed   about   their  bottom  lines  than  our   own   local

corporations. Britain's Midlands Bank, for example, estimated

that  the  cost of losing and replacing an experienced  staff

member  was  equivalent to the employee's  annual  employment

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I can see that some of our local companies may

not  be convinced that the US and European experience can  be

directly transposed to our situation. We need therefore local

data to convince them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, commercial enterprises often cite the

unavailability of space and cost as reasons  why  it  is  not

possible  for  them  to provide workplace childcare  centres.

Perhaps an equally good, if not better,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



option  will be for Government in its town planning to factor

in  the requirement to provide for multi-service care centres

within  each  big office and commercial  development.   These

centres  can  be run by a variety of agencies, to  serve  the

surrounding offices and companies.  This will be particularly

helpful for smaller companies which do not have the resources

to do this themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken so far on supporting the Manpower 21

proposal  to  Transform  the  Work  Environment.   There  is,

however,  another piece of transformation that also needs  to

occur  to preserve the strength of our families and to  allow

its  individual members to fully develop their potential, and

in  so doing contribute to both the economic and non-economic

viability of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This transformation is in the mindset and traditional

perception  of roles in the family, and the traditional  view

also  of care givers in the family.  Better sharing of  roles

and  responsibilities between wives and husbands, and mothers

and fathers will ultimately help families manage much better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will resist the temptation to take a familiar

Singaporean  approach,  to ask for  a  National  Campaign  to

facilitate this change in mindset.  We can achieve  the  same

result  by  sending  out  a clear and  strong  message  about

sharing  roles and responsibilities in families, but we  must

support  this message consistently in policies and in  action

that are not ambivalent but fully in line with the message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will take time, as all efforts to change attitudes

and  behaviour do, and so all the more reason  that  we  must

start  now.   And  in this, I would like to  call  the  Civil

Service  to  start  the ball rolling, and take  the  lead  in

setting   the   example   by   giving,   in   its   benefits,

acknowledgement to fatherhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This it can do by simply extending those of its benefits

relating  to child care, currently only for working  mothers,

to  either  parent.  I expect that it will be quite  a  while

before we see a deluge of fathers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



applying  for  a couple of years off for child  rearing,  but

even  now  I  am sure many fathers are more than prepared  to

take a sick child to the doctor.  By extending the sick child

leave  entitlement of five days per year per child under  six

years of age to be taken by either parent will truly send out

that  message loud and clear that fathers also  can  be  care

givers in the family.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak. I

thought I should  make a short response to one or two  points

in  Mr Jeyaretnam's speech.  He brings up certain allegations

against  the  police and CNB.  The bottom line  is  that,  in

fact,  we  have  had long debates in the past before  on  the

powers of police and law enforcement agencies.  Let me assure

him,  as  well as this House, once again that the police  and

law  enforcement  agencies  have the  trust  and  respect  of

Singaporeans and would not do anything that will betray  that

trust.   That  is why Singapore indeed is one of  the  safest

cities in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first point is about suspects not being

informed about grounds of arrest when a person is arrested by

the  police.   My understanding of police procedure  is  that

when  a  person is arrested he is informed generally  of  the

reason  why  he is arrested.  Of course, in some  situations,

for example, when he is struggling, that may not be possible,

but he is informed as soon as reasonable thereafter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other more substantive point is the case that he

brings  up,  ie, the CNB raid on Madam Doulath Beevi's  flat.

Mr  Jeyaretnam says that because there is no search  warrant,

therefore, CNB officers had violated the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general point must be that the police, CNB and

other law enforcement agencies enforce the law.  They do  not

act beyond the law.  They do not break the law.  For example,

in  this  case,  section 24(1) of the  Misuse  of  Drugs  Act

provides  that  any officer of the Bureau  may  at  any  time

without a warrant enter and search

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



any  place  or premises in which it reasonably believes  that

there  is to be found any controlled drug.  Here, there  were

circumstances which led CNB officers to believe that  such  a

situation  had occurred.  CNB would put up a fuller  response

in  the  press  on the background.  But let  me  assure  this

House,  because this slur has been cast earlier on, that  the

CNB had indeed acted within the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th August this year, acting on information

received,  CNB had arrested a person suspected to be  a  drug

trafficker.   He  was tested positive for  drug  consumption.

CNB  continued  with investigations into his  activities  and

monitored  the  numbers on his pager.  As  a  result  of  the

monitoring, five flats were raided: four of which,  in  fact,

yielded  positive results.  For the fifth flat, Madam Beevi's

flat, there were grounds for making the raid.  In fact, a few

days  after  the  arrest of the trafficker,  the  residential

telephone  number subscribed by Madam Beevi appeared  on  the

pager six times that day.  Hence, a team of CNB officers  was

deployed  to  check  out the address on  1st  September.   On

arrival  at her flat, the officers noted that the hall  light

and  the TV set were on.  The iron gate was unlocked but  the

wooden  door  was locked.  The officers then knocked  on  the

door  and identified themselves as CNB officers, contrary  to

what  Madam  Beevi had stated.  The officers also  repeatedly

knocked  on the door and identified themselves, as there  was

no  response  from within.  Then the officers heard  movement

within  the flat.  They were also able to see feet  shuffling

from  the  gap between the door and the floor.  The  officers

then  gave a warning that a forced entry would be made.  This

warning was repeated several times in English and Malay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the circumstances were such that the officers in that

situation acted within the law and procedures, and  gave  the

necessary warning.  Sir, this assurance to the House ought to

be  made,  so that no one leaves this Chamber today  thinking

that any Police or CNB officers had acted beyond the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I ask for a clarification, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Did the Police make good the door

that has been damaged during the raid and pay for the cost of

it?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Under the law, Police need

not  do  it,  unless they have damaged the door  with  wilful

neglect.   I understand that Madam Beevi has made  a  request

which  CNB  has referred to the AG's Chambers.   So  that  is

being considered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  first, I wish to thank the President for his  inspiring

Address.  It should give all Singaporeans a reaffirmed  sense

of  comfort and confidence, after we have experienced one  of

our worst economic crises since independence.  It is good  to

be  assured  that  Singapore has emerged  stronger  and  more

united.  But, although we have reasons to be optimistic about

the  economic  outlook, I feel we should not be too  euphoric

and lulled into a false sense of security.  We have to keep a

more balanced perspective of the present economic situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that less than a year ago, the

economic  outlook  of  our region was going  through  a  dark

tunnel with no light in sight.  And now, hardly a year later,

we are charged with anticipation and optimism.  The share and

property  market  has made more than a significant  recovery.

The  positive  sentiment has returned.   The  expectation  is

getting  higher and higher - increase in CPF points, increase

in  wages,  higher year-end bonus.  In short, there  is  much

jubilation and contentment in the air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us pause for a moment and make a more sombre

assessment,  and ask ourselves: Has the economic  fundamental

changed  that  much?   Has  the  economic  situation  of  our

neighbouring  countries truly recovered?  Is  the  future  as

bright as we make up to be?  Perhaps we have been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



too  much  influenced by the speed of the  recovery  and  the

mainly sentiment-driven projection.  The reality remains that

trouble  is  still brewing in the region.  The  situation  in

East Timor can be classified as unpredictable, at best.   And

the  outlook of the Indonesian presidential election is still

uncertain.   The same can be said of the Malaysian  election.

The  economic  decline of the Philippines  and  the  rest  of

ASEAN,  including  Korea and Japan, has only  been  arrested.

But  the sign of recovery is still at an early stage and from

now  on,  everything is still fluid.  Nobody can be  sure  of

which  direction it would turn, although there  are  positive

signs that recovery is well on its way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some unexpected turn of events can change the whole

situation.  All in all, even the most optimistic forecast can

only  be that the crisis is well over.  But the light we  see

at  the  end  of  the  tunnel is still  very  dim.   Although

Singapore  has always been said to be the least  affected  by

the  crisis, and because of our good governance and planning,

we  will  be  able  to  take  off  faster  than  any  of  our

neighbours.   There remains some very difficult times  ahead.

The  projection  of  GDP  growth  is  not  widespread.   Many

sectors,   such  as  construction  and  many  categories   in

manufacturing, are still experiencing negative  growth.   And

with an uncertain regional as well as global outlook, we need

to   be   cautiously   optimistic.   The  business   outlook,

especially in the private sector, is not that rosy.   Not  at

the  moment  anyway.  But it is important for us to  be  more

pragmatic  and remain vigilant, and not place our expectation

too high.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's timely reminder of the importance of

developing our people and strengthening our social bonds must

be  taken most seriously.  Although we have experienced  some

economic  and  social hiccups in the past, especially  during

our  early  turbulent years, for the past  15  or  20  years,

generally we have lived a peaceful and secure life.  The  few

problems we have experienced are relatively minor and nowhere

near  crisis  proportion.  So are we  prepared  for  a  major

crisis,  as  that had befallen some unfortunate countries  in

the world?  As a nation, how would we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



react  to  this crisis situation?  If a similar situation  of

what occurred in East Timor, Bosnia or Kuwait somehow happens

to  us, will our people be able to pull together and fight to

the end?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has through the years consciously

promoted a sense of belonging and love of our nation.  It has

provided  every Singaporean a stake in our country.   It  has

helped  everyone  own  a home and shares in  Government-owned

companies, and give everyone equal opportunities  to  make  a

success   in  life.   All  this,  in  the  hope  that   every

Singaporean  takes  root  in our  country.   But  Singapore's

history  is  still  very  young.   Will  the  people  be   as

vulnerable  as the "instant" trees we planted throughout  the

island  to transform Singapore into a Garden City in  such  a

short time?  For although they have grown fast and beautiful,

as those that take years to mature, the moment of truth comes

when  a  thunder storm strikes.  Many of these instant  trees

fall  because much as they look big and lush, the  roots  are

not  deep and the branches are brittle.  They have not passed

the test of time as those which took years to grow.  Have our

Singaporeans,  who have only experienced  a  few  decades  of

nationhood,  developed  strong branches  and  deep  roots  to

withstand any onslaught crisis, be it economic, political  or

religious,  or worse of all, an invasion by an over-ambitious

neighbour?  This will still remain a very big question mark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is comforting to note that we have a strong

SAF  which  possesses the most advanced weapon and equipment,

as  well as a well-trained fighting force, ultimately  it  is

not  the weapon or even the well-trained soldiers alone  that

can  win  the  war.  Throughout history we  have  known  many

battles  had been won by a lesser number of men and  weapons,

and through an indomitable will to fight.  We have read about

extreme  bravery  in  battle.  But it  was  usually  not  the

physical  strength  that  made the soldier  fight  above  his

limit,  but  his courage and total commitment to his  country

that gave him his strength.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while it is important for us to focus on

people development and social cohesion and religious harmony,

ensuring the sharing of wealth by everyone, most importantly,

we   have   to  instill  loyalty  and  patriotism  in   every

Singaporean.  We must make everyone understand what is  meant

by the Chinese words guo jia (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;); xian you guo, hou

you jia (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). It means that

our  country must come first before our home.  If our country

falls,  our  home  no  longer exists.  To  ensure  continuous

existence  of Singapore to have material possession,  a  good

life alone cannot motivate our people to stay and defend  our

country  when  threatened.  The fulfilment of  the  Singapore

dream  cannot  ensure unquestionable loyalty to  our  nation,

because  this dream can turn into a nightmare when things  go

wrong,  and it can from time to time, no matter how  well  we

govern ourselves and how carefully we plan for the future, as

Singapore  is  extremely  vulnerable  to  external   factors.

Therefore, we must develop a national pride and love for  our

land.   We must make everyone proud to be a Singaporean.   It

is  this emotional attachment that could distinguish us as  a

nation of patriots from a nation of immigrants, who may  feel

tempted to move on if they find that the pasture on the other

side  of  the fence is greener.  Only then when we are  faced

with  adversity, we will all stand up and fight and not  pack

up and go.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><b>THE NEED TO PRIORITISE PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE</b></div>

<br>5.14 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, today I would like to entreat the Ministry of Health  to

prioritise  preventive healthcare as the paramount  directive

for the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adage "prevention is better than cure" succinctly

defines a fact that everyone would accept wholeheartedly.  In

terms  of  maintaining  the best  state  of  health  for  any

population,  preventive medicine, rather than  an  excess  of

healthcare  facilities and services to cure the sick,  is  in

line  with the adage and is a fact that each one of  us  here

would also accept wholeheartedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must pursue all avenues to help the healthy

maintain  their well-being for as long as possible.   In  the

long run, it will be the continuous and concerted efforts  in

promoting preventive medicine that provides the best  quality

life  and contains the escalating cost of healthcare for  the

people  and the nation.  It is proven that if we can  succeed

in preventing the development of diseases in the first place,

we  would have achieved the ideal.  Classic examples of  this

would  be  in  the management of hypertension,  diabetes  and

hyper-cholesterolaemia, which predispose patients to cerebro-vascular  diseases.   Well-informed patients  generally  have

better outcome and better compliance with their treatment and

do  lead  quality life for much longer.  They are spared  the

incapacitating and results of strokes, heart attacks or renal

failure.   They are spared the agony of having to suffer  and

the  nation  is spared the burden of having to  pay  for  the

enormous   costs  of  treatment.   Sir,  the   rewards   from

preventive medicine will be immense if it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



is  done swiftly and if it is targeted towards the population

as  a whole.  The expenses now will yield abundant savings in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health allocates only 13%, or

thereabouts,  of  its budget towards primary  and  preventive

healthcare at the moment.  Sir, this clearly shows  that  the

emphasis on preventive medicine by the Ministry of Health  is

dismal.   The  1998 National Health Survey has revealed  that

more  Singaporeans have hypertension, high blood cholesterol,

diabetes  and  obesity now when compared to the situation  in

1992.   The  incidence rate of cervical cancer  had  declined

only  very  slightly  despite the availability  of  pap-smear

screening tests for women in Singapore in the past 30  years.

The  four  leading causes of death in Singapore are  cancers,

heart  diseases, pneumonia and cerebro-vascular diseases,  in

that   order.    Deaths  from  these  diseases  are   largely

preventable  and many potential cases can be averted  through

preventive healthcare.  The resultant effect will be  reduced

illnesses and increased quality life for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health must have a new mindset and

approach  in terms of preventive medicine if we  want  to  do

much  more than we have so far.  Why should the Ministry take

on this job single-handedly when we can tap all our resources

to give effective and positive results?  Sir, I would like to

suggest  that the Ministry of Health harness our  doctors  in

both  the  private and public sectors and have an  integrated

effort towards enhancement of preventive healthcare.  We have

already  in  place qualified and competent doctors  that  can

promote  preventive healthcare efficiently.  We  can  have  a

good go at it and I urge the Minister for Health to implement

directives  in  this important area of healthcare.   Perhaps,

the Ministry of Health would consider what I have in mind  in

nine areas as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To take off in this area of healthcare, the Ministry

must  first  want to revamp the existing model of  healthcare

and put up a bold and comprehensive new method of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



implementation  of preventive healthcare.  More  funding  and

allocation of personnel in preventive medicine have to be put

in  place.  The very crux of the issue is to reach out to the

people and efforts in this matter must be expanded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government, as the largest single employer in

the  country, must take the initiative and provide  free  and

basic  medical healthcare for all civil servants on a regular

basis.   Spending in this area now will be worthwhile in  the

longer  term.  We will be rewarded in time with  a  healthier

workforce.   The  quality of life for  the  workers  will  be

enhanced   because  they  will  be  less  prone  to   chronic

debilitating diseases in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expanding on the previous point, the Government

should  work  with more companies to facilitate  and  promote

preventive medicine.  As an example, more doctors and  nurses

can  be  made available to help companies conduct  preventive

check-ups  and to give talks on various topics of  preventive

healthcare.   When Prime Minister Goh launched  the  "Healthy

Lifestyle Campaign" this year, he said that the experience in

many  countries  around  the  world  has  shown  that  health

programmes   do   help   control   medical   costs,   improve

productivity, reduce absenteeism and heighten staff morale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There is a projected increase to about 800,000 aged

citizens  by the year 2030 and it is obvious that those  born

in the 1950s and 1960s will make up a majority of the elderly

of   tomorrow.   It  is  therefore  urgent  that  we   target

preventive  medicine on these citizens who are now  in  their

40s  and  50s.   Immediate and successful  implementation  of

preventive  healthcare  now is necessary  as  many  of  these

people may lapse into chronic ill health very soon indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there cannot be successful

implementation  of  anything unless the monetary  issues  are

addressed.   I  would like to urge the Finance  Ministry  and

Health Ministry to facilitate the people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



who  seek  preventive healthcare.  Perhaps, as a first  step,

tax  incentives  could  be  given to  employers  who  provide

preventive  healthcare  for  their  workers.   In   addition,

individuals  should  be  allowed to use  their  Medisave  and

MediShield  accounts  to  fund  their  expenses   for   basic

preventive healthcare.  I might venture to say that  allowing

use  of CPF funds for this purpose might even be superior  to

allowing  use of CPF funds for life insurance.   Thirdly,  we

should endorse the use of Medifund for the extremely needy as

these people would probably be those who are most in need  of

preventive healthcare but who are most deprived of it, either

due to ignorance or lack of funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The Ministry of Health should be proactive and

remain  savvy  in keeping up with the changing  and  pressing

problems  that arise from time to time and be ever  ready  to

alter course where necessary.  Being willing and prepared  to

re-evaluate and scrap existing unsuccessful methods would  be

a good virtue to have.  Consider the pap smear screening test

in  its  present  form.  It has been available  in  Singapore

since 1964 and yet the incidence rate for cervical cancer has

not  declined.  We should not have to wait 30  years  to  re-evaluate  this  failed  method, and should  have  implemented

better methods long before now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Sir, whilst it would be ideal for us to handle all

cancers  on  an  equal  basis, we have to  be  realistic  and

practical.   We  should  pay  more  attention  to  the   more

prevalent  and devastating of the cancers.  The  Ministry  of

Health must carry out comprehensive studies and elucidate the

necessary course of action.  Thus, preventive care  in  terms

of  breast  cancer should be prioritised since breast  cancer

is,  in  fact, the leading cancer amongst women in Singapore.

Three  new  cases  of  breast cancer are  detected  daily  in

Singapore.   The  incidence of breast cancer is  expected  to

increase  from  32.9 per 100,000 women in 1985  to  55.1  per

100,000  in year 2000.  By then, we are expecting  more  than

1,000  new  cases  to  be diagnosed every  year.   Preventive

healthcare is important because early detection is the single

most important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



factor  for  survival  of  patients.   25%  of  patients  who

presented with breast cancers of 3 cm in size would have died

from the disease five years after diagnosis and this would be

in spite of their having received all forms of treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) This next pointer involves acceptance of a new

mindset  and  a  radical approach.  The  Ministry  of  Health

should  involve the primary healthcare doctors in  preventive

healthcare  because  they are already looking  after  80%  of

patients at the level of primary healthcare.  I must, at this

juncture,  declare  that I am a doctor in  private  practice.

Preventive  care often involves giving a lot  of  advice  and

persuasion to the people directly.  General practitioners, as

family physicians, have better rapport and more time with the

patients,  are  eminently suited for this  function.   It  is

known   that   we  have  efficient  and  affordable   primary

healthcare  in  Singapore very much because we  have  a  good

spread of GP clinics, enough competent doctors and relatively

inexpensive  fees  for primary-care services  throughout  the

island.  It would be good if the Government could put forth a

scheme  that  harnesses  this primary healthcare  sector  for

preventive  medicine.  Not only will this be  cost  effective

and efficient, this will also give patients the advantage  of

increased accessibility and convenience to this type of care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The Ministry of Health should also prioritise

preventive healthcare in terms of more public education.   It

is  necessary for the public to be reminded that they  should

and can maintain good health.  We must accept that it will be

through continuous education and considerable patience before

we  can hope for a change of mindset amongst our people.   We

must  impress upon the people that they should not be seeking

healthcare only when they have become sick.  They  should  be

encouraged to have routine medical check-ups to detect  early

stage   diseases.   To  provide  for  more  scope  in  public

education,   we   need  to  provide  for  the   training   of

"facilitators"  who  promote  preventive  healthcare.   These

"facilitators"   may  be  polyclinic  nurses,   neighbourhood

doctors, community centre grassroots

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



leaders  or  various  company  personnel  officers.   A  more

integrated  and  a  more consistent approach  island-wide  to

promote  different aspects of preventive healthcare could  be

initiated.  The Community Development Councils (CDCs) or even

the  community centres can be involved in this area with  the

guidance of the Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the need to prioritise

preventive  healthcare  must not be  underscored  and  should

definitely  be  an important directive for  the  Ministry  of

Health.  In order to further improve the health of the people

and  enhance  the  healthcare in this  country  in  the  next

millennium, we ought to push for a prompt and serious  effort

on  the implementation of preventive healthcare.  Sir, we are

fortunate here in Singapore as we have the means to afford  a

world-class  home  for  our people.   Nevertheless,  we  must

always  try  to strive for the better and desire  to  improve

upon   what  we  have.   This  Government  has  always   been

discerning  and  knows  what  is best  for  Singaporeans  and

Singapore.   I  am sure the Government knows  that  promoting

preventive  healthcare is one of those items that  should  be

top  on  the  list of what is best for us.   My  concern,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, is that we do not hasten  and  act  on

getting  what we need as a matter of urgency.  We do have  an

abundance  of ideas and a fair measure of means to  get  what

the  world can offer, let us go for the quality life that  we

want all Singaporeans to have in their world-class home.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  first  let me thank the Member, Dr  Lily  Neo,  for

bringing  up this issue.  Let me address two broad principles

first before I take on the nine specific suggestions that she

put up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Ministry of Health agrees

wholeheartedly with Dr Lily Neo that prevention is better and

indeed  cheaper than cure. That philosophy is what is driving

the Ministry of Health. Second, on the question of more money

and  more  resources, by and large, I would  agree  that  the

spending priorities of a Ministry reflect

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



the  priorities of the Ministry but one should be careful  in

not taking that statistic too far.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo mentioned that preventive healthcare takes

up  only  13%  of  MOH's  budget and  that  the  emphasis  is

therefore   dismal.   As  Dr  Lily  Neo  herself   mentioned,

preventive  healthcare  is  not that  expensive  compared  to

hospitalisation. So, 13% does not mean that  we  do  not  put

enough  priority  on preventive healthcare.  The  reason  why

preventive  healthcare  is such a small  percentage  is  that

hospitalisation   is  very  expensive  and   the   Government

subsidises  hospitalisation costs to a very large extent,  to

the tune of 80% for our Class C wards, 65% for Class B wards,

and  so  on.   If the Government had subsidised our  Class  C

wards  at  50%  rather  than 80%, and  the  other  wards  are

subsidised correspondingly, then overnight, the percentage of

budget  on  preventive healthcare would more than double,  to

more than 25%.  I am sure Dr Lily Neo would not say that this

is  a  good statistic.  But 13% amounts to $130 million which

is  being spent every year on preventive healthcare and  that

is  not  a  small  sum.   We  do lay emphasis  on  preventive

healthcare. We are consistently looking out for new  ways  to

improve and how we should approach this issue, and therefore,

we are grateful to Dr Neo for bringing up some suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the nine areas which she has brought

up.   But for Members to understand these suggestions and put

them  into  context,  let me first explain  how  we  approach

preventive  healthcare in the Ministry.  We divide preventive

healthcare into four areas.  The first component is  to  make

sure we have the foundation for a healthy population and that

means  very sound pre-natal/post-natal care and a very  sound

school  health and school dental programme. This  makes  sure

that  our population is given the best level of care  in  the

early  stages  of their lives and, therefore, they  have  the

foundation to keep their health sound.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members know our immunisation programme for our young

children  is  among  the  best  in  the  world.   Our  infant

mortality  rate  ranks among the lowest among  the  developed

countries.  Our track record is excellent.  Our school health

and  dental  programme has done extremely well.  We  are,  of

course, on the lookout to see how we can improve this better.

So  I  would say that for the first component on making  sure

that  our  population starts off healthy,  I  think  we  have

achieved that to a large extent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component is how to keep the adult

Singaporeans  healthy, how to encourage them  to  maintain  a

healthy  lifestyle, ie, having given them a sound foundation,

how  to  maintain a healthy lifestyle throughout their lives.

We have started this campaign on Healthy Lifestyle many, many

years  ago.   We have had some limited successes but  we  are

fighting  against  strong  odds.  Singaporeans  are   getting

richer,  their food gets richer and their lifestyle  is  more

sedentary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to promoting a healthy lifestyle now takes

on  more than just a general exhortation of Singaporeans  but

also  targetting at different groups, ie, those groups  which

are  more  vulnerable to a more sedentary  lifestyle  and  to

poorer  healthy lifestyle habits.  We have taken the campaign

to  the  workplace. We are targetting at people in their  30s

and 40s because as Dr Neo herself mentioned, it is this group

that  would bring along their health problems later  on  when

they  grow  older.   But  promoting and  maintaining  healthy

lifestyle  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  tasks  in   our

preventive healthcare programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third component of our preventive healthcare

programme is screening. We take a very targetted approach  to

look  at  those groups who are most vulnerable  and  try  and

detect  these groups early so that we can prevent the disease

from  starting or from getting worse.  There is a lot in  the

medical  literature on the efficacy of the  different  health

screening procedure. The Ministry of Health here takes a very

pragmatic  approach. We do not advocate widespread  universal

medical screening.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We screen the population and we encourage screening

where it is effective.  If somebody maintains his health  and

has  a  healthy lifestyle, there is very little that he needs

to  do  in terms of medical screening.  If you do not  smoke,

maintain  your  weight  within a certain  recommended  range,

every  time you see your GP, he takes your blood pressure  to

make  sure that it is within the recommended range and if  it

is  high you try to take measures to bring it down.  If every

year  you  take a simple blood test to check your cholesterol

level  and blood sugar, that would give an indication whether

you are diabetic or not.  By and large, if people maintain  a

healthy lifestyle and take simple tests like these, we should

be  able to screen out those who are more vulnerable.  And  I

think  more  can  be done to target those  groups  which  are

vulnerable. Some of the suggestions have been brought  up  by

Dr Lily Neo and I would go to them in detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth component is what we call preventive

healthcare.    That  means  having detected  people  who  are

vulnerable, for example, people who are diabetic, how do  you

get  them  to manage their situation so that their  situation

does  not  get worse and, in so doing, present more expensive

healthcare issues for us.  So that is the fourth category.  I

would  say  that  most of the suggestions that  Dr  Lily  Neo

brought  up  deal with the third and fourth categories,  that

is,  how do we target the groups for screening, those who are

more  vulnerable, and also how do we better manage the groups

which are diabetic or the older groups and that we can manage

their health situations well enough so that they do not lapse

into more difficult problems for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address the nine areas now. First, more funding

and more people.  I think I have done that.  If a measure  is

worthy  of  implementation, I can assure the House  that  the

Ministry  of Health will find the funds to implement  it.  So

funding is never a big problem with us.  But it does not mean

that we will throw good money and that we feel proud that  we

have  increased  the  amount of money we  spent.   It  really

depends on the usefulness of the programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government should take the initiative as the

biggest  employer to provide free and basic medicare  to  all

civil servants.  Members know that is not our approach.   For

healthcare financing, the minimum that we would want is cost-sharing so that people value the services provided for  them.

I  do  not  think  we  should walk away with  the  idea  that

anything  that is free would solve the problem.  I  was  told

that we implemented a mammography screening project from 1994

to  1997, but only half of the women turned up for screening,

even  though the screening was provided free of  charge.   In

other  words,  it  was  not the cost of  the  screening  that

deterred the women, but rather the lack of awareness  of  the

need  of  the screening, the fear of the screening  procedure

and  sometimes, the fear of knowing the result that made half

of  the  women not to turn up for the screening, even  though

the screening was provided entirely free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that money cannot solve all problems. I

think  the  more difficult part of the problem is to  educate

the  population, to get them to understand the need and  also

to  target  at  the  groups  that are  most  vulnerable.  For

example,  if you have free mammography screening, the  better

educated  women who can best afford the fees would take  this

up.   But the less educated women, maybe the 50% who did  not

turn  up  for  the  screening, are  the  ones  who  are  more

vulnerable.  I would think that the greater effort should  be

at targetting the groups which are most vulnerable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to work with companies to conduct

check-ups, etc.  I think this is one of the areas that we are

embarking on, that is, to take preventive healthcare into the

companies, into the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth area is to target at people in their 40s and

50s.  I agree entirely with Dr Lily Neo.  I think we must try

and address these age groups early rather than deal with them

when they turn 60s.  By then, the problem is already there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the fifth area, Dr Neo suggested tax incentives for

employers who provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



preventive  healthcare.  I will pass this on to the  Ministry

of  Finance but preventive healthcare programme, as I say, is

not very expensive and therefore, I am not sure how effective

this would be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also suggested the use of Medisave for preventive

healthcare  cost.   There are no clear-cut arguments  for  or

against  the use of Medisave.  We must realise that  Medisave

savings  can  only  meet a certain portion  of  our  lifetime

healthcare  cost.  If you spend it on preventive  healthcare,

and  you  are  unfortunate  enough  to  have  an  episode  in

hospital, then you have to dig into your pocket, and that can

be  a very expensive episode.  Alternatively, if people spend

this  small amount needed to keep their health in good shape,

like going to the GP which costs $20 or $30, where people pay

out  of  their pocket, then they keep their Medisave for  the

more  costly episodes in the hospital.  So it does not really

matter  as  long  as  everybody saves and  that  saving  goes

towards paying part of the lifelong healthcare cost that  all

of us will probably end up having to incur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On pap-smear screening, I agree that our track record

has  not been such a sterling performance and that is because

we  have  not  made  it  universal. We  have  encouraged  and

exhorted the women to go for pap-smear screening but  it  has

not  been universally made available.  We would look at  this

programme because I think there are medical merits in running

pap-smear screening and we would see how this can be taken up

together with mammography.  We have encouraged

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



the Breast Cancer Foundation and in the three years since  it

has  started,  it has done good work to promote awareness  of

breast  cancer  and  the  effectiveness  of  early  detection

through  mammography.  My Ministry is also working  with  the

grassroots organisations and CDCs to help encourage women  to

go  for  pap-smear  screening for cancer of  the  cervix  and

mammography screening for breast cancer.  We are  piloting  a

pap-smear screening programme in Toa Payoh next year with the

view to extending this programme on a nation wide basis later

so  that  we  can  have  an effective outreach  programme  to

prevent cancer of the cervix.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area that we want to target at is the senior

citizens and to address this issue of affordability,  we  are

having  a  geriatric screening programme with the College  of

Family  Physicians so as to draw in the GPs, and the  funding

would  be made through the Singapore Totalisator Board  which

had  agreed  to  subsidise 75% of the cost.   So  an  elderly

person  would co-pay only 25% of the cost, ie,  only  $5.  We

would embark this geriatric screening programme together with

the   College   of  Family  Physicians  and   the   Singapore

Totalisator Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at Fourteen minutes

past Five o'clock pm and the Debate having continued for half

an  hour,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker adjourned  the  House  without

Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
