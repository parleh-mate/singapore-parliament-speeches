<div align="center"><b>MAIN ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR 1964</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply

[1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the Main Estimates, 1964.

For the convenience of hon. Members, I intend taking

the  total for each head as it appears in  the  last

column  of the abstract of estimated expenditure  on

pages  37  and 38 of Paper Cmd. 30 of 1963.  We  are

dealing now with the Heads of Expenditure in respect

of which amendments stand on the Order Paper.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 3-



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 3 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to know how public funds are being used in the Legislative Assembly. I would like to know whether Government documents used in the Legislative Assembly could also be printed in all the four official languages. The Prime Minister has said that he intends to appoint a Puisne Judge

to  be  the  Speaker of the Legislative Assembly.  I

would like to know the position on this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. I hope there will be more

supplies  of  different  kinds  of  books  for   our

reference in the Assembly Library. This will help us

to  understand better the situation and all  matters

relating  to  the  State  and  to  the  society   in

Singapore in general.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

the Member has raised several points. I do not think

I  need  labour  the House with a long  harangue  on

lines diametrically opposite to those that have been

delivered  by Members in the Opposition,  apart  for

the   fact   that  if  we  had  not   made   special

arrangements for terms and conditions of merger, the

Member for Jalan Kayu would not have been here today

even in spite of the split vote in his constituency.

Being unable to speak English or Malay, he would  be

out,  disqualified, and unable to take part in  this

debate. First of all, whilst we do not expect him to

thank  us for our forbearance and the great care  we

have taken to see that people like him should not be

penalised,  at least we do not expect  him  to  come

here   and  cause  unnecessary  trouble  by  raising

problems about equality of languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of the Speaker. The Government

has  announced its intention, and this is  a  matter

which   requires   the  consent   of   the   Federal

Government.  Needless to say,  if  the  consent  has

already been obtained, an appointment may well  have

been made. The problem is whether we can satisfy the

Federal  Government  to come  to  some  arrangement

whereby  one  of the judicial officers can,  at  the

same time, either be seconded or otherwise freed, do

these duties. At the right time and when finality is

reached, the House will be informed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the Library. I do not know

whether the Member for Jalan Kayu believes that  the

Assembly  Library  is  really  meant  for  political

tracts  and dissertations. If he did, then  I  think

really  the place for it is the National Library.  I

am  sure  all the treatises and pamphlets  which  he

wants  to read, for instance, about infantile  Left-wing adventurism and how generally not to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



make  Marx  and Lenin look like fools in  Singapore,

can  be  obtained in the National Library.  But  the

Assembly Library is normally concerned with  records

of  proceedings of this Legislature and treatises on

rules, procedures and Standing Orders of this House.

I  am  not  saying that there is no  vast  store  of

literature  in the other languages. They  all  have:

Chinese,  Tamil and, not least, Malay.  But  whether

there are any useful publications to help Members in

the  deliberations of this House is another  matter.

If the Member for Jalan Kayu can make out a case why

he  has  been  at a disadvantage because  he  cannot

understand,   for   instance,   Erskine    May    on

parliamentary  practice  and  procedure,  we   might

seriously  consider setting up a team of translators

to  translate such useful treatises on parliamentary

procedures, if he really finds that there is a  need

for  that, and that he is at a disadvantage  because

he does not understand the English language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, only two days ago the Prime  Minister

said  in  his  speech that he welcomed opinions  and

criticisms  from  even  his  own  Back-benchers  and

Members from the Opposition. But when we put forward

suggestions such as this one, he does not take  them

seriously. I remember the Member for Jalan Kayu  has

pointed  out  that  the  P.A.P. always  raise   the

question  of the Communist bogey. If everything  can

be  explained  away on the pretext of the  Communist

bogey,  then nothing can be resolved. If he can  use

this term to evade every question, why should it  be

necessary to have any debate in this House?  I  hope

those  Members of the P.A.P. who were in this  House

some time ago, and who are now still here, will help

to persuade the P.A.P. leadership to implement truly

the  use  of the four official languages, orally  as

well  as  written, in this Legislative  Assembly.  I

hope  the  Prime  Minister  has  not  forgotten  the

promise he made some time in the past. What is wrong

with making this suggestion to use the four official

languages, orally as well as written, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



all  the printed papers? I would like him to let  us

know   whether   there  are  any   difficulties   in

implementing  this suggestion. We cannot  deny  that

the Legislative Assembly occupies quite an important

position,  dealing as it does with  all  matters  of

State and public affairs in Singapore. Therefore, it

is necessary that the four official languages should

be  used  in  the  Legislative Assembly.  The  Prime

Minister,  of course, will remember that  there  are

Members in this House who do not understand English.

If  all the documents are in English, then those who

cannot  master the English language will, of course,

find  it  difficult to take part in the business  of

this House. Our suggestion is to enable every Member

to  understand the matter under discussion  and  the

business  that is conducted in this House so  as  to

help   in   conducting   the  Assembly   proceedings

smoothly.  The Prime Minister thinks that those  who

do  not  understand  will have  only  themselves  to

blame. We hope that the books in the Library will be

in  other  languages  as well  as  in  English.  The

Assembly Librarian will be in a position to look for

the relevant books. In addition to books in English,

we  also hope there will be books in Chinese,  Malay

and Tamil available in the Assembly Library.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what books to supply to the Library, this

question  can  be  thrashed  out  by  the  Librarian

himself.  Why should the Prime Minister  talk  about

buying  books on Marxism and Leninism? In  fact,  we

have   never  asked  for  these  books.  Hence   the

Government are not sincere in wanting to solve  this

question.   On  the  other  hand,  they   want   the

Opposition Members to make suggestions as to how  to

improve  the running of this Assembly --- [Interruption]

The  Member for Jalan Besar should not say that.  We

are  not  the librarians of this Assembly or keepers

of  the  Library. We should trust the Librarian.  He

will   be  able  to  get  all  the  relevant   books

--- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the Member for

Jalan Besar is interested in these books, of course,

we  are not opposed to the buying of books like  The

Adventures of Pinnochio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the appointment of the Speaker of

this  House, the answer given by the Prime  Minister

about appointing a Puisne Judge to be the Speaker is

very  vague.  We have now elected a  Speaker  and  a

Deputy Speaker, and these persons are Members of the

P.A.P. What we want to say is that we hope the Prime

Minister will not forget that it has been two and  a

half  months since the general election was held  on

the  21st  of  September. If the Prime  Minister  is

serious  about  getting a Puisne  Judge  to  be  the

Speaker,  his  appointment to  be  approved  by  the

Central  Parliament, how is that we  still  have  to

wait for the appointment of this Puisne Judge as our

Speaker?  Why should they elect a Deputy Speaker?  I

want  to know whether it is because they are  unable

to  find a Puisne Judge to be Speaker. Whether it is

because of the P.A.P.'s arrogance that some  of  the

Judges do not want to come here to be the Speaker of

this  House? Who insult the Judges? It is the P.A.P.

who  always insult other people. We agree  that  the

P.A.P. should appoint a Judge to be the Speaker  of

this House ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): When did

we agree to this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not know what the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Culture

is  talking  about. I have no need to reply  to  the

questions  put forward by the Back-benchers  of  the

Party in power --- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Please allow the Member to

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Secondly, yesterday

the  Minister  for  Culture was  consistently  going

against the rules and Standing Orders of this  House

when he made his speech. Therefore, we have no doubt

why some of the Judges do not want to be the Speaker

of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



House. It is because of the arrogant attitude of the

P.A.P. --- [Interruption]. It is a fact. As  Opposition

Members,  sometimes we feel sorry  for  the  Speaker

when he is in a very difficult position ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>

<b></b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for Jalan Kayu has moved this

amendment.  Just because he does not understand  the

documents  which are printed in English,  he  cannot

blame  the  Assembly or the Budget, because  in  the

past four years, especially when he was a member  of

the  P.A.P., there was a provision in the Budget  to

enable Members to learn Malay and English and  other

languages. You are lazy. You do not want to make  an

effort to learn English or Malay ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I doubt

whether now is the time to debate the proceedings in

this House or to debate the question of our Assembly

Members. It seems that the Minister is debating  the

Member for Jalan Kayu. I do not know what subject we

should be discussing ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Just allow the Minister to

speak on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): He himself has

been unable to master either English or Malay or any

of  the  four  official  languages.  He  has  always

allowed  himself  to be led by the nose  by  others.

Now,  what  more  does he want to complain?  He  now

complains that there are not enough books for him to

serve  as  references.  He also  complains  that  he

cannot understand the books in English. Even  if  we

give you books and documents in Chinese, you may not

be  able to understand too. Even if we translate all

the  documents and even the Budget into Chinese, you

will  not  understand it, you will not  be  able  to

comprehend it. What is the use?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should thank the institution of this Legislative

Assembly,  because the Government is providing  $500

allowance per month to enable them to criticise  and

attack the Government. In how many countries can you

find these things in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



practice?  Not to talk about freedom of  speech.  If

you dare to attack the Government or any leaders  of

the  Government in certain countries, you will  land

in  gaol  or be banished or even disappear.  Now  in

this   House  Assemblymen  have  various  kinds   of

privileges. They are not liable to court action  for

their  speeches  made  in this  House  and  are  not

restricted  under  normal laws.  Now,  this  is  the

spirit of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These few days we have to put away all our work to

come  to  this  House to listen to  their  speeches.

Whatever   they   talked  was  like   a   stereotype

gramophone  record played over and over again,  like

an old grandmother's tale - long and stinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members are even boasting about the

length  of their speeches, requesting us to  compete

with them in the length of speeches. That is not the

purpose  of this House. Neither is it the  principle

of  legislative proceedings. They want to  have  all

documents,  the  Budget and Bills to  be  translated

into the three remaining official languages. At  the

moment,  they have the right and the opportunity  to

make  their speeches in Mandarin. But do  they  know

how  much money will have to be spent in translating

all  these  documents and papers into all the  three

other  official languages? This sum could very  well

have  been used for other useful purposes,  such  as

building  roads and providing social  amenities  and

facilities. Even if we provide documents and  papers

in  Chinese, the Member for Jalan Kayu  may  not  be

able  to understand them. He has raised the question

of books in the Library. I remember that in the last

session,  there  were  certain publications  in  the

Library  called Monitoring Digest containing printed

records  of  radio broadcasts from other  countries.

Now  this is for the use of certain people who  have

need to study them. These Monitoring Digests are not

for  publication, and in the organ  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  they print certain quotations  from  these

Digests, not from material supplied by the Voice  of

America, but from North Kalimantan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



Radio,   material  advocating  the  destruction   of

Malaysia and making anti-Malaysia speeches.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it

pains  me to find that the Minister for Labour whose

skin  is  not  white  - but our Prime  Minister's  is

somewhat red ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I

wonder  whether the fact that my skin  is  white  or

yellow has got anything to do with ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> The point of order is that the

Member  is making remarks irrelevant to what we  are

discussing.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Labour has also made

personal  remarks  about the  Member.  He  said  the

Member for Jalan Kayu could not read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If your skin is

white,  perhaps you could justify yourself  to  your

forefathers and speak in English in this House,  and

you  will  be  justified in criticising  others  for

being unable to speak English.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Point of order, Sir, I do not

remember making any reference to my ancestors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): My suggestion for

the  amendment is made for the cause of equality  of

the  four  official languages in  this  House.  This

Assembly  is the highest law-making body and  should

be  the right place for implementing respect for all

the  four  languages. It is the duty of the Assembly

to   implement  it,  because  Singapore  society  is

composed  of various races. Since this House  is  an

important body in the State, we should use  all  the

four languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has just now mentioned the

extra  expenditure  incurred  in  translating  these

documents. But in the Ministry of Culture  there  is

plenty of literature which nobody wants to read  and

which is a waste of public funds. Can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



they  justify  their expenditure on publications  of

the Ministry of Culture?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are now

debating   the  proposed  cut  in  the   Legislative

Assembly vote. But I am afraid the Member for  Jalan

Kayu  is talking about the Ministry of Culture,  and

the  waste  of  money  on the  publications  of  the

Ministry of Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member is trying to make his

point. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Fortunately the

Speaker   has   some  experience  in   guiding   the

proceedings  of  this House, otherwise  what  is  to

become  of  this House? There will be disrespect  in

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have reference books which might have

come  from  other countries. The Prime Minister  has

been touring various countries in the world and  has

therefore  acquired some knowledge  and  knows  more

from his experience. In the same way, we should also

be  given  the opportunity to acquire more knowledge

and  know more things through literature in  various

languages.  This is good for all and this suggestion

is  reasonable. I would urge the Government  not  to

evade  the  question  by  saying  that  this  is   a

political  issue.  I  hope that  the  four  official

languages could be treated equally. This  is  not  a

political question.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I am

surprised  to  see the behaviour of  the  Opposition

Members  today.  They appear to be so  keen  on  our

expanding the Assembly Library. As Members  of  this

Assembly,  elected  by  the people,  we  should  not

depend on others to bring forward our arguments into

this  Assembly.  The Government have  established  a

National  Library  where  books  in  all  the   four

languages  are  available  there.  Members  of   the

Assembly  are  provided with a special Library,  and

they, as well as members of the public, should go to

the National Library for their books of reference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. A. Gonzales (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  really  do  not  know   why   the

Opposition  Members have asked for  a  reduction  in

Head 3 - Legislative Assembly - and, at the same time,

ask  for  translations in the four  languages.  What

they  should  have done is to ask the  Minister  for

Finance  to  increase the amount  allocated  to  the

Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last four days we have had dreary speeches

about  the  unemployment  position.  The  Opposition

Members  have  said that there is  unemployment  all

over Singapore. What they should have done is to ask

the Government to increase the number of typists and

translators probably in the Legislative Assembly  in

order that they can have translations, and therefore

create employment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I feel

that  equal  treatment  of  the  four  languages  is

exposed as a falsehood in this Assembly. We see that

the  P.A.P. is only paying lip service to the policy

of  equal treatment of the four languages.  Even  in

this  House this equal treatment cannot  be  put  to

work. The P.A.P. is playing about with this question

of  giving  equal treatment. We are not  asking  for

something  that cannot be done. It is  not  fair  to

have everything only in the English language. If  we

are  really sincere in giving equal treatment to the

four languages, then it should first be done in this

House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I think I had better bring

the  debate back to the rails. Perhaps I  will  give

them   the  best  construction  possible  on   their

motives.  The  best  construction  is,  I  think,  a

genuine misunderstanding on their part. The Assembly

Library is not an ordinary library meant for general

reading.  The  purpose of the  Library  is  to  have

treatises on parliamentary procedure and practice as

in   Britain   and  other  parts  of   the   British

Commonwealth  which have adopted this  parliamentary

practice.  There  are, therefore, no  Chinese  books

written on this anywhere in the world, nor for  that

matter Malay hooks or Tamil books.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  if Members of the Opposition  feel  that

they  find  any  particular  kind  of  text-book  of

assistance,   i   will   seriously   consider    the

proposition  that  translations  should   be   made.

[Interruption] One at a time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I intend to meet all the points that have been raised. As for the Library, as I have said, if the Barisan really want any other reading material, then the proper place is not the Assembly Library but the National Library. When we come to the Ministry of Culture estimates, that is the time

to  point out whether or not the Ministry of Culture

is  doing its duty in providing reading material and

literature  in the Chinese language - indeed  in  any

other language, Tamil and Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I really ask them to consider whether, in fact,

they want to pursue this matter. If they really want

to,  then  I  say I am quite prepared.  The  leading

textbook   on   Constitutional   and   Parliamentary

Practice  is  Erskine May's, a book  of  over  1,000

pages, full of technicalities. If necessary, I  will

even consider a commission to translate it if it  is

of  any value to Members opposite. Other than  that,

we   get   donated  to  us  proceedings   of   other

Parliaments  in  the British Commonwealth;  free  of

charge, they give them to us and we put them in  the

Library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the point of substance is - I agree

this  is  a point of substance - about notice papers,

and   so  on.  Members  will  notice  that  at   the

ceremonial  opening of the Assembly the Order  Paper

for  that day was printed in four languages. If  the

staff  of  this  Assembly  plus  the  staff  of  the

Government Printing Office can cope with  the  work,

we  will  likewise do every single  Order  Paper.  I

concede that. What I would like to point out is that

we have inherited a Government Printing Office which

only  prints in English. The Ministry of Culture  is

at  the  present moment trying to build up a section

that  can  print in Malay, Tamil and  Chinese.  When

that section is built up, and provided we can at the

same time build up a coterie of translators, we will

let all Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



have   all  notifications  in  all  four  languages.

[Interruption] Do they want it? Surely I am assuming

that  they do not want us to do it only in  Chinese.

If we do it, then we have got to do it also in Malay

and Tamil. [Interruption] That is a matter ---



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it seems that you remain silent  when

the Opposition Members interrupt the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps it is because the Prime

Minister was speaking English.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the plain fact of the

matter  is  this. This was decided by  an  All-Party

Commission  back  in 1957 and the  Members  opposite

besides  the Member for Jalan Kayu may not be  aware

of this. But it was found that it is impossible with

the  administration at present constituted with both

the  clerical  staff - the Government  Printing  side

- and   interpreters   at  our   disposal   to   have

simultaneous records of all documents distributed to

Members  in  four  languages.  And  therefore,   for

convenience sake, they retain the use of English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will be quite frank and say that it will

never  be  possible  at any time  to  run  all  four

records in all four languages. It is something which

not even the United Nations can successfully do. But

I  do  promise the Members opposite that  whilst  we

will  always maintain the liberty of each Member  to

use   his   own  language,  the  moment  there   are

sufficient   men  and  material  and  the   printing

capacity to do it, the records will be kept  in  the

national  language.  And I do urge  the  Member  for

Jalan Kayu to utilise the opportunity we offered him

in  the last Assembly and in this Assembly to really

make an effort, otherwise if in five years' time  we

have  built  up this whole apparatus,  he  may  find

himself illiterate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, about the Speaker. But before I go to

that,  I  would  like to make this  point.  I  think

Members  on the opposite side run a very grave  risk

of playing this dangerous line of saying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



that  we  are not equal. Sir, I am prepared to  meet

this problem all the time and every time. But I  say

that  they have already been well isolated from  the

mass  of  the public, playing all kinds of dangerous

external lines. The foreign policy of the P.K.I. is

the internal policy of the Barisan. Now they play on

language  and sentiments. It is our job to see  that

these  very sensitive and highly-charged issues  are

played down. And I say, if they have a genuine point

to  make, I will meet it genuinely. But generally to

say  that  we are not treating the Chinese  language

- and  really they are only interested in the Chinese

language; let us be quite frank about that  - equally

with  the  others,  I say that it  is  not  only  an

untruth  but a positively dangerous line to  pursue.

If  they have a genuine complaint and if they do not

really understand what is being said in the notices,

I  will consider during Assembly sittings to try  to

get some translators seconded from the Courts to try

and   help   them.  But  this  is  not   a   genuine

misunderstanding  or incapacity to comprehend.  This

is  deliberate mischief making, and I say they do so

at  their  peril. This is a country  with  a  plural

society. If we play one without taking into  account

the  sensitivities of the others, there will be real

trouble. So I urge them not to pursue this line. Our

policy  of equal treatment for the four streams  was

decided by an All-Party Commission, that it is  only

feasible   to  have  one  administrative   language.

Wherever possible - at ceremonial openings, and so on

- we  put it in all languages. If really there  is  a

need,  they  do  not understand it,  I  am  prepared

during  Assembly sittings, as I have said, to  bring

in  interpreters. But to play this as  a  propaganda

line is a very dangerous line. I will meet it. I say

we  will  survive. But I am not so sure whether  the

country  can  stand these stresses and strains.  One

thing  is definite. If the next wretched riot  takes

place,  like  the Bertha Hertogh riot, we  will  not

have  enough policemen to guard the Member for Jalan

Kayu and all the Members opposite.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the Speaker. I had hoped that

Members  opposite would have shown a certain  amount

of decorum and good taste. They say they welcome our

desire to appoint a High Court Judge concurrently as

Speaker  of this Assembly. They have cast aspersions

that  perhaps  no High Court Judge wishes  to  be  a

Speaker.  I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, you are  in  an

invidious  position in that you lean over  backwards

to  be more than fair to them, because there can  he

no allegation about that. And I see the advantage of

having an impartial non-party Speaker who is doing a

completely  impartial duty, like a  Judge,  to  take

this  office. I have explained publicly  the  reason

for  the  need  to get the consent  of  the  Central

Government,  because the Judiciary  is  now  in  the

Federal  vote. I do not want to go into the details.

I  have been pressed now. All right, I will say this

now.  The Central Government having taken the advice

of  not our Judiciary - our Judiciary is quite  happy

with this arrangement and is quite prepared to allow

one  of  the  Judges concurrently to act as  Speaker

- but  the  Federal side of the Judiciary  feel  that

they should not duplicate their functions. I am  now

putting   forward  a  proposition  to  the   Central

Government that perhaps one Judge could be  seconded

to  fulfil  this  function  for  the  term  of  this

Assembly, and if the next Assembly does not wish  to

have  him  continue, then he can go back  and  be  a

Judge.  This  matter requires a  certain  amount  of

deliberation  and consideration.  But  I  think  one

thing  is  quite clear, Mr Speaker, Sir.  What  the

Members on the opposite side understand is the  kind

of  fight they carry out where they kick a man  when

he is down and if they had won ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has elapsed. Will the

Member for Jalan Kayu indicate whether he wishes  to

withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to withdraw my amendment. But ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order. My point

of  order  is  that  when  a  Member  withdraws,  he

withdraws. He does not make another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



speech. I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir. One  of

the  problems  which I wanted to anticipate  was  to

have a Speaker who also understands the language  of

the  Opposition in order that they can be  checkmate

before   they   are   out  of  order   through   the

interpretation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $701,300 for Head 3 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 6 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 6 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (3)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that when we raise many questions the

P.A.P. Members always harp on the need to economise.

I  do not understand why the Government are prepared

to  spend  $1,350 per month on the post of  Personal

Secretary  (Political). We  know  that  the  present

incumbent of this post is the defeated candidate for

Bukit  Panjang. [Interruption in Mandarin]  Dr  Lee

Siew  Choh  did  not ask you to  appoint  him  as  a

Political Secretary. Why should the Government spend

$1,350  on  a  person who was defeated in  the  last

election?  It  looks as if this post is  a  kind  of

refuge  for  a defeated candidate of the P.A.P.  The

Minister  for  Finance realises that we  are  facing

financial difficulties. Since that is so, we need to

be  economical. [Interruption in Mandarin] It  is  a

waste of public money to provide for this post. What

have  these Political Secretaries done or, for  that

matter,  what can they do for the people? There  are

many people who are out of job and these people  are

increasing in number. The salary paid to a Political

Secretary  amounting  to $1,350  a  month  is  quite

enough   to   feed   one  family   for   one   year.

[Interruption  in  Mandarin] Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

Members   of  this  House  - whether  Government   or

Opposition Members - have been elected by the  people

and the $500 a month paid to each Member is not from

the  purse of the Minister for Labour. [Interruption

in  Mandarin]  Mr Wong Soon Fong and Mr  Chan  Sun

Wing never [Interruption in Mandarin] ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member should proceed. When

the  Government side get the same treatment from the

Opposition, they will not like it. I think we should

allow him to proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir

[Interruption in Mandarin] - there is a  saying  that

if  one  has  not  made a careful  examination,  one

should  not have the right to speak. If the  Members

opposite  do not know the real situation  and  facts

and talk at random, then they will be doing wrong to

themselves. [Interruption in Mandarin]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the Members of the

Government not to interrupt?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

whenever  Members of the Opposition  speak,  we  are

always faced with two reactions: one is interference

and  the  other is that whenever the Government  are

unable  to  rebut  or argue, they always  raise  the

Communist bogey. [Interruption in Mandarin] How many

questions have we raised which they have never  been

able to answer?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, since our first Budget was put forward

at the end of 1959, the men who opposed the posts of

Political Secretaries were Members of the S.P.A. But

today  the opposition that was voiced by the  S.P.A.

is  now  voiced  by the Barisan Sosialis.  When  the

strong  men in the Barisan Sosialis - Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan and Mr Woodhull - held the

posts  of Political Secretaries, they did not object

to  these posts. But now they say that it is a waste

of  money. These Political Secretaries are important

to  the Ministers and to the people of Singapore. If

they are loyal to Malaysia, then they are good. So I

am  surprised  that the question  of  the  Political

Secretaries  which was raised by the S.P.A. led  by

Tun Lim Yew Hock is now raised and debated at length

by the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.A. talked at length on the Political

Secretaries,  so much so that the Party  disappeared

from the political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



arena.  I am afraid that the same fate which  befell

the  S.P.A. would also befall the 13 Members of  the

Barisan Sosialis in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the defeated candidates, does it mean

that  because they have been defeated they  have  no

ability?  Their  defeat is due to  several  reasons.

They  were defeated because their campaign  was  not

very  good. They went and intimidated the people  in

the  kampongs. But the Political Secretary  who  has

today  been appointed by the Prime Minister was  put

up  to contest the election at Bukit Panjang to show

the  strength  that has ensued in the  past  two  or

three  months.  If by being defeated  means  that  a

candidate has no ability, then in the case of  their

own  leader, Dr Lee Siew Choh, the fact that he was

defeated means that he has no ability. If he  is  no

good, why should he be elected again as Chairman  of

the Party? So, Mr Speaker, I am rather fed up. Four

times  in the past, we had a debate in this Assembly

on  this point. And the voice of Tun Lim Yew Hock is

still  ringing in our ears! His voice is still being

echoed  in this Assembly in the same manner  and  in

the  same  tune. But this has been voiced  by  other

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now

a  Member  of  the Government spoke about  Political

Secretaries  like  Mr  Lim  Ching  Siong  and   Mr

Woodhull.  But I would like to point  out  that  the

present Political Secretary of the Prime Minister is

a  defeated  candidate. What did he do in  the  past

Government?  I  am  sure the people  will  see  this

clearly. He must have done a lot of things for which

he cannot quite be responsible to the people. If you

want  to  appoint  a Political Secretary,  you  must

consider  his ability. A character like him  is  not

appropriate.  This  is  just  only  to  help  out  a

defeated candidate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

former  Member  of this Assembly he must  know  that

making references, albeit allegorical references, to

the  excreta  of  animals and other  things  is  not

becoming  of  this Assembly. If anybody is  debasing

the  prestige and standing of this Assembly,  it  is

the Members of the Opposition. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Please do not use

unparliamentary language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Speaker has

not  heard  it. What I am going to say is this.  You

must  know  that Lim Ching Siong was  loved  by  the

people. He is a patriot. Why are you afraid  of  him

and put him in gaol? [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Are all of you going to

shout?  I  am  having difficulty enough  trying  to

listen to the English translation. I cannot well  do

that with several Members shouting across the Floor.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the

Speaker  for his decision. Now the Prime  Minister's

Political Secretary has been discarded by the people

of  his  own constituency. That is the comparison  I

made  just now, between the flower and the  cowdung.

The  Prime Minister's excuse for appointing  him  as

Political  Secretary is for him to  act  as  liaison

between the people and the Government. Since he  has

been  discarded  by the people,  is  he  in  a  good

capacity   to   create  good  liaison  between   the

Government and the people? Can he do that?  This  is

just  to  help out a defeated candidate. This  is  a

sheer  waste of public money. His work is to  liaise

between the Government and the people, but since  he

has  been discarded by the people, how can he liaise

between the Government and the people? Nobody  wants

him.  These people must struggle by themselves.  You

have no character; the whole lot of you. You are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



not  people  of character. If you have, it  will  be

good for you. These people are just white Chinese.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not know, Mr Speaker,

whether  this is going to be a perennial subject  of

discussion. I am quite prepared for it every year. I

stand by my decision, and I will justify my decision

at  the  end of my term of office. We had  all  this

before.  We  will have more of it in the  next  four

Budgets.  But  I  will ask Members opposite  to  ask

themselves this simple question. If I wish,  through

my  office, to bestow money and patronage, there are

sufficient  powers at my disposal to do  it  without

having  to  put  it in the Budget and  make  it  the

subject of discussion and debate. Therefore, when  I

do   this,  I  am  quite  prepared  for  discussion,

criticism  and  debate.  There  are  so  many  other

officers  which any government has got. I  ask  them

next to ask themselves why, although right from 1959

we  had  nine vacancies - one for each Minister;  one

Political Secretary per Minister - I am sorry,  there

were  eleven,  because three were  for  Culture  - we

never  at any one time filled all the eleven, as  we

were  entitled to do. Even now we have  only  filled

three  out  of the eleven. Surely there  must  be  a

reason.  Surely they must credit us with sufficient,

if not responsibility, then at least with a sense of

decorum  of what is right and wrong in the  interest

of  the public. I do not want to have to defend  the

virtues  of my Parliamentary Secretary.  But  may  I

just  say  this  for the benefit of the  Member  for

Jalan Kayu? If he is of no value to me, he will  not

be there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Prime  Minister tries to justify this  item  in  the

Budget  by  saying that they have only filled  three

vacancies.  He  wants  to  say  that  he   has   not

squandered  away public funds. We know that  we  are

facing  financial  difficulties.  Even  these  three

posts will come to more than $4,000. In one year  it

will amount to about $48,000 to $50,000. This sum is

not  small. If there is a real need for a  Political

Secretary, I would like to hear the reasons for it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



As  regards  the Political Secretary  of  the  Prime

Minister, they have explained that they want him  to

act  as  a  bridge  between the Government  and  the

people.  Hence  the need for a Political  Secretary.

But  the  present Political Secretary of  the  Prime

Minister  - although I do not know him much - when  he

was  attached to the Ministry of Education, was  not

able  to act as a bridge between the Government  and

the  people. Two days ago when we were talking about

Government's monopoly on education and how they made

use of education in the interest of their Party, the

culprit  who  did  that  is  the  present  Political

Secretary to the Prime Minister. He was supposed  to

be  the vanguard of the P.A.P., and yet he lost  the

election. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Who is on the floor? Is it the Member

for  Thomson  or  the  Minister for  Labour?  Please

proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the debate were to

continue in this way, there would not be any meaning

at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> The

Member for Jalan Kayu and the Member for Thomson  - a

constituency  where  his  former  colleague  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis had to run away and allow  him  to

win - on respective merits. Earlier we heard that  he

asked  for  facilities to be able to  get  documents

translated  into the Chinese language.  The  present

Political  Secretary, more than any of  these  eight

gentlemen, speaks four languages. He writes his  own

speeches, which cannot be said for these eight.  The

Barisan Assemblymen are getting $500. He is a former

journalist.  He  was  President of  the  Journalists

Union.  He worked in the Nanyang Siang Pau where  a

lot of Left-wing gentlemen used to go around him  to

get  their statements published. He knows more about

what  is going round in this country, and he is more

loyal to this country than any of them, because,  as

I  have  said, he can speak four languages: Chinese,

English,  Malay and a little bit of Tamil.  Can  the

Member  for Jalan Kayu claim to be able to speak  in

four  languages,  write his own speeches,  read  the

books



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please let us have no more personal

attacks.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the integrity and

personality of the Political Secretary to the  Prime

Minister was questioned. His personal integrity  was

questioned. Why is he being paid $1,350? As for the

fact  that  he was a defeated candidate, well,  Sir,

what  about  the Chairman of his Party?  Why  is  he

still the Chairman of his Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Speaker, Sir, you recently heard some

of  the Barisan unions threw away the workers' money

by way of giving gratuities to Mr Woodhull, and Mr

Fong  Swee Suan. And they were Political Secretaries

here,  Sir,  unlike the present Political Secretary.

Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan, Mr Lim Ching Siong  and  Mr

Woodhull were paid $1,300 to help the Government, to

be  loyal to the Government. They used the money  to

work  against  the Government. We have  a  different

batch of Political Secretaries who are loyal to  the

Government,  unlike  the three gentlemen  whom  they

have  mentioned  who  earned salaries  from  us  and

worked  against  us. Not only that, even  when  they

worked against us after breaking away from us,  they

still  insisted, and we had to sack them from  their

posts of Political Secretary. That is the difference

between  them  and the present Political  Secretary,

who  was  my former Parliamentary Secretary  in  the

Ministry  of Culture. Because he was good,  we  sent

him   to  be  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister for Education. When he went there, he  knew

that   gentlemen   like  them  would   use   Chinese

chauvinism,   education,   would   use    racialism,

Communist propaganda to get hint out. That  was  one

of the reasons. They used this line. Therefore, Sir,

let them not talk about the respective merits of the

present Political Secretaries and any of them.

the work of a Political Secretary is to be a sort of

liaison  between the Government and the  people.  If

the  Government do wrong, then they must oppose  the

Government. If what the Government do is detrimental

to  the  people, they have the right to oppose  them

and  point  out to them that they are  doing  wrong.

That  is  what  they should have done in  the  past,

because  they were the bridge between the Government

and  the  people.  They  were  not  as  bad  and  as

degenerated as the present Minister for Culture ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order. The point

of  order  is  that  the Member for  Paya  Lebar  is

referring to my character and he should be ruled out

of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Member for Paya Lebar

referred to my "low-down" character ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, before the translation

had reached me, you had already risen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Jalan Kayu. I must ask

Members  of  both  sides of the House  not  to  make

personal attacks. One attack leads to another.  When

you  are attacked, you do not like it, but when  you

attack,  you like it. So if we are going to  have  a

sense of decorum in this House, let us have no  more

personal  attacks.  I have been  trying  to  prevent

personal  attacks in this Assembly  right  from  the

start.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

what  I  had  intended to say has been  said  by  my

colleague, but I still have two points to make. Just

now  the  Minister for Culture and the Minister  for

Labour challenged me on my knowledge of English  and

Malay. In the past few years, I have learned  a  lot

from  the  people and I am able to understand  other

languages. Talking about a person who does not  make

any effort to learn additional languages has nothing

to  do  with  his character. As for me,  I  know  my

mother tongue and I am proud of it. But our Minister

for  Culture  does not know his own  mother  tongue.

Even our Prime Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> On a point of order. The Member

for  Jalan  Kayu  is now referring to  the  personal

conduct of the Minister for Culture ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister for Culture has attacked

the Member for Jalan Kayu. When I asked him to stop,

he said it was relevant. Surely the Member for Jalan

Kayu has the right to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Mr

Speaker, for your ruling. You deserve our admiration

for your just stand in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our Prime Minister who is a Hakka cannot speak

Hakka. It is an insult to his ancestry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Chairman of our Party lost in the

elections does not mean that he should not  continue

to  be  the Chairman of our Party. This is  our  own

affair  and  the  money  is  paid  by  us.  If   the

Government use the money for good purposes, then  we

will  support  them. But if they misuse  the  money,

then we will oppose them, since the money comes from

the people. The Political Secretary is making use of

the people's money which is paid as salary.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Siglap)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I should

like  to  explain that the allegations made  by  the

Member for Jalan Kayu are not true. The Minister for

Culture  is  not in the House at the present  moment

and  is,  therefore, not able to defend  himself  on

something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



which  affects  him  personally.  The  Minister  for

Culture  knows  his mother tongue, which  is  Tamil,

very  well.  I  know  that he not  only  speaks  the

language  with fluency but that he is able  to  read

and write in Tamil.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>

<b></b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel the debate

has gone off the rails. But I would like to say that

- the  Member  for Tampines has said earlier - at  the

time  when  Mr Lim Ching Siong, Mr Fong Swee  Suan

and  Mr  Woodhull were Political Secretaries,  they

had  the  right to criticise the Government if  they

found  that the policy carried out by the Government

was  against the interests of the people.  In  fact,

Mr   Speaker,  those  three  Political  Secretaries

received salaries from the Government and because of

that   they  should  have  carried  out  the  duties

entrusted to them by the Government ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

order.  I want to point out that I did not say  this

just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Member repeat what he said? I

did not quite catch it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

statement made by the Minister for Social Affairs is

not my statement. I did not say it just now.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I beg your pardon.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I meant to refer to the Member for

Paya Lebar. What I would like to stress here is that

those three Political Secretaries were paid salaries

by  the  Government. Because of that, it  was  their

bounden duty to carry out the duties that they  were

asked  to  carry out by the Government. It is  their

duty  to explain to the people the policies  of  the

Government. But what they in fact did - the three  of

them  - was  to subvert the Government by  misleading

the  people  with  regard to  the  policies  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we find the posts of Political Secretary during the time of the P.A.P. Government very useful and necessary. It was through the Political Secretaries that we could learn of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



reactions of the people towards the policies of  the

Government  of the day for the benefit and  progress

of  the people. Even the Federation Government  have

begun   to  have  Political  Secretaries  in   their

Ministries. If I am not wrong, I think there are  13

or  14  posts of Political Secretary vacant  in  the

Federation.  If  any of these honourable  Members  m

front are interested, they can make applications  to

the Federation Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

had  no intention of saying more. But the Member for

Paya  Lebar  has  attacked  my  personal  character.

Therefore, I am compelled to reply to him  to  lodge

my  protest. He said my character is very low. Where

is  my  character, up to what level,  where  have  I

reached,  how low is it, whether I have  reached  to

the  level of robbers? He accused me of selling  out

something.  What have I sold out? How  much  have  I

sold  out and for how much? What reward have we got?

The  result has been determined by the people in two

elections.  What  has  that  got  to  do   with   me

personally? They say we are bad people. They say  we

are  running  dogs. What are running  dogs?  Running

dogs  are  those  who  run away from  the  Barisan's

original  constituencies  to  other  constituencies.

Only those ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has sufficiently

vindicated himself. Has he anything else to  say  in

the debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Now, let me say

something  about the post of Personal  Secretary.  I

thought  the Barisan's intention was to  oppose  the

post  of Personal Secretary. Instead, they are using

this  chance  to level personal attacks against  us.

They say the present Personal Secretary to the Prime

Minister  has  no  qualifications  because  he   was

defeated in the last general election. Now  that  is

no reason at all.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether one is defeated or not in an election is a

common thing. To win or lose a battle is commonplace

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



soldiers. If you do not believe it, then let us have

another round of elections and see who will win  and

who  will  lose. These people opposite are deceiving

the  people,  playing  politics.  If  they  won  the

elections by their mean tactics and low games,  then

there is no meaning to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister for Labour has been using words  which

are  not  suitable to be heard in this House,  words

like "mean", "low", and "shameless".



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But you have been

attacking  us  with  words like "mean",  "low".  Why

cannot we rebut? You are really mean, low, and ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please proceed with the debate in an

orderly manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since the Member

says  there  should  not be  the  post  of  Personal

Secretary  (Political),  let  me  say  this.  In  an

election  there must, of course, be someone  elected

and  others defeated. But that is no reason for  the

defeated  candidate to be unduly  depressed  or  the

elected candidate to be elated. This should not also

be   used  as  a  pretext  to  attack  the  personal

character of a defeated candidate. During  the  Hong

Lim  by-election many people came out to support me,

including  Lim Ching Siong and Fong Swee  Suan,  and

yet  I  was  defeated.  But now  that  I  have  been

elected,  what is there to brag about  and  what  is

there  to  criticise  about  an  opponent  who   was

defeated? There is nothing to laugh about  a  person

being defeated in an election. There is no reason at

all  to  accuse the defeated candidate as being  low

and mean because of the results of the election.  We

have been elected and some of us have been appointed

to  our  respective  posts. If you  say  that  there

should not be an appointment of a Personal Secretary

(Political),  then  let me say that  this  post  was

already  in existence in the last Assembly  and  yet

the  people  voted us in. [Interruption] The  Member

opposite interrupted with the name "Ngo Dinh  Diem".

What has that got to do with us in this Assembly?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



If we are Ngo Dinh Diems, then all of you will be in

gaol now, perhaps executed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   the  debate  on  the  post  of   Personal

Secretary (Political) to the Prime Minister has gone

on  for quite a long time. We have heard a lot  from

the  Barisan Members advancing reasons for  opposing

the  appointment of this post. All these reasons are

unfounded and do not hold water. One of the  reasons

came  from  the Member for Jalan Kayu who said  that

since  the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister

was defeated in the last elections, he should not be

so  appointed.  He  also compared the  appointee  to

cowdung and "flower". Can the Member for Jalan  Kayu

compare himself to our Prime Minister so that we can

see  who is cowdung and who is "flower" and also who

is  mean in character? Were you defeated in the last

elections? No. Can we also say that you are a person

with  character  or with a low, mean integrity?  You

have sold out our country to Indonesia and supported

confrontation.  [Interruption]  Including  Mr   Koo

Young. One of you has said this. Yesterday you  also

spoke in this strain.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please address the Chair and not

Members of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Talking about

the  post of Personal Secretary (Political)  to  the

Prime Minister or any other Minister, this is not  a

new  post. This post existed in the past. The Member

for  Jalan  Kayu knows it. At that time he supported

the  appointment, a time when we were  opposing  and

struggling against the corrupted Lim Yew Hock.  What

more   reasons  do  you  now  have  to  oppose   the

appointment of Personal Secretary (Political)? It is

because  you  are now collaborating with  Indonesian

Communists engaged in subversive activities  against

our nation and our people and our Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to give you a very sincere warning

- I  caution you to consider this stand carefully for

the good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



of  yourselves and in the interests of  the  people.

Now,    when    we   are   faced   with   Indonesian

confrontation, where is your stand? Are you standing

together ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are discussing an amendment to

item  (3)  of subhead 1 of Head 6. We have had enough

of Indonesian confrontation for the last three days.

Has the Member got anything further to say about the

proposed  amendment? Unless he speaks on  it,  I  am

afraid I will have to stop him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   will  not  further  touch  on  Indonesian

confrontation.  But  I would like  to  tell  Members

opposite  not  to  make use of this  subject  as  an

excuse  to  talk  of  something else.  The  Personal

Secretary  (Political)  to the  Prime  Minister  has

integrity that can stand competition from anyone  of

you  opposite. He can stand comparison with  Members

opposite  in any respect. Even Mr Koo Young  cannot

be  compared  with  the present  Personal  Secretary

(Political) to the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are we going to see the end of

personal attacks, or is it going to be one series of

attacks  throughout the day? If the Member wants  to

talk   about  the  Personal  Secretary  (Political),

please  do  so,  but  I  do not  want  him  to  make

comparisons with Members of the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first time I am making

a  speech  here. We have just heard the  Member  for

Sembawang.  He said that in the midst of  Opposition

Members there is a kayu, i.e. a blockhead. What does

he  mean? I feel it is unnecessary for him to deride

and to use abusive words. Since we have been elected

by  the  people into this House, we are expected  to

make  speeches. Just now the Member did not  make  a

speech because it was not his turn to make a speech,

and  he  chose not to speak at that time. That  does

not mean that he is low or mean. If it means that  a

person who does not speak is low or mean, then there

are many among you who are mean or low.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, the  Speaker  ruled

just  now  that  there should not  be  any  personal

the road.



<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng):</b> Will the  Member

the House?











<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, I would now like to talk about a few points

raised  by the Government Members. The Minister  for

Culture  said  just now that the Personal  Secretary

(Political) to the Prime Minister is a very  capable

person  who  knows four languages. If  we  assess  a

person's merit on the number of languages he  knows,

then  I  know  that there are many Members  in  this

House who, because they cannot speak many languages,

are  useless  and cannot be representatives  of  the

people.  We  dare not say so, and the P.A.P. should

not say so too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour praised himself, saying

that  he is a very capable person. But the Political

Secretary to the Prime Minister is a person who lost

the  election in the Bukit Panjang constituency. The

Minister  said that during the elections we deceived

the  people. He also said many other things.  It  is

really  bad for the Minister to say such bad things.

I  find  it imperative to tell the House some things

which happened during the election in Bukit Panjang.

During  the  election he said that we were  cheating

the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am very sorry to be up again to

<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, in view of the fact that  the  Member

this,  and  as  I  am  the representative  of  Bukit

Panjang,  I  was  therefore forced  to  raise  these

matters in the House. Since you have ruled me out of

order, I am not going to say any more on this.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In debating the matter of the post of

Political  Secretary,  Sir,  the  Barisan   Sosialis

Members have stated that a Political Secretary is  a

person   who  liaises  with  the  people   and   the

Government,  and  that, according to  them,  as  the

Political  Secretary  to  the  Prime  Minister   was

defeated  in  the elections, he is not fit  to  fill

that  post. His defeat does not mean that he is  not

able to carry out the duties of liaison between  the

Government  and  the  people.  Even  though  he  was

defeated  in Bukit Panjang, nevertheless, the  other

50  constituencies still retain their confidence  in

him and believe in his integrity. That is the reason

why the Prime Minister has appointed him to fill the

post.  In  the  past, three members of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  filled  the posts of Political  Secretary.

What  did  they  do? If they say  that  a  Political

Secretary  is one who liaises between the Government

and   the   people,   then  those  three   Political

Secretaries of the Barisan Sosialis had not  carried

out  the  duties  which the Members in  the  Barisan

Sosialis now expect them to have done then. They, in

fact,   channelled  the  propaganda  of  the  P.K.I.

through the Barisan Sosialis to the people. Is  this

the  kind of liaison work which the Barisan Sosialis

expect  from them? The Barisan Sosialis Members  who

are  here today say differently and act differently.

They are being used by the P.K.I. who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



are  on  the  side  of  the people  who  oppose  the

Government,  and  this is not for  the  benefit  and

happiness of the people. All their efforts  are  for

the  purpose  of leading the people astray.  At  one

time,  the  Political Secretary to the  Ministry  of

Education challenged these people to give  up  their

jobs, but the Political Secretaries from the Barisan

Sosialis  did  not give up their posts because  they

placed  great  value  on  the  salaries  they   were

receiving.  They were consorting with Azahari  which

is  detrimental  to the peace of Singapore  and  the

interest of the people as a whole. Therefore, in  my

opinion,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the incumbent  of  the

post of Political Secretary to the Prime Minister is

one  who  is capable and who commands the confidence

of  the people. Even though he was defeated in Bukit

Panjang,  he is working for the benefit and  welfare

of  the  people. He nevertheless still  retains  the

confidence  of  the  people.  He  is  not  like  the

Political Secretaries from the Barisan Sosialis  who

in the past betrayed the people and the country.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, on the subject of

Political Secretaries, it seems to me that  although

the  Members  of the Government have  explained  the

position, the Member for Jalan Kayu is still in  the

dark.  Their heads are dull, despite the  fact  that

they have been told of it on many occasions. We have

heard  just  now  how the Members of the  Opposition

have  raised the question of language. They pay more

attention to the Chinese language than the  national

language.  Do  they still owe allegiance  to  China?

They  have taken the oath of allegiance to Malaysia.

If  they  are inclined towards the Chinese language,

then  this tactic clearly shows that they have close

connections with China.

confine his speech to the amendment under discussion

and not run into the question of languages?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): In the debate mention

was made of languages and the defeated candidate for

Bukit Panjang. Therefore, I thought it would be  fit

to  explain  this  matter  to  the  Members  of  the

Opposition. If they raise this point, I  cannot  see

why I cannot raise it. They referred to the defeated

candidate  for Bukit Panjang. It is clear  that  the

Members  of the Opposition do not owe allegiance  to

Malaysia. They still owe allegiance to their country

of origin. That is all, Mr Deputy Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, we have taken much of the Assembly's

time  to  debate the post of Political Secretary  to

the  Prime Minister. From the Budget we can see that

there  is a provision for a Political Secretary  for

each  Minister. But only four Political  Secretaries

have   been  appointed.  From  the  notice  of   the

amendments we observe that queries have been  raised

only  on this particular Political Secretary. To  me

this  goes to show that they have a special  respect

both  to  the  Prime Minister and to  his  Political

Secretary.   I  have  no  doubt  that  the   present

incumbent is an efficient and capable man. No notice

of  amendment  was raised in respect  of  the  other

three  Political  Secretaries except  the  Political

Secretary to the Prime Minister. This clearly  shows

that  the  13  Opposition Members are really  scared

because  they realise the capability and  efficiency

of the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.  I

still remember the case of the present Minister  for

Labour. He stood in the by-election in Hong Lim  and

he  was  defeated, although Mr Lim Ching Siong  and

his  colleagues supported him then. Although he  was

defeated  at Hong Lim, he was appointed a  Political

Secretary to the Prime Minister. This was cause  for

concern  to  the Barisan Sosialis. When the  present

Minister  for Labour was going to stand for election

at Queenstown,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



which was the former constituency of their Chairman,

rather  than  be  defeated  by  a  former  Political

Secretary, he would rather prefer to be defeated  by

the Deputy Chairman of our Party. This, as the Malay

proverb  says, means that if an elephant  fights  an

ant,  people will laugh. So the Party Chairman chose

to  fight  the Deputy Prime Minister in the  Rochore

constituency but not in Queenstown. This again  goes

to  prove  the respect that the Political  Secretary

commands. That is, although he was defeated  in  the

Hong Lim by-election, he succeeded in being returned

in  Queenstown. Therefore, it is not surprising that

the present incumbent has become the main target  of

the  Opposition Members, whilst the other  Political

Secretaries who have been appointed and who have not

been  appointed have been left in peace.  They  have

been left alone. No mention was made of them in this

Assembly. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think  we

have  wasted  much of the Assembly's  time  on  this

subject.   It   is   nothing  but  purely   personal

sentiments. It is not the post. If it is  in  regard

to   the  post,  then  it  should  be  for  all  the

Ministers. But this concerns the Political Secretary

to the Prime Minister who is very much feared by the

Opposition  Members.  This  shows  that  the   Prime

Minister of Singapore has chosen a very capable  man

to hold this post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  the  Members on the Government  side  have

said  that  we have been debating this  subject  for

quite  a long time. Since there is a time limit  and

we  have put down several amendments, I hope we  can

put  a  vote  on this amendment. But before  that  I

would like to say a few words. On the appointment of

the  Political  Secretary,  I  would  like  to  know

whether the things he did in the past commanded  the

support of the people and was he really of value  to

the  Government and to the people as  well?  Has  he

such merit or not? But it would be a waste of public

funds  to appoint a Political Secretary who  is  not

able to advance the opinions of other people to  the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

we  have  spent  quite  a long time  discussing  the

amendment of the previous speaker who said all sorts

of  things about the present holder of that post.  I

feel  that  the only people competent to  judge  the

ability  of the person concerned are those who  work

closest  to  him.  I  think if  the  Prime  Minister

considers  him the right person to be his  Political

Secretary,  I do not think anyone else is  competent

to  say otherwise. So that a great deal of this talk

really  means nothing and I propose that we  dispose

of the matter quickly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker, the Member for Jurong has  said  it

himself. It came out from his mouth that the post of

Personal Secretary (Political) to the Prime Minister

depends  on whether the post is necessary. The  true

valuation  should be related to the performance  and

personal  integrity  of  the  person  and  also  the

necessity of the post. If we agree that this post is

necessary,  then we should not waste any  more  time

talking about it. So now the question before  us  is

whether there is a need for such a post.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche A. Rahim Ishak</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  we  have debated at great length  on  this

subject  raised  by the Barisan. The arguments  have

been  repeated over and over again. I wish to  point

out  that the holder of the post, in this case,  the

Political  Secretary to the Prime Minister,  is  not

the  concern  of the Barisan Sosialis.  The  Barisan

can, of course, question the allocation for the post

of  Political Secretary if they want to. The  person

who  holds  that  post is none  of  their  business.

Therefore, may I suggest that we end this debate  on

this  amendment, because the Barisan has not  raised

the question of the post of Political Secretary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Poh Ber Liak ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 6 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (44)  of subhead 1.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Poh Ber Liak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I do not wish to move this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 6 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget there is provision of $51,150 for

the    Office    of    the   Singapore    Government

Representative in Kuala Lumpur. Now, what is the use

of  this  fund? Of what good is it to the people  of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this question because the P.A.P. have all

along  been using public funds to further their  own

propaganda  purposes. I would like  to  ask  whether

this  "Temasek"  building is  being  used  in  Kuala

Lumpur as a branch of the P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am

greatly  relieved that we have settled the programme

for  the various items on this debate because at the

rate  of  one hour per item - as somehow  this  House

managed  to  find one hour to discuss what  I  would

have  thought  was a settled subject like  Political

Secretaries  - we might well be here  for  the  whole

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, subhead 8 - $51,150. Sir, I can understand the

unhappiness  of  the Member for Paya  Lebar  at  the

effectiveness  with  which the Government  has  been

conducting its duties, amongst which is the constant

debunking of Communist propaganda and lies.  But  to

envisage in this item some Party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



advantage  - that  I think can only be  conceived  by

those with the most distorted of minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our relationship with Kuala Lumpur has always

been  the most important single factor in the  well-being  of  Singapore. I disagree with the assessment

of  the  Members opposite that it is Indonesia  that

will determine our future. I say it is Malaysia that

determines our future. Now, with Malaysia  it  is  a

matter  of some considerable importance particularly

in  the first 18 months of the running-in period  of

the  new Constitution that there should be Singapore

machinery in Kuala Lumpur to sort out the  bits  and

pieces  to ensure that they understand what  we  are

doing,  why  we are doing what we are doing.  May  I

explain  to the Member who asked this question  that

the problem is not why we should have an office, but

whether  we  can  have a suitably qualified  man  to

conduct our affairs in Kuala Lumpur? The reason  why

nobody   has  been  appointed  is  because  of   the

difficulty   of   getting  somebody   endowed   with

ministerial  status  to  be  able  to  take  up  our

problems,   instead  of  taking  them  up   on   the

telephone, in person in Kuala Lumpur. It may be that

in  the end this is a problem on which we will  have

to feel our way before we can get a solution. In the

end,  it may be that Ministers may have to go up  in

turn  to  keep  liaison  and  get  Kuala  Lumpur  to

understand what our policy and our programme are and

why  we are doing what we are doing. But if it  were

possible  to  get  somebody  permanently  to  reside

there,  and if there is a person who can  be  spared

for  these  duties,  then I say he  will  need  this

office staff to conduct proper business between  the

State and the Central Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 6 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether this Senior Trade and

Cultural   Representative's  Office  is   still   in

existence  in  Indonesia, whether there  is  such  a

representative, and what is the use of  this  office

in  Indonesia? If we do not have this office at  the

present time, then why should the Government include

this in this Budget?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, again

we go back to the special terms of Singapore's entry

into Malaysia. One of the special terms spelt out in

Cmd.  Paper  33 of 1961 was that we should  have  in

each   Malayan   Embassy  or  each  Foreign   Office

establishment abroad, if we so wish, a special trade

representative  to  look after  Singapore's  special

trading  interests.  We  had  before  the  16th   of

September  one representative in London and  another

one  in Jakarta. It may well be that depending  upon

the  trade and future industrial development,  there

might  be a few others. The one in Jakarta continued

to function up till the middle of October, about one

month after Malaysia.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were not asked to leave. It does not follow that

because  diplomatic  relations  have  been  severed,

therefore trade relations are also severed.  Members

may  not  be  aware that even though  there  are  no

diplomatic  relations,  for  instance,  between  the

British  and  North  Vietnam,  there  is  a  British

Consulate  or  a  Trade  Commission  in  Hanoi.   So

similarly,   even  in  spite  of  the   rupture   of

diplomatic relations between Indonesia and  Malaysia

on  the  17th of September, as far as Singapore  was

concerned, our trade representation went on up  till

the  middle  of  October. Sometime round  about  the

middle   of   October,  for  various  reasons,   the

Indonesian  Government  Foreign  Office   gave   our

mission  two  weeks  to wind  up  their  affairs  in

Indonesia and leave, which they duly did. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



do  not  know  when or whether or  not  it  will  be

possible  for a resumption of diplomatic  relations;

when or whether we will resume trade relations.  But

this  is a sum that has been set aside in the  event

that it is possible to resume trade relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that having spent the whole of the last

three   days   exhorting  negotiations  to   resolve

confrontation,  they would welcome a  resumption  of

trade.  Members on the other side may like  to  know

that,   as  far  as  the  Singapore  Government   is

concerned,  it  is always prepared to resume  trade;

whether  or  not there is a resumption of diplomatic

relations is an entirely different matter. It  is  a

matter  in the hands of the Central Government.  All

of  us  on  this side and, I think, Members  on  the

other  side  have  seen  the views  of  the  Central

Government on it. I would like to repeat what I said

on  the  25th of October, that if there is to  be  a

normalisation  of relationship, which  we  all  hope

there  will  be, we hope it will be on  a  permanent

basis and not a temporary patch-up, generating  once

again  a false sense of euphoria soon to be banished

again  shortly  thereafter.  In  the  meantime,   if

conditions permit, we will resume trade relations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I have listened to the explanation  of

the  Prime  Minister. It is clear that the Singapore

Government  pays  much attention  to  trade  between

Singapore and Indonesia. You will remember that when

the  P.A.P. came into office in 1959, there  was  a

special mission to Indonesia the object of which was

to  promote  and  improve  trade  relations  between

Singapore and Indonesia. But today it seems that our

Senior Trade and Cultural Representative is no  more

in  Indonesia, and yet the Government still provides

a  sum of money in the Budget for this Office.  This

shows  that  the Government is very anxious  to

re-establish  trade  relations  between  Singapore  and

Indonesia, which also is the hope of the  people  of

Singapore. We voice the same hope that there must be

a  resumption  of trade relations between  Singapore

and  Indonesia. The P.A.P. Government also expresses

the hope that ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on a point of order. The

Member opposite must understand that he is a subject

of  Malaysia.  He  is  a Malaysian  citizen,  not  a

Malayan citizen. If he insists on referring to a non-existing  Malayan entity, then one must assume  that

he  disavows the fact that he is a Malaysian citizen

and should not be in this Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Government

expresses   the   hope  that,  notwithstanding   the

relations   between  Malaysia  and  Indonesia,   the

Singapore Government is also hopeful that there  may

be a resumption of trade relations between Singapore

and  Indonesia.  One thing we do not understand  is,

why  does  the  Government not want  to  accept  our

proposal to resume trade relations between Singapore

and  Indonesia? There are reasons for their adopting

their   present   attitude.  Firstly,   the   P.A.P.

Government  in  dealing with  our  future  does  not

accept the views of our Party. They also run counter

to the interests of the people. They are prepared to

work for Malaysia which is sponsored by the British.

Now  that  Malaysia  has  brought  difficulties  and

hardships  to  our  people, without  Malaysia  there

would not have been this Indonesian confrontation.





<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Dr Fong Kim Heng)</b>: Order. Will  the





Member  for Choa Chu Kang confine his speech to  the

amendment  and  not go back to what  has  been  gone

through over the last 3� days?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, it is because I want to point out that

since  the Trade Representative's Office is no  more

in  existence in Indonesia, why should there be such

an  item in the Budget? I also want to point out the

reasons for the attitude the P.A.P. Government  have

adopted.  Now they are trying to shift the blame  on

to  other people for our present hardship.  We  want

trade relations to be resumed between Indonesia  and

Singapore, and since the P.A.P. have the  same  hope

and  aspirations,  why should they  not  accept  our

proposals? Because of the ferocious attitude of  the

Alliance  Government in the Federation,  the  P.A.P.

Government  are  forced  to  toe  the  line  of  the

Alliance Government. Because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



after merger the P.A.P. Government have given up all

control  and  rights to the Central  Government.  So

even  though  the P.A.P. Government want  to  resume

trade  relations, they cannot go against the  wishes

of  the  Alliance  Government. Therefore,  they  are

forced  willy-nilly to toe the line of  the  Central

Government, i.e. in not wanting to hold negotiations

to  re-establish  relations  between  Singapore  and

Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on

Monday  when I invited criticism from both sides  of

the  House, Members may have noticed that I  invited

honest,  useful  criticism  that  can  lead   to   a

constructive  reframing of policy.  I  then  already

suspected,  even before the Member for Jurong  began

his  speech,  that we would be in for  another  five

years  of sterile, destructive, completely insincere

attack.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Member for Choa Chu Kang whether what

he has said, which will be published tomorrow in,  I

hope,  all  the newspapers and not just the  Chinese

newspapers,  is  going to help resolve  the  present

trade boycott between Indonesia and Singapore? If he

has  the  interests  of  Singapore  at  heart,  even

assuming he has not got the interests of Malaysia at

heart,  does  he  think he is helping  Singapore  by

encouraging  our neighbours to believe that  we  are

prepared  to go down on our bended knees  and  plead

for  trade - trade which as clearly borne out in  our

statistics  is 8.7 per cent of our national  income?

Or  is he not spreading alarm and despondency to  be

used  by the Indonesians and the Filipinos for their

international propaganda to say that Malaysia is, in

fact,  torn  and divided within itself, unworthy  of

international support? On whose side is he  speaking

for?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we all want a resumption of trade. But I

say,  more  than a resumption of trade, we  want  to

survive as a separate entity in South-East Asia, not

to  be slowly, one by one, absorbed and dissolved in

South-East  Asia.  Does the Member  understand  what

this is all about? Does he think we are playing  for

a bagful of marbles? Men are being killed, have been

killed, in Brunei and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



Sarawak.  The former leaders of the Barisan Sosialis

thought they were playing a clever little game. I do

not  think  those who are in gaol now  believe  that

this  is so funny. Three of them have already  sworn

that  this is all a great mistake and have given  up

politics.  If they had the courage, they would  have

come  out  and fought their erstwhile companions  in

the Barisan Sosialis for having brought trouble into

this  country. Who brought about confrontation?  Who

started  this whole thing? Of course, we  know  that

some people in this region thought that it would  be

a  good thing if Malaya did not grow bigger. But who

gave them the entree, the sparking point, with which

to  intervene in the affairs of another country? The

Barisan Sosialis, together with the Socialist Front,

linking up with S.U.P.P., linking up with Brunei and

Azahari, leading to the revolt, leading to a  United

Nations   assessment.  They  made  the  interference

easier.  What is the logic of the criticism  made  by

the  Member  for Choa Chu Kang - begin  negotiations?

All  right, what for? To resolve confrontation.  All

right, on what terms and on what conditions on which

confrontation will for the time being be  withdrawn?

He   said,   "Malaysia   will   dissolve."   Another

assessment team has been suggested What for? In  the

hope  that  the assessment will be unfavourable  and

therefore  Sabah  and Sarawak are out.  What  is  he

preaching? What I suggested on Monday - the  line  of

treachery and betrayal.

by $10 in respect of subhead 10."



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are approximately

nine  minutes left before the vote is taken at  5.40

on  Head  6,  and I would like to put the  following

point  to the Member for Paya Lebar. First, on whose

side  is he on? On the side of Indonesia or  on  the

side  of  Malaysia? Second question:  Does  he  want

things to get better between Malaysia and Indonesia,

or does he want things to get worse? Third question:

Has  what  he has been saying just now, exaggerating

alarm, loss of trade, differences of opinion between

Singapore  and  Kuala Lumpur,  been  really  in  the

interest of Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that he is against Kuala Lumpur. We

take  that  for  granted. But is it  really  in  our

interest  - whatever  our  internal  differences   of

presentation   of   policy  - to   exaggerate   these

differences  and  allow  them  to  be  exploited  by

outside powers? It is as simple as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member took the oath of loyalty in this

Chamber, and he should be loyal to Malaysia. He  has

never  even  once - none of the Opposition  - admitted

that   Malaysia  is  in  existence.  They  talk   of

Singapore;  they talk of the Federation  of  Malaya.

Let  me remind them that this is a matter which  may

become extremely serious, and that their words  here

- frivolous  though  they may be  to  those  who  are

watching  these proceedings - if used  and  exploited

internationally,  may well add  to  a  worsening  in

relations.  In  the  event, are they  alive  to  the

dangers they are in - that any man against the nation

who  actively aids and abets aggression against  the

nation  is a traitor, and will be punished as  such?

There  are five minutes left, and I would  be  quite

happy if the Member for Paya Lebar would give  me  a

direct  answer on behalf of his Party  to  my  three

questions.  On  whose side is  he  on  - Malaysia  or

Indonesia? Does he want things to get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



better  on worse? What he has said and what we  have

said  over the past three days - today is the  fourth

day  - on confrontation and loss of Indonesian trade,

is  that  going to make things better or  worse  for

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Anybody who wishes to can speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

because of time limitation, I will briefly reply  to

the  challenge given by the Prime Minister.  On  the

question  whether we are standing  on  the  side  of

Malaysia or Indonesia, I will say that we have never

been  standing  on  the side of  Indonesia.  We  are

standing on the side of the people of Singapore  and

Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Malaysia! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let the hon. Member answer in his own

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): He asks us whether

we  want relations between the two countries to  get

worse  or  better. Our answer is, we  sincerely  and

truly want to bring about progress and prosperity in

the  livelihood of the people of Singapore. That  is

why   we  propose  that  we  should  negotiate  with

Indonesia   to   resolve  this  problem,   including

confrontation.  The  proposition  is  based  on  the

interests of the people of Singapore. My explanation

is clear enough on this point. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member has only a few

minutes  left. I think we should allow  him  to  say

what he wants in the few minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I hope the

Government  side will not continue to accuse  us  of

being  traitors.  They  should  realise  that   they

themselves have sold out the interests of the people

of Singapore. They are the true traitors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This is the first of the many

points  at issue. We shall meet again and  again  on

this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Member for Paya Lebar was not in

a   position  to  reply  to  such  a  "world-shaking

question", so the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Jurong, in the absence of their  leader,

has  taken  over.  In  his answer  he  did  not,  by

implication, admit that Malaysia existed. He  talked

of  Singapore; he talked of Malaya. So Malaysia does

not exist. Of course, he says he wants things to  be

better.  He  was unable to answer the  simple  point

- does he want Indonesian confrontation to succeed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way they have been acting over the last few

days  leaves nobody in any doubt that what they want

is  to  do harm to the country - to spread alarm  and

despondency  - and give succour and  comfort  to  the

enemies of the people, like the P.K.I. That is where

their  hearts lie, where their loyalty lies.  And  I

say,  before  Malaysia, it is one thing  saying  all

these things. After Malaysia, I beseech them, before

it  is  too late. From time to time, Sir, we proffer

them  sincere  advice for their own  good.  Many  of

their  members who used to be there, had they  taken

our  advice,  would  have been much  more  wholesome

personalities  today, instead of  being  broken-down

enemies of the people. That is what they are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Prime  Minister  has  just  now  raised  a  few

questions.   He   says  I  dare  not   answer   them

personally.  At  the same time, he asks  whether  we

want confrontation to succeed or fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three days, all our Members on this

side have said that we are opposed to confrontation,

because  it  will increase the difficulties  of  our

people and bring hardships to their livelihood.  So,

in  order to resolve confrontation, the first  thing

is  to  seek peaceful means to negotiate, to discuss

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on this question, I will have to read

out  to  the --- [Interruption] because the Land Office

has much land in its possession which is occupied by

rural  people. I would tell the Government that  the

Land  Office  has much land under its  control.  The

people  have been living on the land for many years,

for   scores  of  years.  Some  farmers  have   been

occupying  pieces of land on short-term as  well  as

long-term leases. Now, these several acres  of  land

to  each homestead after having been cultivated  for

several years will have increased in value and  will

provide  succour to their families  and  members  of

their  families who, after several years, will  have

grown  up  and will be leaving the land.  They  will

have  their own families and will need further  land

to   develop,  cultivate,  and  to  live   on.   The

Government  do  not  have  adequate  legislation  in

regard  to land policy to provide for the  needs  of

the farmers.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when the farmers make applications to the

Government,  they  are turned down.  They  apply  to

extend  their  houses but their requests  have  been

turned down. On the one hand, the farmers are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



unable  to  find sufficient means to  support  their

families. On the other hand, the Government  do  not

allow them to build houses on the land, and they put

them  in  difficulties. Also, private  land  is  not

available to the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should look at things objectively.

They  should see whether the land available to  them

is enough --- [Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am not aware that the Member has a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear! Hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

can  tell  you this. But let me touch on this  topic

first. So in the end, when a farmer wants to build a

pig   sty,  his  application  is  turned  down.  Mr

Speaker, the farmers want to live on the land.  This

is   for  the  purpose  of  making  a  living.   Any

application  to  extend the building  or  build  pig

sties   is  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  their

families.  Yet all these requests have been  ignored

by  the Government. They say that what I say here is

ridiculous,   because  they  have   understood   the

importance  of this. In my constituency there  is  a

place  where  there is a prawn pond and the  farmers

can support my argument. The Members opposite can go

there  to  investigate. Let  the  members  of  their

branches go there to find out. My land is not  Crown

land.  It  is  private land. There is a small  prawn

pond owned by me, and this land is also private land

acquired through proper means. During the course  of

time, prawn ponds have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



been  built. Some farmers have been arrested by  the

military authorities because of encroachment on  the

land.  The result is that I have been approached  by

these  people for help. I went along to the military

authorities and got the release of these farmers. So

the  farmers  in this area think I am an influential

man and have been able to get their release. That is

why  I have been reelected by them again. [Laughter]

So  in  this  frame  of mind  they  think  I  am  an

influential  man, and they make use of  my  name  to

apply  for land in order to tide over the difficulty

by saying that the land belongs to me. If you do not

believe   what   I  say,  you  can  carry   out   an

investigation to look for the truth. I can challenge

them to look for the truth. If the investigation  is

against me, then I am quite prepared to go to court.

Otherwise, they will have to apologise to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture said that I applied for a permit to get land for the purpose of building a prawn pond. But you can go and ask your own jackals in my area who know what the true position is. They are not aware of the true position and they try to force the matter on me. The land actually belongs to the military authorities. They use force to recover the land, thinking that it belongs to me. So they want to deprive me of the land and the benefit thereof. But that does not affect me at all, in so far as the vested interest in the land is concerned.

All   this   goes  to  show  that  these   political

nincompoops of the P.A.P. will resort to  all  sorts

of  dirty means to attack their political opponents.

Insofar  as it is to their political interest,  they

do not mind. If anything is politically advantageous

to  their  opponents, then they will resort  to  all

sorts  of  tactics to remove these advantages.  Now,

even if you occupy a piece of private land, you will

have  to get a permit first before you can put up  a

pig sty. In these circumstances, many farmers are at

their wits' end. So I hope the Government will relax

certain  restrictions in regard to applications  for

construction of structures and pig sties to help the

livelihood of the poor farmers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, this

long  theme  of  woe interests the Land  Office  and

transactions in the Land Office. They all  have  for

the Member for Jalan Kayu very personal and somewhat

painful  and  unprofitable  connotations.   If   one

illegally  embarks  on  a business  venture  without

permission  from the Land Office and is subsequently

discovered, then the law must follow. Why should the

law  now  be  binding, particularly as  one  of  the

eminent Members of this Assembly makes the law?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, apart from his personal interests in these

matters,  may  I go on to say this?  There  are  two

points  he  has made two valid points  of  substance

which  I  think merit a firm reply. First, additions

to  squatter  huts on Crown land. Second,  the  fact

that  the  Crown takes a firm stand against  further

illegal buildings which, according to him, leads  to

unhappiness for squatters on private land. This is a

perennial problem. Crown lands are of two kinds when

you  let them out. One is under Temporary Occupation

Licences,  the other is under a proper  lease.  What

the  Member  for  Jalan Kayu was referring  to  were

Temporary Occupation Licences. In other words,  land

which  has  been  earmarked for  public  development

- schools,  clinics,  community  centres,  veterinary

centres and so on. Sooner or later, maybe this  year

or  next year, but definitely within the foreseeable

future  - five to ten years - there will  be  building

and  user of land. And the more extensions we allow,

the  more compensation will have to be paid  out  of

public  funds. It is not our money. It is the people

of  Singapore's money. Is the Member for Jalan  Kayu

seriously   suggesting   that   we,   having    been

sufficiently  humane in allowing the encroachers  to

remain   and  giving  them  a  Temporary  Occupation

Licence  at nominal rent, should further burden  the

public   treasury   by   the  prospect   of   bigger

compensation  when  the land is ultimately  required

for  use?  If  he  does, and he thinks  he  can  win

popular public support, then I say he should move  a

resolution  in  this Assembly and we will  hear  his

reasons why we should pursue his policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fully aware that there is a shortage of land

in Singapore, as can he seen from the efforts of the

Ministry   of  National  Development  in  reclaiming

Kallang  Basin,  the seaside from  Bedok  to  Nicoll

Highway and Merdeka Bridge, and my own little effort

in  London  to  get back 300 acres of  farming  land

inside  the  Naval Base. All this we get  no  thanks

for. What we are asked to do is something which,  to

my  mind, is manifestly wrong - to burden public land

with more tenants who will claim more compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private land is in an entirely different category.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the policy of this Government  is

different  from the policy of previous  Governments.

This  Government  has  an  assessment  policy  which

actively   discourages  the  holding  of  land   for

speculative purposes, in other words, buying  a  big

piece  of  land,  squatting on  it,  waiting  for  a

fraction  of  time  for an increase  in  population,

development  around the area which  will  bring  the

price  up, and then selling it. Whether a  house  is

vacant  or not, assessment is put up. Therefore,  it

becomes necessary for the land-owner to utilise  his

land.  Sir, if this were a Government out to protect

the  landlords, squatters would not have got  in  in

the  first  place, let alone expand their  holdings.

adding  rooms  to squatter huts. There  is  a  whole

kampong now in Kampong Chentek, another one  in  the

whole  of the area between the Race Course and  Sime

Road, private land, squatted. If we had let out  our

Crown  land  on  T.O.L.s and held them,  this  thing

would  not  have taken place. I am not  saying  that

this  is  an answer to the problem. Here was  vacant

land  not  utilised, not looked after, and squatters

have  moved  in. The last I saw of  it  was  that  a

telephone  has  been installed  and  so  have  water

pipes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be that ultimately a land policy may

have to be formulated in which vacant land user  may

have  to  be acquired for public disposal.  But  the

plain   fact  of  the  matter  remains,   that   the

Government cannot prevent the private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



land-owner from allowing or not disallowing his

land for certain uses. It has nothing to do with us.

But  what  we are considering is the possibility  of

land  in  agricultural areas, not  in  rural  areas,

marked for agriculture on the Master Plan, where the

land is arable, and the question of letting out  the

land if the owner does not utilise it.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would be glad, Mr Speaker, Sir, for

constructive  proposals. If  the  Member  for  Jalan

Kayu, with all the experience of dodging in and  out

of  the  law and growing wealthier in the course  of

the  years, could explain to me how we could do  it,

we would be indebted ---

by $10 in respect of item (15)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the Registrar of Citizens and

Commissioner for Registration of Persons. I say that

in  the  past few months the Registrar has not  been

able  to help a lot of innocent people obtain  their

citizenship. For example, there are people like  Mr

Tan  Lark Sye who have lost their citizenship during

these  months.  So unless some steps  are  taken  to

ensure that innocent people are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



deprived  of  their citizenship unnecessarily,  then

the situation will become worse.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  the cases of the persons whom  the  Member

for  Tampines  has mentioned are under consideration

by the Committee of Inquiry and I do not think it is

permissible   to  discuss  them  in  this   Chamber.

However,  let  me remind the Member of the  relevant

section  of  the  Singapore  Citizenship  Ordinance,

section 22 (2)  of which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may, by order, deprive any such

citizen  of his citizenship if he is satisfied  that

the registration or certificate of naturalization -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) was obtained by means of fraud, false

representation or the concealment of  any  material

fact; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) was effected or granted by mistake.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 22 (3) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may, by order, deprive any such

citizen  of his citizenship if he is satisfied  that

that citizen -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) has shown himself by act or speech to be

disloyal or disaffected towards His Majesty  or

to Singapore; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) has, during any war in which His Majesty may

be  engaged,  unlawfully traded or communicated

with  an  enemy,  or  has been  engaged  in  or

associated  with any business that was  to  his

knowledge  carried  on in  such  manner  as  to

assist an enemy in that war; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) has within five years after registration or

naturalization been sentenced in any country to

imprisonment  for a term of not less  than  two

years; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) has at any time after registration or

naturalization  been engaged in any  activities

which  are  prejudicial  to  the  security   of

Malaya,  or  the  maintenance of  public  order

therein,   or   the  maintenance   therein   of

essential   services,  or   in   any   criminal

activities   which  are  prejudicial   to   the

interests  of  public  safety,  peace  or  good

order.'.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain very clearly to the Member for

Tampines that the situation which we face now  is  a

most  unusual situation. We are living in  times  of

danger when the security not only of Malaysia but of

Malaya  and  Singapore,  is being  threatened.  When

robbers knock on our doors,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



it   is   quite  important  that  we  do  not   have

accomplices  or  thieves  in  our  midst.  And   any

government will be failing in its duty if it permits

a  situation to arise whereby little Wang Ching Weis

or  Quislings are permitted to endanger the security

of  the  country.  Let me also add  that  those  who

acquire  citizenship have done so within the context

that  they have come to this country freely and have

been given the liberty to exercise the franchise  in

Singapore.  That,  however,  does  not   mean   that

conferment of citizenship would allow such a  person

liberties  which he would not have exercised  before

he  acquired  citizenship. We are  aware  that  many

people  have sought citizenship with a purpose  and,

having  acquired the citizenship, their loyalty  has

not  been  towards the country which has given  them

the  liberty to prosper and enjoy the freedom  which

they  have  had. There are a number of  people  who,

having   acquired  and  enjoyed  the  privilege   of

citizenship,  now seek to destroy  the  security  of

Malaysia. The law provides that such people in  this

category  should be asked whether or not  they  have

abused  the  citizenship that has been  given  them.

Whatever  action the Government has  taken  in  this

respect  has  been done according  to  the  relevant

provisions of the Ordinance and I do not  think  the

Member  for  Tampines  ought to  complain  that  the

Government is not doing its duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I personally feel

that  those persons who are facing the possible loss

of their citizenship must be given a chance in Court

to  prove  that they are really guilty  of  being  a

threat  to  the security of Malaya and Singapore  so

that  the  innocent may be protected.  For  example,

people  like  Mr  Tan Lark Sye should  be  given  a

chance  to  show that they are guilty  of  something

before they are deprived of their citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time has expired. Will the

Member  for Tampines indicate whether he  wishes  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 11 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (50)  of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for overtime allowance for 1963 was

$2,500  but the amount has been increased to $20,000

for  next  year. I would like to know why  there  is

such  an  increase?  Is  it  because  of  the  tense

situation which requires more patrol boats to patrol

our coastal areas?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, item (50) of

subhead  1  relates  to overtime allowance  paid  to

launch  crews,  signalmen, Port  Office  hands.  The

increase from $2,500 in 1963 to $20,000 in  1964  is

brought  about  by  the  new agreement  on  overtime

allowances effective from 1st January, 1962, entered

into   between   the  Government   and   the   union

representing  these grades. Overtime  allowance  was

previously  paid  to launch-crews  only.  Under  the

existing  agreement, it was paid to all Division  IV

personnel  which include signalmen and  Port  Office

staff. Previously, overtime allowance was paid on  a

daily  basis  of a nine-hour day and  time  off  was

given in lieu of work done on Sundays, rest days and

public  holidays.  Under  the  agreement  made  now,

overtime allowance is paid on the basis of a 44-hour

week.  Time off cannot be given in lieu and  payment

must  be  made at double rate for work on rest  days

and  public  holidays. On all  days  which  are  not

Sundays  and  holidays, duty between 8.00  p.m. and 6.00 a.m. must be paid at one-quarter rate. The main

increase  is  due  to  essential  services  of  port

health,  port office and signal stations  which  are

maintained on a 24-hour basis throughout  the  year.

This  is a service which has been introduced by  the

Government  and  it has been appreciated  very  much

indeed by the shipping lines.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am surprised to

hear the amendment moved by the Member for Paya

Lebar.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



This  provision is for overtime in order  to  enable

the  workers to get more allowance. The Barisan have

been claiming all along that they are the heroes and

champions  of  the workers. Now that the  Government

has  provided more overtime allowance to the workers

for   overtime  work,  the  Barisan  are  protesting

against  this. This is a surprise to  me.  They  are

against  Malaysia  and every  move  made  by  us  is

construed  by  them  as  something  which   is   for

Malaysia,  saying  that  this  is  a  provision  for

patrolling.  Now, is this sum enough for  patrolling

the  whole coastal areas of Malaysia? They know that

the budget for the defence of Malaysia is controlled

by  the Central Government. This has nothing  to  do

with  the  State Government. They have been claiming

themselves  as heroes of the workers. But  now  they

are  protesting against this provision of  increased

overtime allowances for the workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

basing my question on the Budget because in 1963 the

provision  was for $2,500 whereas the provision  for

1964 is $20,000. Why am I raising this question?  It

is because we know that the Government is making use

of  public money for the P.A.P. We want to know  the

reason for this increase in the provision. We have a

duty  to  question the Government. The Minister  for

Labour spoke at great length on this simple question

and  what  he  spoke was all rubbish. Therefore,  it

amounts  to  the  Government  giving  free  rein  to

themselves.  They do not allow the people  to  light

their  lamps  but they themselves can  set  fire  to

houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last three days, what

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to point out that ever since the P.A.P. set up the Work Brigade it has been using its members to work for itself. It is alleged that during the recent election the P.A.P. forced the members of the Work Brigade to campaign for their candidates in the various constituencies, to

put  up posters and carry out other propaganda  work

and to intimidate the voters. Did the members of the

Work  Brigade  obey their orders? No, they  did  not

obey  them, but they were forced to do so. They were

told  that if they did not obey the Government, they

would not be able to get jobs. Now if they were able

to  take on jobs as school servants and clerks or in

hospitals  and  other Government  departments,  they

would get at least a minimum salary of $100, whereas

in the Work Brigade they get less.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the Prime Minister tours the rural areas,

members of the Work Brigade are forced to cheer him,

shout  slogans and welcome him. This is  all  wrong.

The Government is using public money to pay them  to

do  party work. This is not proper. If some  of  the

Members  are willing to work for the Party, that  is

another  matter. But some members told us that  they

were forced to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



so.  They had to go to the various branches  of  the

P.A.P. to work for the Party and to maintain  them.

This is very wrong. We hope that the Government will

not  repeat this in future. Some members may be used

by  you,  but it is best for you not to force  those

who do not want to be used by you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Member for

Jalan  Kayu made many allegations against  the  Work

Brigade. He said that the Government made use of the

Work  Brigade to campaign and to put up posters  for

the  P.A.P. during  the recent  election.  He  also

accused  us  of  forcing the  members  of  the  Work

Brigade  to  do  this  work.  I  think  it  is   not

surprising for us to hear what he has said,  because

the  Work  Brigade is not with them.  They  can  say

whatever  they like. I would like to ask the  Member

for Jalan Kayu to recollect that when he was on this

side  of  the House he visited the Work  Brigade  on

many  occasions because in his area there  are  many

roads which were built by the Work Brigade. If he is

not forgetful, he will remember that I also went  to

his  constituency  to look at the roads  which  were

built  by the Work Brigade. I do not think  he  will

deny this. The Government set up this Work Brigade because there is a real need for it. At present, the

Work  Brigade  comprises more  than  2,000  members.

Without the Work Brigade, these people will have  to

face the problem of unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their speeches during the past few days, the

Barisan   have   shown   great   concern   for   the

unemployment  problem of the people. The  Government

set up this Work Brigade to absorb the youths so  as

to  give  them training and to provide jobs  in  the

Government service. Is this not one of the means  of

absorbing  our unemployed? Many roads and drains  in

the rural areas have been built by the Work Brigade.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the rural areas know this very well.

Therefore, the expansion of the Work Brigade  is  in

keeping  with our needs and our circumstances.  That

is  why  we  want to expand it. The Member  for  Toa

Payoh was once in charge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Work Brigade. At that time he was  full  of

admiration  for the Work Brigade, but when  he  left

the  Party he made allegations as to how the  P.A.P.

forced  members of the Work Brigade to work for  our

Party.  But  the people of Singapore know  that  the

members  of  the  Work Brigade have made  their  due

contribution to the welfare of the people.  Whatever

allegations  they make will not be believed  by  the

people. The Government's explanation perhaps is that

some  departments in Singapore have been taken  over

by the Federal Government, but in spite of what they

say,  you just cannot say that there can be  such  a

great   difference  between  the   two   Development

Estimates, because the new Estimates are  only  one-fifteenth of the former Estimates. From this  point,

one can expect that the facilities to be extended to

the people of Singapore will decrease considerably.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on

the  question  of the Work Brigade - whether  it  can

solve the question of unemployment can be seen  from

the  fact  that since its inception there  are  only

7,000  members in it, and we can see the success  of

only  2,000  members.  It is  not  the  question  of

whether  the Work Brigade is desirable or  not,  but

whether  the  P.A.P think that the Work Brigade  can

solve  all the unemployment problems. We cannot  see

any  good  results from the Work Brigade  under  the

P.A.P. My colleague, the Member for Jalan Kayu,  has

said something, but let me give you further facts to

show  that the P.A.P. in organising the Work Brigade

are  not  really interested in the workers'  welfare

but  are merely interested in making use of them  as

their  political instruments. On the matter  of  the

members  of the Work Brigade being used to  campaign

for  the  P.A.P. during the September elections,  we

have  already talked about it and there is  no  need

for me to touch on it any more, but I would like  to

mention  one  thing.  In Thomson  there  is  a  Work

Brigade  camp.  Now, what are the members  doing  in

that area, or what work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



have they done? They have only built the road at  51

milestone,  Thomson Road, opposite  Thomson  Estate.

This  is  because  the  road  leads  to  the  Deputy

Chairman  of the P.A.P. Branch there. But there  are

many other roads in the Thomson area which are in  a

very bad condition. Yet the Work Brigade Camp in the

Thomson area has never been assigned to repair those

roads. At the 6th and 7th mile called Rambutan Road,

there is another road. The condition of the road  is

very  bad.  There are many other roads in  very  bad

condition,  and other areas in Singapore which  have

never been looked after or taken care of by the Work

Brigade under the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago there was a news item in the Press

saying  that  the P.A.P. Thomson Branch  had  a  new

building and the Work Brigade members were asked  to

help  in the Opening Ceremony to decorate the Branch

Office  and  one of the members was electrocuted  in

the course of decorating the Office. Now these facts

go  to  show that the P.A.P. are making use  of  the

Work  Brigade  members  to further  their  political

ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member for Sembawang will not be so

very  forgetful about what took place  in  the  last

elections  at  Sembawang,  when  the  Work   Brigade

members were used to help him, and also some members

of  the  Work Brigade were made use of  to  beat  up

Barisan members for no reason. Now, this is a  fact.

All  those  who  were beaten up  have  their  wounds

remaining to this day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. perpetrate evil deeds, they want us

to  go  along  with them. The question  now  is  not

whether those beaten up by the P.A.P. men are  still

to be seen running about in the streets, but whether

the  P.A.P. are going to let members  of  the  Work

Brigade  do  work  for the people and  not  for  the

P.A.P. itself. That is a matter of policy. If  they

really  want  to use the Work Brigade to  solve  the

unemployment  problem and to help repair  roads  and

bridges  and build roads and do other work  to  help

the  general public, then we will have no opposition

to  it. This question is very serious. Since at  the

moment,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



we  are facing various economic difficulties and the

Government  are  unable  truly  to  look  after  the

welfare  and interests of the rural people, well  on

simple  matters such as roads, bridges, cleanliness,

drainage,  the Government cannot even resolve  them.

The  people are meeting with difficulties  here  and

there. If the Government can use the Work Brigade to

help  in  this respect but they cannot or will  not,

then we will really condemn them. What value can  be

obtained  by  allotting money to  support  the  Work

Brigade? I would ask the Government. What value  has

already  been derived from this provision? Since  my

colleagues have also said something relating to this

subject, that is why I would not like to say more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, let

me   talk   briefly   about  the   allegations   and

accusations of the Member for Thomson. I  would  say

that  what he has said is mere balderdash.  He  said

that  in  the  Thomson area there is a Work  Brigade

Camp  and also there is a road in that area  leading

to the P.A.P. Branch Office and leading to the Vice-Chairman  of the P.A.P. Branch there. This  is  very

childish talk. Since there is a P.A.P. Branch there,

of course, there must be people living in that area,

the members or office-bearers of that Branch. It  is

not like the Barisan Sosialis who, when they want to

carry  out anything in a certain Branch, will  carry

lorry loads of members and supporters from elsewhere

to  give the impression that they have great support

in  that area. But their deceptive tactics will  not

deceive and blind the eyes of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the matter of members of the Work Brigade

beating  up others, it is a distortion of facts.  It

is  because  the Barisan members have  insulted  and

smeared  the  members  of the Work  Brigade  for  no

reason,  and also due to anger and under provocation

that certain members were, of course,---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, the translation seems

to have broken down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, I was wondering whether my own

microphone alone was out of order. Can we pause  for

a  little while? The translation system seems to  be

out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

members  of the P.A.P. are like urchins.  They  will

not  listen to arguments and good lessons, and after

being  taught they can never understand. I  have  to

enumerate facts to illustrate my points. Now, in  my

constituency there are two Work Brigade members  who

are secret society members. One is a fighter and the

other  is  a well-known secret society member.  They

are also P.A.P. lieutenants and the P.A.P. have been

using  these two powerful secret society members  to

further their ends during the election campaign.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of order. If the Member

knows  that they are secret society members,  it  is

his  duty  to inform the police instead  of  talking

about it in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is not a point of order, Mr

Minister. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): These two secret

society  members  were arrested  and  put  in  Pulau

Senang.  The  P.A.P. then started to negotiate  with

them, "If you want to serve us, then we will release

you." Of course, they agreed to serve the P.A.P.  So

during the Prime Minister's tour of the rural areas,

they  really helped a lot and worked late  into  the

night. Since one of the two is quite well off, he is

being made use of by the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order. Is the Member

talking  on  the  Work  Brigade  or  on  the   Prime

Minister's tours?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member has been drifting a

little  away  from the item on the Work Brigade.  It

originally started as a debate on the Work  Brigade,

but  he  mentioned what the P.A.P. did, and that  is

why we went on to the Prime Minister's tours. Please

proceed and try to speak on the Work Brigade.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

so  the  Prime Minister used one of the  two  secret

society men to carry out this purpose and he  really

carried out his job very well. In the past,  he  was

an  S.P.A. man, and he was also Mr M. P. D.  Nair's

man.  He  behaved well outwardly and every night  he

attended  P.A.P. Branch meetings. He  is  doing  all

this  as  a result of his coming to terms  with  the

P.A.P. but this chap is secretly helping Mr  M.  P.

D. Nair. The other man I mentioned was also a secret

society  member and he has been used to threaten  us

and  to create trouble among us. At least this  chap

knew us and he ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I understand what he is

telling us, but is it necessary to raise this matter

in  this  Assembly? He is telling us  a  long  story

about  some secret society gangsters going all  over

the place.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You are in order, Mr Minister. The

Member  is talking about someone. Is he a member  of

the  Work  Brigade? If he is not, then forget  about

it. If he is, then he can proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of order, Sir, If he is,

then  he should disclose his name, otherwise  it  is

all a figment of his imagination.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Probably he does not want to mention

the person's name.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have reason to believe that it is

completely untrue, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is a matter of opinion, Mr

Minister.  Perhaps we will allow the hon. Member  to

proceed. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

because  these gangster members were being recruited

into  the  Work  Brigade, conditions were  made  for

admitting them into the Work Brigade under the guise

of providing training for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On a point of

order.  The  Member has made an insulting allegation

that  the  Work Brigade is merely recruiting  secret

society members. There are many Work Brigade  camps,

one of which ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member is not allowed

to  debate  this subject when he interrupts  another

Member  who  is  speaking. Is he interrupting  on  a

point of order or on a point of clarification? I ask

him what is his point of order. Would he like to say

what is his point of order now?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member will not. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You admit that

there is a camp for the training of secret societies

and secret society members. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member for Sembawang

stop  interrupting? He rose on a point of  order.  I

ruled that the Member for Jalan Kayu should proceed.

I  think the hon. Member for Sembawang should  allow

him to proceed without interrupting. Please proceed,

Mr Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  not going to take a lot of the time  of  this

House.  I  only  express my hope that  if  the  Work

Brigade  is  being  used to solve  the  unemployment

problem,  then  the P.A.P. must  not  lay  down  any

conditions  for  the admission  of  members  of  the

public into the Work Brigade. The P.A.P. should  not

lay  down  a condition that if members of  the  Work

Brigade  were  to  help  the  P.A.P. branches   for

political  purposes, their wages would be increased.

If  you  want  to  make use of  them  for  your  own

political purpose, then it is wrong. You cannot make

use  of public funds to achieve a political aim. But

if  some  members of the Work Brigade of  their  own

wish want to help the P.A.P., that is another matter

altogether.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to the

Opposition, I feel that they do not understand  what

the  Work  Brigade is here for. Just because  in  an

organisation of about 2,000 people there are  a  few

members who the Barisan imagine are gangsters,  they

try to smear the whole organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has asked me whether the

Work Brigade will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



able  to  solve the unemployment problem.  It  shows

that  he  does not understand at all what  the  Work

Brigade is for. I say that the Work Brigade will not

be  able to solve the unemployment problem,  but  it

will help to solve it for the simple reason that the

Work  Brigade  is an organisation where  we  try  to

recruit  young people who have left school  and  who

have  no  skill, and we give them training in  every

way  we  can.  At the moment, we are working  out  a

scheme  whereby we can turn them into masons in  six

months so that they can participate in our expanding

construction  work.  Now, the Member  for  Ubi  Kayu

--- [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry, the Member for Jalan

Kayu.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As I have said before, someone called

him "kayu".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker. It

was a slip of the tongue. I thought it was Ubi Kayu,

but ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is no need to repeat it again.

Mr Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Now, the Member for Jalan Kayu - I

hope  it  is  right  this time - has  said  that  the

Government  forced members of the  Work  Brigade  to

intimidate  the electors. I do not know  whether  he

understands  human nature, because you can  force  a

chap  to  do  a  certain thing, but  you  definitely

cannot force him to intimidate another man. He  said

that   these  people  helped  the  P.A.P. in   the

elections. Well, the Work Brigade is a force of over

2,000  young  men. This is a democratic country  and

these  people have their own beliefs.  They  are  of

different  religions and they have  affiliations  to

different Parties. If some of them want to help  the

P.A.P. outside  their office  hours,  there  is  no

reason why they should not do so. For that matter, I

believe  some  of them may have helped  the  Barisan

Sosialis. As regards intimidation and the beating up

of  people, I think the Barisan boys have beaten  up

and have intimidated more of our chaps. In fact,  if

what they say is true, they can resort to the law;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



they  can  make a report to the police and then  the

law will take its own natural course of action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another allegation made that the Prime

Minister  in  his tours of the constituencies  makes

use  of  the Work Brigade. That is true.  The  Prime

Minister in his tours of the constituencies  has  in

attendance  staff from every department because  the

purpose of his tours is to find out from the  people

what  they  want.  Therefore, he  has  with  him  in

attendance  people from the Public Works Department,

people  from  the  Work  Brigade,  people  from  the

C.B.S.,  people from the P.U.B., so that whenever  a

request is made of him on the spot, he will be  able

to  weigh  and will be able to discuss  the  problem

which the people have right on the spot. In the same

way, the Work Brigade is a disciplined force. We use

it  to control the huge crowds that turn up whenever

the  Prime Minister visits the constituencies.  Now,

they  say  that the Work Brigade is a useless  body,

but  I  am glad to hear from the Member for  Thomson

that if we can prove that the Work Brigade does work

for the benefit of the public, he will fully support

it.  I  do not know whether he goes around with  his

eyes  closed  or  whether he just goes  to  Thomson.

Singapore  does  not consist only of Thomson.  There

are  51  constituencies in Singapore and  there  are

lots   of   things   to  be  done   in   all   these

constituencies.  So it does not mean  that,  because

one  or two roads in Thomson are being made up,  the

Work Brigade has not done work elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his information, Sir, and for the information

of  this  House, I would like to tell him  that  the

Work   Brigade   in   1963   undertook   this   work

- construction and maintenance of rural  and  kampong

roads, construction and repair of timber bridges  in

rural areas. Sir, if I read the whole list, it  will

take  a  long  time. There is on this list  here  20

items   which  the  Work  Brigade  has  done   - land

reclamation,   site   preparation   for    Sembawang

resettlement  areas.  Now, it does  not  mean  that,

because in Thomson there are two roads made up,  the

Work Brigade has not been doing anything. There  is,

for instance, the Kallang River



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



improvement scheme, co-operation of Jalan Damar  and

Tanah  Merah  sanitary  scheme,  and  also  in   the

Southern  Islands  improvement  schemes  under   the

heading of fish prawn culture. The Member for  Jalan

Kayu  may  be interested if he wants to improve  the

output  of his prawn ponds. We welcome him if  as  a

member   of  the  public  he  comes  and  asks   for

information  or  advice.  [Laughter]  Well,  we  are

helping them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Minister is making a personal attack on me.

The matter that I have raised has got nothing to  do

with me personally.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister is making a personal

allegation against the Member for Jalan Kayu.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> With due deference, Sir, I am not

making  any  allegations against  him.  What  I  was

saying  was that we have these facilities ready  for

them  as members of the public. We are able to  help

people with prawn culture, and therefore, as members

of  the  public, anyone, including the  Member,  can

approach us.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister is coming pretty

close  to  attacking  the  Member  for  Jalan  Kayu.

Members on the Government side did heckle the Member

for  Jalan  Kayu and make several allegations  which

add  to  the confusion. Can we leave the Member  for

Jalan Kayu and his prawns alone? Please proceed, Mr

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Well, it has also been said that

the   Work   Brigade  does  not  train  people   for

employment, that there has been no turnover.  But  I

would  like  to point out that since 1960  the  Work

Brigade  has trained 2,500 young boys who  have  had

discipline  in the force, who have had  training  in

certain trades, and who have been employed by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



Government  and  other  statutory  bodies.  It  has,

therefore, served its purpose in training people who

in  between  leaving school and finding  employment,

people  who in order to become leaders of the future

should  first be disciplined. Therefore,  Sir,  from

this you can see that the Work Brigade is serving  a

useful purpose in our community, and I therefore say

the Work Brigade should be allowed to carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Government benches have been trying to  distort

our  views  on the Work Brigade. They say we  allege

that  the Work Brigade is entirely useless, that  it

is  an organisation of secret society members.  This

is not what we have said. They are trying to whip up

discontent  among the members of the  Work  Brigade

against the Barisan Sosialis by saying so. In  other

words,  they are trying to give members of the  Work

Brigade  an  impression that in  the  event  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis coming to power, then some members

of  the Work Brigade will be expelled. This sort  of

talk  is  more  or  less intimidation  against  some

members  of  the Work Brigade who are now supporting

the  Barisan  Sosialis. We do  not  deny  that  some

members  of the Work Brigade are useful youths  who,

by  sheer dint of circumstances, are unemployed  and

have to join the Work Brigade for the time being  to

tide  over their present difficulties and to  enable

them   to   have  some  means  of  livelihood.   But

unfortunately,  in spite of what  the  Minister  for

National  Development has said with  regard  to  the

achievements  of the Work Brigade in  the  field  of

road  construction, the Government  can  never  deny

that  the  Work Brigade has been used by the  P.A.P.

for  propaganda  purposes. This the  Government  can

never deny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We deny.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for

National  Development has said just  now  that  some

members  of  the  Work Brigade can  have  their  own

political choice. They have freedom of religion  and

freedom  of  political ideas. But can the  Party  in

power  explain  why  a lot of members  of  the  Work

Brigade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



have  been  expelled en bloc at the same time?  Why?

Now,  this  is  political  persecution.  Persecution

against those --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Please allow the Member to

proceed.  We  have not much time  left.  If  we  are

continually  going to have arguments  from  here  to

there,  with somebody in the middle, I am  afraid  I

cannot  follow the English translation of  what  the

Member  is  saying in Chinese. So, if  Members  will

appreciate the task I have, perhaps we can have less

arguments from one side to the other with someone in

the middle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  we  are  facing now is a crisis. What  is  the

crisis  about?  It is that the P.A.P. are  misusing

public  funds  by  establishing an  organisation  in

support  of  its own political Party. The Government

are trying to adopt the policy of starvation against

some  unemployed youths in Singapore and induce them

to  join  the Work Brigade under the guise  of  road

construction  and other work. But  the  real  motive

behind  all  these acts is to make use of  the  Work

Brigade for its own political ends. And this we  are

opposed.  We  are against all methods by  which  the

Government try to make use of public funds for their

own  political ends. That is all I wish to say,  Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Chairman, as far as I remember, when we started

the   organisation  of  the  Work  Brigade,  it  was

actually mooted by the Member for Hong Lim with  the

idea of alleviating the problem of unemployment. The

original  intention of the Government in setting  up

the  Work Brigade was, on the one hand, to help some

unemployed persons to have relief work in  order  to

earn  their livelihood; on the other hand, to assist

villagers  in  getting more sanitary  amenities  and

other  health  services in the various rural  areas,

such  as the construction of drains, the removal  of

lallang,  and  such other work. So the Work  Brigade

was  originally set up to serve the interests of the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



I remember that we had a camp in Sembawang to absorb

some  unemployed youths in that area. In fact,  most

members  of  the Sembawang camp of the Work  Brigade

came  from the villages around this area. This shows

that  the Work Brigade has the support of the people

in  general.  If  we  do not close  our  eyes  while

walking  around Singapore Island, then  we  can  see

that  there  are a lot of Work Brigade men  at  work

clearing  the  drains, assisting farmers  to  remove

weeds  and  lallang, and helping them do  some  work

which they are unable to do themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Barisan Sosialis has the effrontery to turn

round  and  say that we are making use of  the  Work

Brigade for our political purposes. I remember  when

the  Barisan  Sosialis left the P.A.P. there  was  a

group  of  members  in  the Work  Brigade  who  were

supporters  of  the Barisan Sosialis then  and  they

were  expelled because they were trying to  obstruct

whatever  measures the Government were  adopting  to

improve  the rural areas. Some of these people  even

went  to the extent of burning the bicycles  of  the

rural  people and assaulting some members  who  were

not members of the Barisan Sosialis. As a result  of

their  behaviour, there was a lot of chaos  in  the

Work   Brigade  camps.  These  trouble-makers   were

expelled  because of their misbehaviour in the  Work

Brigade  and because of their attempts  to  whip  up

rebellious feelings in the Work Brigade.  They  even

tried  to  turn  members of the  Work  Brigade  into

rioters. I remember the Member for Thomson  said  in

his  speech that in the event of some union  members

supporting  the  Barisan  Sosialis, they  would  be

persecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the Nanyang undergraduates, I

remember  there  were lorry loads  carrying  Nanyang

undergraduates   with  the   banners   of   Nanyang

University,   and  some  banners  of   the   Barisan

Sosialis,  appealing to the public to vote  for  the

Barisan  Sosialis. We have seen all this but  we  do

not  say  that  all  the undergraduates  of  Nanyang

University  are supporting the Barisan Sosialis.  In

fact, some of our members on this side are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



graduates of Nanyang University. In fact, there  are

also other undergraduates of Nanyang who are ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Parliamentary   Secretary  has   been   talking   on

irrelevant matters such as Nanyang University  which

is not a matter under discussion now.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Parliamentary Secretary

has been relevant here, because allegations from the

Barisan  side  have  been that the  People's  Action

Party  used the Work Brigade for the elections,  and

he  is  merely making counter-allegations  that  the

Barisan used other people, including Nantah, for the

elections.   Please   proceed,   Mr   Parliamentary

Secretary.  Try to get back to the Work  Brigade  as

soon as possible.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank you for

your  ruling, Mr Speaker. I just mentioned  Nanyang

University in passing to show that there was nothing

wrong  in  some members of the Work Brigade  helping

the P.A.P. This was because these members believe in

the  policies  of the P.A.P. and they  came  out  to

support the P.A.P. There was nothing wrong in it  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Jurong a few moments

ago said that he was not saying that all members  of

the  Work  Brigade were bad hats but, on  the  other

hand,  he  said that in the Work Brigade there  were

some  members who have been forced to join the  Work

Brigade  by  the Government's starvation  policy.  I

just  do  not  understand how there could  be  2,000

members  of the Work Brigade if they were forced  by

the  Government's starvation policy to join the Work

Brigade.   Then  they  would  not  be  helping   the

Government to clear the drains and engage  in  other

construction activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, it

seems  that the Member concerned does not understand

the meaning of "starvation policy".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am saying that

the  Member for Jurong has been ignorant of how  the

Work Brigade was established. It is because the Work

Brigade  did  not help the Barisan Sosialis  in  the

elections that they turn round and accuse  the  Work

Brigade  of  certain things. Now, if  we  apply  the

argument further, we say that Nanyang University has

been  used  by  the  Barisan  because  some  of  the

students have been helping them. Can you say all  of

them belong to the Barisan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the existence of the Work Brigade at present is significant. As far as I know, there is a plan under way to absorb more members into it because there are many people who are desirous of joining it. Now if it is not doing any good work, then there will not be anyone joining.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

let  me  say  something. Just now the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs  talked

about  the history of the establishment of the  Work

Brigade  and  the achievements of the Work  Brigade.

Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not oppose the set-up of the

Work  Brigade. We know the work done by it. We  also

know  the  motive behind the setting up of the  Work

Brigade.   What  we  oppose  is  that   the   P.A.P.

Government  is  making use of the  Work  Brigade  to

attain   their  political  ends.  The  Parliamentary

Secretary  said certain members of the Work  Brigade

were expelled because they burned bicycles and cars.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, do you think that people  really

believe  this?  Can the Government  allow  the  Work

Brigade members to burn bicycles and cars?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that as far as we know, some

members  of  the Work Brigade were expelled  because

many of them did not want themselves to be made  use

of  as  spectators to welcome the Prime Minister  on

his  visits.  They did not want to  obey  the  Prime

Minister  and  as a result they were expelled.  They

were  expelled  because they did not want  to  allow

themselves  to  be  made use of  by  the  P.A.P.  Of

course,  the P.A.P. do not want to admit it, because

this  is shameful. If they do not want to admit  it,

it  is our duty to reveal the facts to the people of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my area, Paya Lebar, during the

election,  at  night, there were two lorry-loads  of

Work  Brigade members who encamped near the Airport.

They patrolled the area and pulled down the election

posters  of  their opponents. These are  the  facts.

Some  of  them carried parangs and clubs to beat  up

the  members  of the Barisan Sosialis. They  did  it

during  the  middle  of  the night.  They  assaulted

workers  of  other  political Parties.  They  cannot

deceive  the people any more. These are  the  facts.

They  cannot hide it. Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that

the  Government is not willing to admit  the  facts.

All these things occurred in the rural areas. It  is

well  known  to the people in the rural  areas,  but

people  in the town area are in the dark as  to  the

real state of affairs. Therefore, it is our duty  to

reveal  how  the  Government made use  of  the  Work

Brigade to carry out propaganda work for the  P.A.P.

during the recent elections.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on a

point  of order. I see the Member for Paya Lebar  is

speaking not like a Member of this Assembly but like

a gangster.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not follow the Member for

Kampong  Kapor's point of order. He says the  Member

for Paya Lebar is not speaking like a Member of this

Assembly but like a gangster. What does he mean?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): We respect this

Chamber and we should not permit any activities, any

acts like gangsterism to be done here. I think it is

not decorous, if, in the opinion of the Speaker,  it

is not against decorum, well, i have no objection.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I asked the Member for Kampong Kapor

what  he  meant. I still do not know what  he  meant

when  he said the Member for Paya Lebar was speaking

like a gangster. I therefore rule him completely out

of  order  and  I ask the Member for Paya  Lebar  to

proceed, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

intended  to  finish my speech  just  now,  but  the

Member from the other side said I was behaving like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



a gangster. I want an apology from him. Just now the

Minister for Culture was pointing his finger  at  us

when he was making a speech, and yet we did not  say

he  was  a  gangster. I require an apology from  the

Member for Kampong Kapor.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Paya Lebar note

that  I  have  already  ruled that  the  Member  for

Kampong  Kapor  is out of order and that  the  Chair

does not think that he spoke like a gangster?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Originally  it  was not my intention to  speak,  but

after  hearing one of the Opposition Members  saying

that  in the last general elections many members  of

the   Work  Brigade  tore  down  posters,  beat   up

political opponents, and carried clubs and  parangs,

this shows contempt for members of the Work Brigade.

Mr  Speaker, if warriors go to war with their  arms

and  weapons,  if  farmers use their  changkols  and

fishermen  their fishing nets, then members  of  the

Work  Brigade have dedicated themselves to the cause

of  the public. Can these people be considered as  a

group  of  gangsters, beating up people  during  the

late nights, as though this country has gone back to

the  law  of  the jungle? This is contempt  for  the

members  of the Work Brigade. Mr Speaker,  we  know

the  tree because of its fruit. We see the fruit and

we  know from what tree it comes. The tongue  speaks

for  the  heart.  Therefore,  members  of  the  Work

Brigade are very angry. They have served the  public

by  cleaning drains and making up roads. The Barisan

Sosialis   threw  wild  allegations  - salary   $150;

running  dogs  of Lee Kuan Yew, and  so  on  and  so

forth. Even we Members of this Assembly listening to

such  allegations get very furious.  Those  expelled

members  of  the  Work Brigade were those  who  were

engaged  in  agitation.  Therefore,  allegations  of

beating  up people are all unfounded. It is contempt

for  the thousands of Work Brigade members who  have

contributed their bit towards society. I  think  the

Member  should  withdraw these  serious  allegations

against  the  Work  Brigade  members  who  have   no

opportunity  to  defend themselves in  this  Chamber

against such allegations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, at first I had no intention of saying anything,

but  after  seeing that the Government  benches  are

paying  very much attention to this, since  "it  has

caught  hold  of  their painful legs",  I  will  now

discuss  it further because these facts have exposed

the  evil deeds of the P.A.P. We have said just  now

that we do not oppose the Work Brigade members,  but

what  we  are  against is that  the  Government  are

making  use  of  their starvation policy  to  coerce

people  into  joining the Work Brigade in  order  to

make use of them to do things for the P.A.P.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the incidents mentioned by us, they are

concrete  facts which cannot be denied. I will  give

further examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago, in the small hours of the night at

Toa Payoh, an incident happened at the office of the

Country  People's Association. This  Association  is

now banned by the P.A.P. Certain members of the Work

Brigade  were  engaged to wreck the  office  of  the

Association  there. Of course, the  members  of  the

Work  Brigade did not dare do such a thing. But they

did  it because they were thinking of their work and

of  their  stomach. They had to make  a  living  and

therefore  they  had to take directions  from  those

behind  them  - namely  the  P.A.P.  So  we  are  not

condemning the members of the Work Brigade.  We  are

only  complaining about the way in which the  P.A.P.

are  making use of the members of the Work  Brigade.

We  did not lodge any complaint. But we did disclose

these  facts.  But the main Chinese  newspapers  and

other  newspapers did not publish these  facts.  The

reasons  are  obvious to all, There  has  been  some

intimidation from certain authorities to prevent the

news   from   being  published.  Who   directed   or

instigated the members of the Work Brigade to  wreck

the  office  of the Country People's Association?  I

mention  this incident only to show that the members

of   the   Work   Brigade  had  been   coerced   and

intimidated. If they had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



not  carried  out the orders, they would  have  been

sacked.  This  goes  to show  that  the  P.A.P. are

suppressing them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, our friends opposite

have  made certain allegations. To me, they are just

fantasies  and cooked-up stories. We all  know  that

Singapore  is a country ruled by law. There  is  the

rule  of law in the legal institutions of Singapore.

If any illegal act is committed, then it is the duty

of a citizen to make a report to the police or lodge

a  complaint for action to be taken in  a  court  of

law.  I believe that the Barisan Sosialis have  many

lawyers behind them. They would be able to take this

case  to the Court. They have people like Mr T.  T.

Rajah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another allegation is that certain members of the

Work  Brigade  were  sacked  because  they  did  not

support  the P.A.P. But the true reason is  that  in

any  organisation there must be rules regulating the

discipline of its members, and if any member of that

organisation  infringes any of  its  regulations  he

will  then  be  duly  dealt with  according  to  the

regulations.  If  any  of  the  members  commits  an

offence, he will then be dealt with according to the

regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Head "Building Survey"

concerns a department which carries out such work

as the inspection of buildings. I would like to ask

the Government   some  questions  in   regard   to

the inspection of houses, structures, chicken-sheds

and pig-sties built by the farmers. This department also

has the duty of inspecting attap houses built by the

farmers.  Of  course,  we do not  agree  that  attap

houses  can  be built at any place. But we  can  see

only  a  few  houses  in  certain  areas  where  the

population  is  not dense. We can  see  one  or  two

houses in certain areas with families staying there,

keeping  poultry and rearing pigs and chickens.  But

this  department  has sent out notices  to  demolish

their  houses.  But when I visited those  places,  I

found the chicken-sheds and huts were so small  that

they  could not even accommodate the Minister's car.

Even   such   structures  were  given  notices   for

demolition.  For the sake of making a living,  those

people  have  to  set up small  sheds  in  order  to

maintain  their  livelihood. Yet the Government  are

giving them notices to demolish the structures. Even

their  applications to extend the buildings,  houses

and  sheds  have been turned down, Even requests  to

repair leaking roofs have been turned down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to see the Chief Building Surveyor and he

told   me   that  this  was  a  matter   under   the

jurisdiction of the Minister. He himself  could  not

do  anything. Since he said that he could do nothing

in this respect, I thought that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



these   farmers  might  go  to  see   the   Minister

concerned. But the Minister did not care to see them

because these problems did not affect him. So he was

not  unduly  worried about it. But these things  are

closely  linked  up  with  the  livelihood  of   the

farmers.  The ordinary chicken-sheds, pig-sties  and

structures are also being dealt in this way  by  the

Government.  There were houses which  were  somewhat

extended; the extensions were not very extensive and

yet  they were prohibited and notices were given for

them  to  be  demolished. Of course, there  must  be

cases  where the Government could remind the farmers

in  advance about what could be done and what should

not  be  done because the farmers in general  cannot

know   the   niceties  of  laws,   regulations   and

procedures   of   the  different  departments.   The

Government should spend some time explaining to  the

farmers  so  as to guide and teach them. Then  there

will be fewer cases of farmers building unauthorised

structures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have raised this point in order to urge the

Government  to  be flexible. It should  not  try  to

demolish such unauthorised structures whenever  they

are  built. The Government should, at least, in  its

publicity work, enlighten the farmers on this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San and Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I prefer to have one speaker from the

Opposition and one speaker from the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  again  misrepresented  the  facts.   He

alleged  that  I was not interested  in  seeing  the

farmers. As far as I can remember, I am available to

anybody who has a legitimate grievance to air, and I

do  not  remember any of the farmers wanting to  see

me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We give notice to quit or notice of demolition

under   certain  circumstances.  Firstly,   if   the

building  is unauthorised; secondly, if the  repairs

or  the  enlargement is not according to  the  plans

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



have   been   submitted,  or  the   enlargement   is

unauthorised.  We have staff in our  department  who

will  be  able to help these farmers if they  really

want to undertake legitimate repairs. In most of the

cases that we have come across, they are not repairs

but   enlargements   and   extensions   of   illegal

buildings.  As  I have said before,  there  must  be

control,  not  only over attap huts, but  even  over

well   constructed  modern  flats.  There  must   be

control,  otherwise there would  be  chaos  in  this

town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time there is an unauthorised erection, we

send  people there to investigate, and in most cases

we  find  that they are either unauthorised  or  the

reconstruction  that has taken  place  has  involved

additional  floor area to the building.  Very  often

additional  living units complete with living  room,

kitchen and toilet facilities have been added to the

original  building. If these were allowed to  go  on

unchecked,  very soon you would have an  area  where

you  would  find that there is no access, and  where

usually  it is a fire trap, as in the case of  Bukit

Ho  Swee and the two fires that happened recently in

Geylang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, if a farmer really wants to build,

he  can always come and see our staff; submit a plan

which is according to specifications and which  will

allow him to have a healthy house, As the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  has said, some of these  units  are  so

small  that  even a car cannot be put in. Therefore,

these  are  not  fit for habitation. Must  we  allow

units of this type to be put up?

willing to live in unhygienic structures and houses.

It  is not of their own free will that they have  to

live  in  such places. Our constructive  suggestions

with  regard  to  rural development  have  not  been

publicised adequately, and there has been a  lot  of

allegations against the Government for their failure

to improve the lot of the poor farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning there were about 20 families in the

Lim  Chu Kang area who have had their farms,  houses

and vegetables affected adversely. This morning when

I went there I saw a riot squad, policemen, red vans

and  radio  cars  and some Malays  carrying  knives,

wooden sticks and parangs. Bulldozers were also used

over  the  vegetable farms. How did  this  state  of

affairs   come   about?  This   is   the   so-called

Government's  intention of helping  the  farmers  to

live  in flats, so that action can be taken to drive

them away from their farms. Now, what happens?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> On a point of order, Sir. We are

debating  Head  14  - Building  Survey.  We  are  not

debating resettlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point is in order. We are

debating Head 14 - Building Survey. Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

demolition  of  houses  is connected  with  Building

Survey.  In  fact, it is connected  with  the  rural

development  scheme  of the Government.  I  am  just

bringing  your attention to this morning's  incident

to show that the farmers have no place to live in. I

rang up the National Development Ministry as well as

the  Social  Welfare Department, but  there  was  no

reply  as  to how these affected farmers are  to  be

dealt  with.  They say that these  farmers  will  be

given Housing Board flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> On a point of order, Sir, Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member is referring to a piece  of

land belonging to the Housing Board. The eviction of

trespassers  on  that land has  no  bearing  on  the

subject  we  are  now discussing.  I  hope  he  will

confine himself to the subject under discussion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point is we have not got much

time  left. The Member speaking at present has  only

about two to three minutes more. So perhaps we  will

allow  him  to wind up the proceedings of  the  day.

Please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I have brought

out  these  facts for the purpose of the  record  so

that the Government will know what to do with regard

to the livelihood of these farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with this question, we want the

Government  to be careful in dealing with  these  20

families (comprising at least about 100 persons) who

are  affected by the action this morning. This is  a

picture  showing  the  demolition  action   of   the

Government    which   was   taken    this    morning

[Indicating].



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, here again it

is  a misrepresentation of facts. Though it does not

come  under  the debate in question, but  since  you

have allowed him to go on, I would like to give  you

the  true  facts  of the case. These  people,  as  a

Backbencher has said, are trespassers who  had  been

occupying Housing Board land for a long time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Squatters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> No. Squatters on Housing Board

land   - yes.   They   were  given  every   available

opportunity   to  move  out.  In  fact,  alternative

accommodation in substitution was offered  to  them,

but  they  refused. They turned down the offer  and,

just  like  in Toa Payoh, they were bluffed  by  the

Barisan boys. They were told to stay until the  very

last  minute,  when we had to say,  "Well,  we  have

given  you enough time." They refused to budge,  and

that is why we had to take quite strong action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time the Barisan boys give a picture, it is

a  wrong picture. They never give the other side  of

the picture.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to

speak in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One minute left.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

since  time  is short I do not propose to  talk  too

much. I would like to reply to the points raised  by

the Opposition in the shortest time possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that the Member for Jalan Kayu

is  not really interested in the farmers. What he is

interested in are pigs, fish ponds, prawn ponds, and

chickens. A few days ago ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There should be no personal attacks.

We  have had this throughout the day. The Member has

half a minute left, Is that all he proposes to talk?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): There is a law in

every  country. Singapore is a place where the  rule

of  law prevails. If you want to build a house,  you

can  do  so  provided  you  submit  a  plan  to  the

Government,  and on approval you can  go  ahead  and

build   it.  You  will  then  never  have  to   face

demolition. But the Member for Jalan Kayu  seems  to

be  encouraging  the  people of Singapore  to  build

illegal and unauthorised houses and structures.



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Time is up. Does the Member

for Jalan Kayu wish to withdraw his amendment or  to

take a vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

want a vote to be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $620,420 for Head 14 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br>7.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are very close to the moment of

interruption.  If Members agree, I propose  to  take

the  Chair  again  tomorrow. No  dissentient  voice?

Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  I  beg  to report that  the  Committee  of

Supply has made progress on the Main Estimates, and

ask leave to sit again tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tomorrow it shall be.
