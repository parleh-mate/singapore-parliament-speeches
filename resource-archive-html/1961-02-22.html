<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF MEMBER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members will recollect

that during the debate on the motion moved by  the

then Member for Hong Lim inviting, inter alia, the

Assembly  to rescind my ruling which admitted  the

motion of the Deputy Prime Minister to condemn and

to  suspend  the  then Member  for  Hong  Lim  for

alleged dishonourable conduct in the Assembly,  I,

in  effect,  opined  that  the  issue  before  the

Assembly seemed to have been confused and  clouded

and I wondered whether, in view of the conflicting

opinions  that  had  been  expressed  during   the

debate,  it would not be in the interests  of  the

House  to  obtain  legal opinion  in  the  matter.

Honourable Members will recollect that the  motion

was  taken  to  a division and was defeated  by  a

majority vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there was no unanimity and as the issue raised

was,  to my mind, one of utmost importance in  the

orderly and proper conduct of the business of this

Assembly, allowing of no doubts, especially in the

mind  of  the Speaker, I prepared a memorandum  on

the  matter  and requested the Clerk  to  seek  an

opinion thereon from the Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table

in  the House of Commons-a senior officer of  that

House  primarily  charged with the  special  duty,

when asked, of assisting and advising legislatures

in  the Commonwealth on matters referred to him by

the Clerks of such legislatures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reply has been received and it would, I think,

be of interest to place on record the views of the

Fourth  Clerk-at-the-Table on the specific  points

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion by the then Member for Hong Lim was

in the following terms:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the ruling of the Speaker admitting the

motion of the Deputy Prime Minister in regard to

the Member for Hong Lim be rescinded and that this

Assembly has no jurisdiction to deal with the

matters raised therein.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stated in my memorandum that the arguments put

forward  in  the debate in favour  of  the  motion

urged, in effect-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the Assembly had no power either to

condemn  or to suspend the Member for  Hong

Lim in the circumstances of the case and in

the   light   of  the  constitutional   and

statutory provisions extant in Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that, therefore, the motion of the Deputy

Prime   Minister  sought  to  request   the

Assembly  to do something which  was  ultra

vires;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that, consequently, the Speaker ought to

have ruled that the notice of the motion of

the  Deputy Prime Minister was inadmissible

and  the  motion  could  not  therefore  be

placed on the Order Paper for debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I posed were as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Is the Speaker justified, under the

provisions of Standing Order No. 31(5)  and

having   regard  to  section  54   of   the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in  Council,

1958, to direct that a notice of motion  be

returned  if he is of the opinion that,  or

entertains  some doubt whether, the  motion

seeks   to  request  the  Assembly  to   do

something which is ultra vires?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) In the light of the inherent powers of the

Assembly,   and  the  provisions   of   the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in  Council,

1958,   the   Standing   Orders   and   the

Legislative Assembly (Power and Privileges)

Ordinance, 1955:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly: Has the Assembly power to proceed

against  a  Member by way of condemnation  (or

censure,  reprimand  or  admonition)  in   the

circumstances enunciated in the motion of  the

Deputy Prime Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly: Has the Assembly power to suspend a

Member  for dishonourable conduct of the nature

alleged  in  the  motion of  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister: and if so, to what extent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference is made in question (a) to paragraph

(5) of Standing Order No. 31 and to section 54  of

the  Singapore  (Constitution) Order  in  Council,

1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order No. 31 deals, inter alia, with the

manner of giving notices of motions and paragraph

(5) thereof reads as follows :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(5) Any such notice shall be submitted to the

Speaker or in his absence the Deputy Speaker  who

shall direct-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that it be printed in the terms in which it

was handed in; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that it be printed with such alterations as

he may direct; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that it he returned to the Member who

signed it, as being in his opinion

inadmissible for reasons stated.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) of section 54 of the Order in

Council reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Subject to the provisions of this Order and

of the Standing Orders of the Assembly, any Member

may  introduce any Bill or propose any motion  for

debate  in,  or may present any petition  to,  the

Assembly,  and  the  same  shall  be  debated  and

disposed  of according to the Standing  Orders  of

the Assembly.'



<br><br>Paragraph (2) of that section specifies  when  the

recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  must

be signified before the Assembly can proceed inter

alia upon any motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On question (a), the Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table

had, inter alia, this to say-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the Speaker would not be justified in

directing  that  a notice of motion  be  returned.

even if he is of the opinion that the motion seeks

to  request the Assembly to do something which  is

ultra  vires. He has in my view no right or status

to  prejudge the issue in this way; it is for  the

Assembly to decide.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table goes on to make two

further points, namely:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(i) To the best of my knowledge no Speaker of

the  House  of  Commons has ever  ruled  out  of

order  a notice of motion on the ground that  it

suggested  a  course of action which  was  ultra

vires.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Section 54 of the Constitution Order in

Council puts the matter fairly clearly. If a

motion   does   not   conflict   with    the

constitution  itself or  with  the  Standing

Orders (which it does not appear to do)  and

if  it does not impose a charge, etc. (which

it does not), it may be moved.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first part of question (b), that is to

say,  whether  the Assembly has power  to  proceed

against  a  Member  by  way  of  condemnation  (or

censure,  reprimand  or admonition),  the  Fourth

Clerk-at-the-Table states that he would be  fairly

certainly  of  the opinion that the Assembly  does

have such power. He adds-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There seems to be nothing indeed to prevent any

deliberative body (such as for example the Council

of  a  Trade Union) doing this, provided that  the

motion  does not contain a libel. In the  case  of

the  Legislative Assembly, the question  of  libel

does  not arise in view of Section 3 of the Powers

and  Privileges  Ordinance, 1955. Furthermore  the

words "except upon a substantive motion moved  for

that  purpose" contained in Standing Order 46 (10)

would appear expressly to envisage the moving of a

motion   condemning  a  Member  for  his  personal

conduct.'



<br><br>For  clarity,  let  me  quote  section  3  of  the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers  and   Privileges)

Ordinance,  1955, and paragraph (10)  of  Standing

Order No. 46.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3 of the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges) Ordinance, 1955, reads as follows :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`3. No civil or criminal proceedings may be

instituted against any person while a  member  of

the Assembly-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in respect of words spoken before the

Assembly or a committee thereof; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in respect of words written in a report to

the Assembly or to any committee thereof  or

in any petition, bill, resolution, motion or

question  brought  or  introduced   by   him

therein.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order No. 46 deals with the contents of

speeches and paragraph (10) thereof reads as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(10) The personal conduct of Members of the

Assembly shall not be referred to except upon a

substantive motion moved for that purpose.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of question (b), that is to

say, whether the Assembly has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



power to suspend a Member for dishonourable

conduct of the nature alleged in the motion by the

Deputy Prime Minister and if so, to what extent,

the Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table states —



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The real crux of the matter, as Mr Speaker

Oehlers  realises,  is whether  the  Assembly  has

power  to  suspend  a  Member  otherwise  than  in

accordance with paragraph (1) of S. O. No. 56.  My

own opinion is that it has, but I would hasten  to

add  that  my  answer is not given  with  as  much

certainty as I would wish.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table continues—



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The key to the problem seems to lie in Standing

Order No. 56 (5). I think that this paragraph  can

be  taken  to confer a power upon the Assembly  to

suspend  a  Member otherwise than  in  accordance

with  paragraph  (1) of the Order.  The  parallel

provision in the Commons Standing Orders, as  was

noted in the course of your debate, is No. 22  (6)

which  reads "nothing in this order shall be taken

to  deprive  the House of the power of  proceeding

against  any Member according to ancient  usage".

It  is clear that the Commons may still suspend  a

Member  otherwise than as a result  of  his  being

named  by  the Speaker. The Commons  practice  in

this regard is, relevant to the interpretation  of

Singapore  SO. No. 56 (5) by virtue  of  Singapore

S.O. No. 103 (1)...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will no doubt recall that

under  the provisions of paragraph (1) of Standing

Order No. 56 a Member may be suspended on a motion

moved  after he has been named by the  Speaker  in

regard to certain acts of disorderly conduct;  and

paragraph  (5)  of that Standing  Order  reads  as

follows:—



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(5) Nothing in this Standing Order shall be

taken  to  deprive the Assembly of  the  power  of

proceeding  against any Member  according  to  any

resolution of the Assembly.'



<br><br>Paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 103 reads as

follows:—



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) In cases of doubt the Standing Orders of the

Assembly shall be interpreted in the light of  the

relevant   practice  of  the  Commons   House   of

Parliament   of   Great  Britain, and   Northern

Ireland.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the extent of any suspension, the

Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table states, inter alia, —



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I cannot help thinking that a conditional

suspension  of the type in question may  be  wrong

since  it in fact disenfranchises the constituency

for an unlimited period.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>



The  Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table, however,  mentions

the  case of a Member of the House of Commons  who

was  in fact suspended during the pleasure of  the

House, and in any event, he goes on to say that it

is  doubtful whether the Commons possess the power

to suspend a Member beyond the end of a Session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table also touches on the

jurisdiction  of  the  Courts  of  Law  in   these

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He points out that if this Assembly had wished to

pursue  the  matter  raised by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  to  a conclusion, it would have  had  to

vote  on the Deputy Prime Minister's motion  after

listening  to  the arguments for and  against  the

vires of its proposed action, bearing in mind that

its  action — if  it resulted in suspension  of  the

then  Member  for Hong Lim — might be  tested  in  a

Court of Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is further pointed out by the Fourth

Clerk-at-the-Table that any decision of this Assembly  that

a  matter  is  intra vires cannot be  regarded  as

final  insofar  as there may exist an  opportunity

for  testing its legality in a Court of Law.  This

would  be  so  even  if, as suggested  during  the

debate,  the  Assembly had sought  and  agreed  to

abide   by   the   opinion   of   so   eminent   a

constitutional  lawyer as Sir Ivor  Jennings;  but

the  fact that the Assembly acted on that  opinion

would   not   in  itself  persuade  the   Judicial

Committee  of the Privy Council if the issue  came

before  them that the Assembly's action must  have

been  intra  vires.  And,  of  course,  Honourable

Members are aware that there is judicial provision

whereby  a decision of a Court of Law in Singapore

could  under  certain circumstances  be  taken  on

appeal  to  the Judicial Committee  of  the  Privy

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to any decision which may have been

taken  by this Assembly to condemn the then Member

for  Hong  Lim, as distinct from any  decision  to

suspend him, the Fourth Clerk-at-the-Table  is  of

the  opinion that the question of a test as to the

legality  of that decision in a Court of Law  does

not  seem to arise, for there is nothing for which

a Member who has been condemned by resolution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>



could sue. He cannot sue for libel, since there is

a statutory bar to this, and no other right of his

has been infringed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, and perhaps, I venture to state, to

the  minds of some if not all Honourable  Members,

the  difficulties, procedural and  constitutional,

which  faced  this House in the whole  proceedings

stemmed   mainly   from  the   present   Ordinance

declaring  and  defining certain  of  the  powers,

privileges  and immunities of this Assembly.  This

Ordinance  was passed in 1955 before  our  present

Constitution came into operation, and does not, as

I  think  it should do, truly reflect the  plenary

authority  which  a legislature in  an  internally

self-governing  State,  such  as  ours,  ought  to

possess.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dignity and prestige of this Assembly

demands  that it should always be in the  position

to  assert itself positively and it should  never,

on  any occasion, find itself in an atmosphere  of

uncertainty  and  indecision in matters  affecting

its powers, privileges and immunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers, privileges and immunities are

matters  concerning the whole House, and I  would,

if  I may, suggest that consideration be given  to

the  setting  up  of  a  Sessional  Committee   of

Privileges  with  the primary  duty  of  enquiring

into,  considering  and making recommendations  on

all  matters relating to or affecting such powers,

privileges and immunities, including the  question

of   the   revision  of  the  present  Legislative

Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance, 1955.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister,  with reference to the "Public Enquiries

Services  Co-ordination Committee, why such  forms

are  printed only in Chinese and English, why  are

they  not  also printed in Malay, and  whether  he

will  arrange  to  have  these  forms  printed  in

Chinese, English and Malay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

preface my answers to the first three questions by

saying  that they are matters directly dealt  with

by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National   Development  who,   unfortunately,   is

indisposed  and  will not be  able  to  answer  in

person?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the first question is that

instructions have been given for the forms  to  be

printed  in Malay and Tamil, as well as in English

and  Chinese.  Because the special  needs  of  the

Malays are different and are under constant review

by  the  Rural Board, the District Office Islands,

the   Urban   and  Rural  Services  Council,   the

Secretary,    Malay    Settlements,    and     the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Ministry   of

National Development - these special forms were not

considered  applicable for  special  Malay  areas.

However,  to  avoid  the appearance  of  different

treatment, forms in Malay and Tamil will  also  be

made available in future in non-Malay areas and in

Malay areas.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I am not

satisfied  with the answer why the existing  forms

could  not  be  used in Malay areas;  whereas,  in

fact, in my area I am using such forms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The forms which were issued,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, were general application forms,

and  the  forms which were intended to  be  issued

foil special Malay areas were different. But since

<div align="center"><b>LOW-COST HOUSES AT JALAN KAKI BUKIT MALAY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SETTLEMENT</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Complaints of defects by owners)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister  whether any, and what, steps  have  been

taken to meet the complaints of the owners of  the

low-cost houses at the Jalan Kaki Bukit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>



Malay Settlement concerning the structural defects

of  their  houses which were sold to them  by  the

Government on instalment basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The hundred low-cost Malay

houses  at  the Jalan Kaki Bukit Malay  Settlement

were  constructed by the Housing  and  Development

Authority  on behalf of the Government. Under  the

terms of the contract, the contractor was required

to  make  good any defects within six months  from

the  date of completion of the houses. The  houses

were  completed and taken over for  occupation  on

14th  May,  1960. The six months' period therefore

expired on 14th November, 1960. Before the  expiry

of  six  months,  all defects  such  as  defective

painting,  broken concrete slabs, broken rendering

in  bathrooms, broken glass louvres, loose hinges,

and so on were remedied on complaint and the

house-owners  signed  work  forms  certifying  that  the

defects had been rectified. There were in fact, no

structural  defects complained  of,  and  all  the

other  defects  had  been  made  good  within  the

contractual  period of six months.  Responsibility

for the maintenance of houses after 14th November,

1960, rests with the individual house-owners.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, has the

department  concerned met the complaints  which  I

have   mentioned   in  this  Assembly   from   the

individual house-owners?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I think the matter does

not arise out of the question. All I can say, from

my  brief,  is  that in the building contract  any

complaint  can  be made within  a  period  of  six

months  and  must be rectified. The Housing  Board

held  up  payment to the contractor of  a  certain

specified sum agreed in the contract for a  period

of  six months to ensure that any defects were put

right. But once the house-owners had signed  after

six  months and they were satisfied that the house

was  in  order, their the money had to be paid  by

the  Housing  Authority to the  contractor.  After

that  the  contractor  is  absolved  from  further

responsibility.  May  I  add,   of   course,   the

obvious — that all the house-owners had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>



signed these forms saying that they were satisfied

that all defects had been put right.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, as far

as  I  know, one or two house-owners have not  yet

signed the forms. Is this true or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not think that can be

the  case, Mr Speaker, Sir, If there were one  or

two  who  had  not signed to say  that  they  were

satisfied, then the money in respect of those  one

or  two  houses  could not have  been  paid  over.

Legally, the Housing Authority must hold back  the

money and cannot pay the contractor.

<div align="center"><b>ALLOTMENT OF SITES AT MALAY SETILEMENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister  when  will the sites  at  the  following

Malay  Settlements be allotted to those applicants

who  are  on  the waiting list:— Jalan Kaki  Bukit

Malay  Settlement, Ayer Gemuroh Malay  Settlement,

and Sembawang Malay Settlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, there are three Malay

Settlements  that  have  to  be  dealt  with.  The

positions  in respect of the three are  not  quite

the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jalan Kaki Bukit Malay Settlement:</i> In the first

phase  of the development of this Settlement,  200

allocations  were  made. In  the  second  phase  a

further  61 plots were allocated, leaving  another

21  allocations yet to be made. Investigations  by

the  Management Committee have now been  completed

and  the  remaining  21 sites  will  be  allocated

within the next few weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ayer Gemuroh Malay Settlement:</i> In the first phase

80  allocations were made. Plans under the  second

phase for a further 200 plots have been drawn  up,

but  the  investigation  of  site  works  and   an

estimate of costs are still in train. One  of  the

remaining areas is prone to flooding and two  feet

of  infilling will be necessary, whilst in another

area  construction  of  a  sea-wall  as  well   as

infilling  will  be  necessary.  Any  forecast  on

allocations must first await these detailed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>



site  investigations. Only when the cost is  known

can application for the necessary funds be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sembawang Malay Settlement: The layout plans for

200  plots have been drawn up and approved and the

manual preparation of the site is being undertaken

by  the  Work Brigade. It is expected  that  earth

works  and ground preparation will take six months

to  complete.  It is estimated that  the  cost  of

other  works including drains, roads and materials

will be round about $23,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that in all Settlement areas,

applications exceed the number of sites available.

For  example, there have been 724 applications for

200 building plots planned for the Sembawang Malay

Settlement. Once this phase for 200 sites has been

completed, a fourth phase for a further 200  plots

will be undertaken.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Could the authority

concerned explain whether low-cost houses will  be

built  in  the  new  settlements  as  a  long-term

prospect,  and  also whether the  Government  will

build mosques for the inhabitants in those areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I do not wish to answer in

detail,  but  I would like to take the opportunity

to sketch very broadly the policy in regard to the

Malay settlements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two points of view. One is that more

and  more settlements should be created. The other

is  that the Housing and Development Board should,

when  building its houses, take into consideration

the  Malay sector of the population involved in  a

particular  area  and include and  integrate  them

into a building estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first school of thought has considerable

argument on its side in the case of special  rural

areas  where  the  Housing and  Development  Board

projects  are  not so intensive, and  considerable

work  can  be  done to improve housing  conditions

among  the  Malays  in the kampongs.  But  in  the

suburban areas where all housing development and a

considerable number of these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>

plans  have  been  drawn up  by  the  Housing  and

Development  Board, it is considered unhealthy  to

segregate  deliberately the community  by  marking

out  certain  buildings as only for occupation  by

Malays.  The balance of opinion is that where  the

community  is  already  a  mixed  one   and   when

resettlement takes place, it should take place  on

a "mixed" basis—mixed in the sense that no special

roads or particular buildings are set aside for  a

particular   race.  Therefore,  the  question   of

special mosques to accompany these houses in these

housing  and  development  plans  does  not  arise

- neither churches nor temples. In the case of  the

kampong  settlements, there is procedure  for  the

kampong  dwellers to make application for a  surau

to be set up by the appropriate District Office.

were  in respect of the Malay stream and 5,438  or

82 per cent were granted loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all who applied for the loan of text-books

<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr Speaker, Sir, Members will remember that

during the debate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



on  the Budget, Mr Ong Eng Guan, who was then the

Member  for  Hong  Lim, made  certain  allegations

against  the  Prime Minister and the Minister  for

Labour and Law. He was given every opportunity  to

substantiate his allegations and, in fact, on 29th

December  the  House waited for him to  appear  in

this Chamber to substantiate his allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Eng Guan, however, tendered his resignation and the House could not therefore hear

him.  I therefore at that time announced that  the

Government would institute a Commission of Inquiry

to investigate the truth or the falsehood of these

allegations.  At the same time, my motion  calling

for the condemnation of Mr Ong Eng Guan, the then

Member for Hong Lim, for his dishonourable conduct

in  abusing  the  privilege of  the  Assembly  was

postponed sine die until the Commission of Inquiry

had made its findings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know by now that the Commission of

Inquiry  under  Justice  Chua  has  sat  and   has

completed  its work. The Report of the  Commission

is  now  with the Government Printer and  will  be

distributed  to  Members as soon as  it  has  been

printed.  Members  would like to  know  that  this

morning  I have submitted a motion calling  for  a

debate on the Report of the Commission of Inquiry.

This debate is to be held on 1st March.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Questions may be asked on that

<div align="center"><b>COMMON GAMING HOUSES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill, Sir, is to provide

for  more effective control of public gaming, more

especially  in coffee shops and places  of  public

resort.  The  existing law relating to  gaming  in

public is contained in the Vagrancy Ordinance, and

has  been  found  to  be very  inadequate.  It  is

therefore proposed, Sir, following the legislation

in  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  to  improve  the

provisions  relating to gaming in  public  in  the

Common Gaming Houses Ordinance, and to give  wider

powers to the police to suppress gaming in public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many complaints of the noise and

nuisance  caused  by gaming in  coffee  shops  and

places of public resort, and it is known that such

places are frequented by secret society members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides, in clause 7, for the

punishment  of  gaming  in  public  and  for   the

punishment  of persons who instigate,  promote  or

intentionally  facilitate the  commission  of  the

offence of gaming in public. A person who  is  the

tenant,  lessee, occupier or person in  charge  of

any  public place which is used for gaming is also

made  liable to punishment, unless he proves  that

he has no knowledge that the premises are used for

gaming. In order to facilitate proofs of gaming in

public,  a  number  of presumptions  are  created.

Where  it  is shown that the person was playing  a

game  of  chance or any mixed game of  chance  and

skill in a public place, it will be presumed until

the contrary is proved that he was gaming, that he

was  playing for money or money's worth. When  any

article found in any public place is an instrument

or appliance for gaming, it will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



presumed until the contrary is proved that  gaming

took  place at such public place, that the  person

had  in his possession, custody or control of such

article for gaming at such public place, and  that

the public place was used for gaming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Sir, a number or prosecutions for

gaming  in  public  have failed because  it  often

happens  that when the police come on  the  scene,

the persons taking part disperse and run away, and

it  is  impossible  for the police  to  prove  the

particular game that was played and the part taken

by the persons in the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also being taken to re-enact,

with  amendments, the existing provisions  of  the

Common  Gaming  Houses  Ordinance.  The  principal

changes proposed are summarised in the Explanatory

Statement   to  the  Bill.  The  effect   of   the

amendments will be to enable more effective action

to  be  taken against common gaming houses, public

gaming and public lotteries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

Bill to be able to do what he intended to do.  Let

me  quote, Sir, from Hansard, Volume 12,  No.  11,

col. 723, line 12:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have looked very closely into the Common

Gaming  Houses  Ordinance, and we  find  that  the

provisions  there are sufficient for  us  to  deal

with the situation.'



<br><br>And again in col. 727, line 9, the Minister said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have all the powers that we want. No

additional powers are necessary. All that we  have

to do is to go for them and bring them down.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  fact that today he is asking  for  more

powers  shows  that the problem is more  difficult

than was anticipated. We know, Sir, that merely by

legalising sweepstakes and lotteries under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



Turf   Club,  gambling  could  not  be  adequately

controlled   and  reduced.  Since  the  Government

maintain that they too regard gambling as a social

evil—their purpose is not to increase the  revenue

but  to  control the evil—may I suggest  something

quite  constructive, Sir, and if  they  adopt  the

suggestion, it will be a proof of their sincerity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that to control gambling adequately as

a  social  evil, there must also be an educational

campaign. The Ministry of Culture and the Ministry

of  Education  have  in their  hands  the  weapons

— propaganda and education — to enable the people to

realise  that  gambling is an evil, and  that  the

poor  mugs  who buy those tickets will  simply  be

contributing out of their hard-earned earnings  to

the coffers of the promoters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the workers in Singapore are made to realise

this,  Sir,  then  it  will gradually  reduce  the

gambling  evil  in  Singapore.  We  will   be   in

wholehearted  support of their  attempt.  We  will

then  say  that the Government are really  sincere

and  that  their motive is really not to  increase

revenue. Sir, we are only too pleased to agree  to

the   granting   of  additional  powers   to   the

Government.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are glad

that the Government have now come to this Assembly

for additional powers to control gambling. But the

Government — and a P.A.P. Government at that  — have

been wont to say in this Assembly and outside that

they  always say what they mean and mean what they

say.  They said not so long ago, as quoted by  the

Member  for  Tanglin  (to  quote  the  words  from

Hansard, Vol. 12, No. 11, col. 723):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have looked very closely into the Common

Gaming  Houses  Ordinance, and we  find  that  the

provisions  there are sufficient for  us  to  deal

with the situation.'



<br><br>They  always say what they mean. But the  Minister

now  comes  to this House and says that what  they

meant to say was that what they said was not  what

they meant to say at that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they said they were keen to control

gambling.  We are with them in that. But  we  must

say this: that instead of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>



controlling gambling, they had, because  of  their

special  liking  for  the  Singapore  Turf   Club,

encouraged the opening of shops along the  streets

of  Singapore  with signboards saying,  "Singapore

Turf  Club Tickets Sold Here". And we said at that

time that if the Government were to introduce this

kind   of  public  lottery,  it  would  mean  more

gambling;   it   would  mean  encouraging   school

children  to walk into a shop to buy a ticket  for

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is in danger

of going back to the old debate on that particular

topic.  Can he indicate how his remarks arise  out

of this particular Bill? We are now discussing the

principle of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, what the

Government intends to do with this Bill is to  see

that  gambling is more controlled.  But  the  very

fact  that there are more retailers now of  public

lotteries means that gambling is not so controlled

as the Government want it to be. That is why I try

to  point  out that on the one hand they  say  one

thing,  but  on  the other hand, they  do  another

thing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is a

misunderstanding by the Members of the  Opposition

of  what this Bill sets out to do. The Member  for

Farrer  Park has not said anything today, probably

because he realises the legal position better than

his colleagues on the Front Bench!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide for more

effective control of common gaming houses,  public

lotteries, as well as public gaming. In the  past,

the  Common  Gaming  Houses Ordinance  dealt  with

common  gaming houses and public lotteries.  There

was  a  separate Ordinance known as  the  Vagrancy

Ordinance  which  dealt with  public  gaming.  The

purpose of this Bill is to repeal those provisions

of  the Vagrancy Ordinance which dealt with public

gaming,  and to bring those provisions within  the

scope  of  the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance.  In

the  Federation  of  Malaya, Mr  Speaker,  public

gaming, common gaming houses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



and  public lotteries are punished under a  single

Ordinance,   and   we  have,   in   making   these

amendments, adopted the same procedure here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Tanglin has just

now made a very novel suggestion to the House.  He

has  suggested  that,  in order  to  bring  public

gaming  and gambling generally under control,  the

Government  should  try to educate  gamblers.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I think the best way to  deal  with

gamblers  is to increase effectively the penalties

of  the law so as to make it not worth their while

to  continue those pursuits. Mr Speaker, Sir, the

penalties  for gaming in public have been  equated

with  the  penalties provided for  other  offences

under  the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance in  this

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Turf Club recently

published its Annual Report on the proceedings  of

the  past  year.  It  was clearly  shown  in  that

Report, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the amount of money

invested  on the totalisator operated by the  Club

increased from $13 million in 1959 to $23  million

in  1960. It was also stated in that Report  that,

as  a  result  of steps taken by the Club  in

co-operation  with the police, about 1,000  to  1,500

bookmakers  were put out of action.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir, that is indeed a creditable performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has

suggested  that  far from bringing gambling  under

control, we have allowed the Turf Club to  try  to

induce  members  of the public to gamble.  He  has

referred  to the notice boards that are placed  in

shops by the Turf Club, inviting the public to buy

lottery  tickets  there. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  as  a

matter  of  fact,  the Turf Club  have  been  very

disappointed in their expectations. In fact, there

has  not  been  an increase in the sale  of  their

lottery tickets. The people who are interested  in

that sort of gaming already had the facilities  of

buying  these  tickets. It  has  not  in  any  way

increased public gaming. So that all in  all,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, together with the action  that  has

been taken in the past, this Bill will be able  to

bring  gaming  under proper control,  particularly

gaming  in  public, for which the punishments  are

totally  inadequate  under  the  present  Vagrancy

Ordinance. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



hope I have fully answered the points of criticism

raised just now by the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Byrne].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not know whether any hon.

Member  wishes to speak on any particular  clause.

If there is, will the Member please indicate which

clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh (Joo Chiat):</b> Clause (2) (b).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will take clause 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2— Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand

part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in its zeal to make

Singapore  a Utopia, the Government, I hope,  will

realise that the people's wishes also have  to  be

considered.  A good many people may  not  want  to

live  in  a Utopia. The other point is this.  What

the  Government may consider to be a good  or  bad

thing  may  not  meet with the thinking  of  other

people.  After all, to grow pretty roses  we  also

need cow-dung.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Law

has  stressed the public aspect of gaming. I agree

with   him   that  gaming  in  public  should   be

suppressed. By all means do so. But the definition

"gaming"   in  clause  2  when  taken   with   the

definition  of "common gaming house" in  the  same

clause makes habitual gaming in private clubs open

to  prosecution. Mr Speaker, Sir, the  definition

of  "common  gaming  house" — the  second  part  of

it—reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`any place kept for habitual gaming, whether the

public or any class of the public has or may  have

access thereto or not,'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



That brings in private clubs where habitual gaming

takes place. I think I am right there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` "gaming", with its grammatical variations and

cognate expressions, means the playing of any game

of  chance or of mixed chance and skill for  money

or money's worth;'.



<br><br> If  you go to clause (2) (b), the Minister—I take

it he will be Minister for Labour and Law—may:—



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`declare any game, method, device, scheme or

competition specified ... to be a game  of  chance

or  a  mixed  game  of chance and  skill  ... and

thereupon  it shall be an irrebuttable presumption

of  law that such game, [etc.] is a game of chance

.... as the case may be, for the purposes of this

Ordinance.'



<br><br>There can be no defence then if, for instance,  in

a private club there is habitually going on a game

which  the Minister by notification in the Gazette

declares to be a game within the Ordinance.  There

is  no  defence at all. Now, there is a game which

goes on not only in every private club but also in

the  majority of Chinese private houses,  not  for

one  day  or for two days in a year, but  probably

for  300 or more days in a year, and that game  is

mahjong.  Mahjong to the Chinese is what the  game

of  bridge or whist is to the Europeans. There  is

no  question  whatsoever  that  mahjong  has  some

element of chance. I do not deny that. But it is a

national  game, and if the definition in clause  2

is  carried  to  its  logical  conclusion  by  the

Minister for Labour and Law, then everyone  of  us

may  land  in gaol. For that purpose, Mr Speaker,

may  I ask the Minister for Labour and Law to give

an assurance that, before he uses his powers given

in  clause  (2)  (b), he will  have  a  full-dress

debate  in this House? If he gives that assurance,

then  I  do  not think we need have any amendment.

Otherwise  I  would like to move an  amendment  to

paragraph (b).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Of course, the hon. Member is much

too  late  in  so  far as moving an  amendment  is

concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koh:</b> May we then have an assurance from the

Hon. the Minister for Labour and Law that in  the

word "game" there, he will not include the game of

mahjong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this Bill we have

not in any way altered the existing definition  of

a  common  gaming house, and it is the law  today.

Even before this Bill is enacted into law, if  any

place  is  kept for habitual gaming,  whether  the

public or any class of the public has or may  have

access thereto or not, it is a common gaming house

and is punishable as such. We have made no changes

in the law as far as that is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of this clause is

to  enable the Minister to make declarations  with

regard  to  lotteries being, say, public lotteries

and  certain games being games of chance or  games

of  mixed  chance and skill. That, as I have  said

before,  is  to enable the police to bring  public

gaming  effectively under control. It is  not  the

purpose  of this Bill to deny people the right  to

have  an  innocent  game  of  mahjong  with  their

friends  in  their  homes even  if  they  do  some

gambling on the side, Sir!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 25 inclusive ordered to stand part

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr K. M. Byrne be discharged from the

Select  Committee on the Administration of  Muslim

Law  Bill and that Inche M. Ismail Rahim be  added

to the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reason for this change is that Mr Byrne, who is a Catholic feels that he is

placed  in an invidious position to pass  judgment

on  a  Bill which relates only to Muslims and that

it  would be preferable if a Muslim Member of this

Assembly were to take his place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think, Sir, it would be a great pity

if the Minister for Law—



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Labour and Law.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> — Labour and Law — I beg your

pardon - deprives this Select Committee of his  very

expert advice on matters relating to law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill not only concerns itself with

Muslim manners and custom, but it also relates  to

Muslim  law.  Living  in a multi-racial  State,  I

think  it is important that any law which we pass,

even  though it relates to a particular  community

or  a particular section of a community, should be

such  that  it  should bear some relation  to  the

general  law of the land. On a matter  like  this,

even though Mr Byrne is a Catholic, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



am  sure  in my own mind that he will be  able  to

dissociate  himself  from  that  aspect   of   his

personal life and give his experience of  the  law

to  the  great  benefit of  the  Muslims  Bill.  I

understand the Select Committee has agreed to  it.

[<i>Interruption</i>]  I  am so sorry. I  understand  Mr

Byrne    wishes    to   be   relieved    of    his

responsibilities in this matter because  he  feels

that  some other person could do better. I  myself

doubt  very  much that could happen,  particularly

when  all the Members of the Select Committee  are

laymen,  and  I  think on a Bill of  this  nature,

although  you yourself, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  are  a

lawyer,  any assistance from another lawyer  would

be of great benefit to the Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that point has not

been  overlooked before this motion was tabled  by

the Leader of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, the State

Advocate-General  is always invited to be present  at  such

Select  Committee proceedings. He is a Muslim  and

is  very well versed in Muslim Law, and I am quite

sure  the  Select  Committee will  have  the  best

expert  advice  that any such Committee  can  ever

hope to have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr K. M. Byrne be discharged from the

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Health, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section  5  of  the Civil Defence Ordinance  (Cap.

73),  resolves  that the Civil Defence  (Singapore

Hospital  Reserve — Formation)  (Amendment)   Rules,

1961,  published as Notification No. S 37  in  the

Gazette Supplement No. 12 of 10th February,  1961,

as contained in Paper S.L. 4 of 1961, be approved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Hospital Reserve was constituted in

1952  by  the  Civil  Defence (Singapore  Hospital

Reserve — Formation) Rules, 1952, and was at  first

controlled  by the Assistant Director  of  Medical

Services  (Defence), a post which was subsequently

abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1954, the Reserve has been supervised by

the Civil Defence Commissioner. It is organised as

a  volunteer unit which aims at supplementing with

trained personnel a nursing and hospital staff  of

all  hospitals  in  Singapore in  times  of  civil

emergency or war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reserve has a strength of 672 volunteers,

made  up  of  263 men and 409 women. The  cost  to

Government  of  maintaining  such  a  Reserve   is

approximately  $57,000  annually.  Until  February

1960,  the  Reserve was part of the Civil  Defence

Corps,   when   Government   decided   that    the

supervisory  responsibility and financial  control

of  the  Reserve  should  be  transferred  to  the

Ministry  of Health. The Principal Matron  of  the

Medical Department was consequently charged as the

officer to control and administer the Reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rules which are the subject of this motion

are designed to amend Rules No. 2 and No. 4 of the

principal  Rules, so as to empower  the  Principal

Matron  of  the  Medical Department,  Ministry  of

Health,    to   discharge   the   responsibilities

connected with the Reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section  5  of  the Civil Defence Ordinance  (Cap.

1961,  published as Notification No. S 37  in  the

<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Health, namely,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (3) of

section 28 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Ordinance

(Chapter  148), resolves that the Food  and  Drugs

(Amendment)   Regulations,  1961,   published   as

Notification  No. S. 36 in the Gazette  Supplement

No. 12 of the 10th February, 1961, as contained in

Paper S.L. 3 of 1961, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations which are the subject of this

motion  are designed to broaden the scope  of  our

food  and drugs legislation. The Sale of Food  and

Drugs Ordinance provides for the sale of food  and

drugs  in  a  pure  state and for  such  necessary

controls    over    the    import,    manufacture,

distribution and sale of food and drugs,  so  that

the  public are protected and can obtain  articles

of a high quality and composition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal Regulations under this - Ordinance

were  published in 1957, and, the past  3½  years'

experience in applying them has shown the need  to

improve  and  to  add  to  the  1957  Regulations.

Moreover,  changes  in  food technology  occurring

during this time have brought forth new substances

and    techniques   which   were   not   permitted

previously,  but  which can now be  advantageously

permitted under prescribed conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regulations before you, Sir, refer

particularly  to three aspects of food  and  drugs

control.  Firstly, various provisions  now  permit

the  addition  of Vitamins A and  D  to  milk  and

prescribe  adequate standards for such enrichment.

Emulsifiers  are  now permitted  in  milks  as  a

result  of advances in food technology. Half-cream

and  vitaminised  skimmed milk are  now  permitted

free  sale under prescribed standards. Regulations

2, 3, and 4 have reference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, hitherto certain colouring matters were

prescribed as prohibited colouring matters, and in

this  context  all  other colouring  matters  were

permitted.  In  accordance with current  practice,

these  have  been revised and a list of  permitted

colouring  matters  has  been  drawn  up,  thereby

excluding all other colouring matters. The  object

of  this  amendment is to ensure  that  newer  and

possibly  dangerous  and toxic  colouring  matters

developed as a result of advances in the  chemical

field do not become freely used. Regulations 5 and

6 and Schedule A have reference.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the principal Regulations,

anti-oxidants  or  substances which  prevent  or  delay

rancidity  were not defined but were  left  to  be

approved individually by the Chief Chemist. It  is

considered  that generally accepted  anti-oxidants

should  be  specifically  defined  and  these  now

appear  in Schedule H of the amending Regulations,

where  the  type of anti-oxidant and the permitted

quantity are defined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these changes, the opportunity was taken

to  do away with the complex set of forms shown in

Schedule  C of the principal Regulations,  and  to

replace  them  by  a simpler and  more  convenient

single  form to be issued administratively by  the

Minister. In short, these Regulations will broaden

the  controls on milk, colouring matters and

anti-oxidants  in  the  light of current  practice  and

improve our Food and Drugs Control laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (3) of

section 28 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Ordinance

(Chapter  148), resolves that the Food  and  Drugs

(Amendment)   Regulations,  1961,   published   as

Notification  No.  S 36 in the Gazette  Supplement

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  I  signify  that   I   have   the

recommendation  of  His Excellency  the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara to proceed with this  motion.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly records its admiration for the

determination  and courage of the Algerian  people

in  their struggle for freedom against the tyranny

and  oppression  of  French  colonialism;  and  on

behalf  of  the people of Singapore expresses  its

whole-hearted support for the cause of freedom for

the  Algerian people, and resolves that as a token

of  sympathy  and  support a  sum  of  $10,000  be

contributed   by  the  Government  to   a   public

subscription  in support of the Algerian  people's

struggle for freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the House may remember the

enthusiastic  welcome extended by  the  people  of

Singapore  to Dr Ferhat Abbas, Prime Minister  of

the Provisional Government of Algeria, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



few weeks ago. The warmth of the welcome given  to

him  was  a measure of the admiration and sympathy

our  people had for the Algerians in their  bitter

struggle  against  a tenacious  and  unenlightened

French  colonialism. This sympathy for nationalist

struggles  everywhere comes naturally  to  peoples

who  for  decades have tasted the  humiliation  of

alien   rule   and   arrogant  despotism.   Though

Singapore  is not in a position to involve  itself

actively in foreign affairs, it nevertheless  took

the  opportunity to pay its respects to the leader

of the Algerian freedom fighters the moment he set

foot on Singapore soil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French, with characteristic obtuseness,

appear  to  have taken a dim view of  the  welcome

accorded  by Singapore to Dr Abbas. They  thought

it  necessary  to make a protest  to  the  British

Government over this. The British, for their part,

not  only transmitted this silly protest to us but

also  saw  fit,  presumably out  of  deference  to

French  sensitivity,  to deprecate  the  Singapore

Government for having accorded the honours  to  an

enemy of French imperialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Western reaction to the welcome accorded to

Dr Ferhat Abbas is typical of their insensitivity

to  the  winds  of  change in Africa  and  to  the

attitude  of  the Asian peoples to the  liberation

struggles  now erupting from one end of Africa  to

the other. What the Western powers have failed  to

grasp   is  that  Africa  has  joined  the  global

revolution  of rising expectations and  that  this

long   quiescent   continent   is   entering   the

mainstream of man's quest for human dignity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French, in particular, appear not to have

learnt the lessons of their ignominious defeat  in

what  used to be known as French Indo-China.  Like

King  Canute, they thought they could  order  back

the rising tide of nationalism in Indo-China. They

tried  to  erect a dyke of repression against  the

tidal wave of nationalist revolt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in the end, the dyke broke and

French colonialism was swept into the sea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in Algeria, the French imperialists are

repeating the errors they made in Indo-China.  The

only difference is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1021</b></font><br><br>



that in Algeria they are practising repression  on

a  scale  that  far exceeds in brutality  anything

carried   out  in  Indo-China.  If  the   Algerian

struggle   for   freedom  has  won   the   special

admiration  of peoples in Asia and Africa  it  has

been because of the Algerians' refusal to be cowed

and  broken by the terrorism unleashed  by  French

colons   and   by   disgruntled  French   generals

evacuated from the battlefields of Indo-china. The

systematic  and  widespread  torture  of  Algerian

nationalists  has been testified to  not  only  by

French liberals and intellectuals but also by  the

International Red Cross.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savagery of imperialist repression in Algeria

derives  from the determination of just  over  one

million European colons to remain permanently  the

overlords of some nine million Arabs. The six-year

old war in Algeria is essentially an attempt by  a

Fascist-minded  minority of European  settlers  to

ensure  the  permanent  subjugation  of  the  Arab

majority  whose  proper  role,  according  to  the

French  colons, is to serve as hewers of wood  and

drawers of water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the situation in Algeria is not

unlike that prevailing in Kenya, South Africa  and

other areas where European minorities have settled

among  a non-European population. In Algeria,  the

European  colons  steadfastly  refuse  to  abandon

their   position  of  a  privileged   aristocracy.

Therefore,  when confronted by the  assertions  of

Algerian  nationalism  and  Algerian  demands  for

freedom,  the  French  colons,  backed  by  French

generals,   are   trying   to   counter   Algerian

nationalism with repression and terror.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was French extremism which forced a moderate

and  conciliatory Algerian nationalism  to  resist

French  repression and violence with  violence  of

its own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ferhat Abbas, for example, is no extremist. He was initially an advocate of an Algerian

Republic  federally linked to France. This  modest

demand  was rejected by the French Government  out

of deference to the stiff-necked colons and French

generals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French answer to the Arab demand for

progressive  devolution of power to the  Algerians

was  force  and  repression. Today,  some  half  a

million  French  troops are  engaged  in  what  is

euphemistically   termed  the  "pacification"   of

Algeria. Until a few months ago, the French  tried

to dismiss the Algerian National Liberation Front,

led  by  Dr Abbas, as an insignificant  group  of

malcontents   who   in  no   way   reflected   the

aspirations  of  the nine million  Algerians.  The

European  settlers comforted themselves  with  the

belief  that the Arab masses enjoyed being  slaves

in their own country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this myth was exploded last December

when  General de Gaulle visited Algeria.  European

settlers tried to force Arabs to take part in  the

general strike to demonstrate support for a French

Algeria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arab masses, who had hitherto remained silent

and  sullen  under European terror, gave  vent  to

their   feelings  by  raising  the  cry  of  "Arab

Algeria".  Green  and white flags  of  the  F.L.N.

appeared  out of nowhere by the thousands  in  all

the major cities of Algeria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the myth that the F.L.N. represented only a

minority of Arabs was decisively exploded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt now that the Arab masses

have clearly identified themselves with the F.L.N.

and  with  Dr  Ferhat Abbas.  French  terror  and

repression  will  not halt the march  of  Algerian

independence. The war in Algeria has  entered  the

last  phase which must culminate in the demise  of

French  imperialism. It may be that the  desperate

French  colons  and generals will  be  tempted  to

launch  all-out repression and total  war  in  the

hope  of  prolonging their uneasy hold for  a  few

more  years.  But  as in Indo-China,  the  French

Canutes must retreat before the irresistible force

of nationalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World opinion and, in particular, Afro-Asian

opinion,   can   hasten  the  demise   of   French

colonialism  in Algeria by showing their  sympathy

for the Algerians and by pressing for a negotiated

settlement between the French



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



Government  and  the F.L.N. The French  Government

should  recognise the right of the Algerian people

for self-determination and abandon the futile hope

of  by-passing  the  F.L.N. and  negotiating  with

stooge  Arab  organisations — the  so-called  "third

force".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no "third force" capable of

bringing  the  six-year old war in Algeria  to  an

end. The only force worth negotiating with is  the

F.L.N. headed  by  Dr Abbas,  because  only  the

F.L.N. has  the support of the vast  majority  of

Algerians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Abbas was in Singapore, he gave this

parting message to the people of Singapore:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`From all of you we ask not arms but support and

pressure  on  France to end this war  against  our

people. We are confident of your help.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is in no position to offer massive help

to  the  courageous people of Algeria. But we  can

respond  to  the request of Dr Abbas and  sustain

the  spirit of the Algerian nationalists by  token

sympathy and support. I therefore propose  that  a

sum  of  $10,000 be contributed by the  Government

towards  an  "Aid to Algeria Fund". The Government

is  confident that members of the public will  add

to  this  fund  by  contributions  of  their  own.

Contributions  can be sent addressed  to  "Aid  to

Algeria  Fund", the Prime Minister's Office,  City

Hall.  I  am quite sure that the response will  be

generous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, the Opposition is

filled  with admiration for the determination  and

courage  of the Algerian people in their  struggle

for freedom and prays that their struggle will  be

crowned with success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition listened with rapt attention

to  the speech of the hon, mover of the motion — the

Minister for Culture — and the Opposition would have

been filled with great admiration,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1024</b></font><br><br>



as  would  have  been the people of Singapore,  if

that  speech had been about the P.A.P.'s  struggle

against  British colonialism for the  independence

of  Singapore. But alas, Sir, there was not a word

about  it.  It  was  just a speech  extolling  the

Algerians  for their determination and courage  in

their  struggle  for freedom. It would  have  more

substance and more meaning if it were to come from

a people who are equally determined and courageous

to  fight  for  independence  for  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Sir, who have been ridiculed by the P.A.P. to

be Right-wing are the very people who have brought

self-government for the people of  Singapore;  and

even  previous  colonial administrations  have  in

their  colonial  way brought about  constitutional

advance  for Singapore. But the P.A.P.,  Sir,  who

claim   to   be  anti-colonialists  and  Left-wing

Socialists, are not going to bestir themselves  to

struggle  for  the freedom of Singapore  from  the

British  colonial yoke. No, Sir,  they  are  quite

content  with what we have got for the  people  of

Singapore.  They maintain and maintain  repeatedly

that  the next step towards constitutional advance

is through merger with the Federation—



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Cairnhill is really going very, very far away from

the  motion.  We are now dealing with Algeria.  He

wants to convert this debate into a debate on  the

independence of Singapore. I cannot see  how  that

is relevant.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, what I am

trying  to  point  out  is  that  this  speech  of

admiration would have had greater substance if  it

had  come  from a government imbued with the  same

determination and courage.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member had

stopped at that, that is quite in order. That is a

remark  in  passing which is quite in order  in  a

debate  of  this  nature. But when  he  goes  into

details  and embarks on a speech about  merger,  I

think,  unless he can satisfy me to the  contrary,

he  is  very, very far away from the motion before

us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> May I beg leave to explain,

Sir?  The  Algerians  are  fighting  for  complete

independence from French colonial domination. This

Government  is not going to do it. They  say  that

the   only  way  to  gain  freedom  from  colonial

exploitation, or whatever you like to call it,  is

through a merger with the Federation - that is their

line.   And   yet   they  say,  "We   admire   the

determination and courage of the Algerian people."

May I, therefore, continue, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid not. The hon. Member

must  now confine himself to Algeria, and  Algeria

alone, and the suggestion that there should  be  a

gift of $10,000.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I bow to your ruling, Sir. Then

we  come to the second part of the motion. Sir,  I

have an amendment to propose to the second part of

this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order, except

the format which has been altered.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 7, to leave out the words from

"subscription" to the end, and to insert "for  the

relief of Algerian refugees."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, this money that is to be

contributed  by  the Government towards  a  public

subscription is meant for the relief  of  Algerian

refugees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a period of financial stringency when the

emoluments   of   civil  servants   have   to   be

arbitrarily cut by the Government, in a period  of

economic setback brought about by the presence  of

the  P.A.P. Government, and in a period where  new

and  increased taxations have to be introduced  by

the  Government in the last Budget debate,  it  is

felt  that the Government should conserve all  its

financial resources for the welfare of the  people

of  Singapore.  But on humanitarian  grounds,  the

Opposition feel that, as a token of our admiration

and, of our support, the Government can expend the

sum   of   $10,000  for  the  relief  of  Algerian

refugees. The object of my amendment, Sir,  is  to

make  it clear that this money that the Government

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



donating  towards a public subscription  is  meant

for  this purpose. It is right and proper that  we

should  come  to  the assistance of  the  Algerian

fighters in that we should give them some monetary

support to ameliorate the hardship that they  have

suffered  as  a  result  of  their  struggle   for

freedom.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly records its admiration for

the  determination  and courage  of  the  Algerian

people  in their struggle for freedom against  the

tyranny and oppression of French colonialism;  and

on behalf of the people of Singapore expresses its

wholehearted support for the cause of freedom  for

the  Algerian people, and resolves that as a token

of  sympathy  and  support a  sum  of  $10,000  be

contributed   by  the  Government  to   a   public

subscription  in support of the Algerian  people's

struggle for freedom.'



<br><br>Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from "subscription" in the second

last line to the end,



<br><br>that is, the words "in support of the Algerian

people's struggle for freedom",



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there to insert "for the relief of Algerian

refugees".



<br><br>That is to say, the last part then reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and resolves that as a token of sympathy and

support a sum of $10,000 be contributed by the

Government to a public subscription for the relief

of Algerian refugees.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question now is, "That the words proposed to

be  left out, be left out", and the debate at  the

moment  must  be  confined,  of  course,  to   the

amendment.



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let

us  not permit the Member for Cairnhill to draw  a

red  herring before us. I will deal with  what  he

has   said  about  the  P.A.P. struggle   against

colonialism. Let me —



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member will have an

opportunity  later on to deal with  that.  At  the

moment,  we  should,  I  think,  dispose  of   the

amendment. In other words, the suggestion is  that

this  public subscription should be for the relief

of  Algerian refugees, rather than in  support  of

the Algerian people's struggle for freedom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, let us be clear

about  the situation that is existing in  Algeria.

On   the  one  hand,  you  have  people  who   are

indigenous in Algeria fighting French settlers  on

the  other.  The  majority of  the  population  in

Algeria  are  Moslems. To all outward appearances,

it would appear that this is a war between Moslems

and non-Moslems, between Moslems and Christians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Dr Abbas, in a Press interview at the

Airport,  quite  categorically  stated  - that  the

F.L.N.  (Force Liberation Nationale) is not waging

a  holy  war. It is not a war between the  Moslems

and the Christians. The F.L.N. is not waging a war

between  race  and  race, between  Algerians  and

French,  between brown and coloured people against

white.  It  is  essentially  a  war  against   the

domination  of  a European power over  an  African

State.  In  this, we whole-heartedly  support  the

cause of the F.L.N.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the F.L.N. was formed, there was no

organisation   in   Algeria   to   fight    French

colonialism. The Moslems in Algeria, including the

refugees,    are   whole-heartedly   behind    the

leadership  of  Ferhat Abbas,  who  is  the  Prime

Minister of the pro-tem Algerian Government.  The

motion  that  we  are moving, that the  Government

should contribute $10,000 towards the cause of the

Algerian  people, should rightly  be  given  to  a

representative body, a body that has obtained  the

recognition  of  those  who are  fighting  against

French    colonialism.   That   money,   including

contributions from the public, should be delivered

to  the Provisional Government of Algeria. And  if

this  pro-tem Algerian Government  so  wishes  to

donate  this sum to the relief of their  refugees,

then  we cannot stop them. But we would say  this:

that the Provisional Government under Ferhat Abbas

is  the  representative body of  the  Moslems  in

Algeria, and it is quite correct, therefore,  that

any  assistance towards their fight against French

colonialism  should  be given to  this  particular

body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I therefore oppose the amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I just add to the

explanation,  Mr  Speaker, Sir?  If  we  were  in

diplomatic    relationship   with    the    French

Government, then perhaps it may be necessary,  for

diplomatic  and  other  considerations,  and   the

niceties  of  international intercourse,  to  give

this  sum  of money in such a way as not to  upset

the diplomatic relations between us and France.  I

think  Members  of the House have heard  what  the

Minister  for  Culture had to say  about  what  we

think  of  the  French protests  and  the  British

deprecation  of our reception to Dr Abbas.  These

considerations do not bear on our action  at  all.

We  give  this  money in support of  the  Algerian

people's  struggle for freedom. In the process  of

that  struggle, there have been many displacements

of  persons.  If it is the view of the Provisional

Government  to use the money for the refugees,  so

be  it.  But  why  do we want to  specify  to  the

Provisional Government of Algeria that  they  must

use  it  for  the refugees? Dr Abbas has  already

said that he wants our moral support. He does  not

want  arms  from us. So we can be sure  that  this

$10,000 will not be for the purchase of French

sub-machine guns. It must be used in a manner which we

think  they are fit to decide. Therefore, I -think

the  amendment is really of no significance. There

is  no  reason why we should dilute our frank  and

wholehearted  admiration for  their  struggle  for

freedom.  If  the Member for Cairnhill  wishes  to

move  another motion at some other date expressing

his  sympathy  and his feelings of depression  and

melancholia  at the thought of refugees  suffering

as  a  result of their being displaced from  their

homes, we will be quite ready to support him then.

But I say that this $10,000 is not a very big sum.

Let  us not quibble about what it should be given

for. Let the Provisional Government of Algeria use

it  for refugees or for any other cause they  deem

fit.  As  I  have  said,  considerations  of   our

diplomatic ties with France do not apply,  because

none exists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In view of the sober

explanation of the Prime Minister and  the  Deputy

Prime  Minister,  and  in  order  to  make  it   a

unanimous decision, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question, as appearing

in item 6, is now before the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, may I be

permitted  now  to revert to what the  Member  for

Cairnhill has uttered just now, in a sneering  way

perhaps,   of   the   P.A.P.'s  struggle   against

colonialism?  Let  us review the  history  of  the

P.A.P.'s  leadership among the masses in attaining

the new constitution under which we operate today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, there were the general elections under

the  Rendel  Constitution, the P.A.P. having  been

formed in December of the previous year, 1954. But

at that time, we fully understood the implications

of the Rendel Constitution, that it did not convey

in  any  sense a self-administering government  or

give  complete internal control of the affairs  of

the State. For that reason, the P.A.P. resolved to

be  in  the  Opposition during the period  of  the

Rendel  Constitution, so that we could reveal  the

weaknesses,  the  defects, and the  sham  of  that

Constitution four years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period of the Rendel Constitution in

1956, the first Merdeka talks were held. Mr David

Marshall,  then Chief Minister, led  an  all-Party

delegation to London. Our representatives at those

talks were the Secretary-General of the Party, Mr

Lee  Kuan Yew, Mr Lim Ching Siong and Inche Ahmad

bin   Ibrahim.  Let  me  remind  the  Member   for

Cairnhill   that  nothing  came   out   of   those

constitutional talks under the leadership of David

Marshall.  In 1957, following the resignation  and

collapse of David Marshall, Mr Lim Yew Hock,  now

Member  for Cairnhill, became Chief Minister,  and

he  in turn led a second round of talks in London.

However,  let  us be quite honest  about  how  the

trend of those talks was carried out; who provided

the  mass base, the mass support, so that the 1957

talks  could  be successful, and  so  that  a  new

Constitution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



could  be  drafted out which would  give  complete

internal self-government to Singapore. It  is  not

the  achievements of those — meaning the Member  for

Cairnhill  and  his  colleagues — who  were  in  the

Government at that time. It was an achievement  of

the  people of Singapore, of the masses,  who  had

confidence in the P.A.P. That confidence had  been

very   ably  demonstrated  in  the  City   Council

election and in the general elections in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. cannot claim that by itself it

will   lead  Singapore  to  complete  independence

unless it is also supported by the masses. I  have

never  claimed  at any time that the  Constitution

under  which we operate now confers upon the State

complete  independence. In fact, we have explained

very  carefully  and clearly  to  the  people  the

limitations  under  which  we  work  even   today.

However,  the  Constitution has promised  that  in

1963,  there will be a review of the Constitution,

and  we are determined to see that that clause  is

honoured.  Because we have been a colony,  because

today  we  are a semi-colony, there  is  a  mutual

feeling   of   sympathy  between  the  Provisional

Government  of  the Algerian leaders,  Dr  Ferhat

Abbas and Mr Sori and ourselves. It is because  of

this understanding of peoples who have in the past

been under colonial domination that we, the P.A.P.

Government, have moved this motion in  support  of

the  Algerian  people's struggle for  independence

against French imperialism.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am a bit confused, and I am sure the Deputy

Prime  Minister  must be also. He  said  that  the

P.A.P. provided the mass support—



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am not permitting any

debate  on  that  aspect of  the whole  matter.  I

allowed  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  to  make  a

statement  for the simple reason that  the  Member

for  Cairnhill had made a statement which requires

an  answer. I think the Deputy Prime Minister  has

been very restrained in his statement. From now on

there   shall   be   no  debate   on   Singapore's

independence  or  merger with  the  Federation  or

anything of that nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I shall fall in

with  your ruling. Anyway, I just wanted to  point

out that I did not mean to debate it. I was asking

for  clarification on something  that  the  Deputy

Prime Minister had said.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is too late.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, "freedom"

and  "liberty"  are words which have  aroused  the

feelings of people in many countries all over  the

world and throughout the ages. Sir, I am sure  all

of  us  want to be free ourselves, and in  wanting

freedom  for  ourselves naturally we want  freedom

for  others also. Therefore, who is there who  can

oppose  or dare to oppose the granting of  freedom

to  other people? We have seen that France herself

in  the  course of her history has had a wonderful

chapter  on her own fight for freedom.  The  words

"liberty,  equality and fraternity" were  born  in

France.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Rome!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Unfortunately, Sir,—



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> He is quite right — Rome.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Unfortunately, Sir, when

people  have got their freedom, they often  forget

to  grant the same freedom to others. May I remind

that,  Sir,  to the governing Party?  Tragedy  has

overtaken  Algeria to the extent that  the  French

have   forgotten  the  lesson  they  have   learnt

themselves  so that there is now this  tragedy  in

Algeria. We do hope, Sir, that France will do what

Britain  did  for  the Federation.  Grant  freedom

amicably and help Algeria to have freedom  without

chaos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in supporting this motion on the fight of

the  Algerians for freedom, we want to assert that

we  must never forget that when we ask for freedom

for ourselves we must see that freedom is given to

others, and that in Singapore there should be more

freedom of speech and more freedom for the Press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, perhaps more Members of

the  Opposition  would like to wax eloquent  where

the Member for Cairnhill has stopped short. I just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



want to make two points. First, this $10,000 is  a

gesture - we  do not really expect it  to  help  the

Algerians   win  the  war,  not  even  if   public

subscriptions  bring  it to $100,000.  But  it  is

significant  that in a world in  which  total  war

means  total annihilation, the conflict is reduced

to  a  secondary  plane  of  a  limited  war  with

unlimited world support. There is pressure in  the

United  Nations. There are expressions of sympathy

and  solidarity  and  we throw  in  our  voice  in

support of the chorus on behalf of the freedom  of

the  people  of  Algeria.  This,  of  course,  not

unnaturally has made the Member for Cairnhill talk

about  independence for Singapore.  Sir,  I  think

there  should be a proper time and place in  which

we  should debate these matters. I have seen  many

gyrations  and  contortions performed  by  many  a

politician in Singapore — some of them on the  Floor

of   this   Assembly — but  the  gyration  and   the

contortion  and  the volte-face  that  I  saw  was

something, Mr Speaker, Sir, which will take us  a

few   hours  of  debate.  It  is  typical  of  his

hypocrisy and—



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. First, I did indicate that

there  should  be no more debate on  the  comments

made  by  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  anent   the

independence of Singapore. Secondly, I have always

over-ruled   the   word   "hypocrisy"   as   being

unparliamentary in this Assembly. I ask the  Prime

Minister to refrain from continuing the debate  on

that  aspect  of  the speech  of  the  Member  for

Cairnhill and to withdraw the word "hypocrisy".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have not the

slightest intention of pursuing a debate which you

have ruled should not take place. I was suggesting

that  at some other sitting in this Assembly,  the

subject which the Member for Cairnhill so blithely

touched  upon in passing should be dealt  with  at

length  in order that a proper exposition  of  the

stands  and  the  changes in  the  stands  of  the

S.P.A.,  ex-Lib-Socs, ex-Labour  Front,  ex-Labour

Party  can  be properly ex-pounded and exposed.  I

have no intention, Sir, of pursuing the debate—



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Well, stop it then.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> However, as to your second

ruling.   Sir,   about   withdrawing   the    word

"hypocrisy"  perhaps it may be less  offensive  to

you  if  I  were  to say in its place  a  complete

absence of sincerity?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must insist on an

unqualified withdrawal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The withdrawal of the word

"hypocrisy", Sir, is unqualified since you have so

ordered  me. I would say that it is fair,  polite,

and  civil to say that the speaker at the time  he

made the proposition was devoid of sincerity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the motion proper, may I add this, that

it  is  my  hope  that  not just  individuals  but

institutions,  associations, and  societies  could

use  this  opportunity to make a  gesture  in  the

forum of world debate as to what they think of the

French and the stupidities and brutalities of the

colons   and  the  French  Army  in  Algeria,   by

contributing to this fund.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, in reply.



<br><br>4.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when a mouse

begins  to roar like a lion, then I think we  have

seen  all that needs to be seen. So when  I  heard

Members  of  the Opposition making  violent

anti-colonial speeches, I felt that I had seen all that

I needed to see. But perhaps—



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is what Ong Eng Guan feels about

you!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Since the Member for Farrer Park

seems to be involving himself in matters which  do

not  concern him, I hope he will join in the  Hong

Lim by-election when the time comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this motion, Sir, is quite simply

and straightforwardly to show our sympathy not for

any  individual or for the refugees as  such,  but

for  the anti-colonial movement in Algeria. To that

extent,  we are requesting a token sum of  $10,000

as  a  contribution towards the Aid Algeria  Fund.

Anyway, I hope, Sir, the S.P.A. will also join  in

contributing  to  this fund  together  with  other

members  of  the  public and  other  anti-colonial

fighters  and  so help to make the fund  something

worth remembering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly records its admiration for the

determination  and courage of the Algerian  people

in  their struggle for freedom against the tyranny

and  oppression  of  French  colonialism;  and  on

behalf  of  the people of Singapore expresses  its

whole-hearted support for the cause of freedom for

the  Algerian people, and resolves that as a token

of  sympathy  and  support a  sum  of  $10,000  be

contributed   by  the  Government  to   a   public

subscription  in support of the Algerian  people's

struggle for freedom.

<br><br>4.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move the motion* standing in my name.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ABHORRENCE at the cold-blooded murder of MrLumumba and his colleagues; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALLS upon the United Nations Organisation to assist in the investigation

of the murder, the apprehension of the criminals and their principals to bring

them to justice;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that this Assembly also

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONDEMNS the presence of Belgian troops and agents in the Congo and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUPPORT the proposal that all Belgian and foreign troops not under

United Nations command should be forthwith expelled from the Congo and

that the United Nations Organisation ensures law and order in the Congo

so that the Congolese Parliament could be re-summoned for the formation

of a Government to represent the Congolese people, to prevent foreign

intervention which must inevitably lead to the tragedy of a civil war.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Wednesday last when the news broke upon the

world that Mr Lumumba was said to have escaped



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



and  ten  nations immediately signed a declaration

that  they  believed  that he had  been  murdered,

billions  of  angry  words, indignant words,  have

been  uttered and millions of words have gone over

the  ether to carry the righteous indignation  and

anger   of  people  with  any  sense  of   decency

throughout  the whole world. It illustrates  in  a

small way the fact that we live in one world; that

there   is   only  one  piece  and  that   it   is

indivisible; and that what happens in  the  Congo

affects everyone of us sooner or later. In a world

shrunken  in size as a result of man's  scientific

and  technical advances, new problems  emerge.  In

the case of the Algerian conflict, since total war

means total annihilation, new forms of combat  for

partial or complete victory in limited fields have

to   be  evolved.  It  is  the  intention  of  the

Government, in bringing this matter up for debate,

to  state categorically, first, on behalf, I  hope,

unanimously of the people of Singapore, whether we

represent the Government Benches or the Opposition

in  order that so much more little weight could be

put  in the balance in favour of what is right and

just, and also to set the tone of the talking that

has  been  going  on  and  will  be  going  on  in

Singapore  and  around  us;  and  what   is   more

important, to set the pace of the thinking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know if it is necessary for me to

preface  my remarks by pointing out that emulation

is  one of the most important motivations of human

behaviour.  Every  day  over  the  last  one  week

particularly, more in the case of the  non-English

language  newspapers, there have been pictures  of

people  breaking up Belgian embassies in Belgrade,

Warsaw, and other places in the world. In some  of

them, riots; civil commotion even taking place  in

America  itself.  Therefore, quite understandably,

the  people of Singapore and the workers who  read

of  these  matters day by day feel that they  also

should register their protest. Sir, I think it  is

a  natural and an admirable point of view. But for

the  fact that we are a government entrusted  with

law and order and that the Minister for Finance

is  extremely  keen to get capital to come  in  and

start factories, I think we would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



not  have  the  slightest hesitation  in  allowing

massive   demonstrations  outside   the   Consular

offices  of  the Belgian Government in order  that

the  right kind of show of what we think  of  them

can  be  put on. However, because of our  somewhat

limited and conscribed situation, and in case  the

demonstration against the Belgians turned, rightly

or  wrongly,  into a demonstration  against  other

Western governments connected or unconnected  with

the  death  of  Mr  Lumumba, I  have,  as  Acting

Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  advised   many   an

association  to  restrain  theselves  from   their

righteous  desire to show the Belgians  what  they

think  of  them  and  to do as  little  damage  as

possible; and that if we must protest, then let us

do  it in a civil and unharmful way in order  that

those  who  are thinking of putting up  new  glass

windows and putting new things in them need not be

unnecessarily frightened away. The effect  of  the

world   radio,   the   world  Press,   the   radio

photographs  that  carry the message  of  what  is

happening  in  other parts of the world  will  not

unnaturally stimulate our own people into  wishing

to be like what all independent, righteous, decent

people all over the world think and do. However, I

hope that with this explanation, I will have given

them  some  grounds for consolation why we  should

not  break  a  few glass windows. I  am  told  the

Belgian Consulate is on one of the upper floors of

the  Asia Building, and I asked them to desist  in

case  a  few  other windows besides those  in  the

Belgian  Consulate got broken and people got  hurt

unwittingly in a demonstration not meant for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are really very few new things that

can  be  said on the subject of the death  of  Mr

Lumumba.  Everything that need be  said  has  been

said  so  well  and eloquently by  so  many  other

eminent  people with more powerful pens  and  more

eloquent voices than our own. All I wish to do  is

to  draw attention, from our point of view,  to  a

few salient facts. There are really two issues: 1.

Lumumba the man when he was alive. 2. Lumumba  the

myth that has been created



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



by  his  murder. As for Lumumba the man, we  never

said  anything.  We  stood  for  the  freedom  and

independence  of the Congo, and if  the  Congolese

people  chose Mr Lumumba as their Prime Minister,

then it is their right to do so and he should have

been given the opportunity to carry out his duties

as  Prime  Minister. It is said in  some  quarters

that  he had a somewhat different past and  so  on

and  so  forth. But whatever he was, the stupidest

thing  that could have been done was to  kill  him

and create the myth; and the myth inevitably grows

bigger and bigger and stronger day by day.  It  is

the biggest united front issue on world basis that

has  been  created  since the Spanish  Civil  War.

Whether you are a Right-wing, or a Liberal,  or  a

Fabian,  or  a  Social Democrat, or  a  Democratic

Socialist,  or  a  Communist, willy-nilly  if  you

believe in decent behaviour, certain standards  of

honesty  and  certain  standards  of  what  people

should  or should not do, then you must be against

what  has happened. As Mr Nehru said, "Some  very

evil  things must have been done with  the  active

concurrence  or  connivance  of  people  in   high

authority." A group of men endowed and vested with

authority  and recognised by other governments  in

the world did not have the courage to say that Mr

Lumumba  had been executed without even  a  secret

trial. It has been said that people in some  parts

of  the world got executed without a proper trial,

but  at  least they were given a trial even though

it  was  in  secret. When Mr Beria was  executed,

nobody  heard  about the trial, but  there  was  a

trial and there was a proper execution. So was the

case with Imre Nagy and other people. But here are

a  group  of  men who did this man in, and  then,

knowing  full  well  that  what  they  did  was  a

disreputable  and outrageous act against  humanity

and  decent  human  behaviour, said  that  he  had

escaped.  And ten nations who had good reasons  to

know  what  was  happening because  they  all  had

representatives there immediately said, "You  have

done him in." And true enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



they said, "Yes, he has been dismembered by Baluba

tribesmen in some unknown village and his  remains

have been scattered in some unknown place in order

that  he should not be deified." And so we are  in

the  curious  position  of  finding  ourselves  in

complete  and  absolute unanimity with  a  lot  of

people  with  whom  we are often in  disagreement.

Your  Right-wing  people with the  right  sort  of

conscience — I am quite sure Sunday school  teachers

who  are Members of this Assembly would revolt  at

the thought of doing in an opponent in that way. I

grant them at least that much sense of decency and

moral  rearmament courage. On the other  hand,  of

course,  you  have your dreamy-eyed idealists  and

Liberals.  They also, in the name of  freedom,  of

what is right and wrong, must denounce it. And  in

the extreme, you have your hard-boiled ideological

Communists all shouting the same slogan:  "Lumumba

the  myth,  Lumumba the statesman." Nobody  called

him a statesman when he was alive; but I think  if

for  nothing  else  when  he  died  he  became   a

statesman, and so it must be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to point out the line and the

stand that we have decided to take in this motion.

If  anybody  differs from this line and  wants  to

take  another  line,  let him  do  so.  There  are

several  lines.  One  is the  line  taken  by  the

Russians:  from the death of Lumumba to down  with

Hammarskjoeld; withdraw the United Nations  troops

from   the  Congo;  recognition  of  Gizenga  (the

successor to Lumumba), and a host of other things,

which  would  mean another Spanish  Civil  War  or

another Korea. It is bound to happen. Then on  the

other   extreme   end,  there  is  the   American,

Ambassador  in  the  United  Nations,  Mr   Adlai

Stevenson, who so eloquently put it, "We  denounce

all  that has happened is wrong. Never mind  about

the  past,  but let us concentrate on the  future.

And  therefore let us think of some  coherent  and

practical way of resolving it." That is the  whole

problem.  People cannot forget the past. They  get

angry  and they get extremely cussed because  some

very  serious wrongs have just been done. And then

there is the line which we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



taking — the line which has been charted  by  people

who sincerely believe it to be wise and who are in

possession  of  the  facts - to demand  the  minimum

conditions within which to contain the conflict in

the   Congo,  to  prevent  it  from  becoming   an

international arena (either a hot or a cold  one),

to  create the minimum conditions under which some

form   of   representative   government   can   be

established, and the will of the Congolese  people

expressed   by   their  elected   representatives.

Different   problems  with  different  notes   and

different  timbre are being sounded in  memory  of

the  same  man. They carry different  meanings  to

different people. But for us — the uncommitted - the

sound that we respond to the clarion call that  we

would like to join in, is one which says, "Let  us

contain  the  conflict of the  civil  war  in  the

Congo.  Let us prevent more trouble being  created

by  new  troops  being sent in and recognition  of

opposing  governments inside the Congo,  and  give

the  Congolese people a chance to get started with

their independence in circumstances which would at

least give them a chance of success." That is  the

purport of this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We add our voice to the rousing chorus of

indignation and, if for nothing else, we would  at

least  have added one more protest for  those  who

are  on  Mount Olympia to hear, since they  decide

our  fates. I hope that we in Singapore will  give

the  lead to the thinking that should be  done  by

people  in a position to influence public opinion.

One  could get hysterical over this. One could get

very angry. But what I am asking this House to  do

is  soberly, albeit we are angry, to see what this

means to us, what it is doing to our people,  what

ploy  and  play is being done at this moment,  and

how  we,  as  the elected representatives  of  the

people, should lead them in expressing their views

of  what  is  right  and wrong  in  matters  which

concern us, although these matters take place some

thousands of miles away in some country unknown to

us,  but  so vitally important to the survival  of

all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the motion of the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peoples of the world are shocked at the news

of  the  cowardly  murder of Mr  Lumumba.  We  in

Singapore join in this world-wide demonstration of

sympathy,  solidarity  and,  friendship  with  the

Congolese  people.  The whole world  condemns  the

atrocious  acts  of  the  imperialists  and  their

lackeys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, who are the murderers of Mr Lumumba? The Kasavubus, the Mobutus or the

Tshombes  are only the front Quislings  of  powers

behind  the scenes. It is the Belgian colonialists

assisted   by   the  N.A.T.O. powers   with   the

connivance of the United Nations. I cannot believe

for  on  moment that the United Nations could  not

protect  the  life of Lumumba when it can  protect

the lives of ordinary white men in the Congo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must take positive action against

the ostensible murderers of Lumumba. At least this

Government must initiate action to boycott Belgian

goods. The murders in Sharpeville and in the Congo

are   as   a   result  of  the  African   people's

determination to fight for freedom.  All  colonial

powers, be they French, Belgian, Dutch or British,

join one common flag for mutual aid. They can only

hope  to last a bit longer by binding together  in

the  face  of  a  common foe. To the anti-colonial

people, the fight is like that of a trade union of

workers  against an association of employers.  All

colonial powers die or fall together. Sir,  it  is

therefore necessary for us in Singapore  to  fight

against  British colonialism with renewed  vigour.

The  murder of Lumumba is an object lesson for all

colonial people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, we must

therefore  not forget our own fight  and  our  own

political  prisoners. Our fight, is  part  of  the

world-wide fight against colonial forces. I  would

therefore  ask  the Government to convene  a  mass

meeting  in front of the City Hall and invite  all

political  parties, unions and mass  organisations

to participate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



At  this  meeting,  we should demand  the  British

colonialists  to free our political prisoners.  We

should also—



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whethere the hon.

Member can indicate how that trend is relevant  to

the motion moved by the Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, in those days, these political

prisoners  were  fighting  against  the   colonial

masters in the same way.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest then that the

hon.  Member  send in a notice of  motion  dealing

with that particular subject if he so desires.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I ask the Government to

challenge the right of the French colonialists  to

suppress   the  Algerian  people's  struggle   for

freedom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What has that got to do with

this one?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Wrong page!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has gone backwards!



<br><br>5.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today

we  are  registering a protest against the  brutal

murder  of  an  elected leader  of  the  Congolese

people. In debating this motion before the  House,

we  are,  in  fact, joining with  the  peoples  of

Africa and Asia in denouncing colonialism. We  are

joining the world-wide cry of denunciation of  the

atrocities  committed by the hirelings of  Western

imperialist powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the essence of the motion before the House

is  anti-colonial. The struggle for freedom  is  a

consistent  struggle. There can be no  compromises

in  any  way. It would only end if there  is  full

political, social and economic freedom.  While  we

condemn  and denounce the colonialists  and  their

stooges,  we  must not make it merely  a  negative

cry.  The unanimous call of the Afro-Asian peoples

is  not negativism. It is a positive call for  the

restoration of the fundamental human right  to  be

free  from subjugation and exploitation. In  fact,

it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>



is  a  demand for the restoration of the right  to

decide one's own future and destiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore, Sir, are far from being free,

even politically. Colonialism in Singapore has not

ended.  Our  struggle today, as it was before,  is

still  largely anti-colonialism. In this phase  we

endorse  the  aspirations for  which  Mr  Lumumba

stood.   And   when   we  denounce   and   condemn

imperialism,  we  must be able to  draw  objective

lessons  for  the furtherance of our own  struggle

against imperialism. The greatest justice that  we

can  do  to  Lumumba  is to  intensify  our

anti-colonial  struggle  and destroy  all  evidence  of

colonialism in this part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in so far as the Congo is concerned, the

facts   are  evidently  clear.  Lumumba  and   his

colleagues    were    legally    constituted    as

representatives of the Congo. The  fact  that  Mr

Lumumba  was removed, the fact that the

popularly-elected  Parliament was dissolved,  and  the  fact

that  Mr Lumumba and his colleagues were arrested

and  murdered  in cold blood, do  not  change  the

basic  proposition.  Killing  the  leader  of  the

people  does  not mean killing the aspirations  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Col. Mobutu, Tshombe and Kasavubu and the

N.A.T.O. powers - which  connived  with  them   are

nothing,  but political criminals. These  traitors

of  the  Congo people, no matter what  influential

positions  they now hold, no matter  how  strongly

they  are  armed  by the foreign  imperialists  to

fight  their own people, and no matter how  dearly

they  are  petted by colonial powers like Belgium,

France,  Britain and America, cannot be recognised

by  any  standard as the legal representatives  of

the Congolese people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, those who accept Lumumba as the

rightful  leader  of the Congo people  cannot  but

accept  anybody,  be  it  Kasavubu  or  Mobutu  or

Tshombe,  or anybody who is anti-Lumumba and  anti

what  he  stood for, as traitors to the  Congolese

cause. Sir, the only justifiable thing any country

could  do, or the United Nations itself could  do,

is to restore effectively the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>



legal  Government of Lumumba. Any  solution  which

disregards these fundamentals is essentially  anti

the Congo people. We in Singapore, Sir, are not in

a position to contribute directly to this struggle

of  the Congolese people. We have not even come to

the  stage where our voice could be heard  in  the

world  forum.  But, Sir, we can  make  the  solemn

declaration  that  if we have  the  will  and  the

determination, we must develop the courage to  say

"wrong"  to that which is wrong, and to contribute

in any way, no matter how small, to denouncing the

atrocities of imperialist powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the United Nations is

nothing but a laughing stock. Western imperialists

are  manipulating the United Nations to give legal

protection   for   the  plundering   of   colonial

territories.  We  can only hope  that  the  United

Nations Organisation fulfils the objects for which

it  was  founded. This, Sir, is the hope of

peace-loving people of the entire world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said earlier that it is necessary, in

denouncing colonial intervention in the Congo  and

in endorsing the struggle of the Congolese people,

that we must try to draw objective lessons for the

eradication  of our immediate enemy,  the  British

imperialists. In Singapore, Sir, colonialism is as

strong as ever. There are people who pose as

anti-colonialists  but  they are not  any  better  than

Kasavubu,   Tshombe,   or   Mobutu.   There    are

imperialist    agents   working   in    Singapore,

obstructing the struggles of the people in a  very

shrewd and cunning manner. The criterion to  judge

an  anti-colonialist is not the  strength  of  his

anti-colonial cries, but the record of his  deeds.

Some  of  these fake anti-colonialists  have  been

exposed,  but some have not as yet. But,  Sir,  as

sure  as certainty can be, the day will come  when

colonialists  and pro-colonialists, no  matter  in

what  form  they  appear,  will  be  exposed   and

destroyed by the will of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our midst we have one of the most

powerful  colonialist agents, and I want  to  make

certain remarks in passing, because I think it  is

the responsibility of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



all  of  us  to take note of the situation.  I  am

referring  to the Straits Times. Sir, the  Straits

Times is British-owned.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder whether the Member

can  assist  the  Chair  by indicating  how  those

comments on the Straits Times are relevant to  the

motion on the Congo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, as I said earlier, the motion

before us is essentially anti-colonialist. We,  in

Singapore, are still continuing our struggle which

is   essentially  anti-colonialist.  The   Straits

Times,  Sir, by its conduct has proved  to  be  an

agent of the imperialists here.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member was

perfectly  in order when he passed the  first  two

remarks.  But  when  he  goes  into  details,   in

enlarging  on  his comments, then I  think  he  is

perhaps  going a little bit too far away from  the

motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> With due respect, may I say that my

reference to the Straits Times is only in  so  far

as it relates to the motion before the House, i.e.

the  Lumumba affair? What I intend to do  is  just

relate what I have to say about the Straits  Times

to  what it has been reporting on Mr Lumumba  and

the  Congolese  crisis,  which  I  feel,  Sir,  is

significant in the debate on the motion before the

House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the hon. Member embarking on a

criticism of the Straits Times? If he is,  then  I

am  afraid  that perhaps he is going a little  bit

too far away.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> It is in a way a criticism, Sir, but

when   you   are  debating  a  motion   which   is

essentially  anti-colonial, and when you  are,  in

fact, denouncing colonialists who are thousands of

miles  away,  may  I  submit,  Sir,  that  it   is

necessary for me to debate on the motion in such a

way  as  to point out even local agents  who  have

been   deliberately  carrying  on   a   propaganda

campaign  with  the  idea of  influencing  certain

sections of the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I must rule the hon.

Member  out  of  order. I think his remarks  might

have been pertinent to the motion on Algeria where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



there   was   a   definite   mention   of   French

colonialism,  whereas  in  the  Prime   Minister's

motion there is no such reference at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Very well, Sir. The struggle for

freedom,  Sir, is not, as I have said  earlier,  a

compromising  one. Freedom is the  birth-right  of

every  human being. The sooner we realise that  it

is  not  a  subject for compromise, the better  it

would be for the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I wish to say here now in conclusion, Sir, is

that  no  single member, no single politician  has

been   the  crusader  who  has  been  successfully

carrying out the struggle to end colonialism.  But

in  the  past,  the vanguard of the  anti-colonial

struggle in Singapore has been the working  class.

It   shall  continue  its  mission,  and  ultimate

victory  and  freedom will come, not  through  the

ability of individual political leaders or foreign

political  agents,  but  through  the  unrelenting

struggle of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we identify ourselves with the spirit of Mr

Lumumba  and the Congolese people, we  must  pause

and   reiterate  our  anti-colonial   stand.   The

struggle in Singapore is led by the working class.

No  imperialist power, no pro-imperialists  or  no

agents  of  the imperialists, no matter  in  what

influential  position they are, whether  they  own

newspapers  or  not,  can stop  the  will  of  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Opposition wholeheartedly supports the motion. The

Congo  situation  has become very  explosive,  and

unless  the  United Nations handle  the  situation

with  firmness and determination to bring law  and

order, there will be chaos and many deaths will be

laid at the door of the United Nations. We support

the  motion,  Sir, because we not only  abhor  but

deplore the killing of any political leader of any

political  party in any country.  This  method  of

political  elimination should be  condemned.  Sir,

Malaya has set a very fine example to the world in

her  handling of the Congo situation. Her soldiers

in  the Congo have done a very fine job, and  they

have not been found wanting. They have won for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  and  for  themselves  the  admiration  and

respect  of the whole world. The Opposition  would

like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute  to

their good work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government, in the motion which has been

disposed  of  earlier, has asked for  a  grant  of

$10,000  towards the Algerian fighting  front.  In

this motion I feel that the Government should give

consideration to a contribution towards the  Congo

Cheer  Fund as a token of Singapore's appreciation

of  the  good  work that the Malayan soldiers  are

doing in the international field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Opposition does not propose to make a

long  political  speech. In fact,  the  Opposition

finds it difficult to understand the speech  of

the  hon. Member for Thomson, especially after the

sober and responsible speech of the Prime Minister

in  moving the motion. The stand of the Opposition

is  clear. We are with the motion one hundred  per

cent,  and we do not require, like the hon. Member

for Thomson, to use language that may tend to give

the impression to the people of Singapore that the

Congo  situation is an all absorbing  matter  that

requires their full interest and that they  should

try  not to remember the burning question  of  the

day.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated dissent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> In my opening. Sir, I have

indicated that what we want to do today is to add

one  more voice in the world forum, albeit we  are

not  in  the United Nations; because in a position

of  no  total war, the voices of groups of people,

of  nations, of Governments, add to the sum  total

of  world opinion, which finally decides  big  and

burning  issues which are settled by the  gods  on

this  earth in Mount Olympia where they meet  from

time  to  time, either in Geneva or in the  United

Nations. Not that we believe, of course,  that  we

are  not  fully  aware of the  difficult  problems

which  lie  in  the  path of all  those  who  seek

freedom,  liberty  and  a better  life  for  their

people.   In  Algeria,  it  has  meant   downright

shooting and killing of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



the  French until the last blow has been delivered

and the French side says, "We have had enough. Let

us  stop."  In  the  Congo, a different  situation

prevails.  True, riots persuaded the  Belgians  to

give  over political and theoretical independence,

hoping by their controls on the administration  to

maintain  their  economic  and  military  position

there.  That  blew  up  in their  faces,  and  the

position  has  collapsed.  And  because  political

independence  has been granted, the  Belgians  are

now  guilty of a heinous crime in meddling in  the

affairs  of  the  Congo, either  directly  through

their   administrators or  their  soldiers,   or

indirectly  by  supporting  people  like  Tshombe,

Mobutu  and,  it  has  even been  said,  Kasavubu,

either  through arms or finance, and to  make  the

arms prevail over the politicians. The Member  for

Cairnhill found himself in the same company.  "Let

us,"  he said on the Algerian issue, "likewise  do

the  same  in  Singapore, i.e. fight for  freedom,

relentlessly,  manfully, and courageously  to  the

bitter end." The Member for Aljunied says, "Let us

do  so  by calling a mass meeting." Let me explain

first.  If you say that independence for Singapore

by  itself is a must and a necessary step forward,

then  I say you must be prepared to pay the price.

And whatever our shortcomings, we are prepared  to

pay  the price of the things we seek. But  it  has

been our proposition from the very beginning - and I

would  welcome an opportunity in this House or  in

Hong  Lim, if the Member for Cairnhill would  send

his    representative   there,   to   debate   the

proposition  that  Singapore  can  and   must   be

independent by itself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do admit that perhaps the

Prime Minister has been jockeyed into saying  what

he  is  saying, but I have already ruled that  all

that  is  not relevant to the present  motion.  In

fact, I did over-rule the Member for Aljunied when

he  embarked on a similar proposition. I  ask  the

Prime Minister not to deal with that topic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker. I

never  intended  to deal with it.  It  is  a  much

bigger topic which requires considerably more time

and thinking. All



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



I  need say is this. All right-thinking people  in

their right minds must be against colonialism. But

a  lot  of not right thinking people were  talking

wrongly  and out of their minds in the days  gone

by,  the Progressives, the Labour Fronters and  so

on.  We  are talking of colonialism, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  and I am talking in abstracto, no longer  of

Singapore as independent, which is a bigger issue:

whether you have independence through merger  with

Malaya  or  whether  you  have  independence   for

Singapore by itself. But I am aghast at the number

of  phoney would-be martyr who all want to be like

Mr Lumumba when they know full well that they are

in  no danger of liquidation. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

would like to see fierce men in fierce situations.

Then  I  admire them. When there is  a  danger  of

annihilation  and  liquidation,  and  then  fierce

words are spoken. Not just stones are thrown,  but

grenades  and  mortars — hand-made ones — are  thrown;

and  in  return a big bomb from an aircraft  which

comes down, as they do in Algeria, and smacks  you

out. Then I say, "Brave men", and—



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Prime Minister is perhaps

forgetting  that he is replying and not  making  a

new speech. He is replying to arguments which have

been raised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is the burden I have

now to discharge, Mr Speaker, Sir,If I had only

to  round up what I said at the opening,  then  my

task  would  have been a simple  and,  I  hope,  a

graceful one. I had already made those two  points

which I thought would have rounded up the argument

nicely.  But the task I am now confronted with  is

to  embark altogether on another theme, the

anti-colonial  crusade which is going on all  over  the

whole  world but which, in our circumstances,  has

to be interpreted in an intelligent and courageous

manner. Courage means not just taking a stone  and

throwing  it;  but courage means, firstly,  having

the intelligence not to throw a bomb when you know

it   is  going  to  break  your  own  window;  and

secondly, saying you are not going to throw a bomb

when you are in the midst of phoney fierce men.  I

say I know I am in no danger of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



being  liquidated. Therefore, I require no courage

to  invite people to liquidate me, people  whom  I

know have not the slightest intention of doing so.

Let  me  remind  the Member for Aljunied  that  we

would have held more than just a protest rally  if

anybody  in  a detention camp had been  liquidated

like   Mr  Lumumba.  But  we  are  dealing   with

different  people, Mr Speaker, Sir. These  people

are  more intelligent and, in their own interests,

they are playing the game in a different way. What

I would like to welcome is a thoughtful exposition

by  the  Member  for Cairnhill, in  his  long  and

tortuous  career,  on  how  to  meet  the  present

difficulties  which  lie  in  the   way   of   the

aspirations  of  the people of  Singapore  towards

freedom,  a democratic way of life, and  a  better

and  more equal society. That is the issue. I have

been arguing in this Assembly—



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister

will  agree  with me that that is not  the  issue,

because the issue is item 7.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> My reply to that is how to

meet  the  meat of the insinuation that have  been

made  in  between your bringing  me  back  to  the

motion, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one point of material substance

which  the Member for Cairnhill has made, namely,

that  we  should contribute $10,000 to  the  Congo

Cheer  Fund. Sir, let me straightaway say  that  I

think  it is a courageous thing for the Federation

Government to have sent their troops to the Congo,

and   an   even  more  courageous  thing  in   the

circumstances,      in     extremely      perilous

circumstances, to keep some 600 Federation  troops

in  provinces where, I am told, some three or four

battalions   of   well-armed   and   well-equipped

Congolese  officered by Belgians  are  confronting

them.  We  would  welcome an opportunity  to  give

expression of some cheer to the Malayan contingent

in  the  Congo. But let it never be  suggested  to

this   Government  that  we  should  boost  up   a

colonialist  newspaper which has been attacked  by

the  Member  for Thomson in what I thought  was  a

mild, moderate and restrained tone, and which  you

felt was somewhat out of place in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



this  motion. The Berita Harian Congo Cheer  Fund,

besides  having  the purpose of  cheering  up  the

troops  in  the Congo, has also to  cheer  up  the

people  who read Berita Harian, and cheer  up  the

owners of Berita Harian by putting up their

sales—



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Point of explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Explanation?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Prime Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I will have no chance

later to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the Member for Cairnhill

is  always  full of explanations after having  put

his  big foot into it. The Congo Cheer Fund by  no

stretch  of  the imagination can  be  said  to  be

disinterested. We are prepared to cheer the troops

in  the  Congo, and we will do so. But we are  not

prepared to cheer the owners of Berita Harian  who

happen to be the same owners of the Straits Times.

Sir, may I go back to the motion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am glad, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that Members of the Opposition are mindful if  the

fact that when they stray from the beaten path  of

the  motion,  they do so at their peril.  Because,

despite your vigilance, Sir, it is my duty to meet

them  in all these asides somehow or other  within

the rules of debate allowed in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just wind up by saying that this motion is

nonetheless  sound and deserves  the  full-hearted

support  of  the whole of the people of Singapore,

despite the very embarrassing fact that the Member

for  Cairnhill wholeheartedly agrees with it?  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill is in  such

a position that when he wholeheartedly agrees with

anything,  it  becomes suspect! I  would  like  to

mention to the people of Singapore that, in  spite

of  the fact that he agrees with it, it is a sound

resolution



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



in  keeping with the proposal put forward by  the

three  members  of the Afro-Asian  group  in  the

Security Council, namely, Ceylon, the U.A.R. and

Liberia. It is an attempt by countries which have

not  the  wherewithal  to influence,  subvert  or

extract any benefit from the Congo, or any  other

State  for  that  matter. It is  a  proposal  put

forward by countries whose only interest is peace

and  justice. Peace to be maintained by  the  Big

Powers  staying out of this and not  turning  the

Congo into a hot war or a cold war arena. Justice

by  ensuring  that those who have committed  this

crime  should be brought to book, that a properly

constituted  government  should  be  allowed   to

emerge  from the Congolese Parliament,  and  that

the wherewithal of an effective government should

be granted to the people of the Congo through the

assistance of the United Nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last word on the United Nations, Sir. One

of  the  most curious things about the  ploy  and

play  of propaganda in the Press and in the radio

is  an often informed and tremendously solid  and

firm  conclusion on the basis of third or

fourth-hand   information   reported   in   the   Press.

Therefore,  the  only basis on which  people  who

have  not  got representatives in the  Congo  can

work  in  the  formulation and  pronouncement  of

policy  made  by  people in  authority  who  have

representatives there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this: that Mr Dayal, the United

Nations  representative in the Congo (he  happens

to  be  an  Indian, but he is the United  Nations

representative  who  represents  the

Secretary-General  in  the  Congo) is a man  of  integrity,

acknowledged  all  round.  He  has   never   been

attacked  by  Mr Khruschev. He  has  never  been

attacked  by  the  Americans,  or  even  by   the

Belgians. Sir, he has never been attacked by  any

Afro-Asian  powers. Presumably, we must  conclude

that  he is a man of some considerable integrity.

He has published reports from time to time and  I

think  it  is a pity that such reports  have  not

been  read  more  by  Members of  this  Assembly,

particularly if they have to make speeches on the

matter.  I  hope through you, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

such  valuable material should be made  available

in the Library.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is clear is this. Mr Nehru undoubtedly is

well-informed, and whatever else he  may  or  may

not  know,  in his formulation of policy  he  has

made   clear   that  to  abolish  the

Secretary-Generalship of the United Nations or to  withdraw

United Nations operations in the Congo must  mean

chaos,  disaster  and  civil  war;  a  civil  war

leading  to international intervention on  a  big

scale  in  the  Congo. I know nothing  about  the

Congo, Sir. All I know is Mr Dayal's credentials

and what Mr Nehru has publicly said. I would say

that  Mr  Nehru is not a man likely  to  mislead

other people, nor India. And the odds are that if

he  is prepared, on behalf of his Government  and

the nearly 400 million people of India, to commit

them  to  what  he thinks is right, despite  what

other countries are shouting and wishing to  have

happen  in the Congo, then I say that is a  point

of view worth thinking about. I would like to see

a great deal of evidence to the contrary before I

discard that point of view on the ground that  he

has been ill-informed, or that it is erroneous or

misguided.   Sir,   on  the  authority   of   the

credentials  of those people who  have  not  been

challenged  by  any  side, I ask  this  Assembly,

without a dissenting voice, to give approval to a

resolution which is in the same terms and  spirit

as that presented by three small nations, with no Big  Power  interests in the Congo,  or  anywhere

else  in the world, and which is put forward  for

the  sake  of  the  peace of the  world  and  the

happiness of the small nations, as well as  those

of the big ones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly expresses its



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ABHORRENCE at the cold-blooded murder of Mr Lumumba and his colleagues; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALLS upon the United Nations Organisation to

assist in the investigation of the murder,  the

apprehension   of  the  criminals   and   their

principals to bring them to justice;



<br><br>and that this Assembly also



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONDEMNS the presence of Belgian troops and

agents in the Congo and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



SUPPORT  the proposal that all Belgian and foreign

troops not under United Nations command should be

forthwith  expelled from the Congo and  that  the

United Nations Organisation ensures law and order

in  the  Congo  so that the Congolese  Parliament

could  be  re-summoned for  the  formation  of  a

Government to represent the Congolese people,  to

prevent    foreign   intervention   which    must

inevitably lead to the tragedy of a civil war.
