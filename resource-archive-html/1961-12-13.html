<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 50 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs yesterday

stated in this House that the Government had lifted the

ban of 8,000 books. All the books banned by the

previous Government were unimportant and the Government

hooks  on  which  the ban had been lifted  were  of  no

significance. I said yesterday that the does not  allow

books   of  a  political  nature,  such  as  books   on

socialism,  to be imported into Singapore. The  present

Government  professes to be a non-Communist,  Socialist

Party. The Prime Minister has also recommended that the

people  should  read all kinds of books in  order  that

they may learn how our society can be reformed. But the

Government has so far not allowed books



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>



of  this nature to be imported into Singapore.  If  the

Government is sincere in reforming our society  through

knowledge  gained from certain books on  socialism  and

political   theories,   then  it   should   allow   the

importation of such books into Singapore, as they  will

be  very useful to the people of Singapore. If it wants

to  prove that a bad society can be reformed,  then  it

should  allow the people to read these books  in  order

that  they  can  decide  for  themselves  whether   the

arguments  put forward by the Government  are  good  or

bad.  The  present policy of the Government is contrary

to  its  declared policy of promoting Malayan  culture.

The   Minister   for  Culture  and  his   Parliamentary

Secretary  have said that they want to encourage  local

writers  to  write  books with a local  background,  as

books  of  the  nature of Alice in Wonderland  are  not

useful  and  necessary in Singapore. The censorship  on

useful  books imposed by the Ministry of Home  Affairs

had not been in keeping with the Government's professed

policy.  There is a book called Reminiscences  of  Fire

which  has  not  been  properly censored.  The  present

Government's  policy  is  not  in  keeping   with   its

professed   aim  of  promoting  Malayan  culture.   The

Government  should not adopt the same  rule,  the  same

standard  or  the  same criterion  in  respect  of  the

censorship of all kinds of books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I want to raise is in connection with

the   issue   of   identity  cards.  At  present,   the

Registration  Centre  sends  out  teams   to   register

students in schools so that they do not have to come to

the  Centre for their identity cards. This  is  a  good

method,  but, in actual fact, no proper facilities  are

extended  to  students, especially those in  the  rural

areas.  If  the students who are promoted to  secondary

schools  in  the  rural areas do not  possess  identity

cards,   the   schools  will  not   admit   them.   The

Registration  Centre has not sent out officers  to  the

rural  schools  to register students  who  qualify  for

registration.  When students went to the  Centre,  they

were  told  by the officer in charge that  they  should

remain  in  their schools and wait for the officers  to

come  and  register them. But no officer has ever  been

sent to the rural schools. The students in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>



the rural schools have been inconvenienced because many

of them will be going to secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister for Home Affairs will take

steps  to  facilitate the registration of  students  in

order  to  enable  them  to proceed  to  the  secondary

schools in the urban areas. I hope he will provide them

with  all  kinds of facilities to save their  time  and

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not clear what books

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang was referring to. We have

not  banned books of a political nature. We  have  also

not  banned  books  on socialism.  Many  book-shops  in

Singapore  are selling books on socialism.  Perhaps  he

has  not visited the book-shops, and that is why he  is

not  aware  of this fact. Perhaps he has visited  those

book-shops which do not sell this kind of books as they

are  not  in  great demand. The hon. Member  could  not

point  out  any  specific example, and that  is  why  I

cannot give a specific answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy on the censorship of books sold in the

book-shops has always been liberal. We have been  quite

open-minded about it. I would like to quote  a  passage

from  the  Report  of  the P.A.P.'s  Special  Committee

reviewing the work of the Government and the Party. The

Report clearly shows the attitude of the Government  in

regard to the censorship of books and literature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is contended that we have tended to be too strict

in  our censorship of books, films, records, music  and

other  cultural  material from  abroad.  Censorship  is

always  a  tricky problem as it very often  involves  a

certain  measure of subjective judgment on the part  of

individuals  who  exercise  censorship.  What  may   be

immoral  or undesirable to one group of people may  not

be so to others. Such differences of opinion are likely

to arise in an even more acute form in a multi-cultural

society where sense of values differ.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, censorship must pay regard to the

prevailing   political  atmosphere  and   tensions   in

society.  We must ensure that there is no expansion  of

cultural  forces  inimical to cur broad  objectives  of

creating  a  Malayan  nation  and  a  democratic,  non-communist socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as long as these broad objectives are not

jeopardised,  there should be freer  play  of  cultural

influences.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cultural materials from abroad which are

not merely propagandistic but calculated to bring about

active   hostility   against   democratic   forms    of

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should restrict such type of cultural material as

we  restrict material which glorifies colonialism.  The

test  is  what impact certain types of hostile cultural

materials  is likely to have on our people at  a  given

moment. For example, it may be all right to show a film

dealing  with religious and racial conflicts  or  about

juvenile delinquency or gangsterism at times when there

are  no  acute racial religious or juvenile delinquency

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works of literary and social, value, including those

by  Communists, should not be excluded as a  matter  of

course.  Only such works should be excluded  which  are

likely  to  incite  our people to  do  unconstitutional

things or hamper us from our goal of building a Malayan

society.'



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It seems to be a very long

extract.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is only a short paragraph more to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to this overriding consideration, we should

allow  freer  flow  of  books,  scientific  literature,

plays,  films  and songs from Communist  countries.  We

recommend that all nonpolitical books should be allowed

entry from Communist countries as a general rule.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, from what I have already quoted, we can

see  clearly that the Government's policy on censorship

is  very  lax and broad-minded. Because of  this,  many

books which were banned formerly are allowed on sale at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the allegation that we do not encourage local

creative works in literature, unfortunately the  Member

for  Choa  Chu Kang has not been able to  give  us  any

concrete examples in this respect. We have banned  many

undesirable publications imported from other countries.

There is a positive aspect of this ban. If we have very

few   undesirable   publications,  then   the   healthy

publications in our own country will have a good chance

of  better  circulation. There will be  more  and  more

people  trying to take part in literary  works  with  a

Malayan  background. Therefore, in  this  respect,  our

policy  is  in compliance with that of the Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the book mentioned by the Member for Choa Chu

Kang, Reminiscences of Fire, this was banned only at the

time when the students were staging a boycott. This book

contained  seven articles, the first six  of  which  are

quite  innocuous.  But the last article,  the  title  of

which  is Reminiscences of Fire, is the main reason  for

banning  this  book. It is because the  writer  of  this

article wrote about students camping in the Chinese High

School   in  1960.  This  article  states  clearly   the

organisation  and  activities of  the  students  camping

there, how they were trying to go against the Government

at  that  time, and how propaganda work was carried  out

against the Government then. In this article terms  such

as   "superior"  and  "Directives"  which  in  Communist

organisations  were commonly used. Only those  who  were

found  connected with the underground activities of  the

Communists   will  have  knowledge  and  use   of   such

terminology. The event took place at the time  of  anti-colonialism,   and   the  government   then   was   pro-colonialist. But the present Government is  a  popularly

elected  government.  The  anti-government  by  violence

phase has gone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for banning this book is that at the

time  when  the book was banned there was a minority  of

Secondary IV students who made use of the same method of

organising  agitation among students  in  their  boycott

against Government Secondary IV examinations. They  even

resorted to violence to stop students Who wanted to  sit

for  the examinations. So in that atmosphere of tension,

if  we allowed this book to circulate in the market,  it

would  only  lead  to  increasing difficulties  for  the

Government.  Therefore, I would like to ask  the  Member

for Choa Chu Kang whether he is sincerely concerned with

local  writers  with a Malayan outlook writing  literary

works  in  this perspective or whether he is  trying  to

defend  Communist activities. Unfortunately, he has  not

made it clear to me. I can tell him that fortunately  it

is  we  who are in power, otherwise the writer  of  this

book will not be able to move about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>



freely in this country. He might be confronted with more

difficulties and troubles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Registry of Persons, the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang mentions that the Registration Office has  not

sent  out mobile teams to rural schools to register  the

students who want to apply for identity cards. If  there

is  such  an occurrence, and if he can bring up concrete

examples, such as the place or the name of the school or

the  students, then I will take proper measures to  deal

with  such a problem. As far as possible, we are  trying

to  reduce  the need for 12-year old students  from  the

rural  areas  to go to the Registration  Office  to  get

their  identity cards. Many members of the public go  to

the  N.R.I.C. Centre to get their identity cards. So  if

we  encourage  more  and  more students  to  go  to  the

Registration Centre in the city, then there  will  be  a

great pressure of work. That is why we have decided that

where  there  are students who are of age  and  who  are

studying in rural schools, we will send out mobile teams

to  register  them so that we can save  them  a  lot  of

trouble   and  transport  money.  Of  course,   we   are

understaffed and because of the question of expenditure,

it  is  impossible for us to send out  mobile  teams  to

every  school in the rural areas. I believe  that  given

more  favourable  conditions,  both  administrative  and

financial, we will try to send out mobile teams to every

school  in  the  rural areas so that every  student  who

wants to apply for an identity card can be attended to.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Minister  were to have said yesterday what he said  just

now,  I would have nothing to pick with him. In fact,  I

would  have supported him. When he was attacked  by  the

leader  of  the Barisan Sosialis in regard to censorship

of  publications and the denial of citizenship rights to

be  a  number of what the Barisan Sosialis termed "anti-colonial  fighters", the Minister felt it to be  a  very

convenient way of answering such attacks by saying,  "We

are not so bad. It was the Lim Yew Hock Government that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>



imposed  the  ban. Since we came into  power,  we  have

already  approved about a few thousand books." Sir,  in

regard  to that ban, may I explain here that it  was  a

blanket  ban  on all publishing companies in  Communist

China? Then there was a continuing process of screening

the books, and if the books were harmless they would be

released for sale in Singapore. The P.A.P. took  office

in  1959 and the continuing process still continues. As

a result of that continuing process, the ban was lifted

from a large number of books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to citizenship, the Minister said, "We are not

so bad. The Lim Yew Hock Government was very strict. We

have  given citizenship to a lot of people."  What  the

leader of the Barisan Sosialis said about the denial of

citizenship rights was, I think, in regard to those who

they  claimed  were  anti-colonial  fighters,  and  the

Minister  knows who they are. We refused to grant  them

citizenship. The fact that the P.A.P. has been in power

for 2½ years, and coupled with the fact that those so-called  anti-colonial  fighters were  comrades  of  the

P.A.P. and  they still refused them their  citizenship

rights shows that what the Lim Yew Hock Government  did

was quite right.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been the habit in this House since 1959

to  label  all  sins or omissions on the Lim  Yew  Hock

Government. Even the Barisan Sosialis, when  they  were

sitting  opposite,  were attacking  the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government, as if it was a free-for-all. But  now  that

they have come over here they are beginning to have the

feeling,  as the people of Singapore are now  beginning

to realise, that the Lim Yew Hock Government was not so

bad  as  compared with the P.A.P. Government. At least,

it is much better.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Member for Cairnhill mentioned

a  little while ago about citizenship being denied only

to  certain people. But I can assure him that a  number

of  students who took part in the 1955/56 demonstration

have been denied their citizenship. Also quite a lot of

people  who were active members of the P.A.P., and  not

only  those  who  were  detained, like  the  Organising

Secretaries  and  Branch Committee members,  have  been

denied their citizenship. We do not know why.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> As regards the books, Sir, may I

ask  the Minister how is it - this is in defence  of  the

Member for Cairnhill in a certain way - that books  which

were  available during the Lim Yew Hock period  are  no

more available today?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> What are the books?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, a number of companies have

been  writing  to  the  Minister for  the  last  twelve

months.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Name

the books.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The names of the two companies

concerned  are  the Singapore Trading Company  and  the

Education  Book  Store. They have been writing  to  the

Minister  asking for certain hooks to be released.  But

they have not been released. In fact, during my stay in

the Ministry, I found that if there is but one line  in

the whole book which says what is happening in China is

good, or if there is just one line that praises Mao Tse-tung,  then the whole hook is banned. So much so,  Sir,

that  several  people  who  had  been  working  in  the

Ministry  have  resigned in protest. I  feel  that  the

Minister  has borrowed spectacles heavily  tinted  from

somewhere.  Otherwise he could not have seen  socialist

books as Communist books.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I did not know, Mr Speaker, Sir,

that  the Member for Queenstown has now allied  himself

with  the  Member for Cairnhill. My point  is  that  in

Singapore,  unlike  in  the Federation,  it  is  not  a

blanket   ban   as  such.  Books  are  released   after

examination.  This  Government has been  more  liberal.

That is why within a period of two and a half years, we

have released more than 8,000 books. In the Member  for

Cairnhill's  time, probably none of those  books  would

have been released. The Member for Queenstown has asked

how  it  is that books which were available during  the

previous  Government are no longer available  now.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, there are many reasons why  books  which

were  available during the previous Government  are  no

longer  available  now. It is  not  that  we  are  even

stricter than the previous Government. I would like  to

give  some of the reasons why it happened. In June this

year, I instructed my officials to find out about this,

because  certain  allegations were made  that  nowadays

book-shops have less books for sale than before.  After

interviewing five of the largest bookshops in the city,

we found out that these are the reasons why there is  a

scarcity  of  books  nowadays. First,  once  the  books

produced in China, are sold out in Singapore, they  are

no  longer  available in China. It is not  possible  to

order  again  the  same type of  books  because,  in  a

planned economy, as in China, the production is related

to the demand. Once the books are sold out, that is the

end  of  it. Secondly, there is a shortage of  printing

material  in China, and, therefore, it is not  possible

for the Chinese Government to produce as many books  as

before [Interruption] -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> - for export overseas. The third

reason, according to the bookshop proprietors, is  that

in  recent  years creative work in China has been  very

scarce.  The reason is that many of these writers  have

been sent to the villages and the communes to take part

in  physical labour, and, therefore, they have no  time

to  write any literary works. Hence, there are less new

books



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>



available in Singapore. Mind you, Sir, this information

was  given  by people who have been dealing  with  this

business  for  years.  Fourthly, the  market  for  the

progressive type of books is very small. Those who read

them  are the youth and the intellectuals. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  what  all proprietors of bookshops are  after  is

profit. If this type of books do not bring them as much

profit  as  the  others,  they will  not  import  them.

Fifthly, although the Singapore Government has released

many types of books, the Federation still imposes a ban

on  this type of books. Therefore, the market continues

to  be  very small, and it is not profitable to  import

this  type of books for sale in Singapore only.  It  is

not because the Government's standard of censorship  is

more  severe  than  that of the previous  Government's.

These are objective facts.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (1) on the Order Paper

Supplement for today. Inche Ahmad Jabri.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 50 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 3.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am surprised to see that the vote for the cost of students attending the Muslim College at Kiang has been reduced as compared to the 1961 vote.

What  should  have  been done by the Government  is  to

increase the vote and not to reduce it. This is on  the

basis  of the policy to encourage more capable students

to  further  their religious studies. It is, therefore,

necessary that this vote should be increased.  We  have

just  heard  how  the  Prime  Minister  replied  to  my

question  concerning translators in the High Court,  He

said there were not enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>



defendants,  and  so  there  was  no  need   for   more

translators. I think those who receive religious  study

at  the  Muslim College, Kiang, will be more useful  to

the State of Singapore. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I think

it  is appropriate for the Ministry of Home Affairs  to

increase this particular vote, and not have the vote as

it  is this year. When I read today's newspapers, there

are very few students studying at the Muslim College at

Klang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Muslim

College,   Klang,  was  founded  in  March  1955,   the

Singapore  Government made a capital grant  of  $10,000

and undertook to offer ten scholarships in' two batches

of  five  scholars at the rate of $1,560 per year.  The

first batch of five students who joined the college  in

1955  completed their studies in 1959. No  scholarships

were  offered  in 1960 because consideration  was  then

given  to  reviewing the extent to which the Government

had  need  of personnel academically qualified  in  the

Muslim religion and the extent to which they could make

use  of the College. Unfortunately, this assessment  of

the  demand  for  graduates  of  the  College  was  not

completed before the opening of the 1960 academic  year

of  the  College  in April of that year.  However,  the

matter  was  resolved and it was decided  to  send  one

scholar  a year for the five years commencing from  the

1961  academic  year, instead of five scholars  in  one

batch. The provision of $4,000 in the 1962 Estimates is

less  than previously because of the decision  to  send

one  scholar  a year instead of five at the  time.  The

provision of $4,000 in 1962 is to meet the cost of  the

student who studied in the College in the academic year

196l  and will continue to do so in 1962, and the  cost

of  the  student who will be selected for the  academic

year 1962, and a little bit of other expenses that  may

arise in connection with their studies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of $7,800 in the 1961 Estimates was

only  a  repetition of previous estimates. At the  time

when  the  provision was entered in the 1961 Estimates,

no decision had yet been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>



arrived at whether to send one scholar per year or five

scholars in one batch. That is the reason why there  is

this difference in the provisions for 1961 and 1962.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an item for the maintenance of vessels,

and  I  find it difficult to understand why it is  that

the  estimate for 1962 is double that of  1961.  Is  it

because there are more vessels to be maintained  or  is

it  because  the maintenance carried out from  year  to

year has not been enough, and it has to be made up with

a double vote?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision is

for the maintenance of the following vessels:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H.M.S. Laburnum, which is the Head-quarters ship of

the  M.R.N.V.R.; H.M.S. Panglima, H.M.S.  Cana,  Panji,

two   harbour  launches,  one  fast  motor-boat,  three

bailers and five dinghies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until 1962, the proper maintenance of vessels has not

been  possible  owing  to the  lack  of  funds  and  so

maintenance on a breakdown basis only has been  carried

out. The slipping or docking has always been kept to  a

minimum  because  of  high  dock  charges.  Dock  Staff

therefore, have not been able to carry out drill  tests

or the examination of hulls and of associated fittings.

This  lack of proper maintenance in the past means that

in most cases major overhauls will be required in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In working out the amount required for maintenance of

such  vessels in 1962, estimates from the Harbour Board

have been obtained and, as a result of these estimates,

a   figure  of  $138,976  has  been  arrived  at.  This

maintenance comprises such items as scraping, painting,

refitting   of   underwater  fittings,   replacing   of

waterline  plates,  cleaning, slipping,  dock  charges,

etc.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 53 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the time of the Bukit Ho Swee Fire many

people were asking themselves this question: Why should

Government have to wait for a big fire before  building

houses to rehouse these attap-house dwellers? The  Fire

Brigade  cannot control a fire that breaks  out  in  an

attap-house  area  if  the wind  is  blowing  strongly.

Therefore,  it would be a pity if the Fire  Brigade  is

unable to prevent an occurrence like this once in three

years,  because if the money that has to  be  spent  to

relieve  these fire victims could be spent  before  the

fire,  it  would save the fire victims, the public  and

the  Fire Brigade too, a large expenditure of money and

effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion made is this, If the Fire Brigade

could  suggest preventive measures to reduce  the  fire

risks  in  these  areas, that would be another  way  to

prevent a tragedy like this from happening regularly. I

have been told, Sir, that in these attap-house areas if

they  changed the roofings of attap to zinc or aluminum

roofings,  then the Finance Ministry would  come  along

and say that the property tax must be increased.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now on the Fire Brigade and not

on  housing.  Let  us not talk about  attap  houses  as

against  zinc  houses. I should  imagine  that  if  the

Member  wishes to speak about the Fire Brigade on  this

vote,  he  should  indicate how the  Fire  Brigade  has

failed, whether expansion is necessary and 50 on and so

forth-not on housing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the vote for the

Fire  Brigade  comes  to nearly $2½ million.  If  by

preventive  measures fire risks could be reduced, then

we could reduce the expenditure. All this tragedy would

not  have  happened.  Simple  measures  like  the  Fire

Brigade people going round to advise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>



the  people  on  changing their  roofing  would  be  of

greater  help.  But  there is one  obstacle,  Sir.  The

property  tax  people  say this thing  cannot  be  done

without  increasing  the property tax.  This  is  where

perhaps one Ministry could help another.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the total sum to

be  allocated for Head 53 be reduced by $100." I do not

know whether the Minister has anything to answer there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually it is

more  a  question  of housing than  the  Fire  Brigade.

However,  I wish to inform the Member for Tanglin  that

it  is precisely because of these fire hazards that the

Government is spending millions of dollars each year to

build new flats, which will be more tire-proof, and  we

hope  with  the successful conclusion of the  Four-Year

Development  Plan on housing, such large fires  as  the

Bukit Ho Swee fire will not occur again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Fire Brigade may be in a

position to suggest ways and means of preventing  fire,

such as the use of inflammable materials for houses and

so forth. But all this, Mr Speaker, Sir, is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Non-inflammable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> - non-inflammable materials for

houses and so forth. But, Mr Speaker, all this is to a

large  extent  tied up with the economic conditions  of

the  people. I mean, all the non-inflammable  materials

invariably  are more expensive than attap  and  planks.

Therefore, many of the suggestions of the Fire  Brigade

are  just  not  within the means of  these  attap-house

dwellers to carry out. That is where the Housing  Board

has  come in to build low-cost houses for these  attap-house dwellers.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

whether  the Minister could give some consideration  to

this  suggestion.  During  the  life  of  the  previous

Government   some   kampongs  has  fire   extinguishers

provided  together with one or two firemen going  round

and forming a squad of about 20 kampong people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>



depending on the size of the kampong, to teach them how

to  use  these  fire extinguishers and to  be  on  call

should there be a fire to prevent the fire spreading. I

find  that these fire extinguishers have now gone  dry;

the  20 people have gone off the list, and nobody knows

who they are because the list has not been renewed.  If

the  Assemblyman  concerned  for  that  area  were   to

approach  the Minister and give him the details,  could

we get help along those lines?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member

for  Mountbatten  were to make a request  to  the  Fire

Brigade for the setting up of a fire-fighting squad  in

whichever kampong she thinks necessary, I am  sure  the

Fire  Brigade would only be too glad to do so. In fact,

there are at the moment 72 kampong fire-fighting squads

in 28 kampongs. These squads have all received training

and   equipment  from  the  Fire  Brigade.  They   were

recruited  in  order to fight fires  in  the  incipient

stage  within their own kampongs before the arrival  of

the Singapore Fire Brigade. I can assure the Member for

Mountbatten  that if she were to put up a  request,  it

would be favourably considered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall discuss

this in the Development Estimates. I withdraw this

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,449,510 for Head 53 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 54 -

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 54 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 7.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote for the purchase of of passports

amounting  to $24,000. I wonder whether it is  wise  to

spend  so much money on passports which will be out  of

fashion  when  the  next constitutional  advance  takes

place  in,  I  think, 1963. How many passports  can  be

purchased with $24,000, and how long will these last?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I think the

provision is very necessary to meet the anticipated

demand in 1962. For the information of the Member for

Cairnhill, the number of passports issued from June to

December 1959 was 6,341. In 1960, the number of

passports issued was 17,432. In 1961, as at November,

the number of passports issued has reached 20,607. The

amount provided for in the 1962 Estimates can only

purchase about 19,000 passports. Fortunately, we are

anticipating a balance of about 8,000 passports this

year. So together with 18,000 for next year, we are

just in a position to meet the demand in 1962.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In view of the explanation, may I

beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 54 be

reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no wish to embarrass the Minister, for as

we  all  know, the Immigration Department has  improved

considerably  as a result of recommendations  from  the

Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen and branches. But  I  wish

to raise a few points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the improvement, there is still

restriction imposed on Singapore citizens who  want  to

travel. For example, Singapore citizens and children of

Singapore citizens who have been awarded

scholarships  in  iron  curtain  countries  have   been

prevented from going on these scholarships just because

the  Special Branch - the Special Branch always comes in - says  that these people should not be allowed to go  on

scholarships to non-pro-Western countries. I wonder  if

the   Minister  will  reconsider  the  policy  on  this

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again. Sir, you will remember that at the

inauguration  of the Barisan Sosialis, we  extended  an

invitation to -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mao Tse-tung!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the Sarawak United People's Party

to  attend our inaugural meeting. The Chairman  of  the

Party  himself was entertained lavishly when he  passed

through Singapore. He has said that his organisation is

a  legal organisation and that there is no Communist in

his organisation. Yet when his representative was asked

to  come  along, our Minister here saw fit to stop  him

from  attending the inaugural meeting. Again  I  wonder

whether the Minister will consider changing the  policy

on this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still one more point. This concerns the

local-born who are now in China. There are a number  of

people  born in Singapore who went to China for various

reasons, and now when they want to come back, they  are

prevented from doing so. People over the age of  twelve

have  not  been issued with certificates of status.  We

think  it is the inalienable right of anybody  born  in

Singapore that he be allowed a chance to come back.  We

know,  Sir,  there  are people who have  been  away  to

America,  Indonesia and Australia for 20 to  30  years,

and  because they could produce documents to prove that

they  were born in Singapore, they were allowed to come

back.  Why is discrimination shown against those people

who  went to China? We know a number of such cases, and

even  the brother of one of the Assembly women opposite

is similarly discriminated against.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is the opportune time now for  us  to

touch  on  the immigration laws. Our Minister for  Home

Affairs  is  no longer a bachelor. He knows the  warmth

and responsibilities of a family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two rules in this country restricting local

citizens  from applying for permission for their  wives

to  enter Singapore. There is another restriction which

is  applicable  to  their children.  According  to  the

present  law, a local-born citizen will not be  allowed

to  apply for permission for his wife to come into this

country if between the period 1948 and 1952 he has  not

been living together with her. The rule applicable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>



to  their children is this. If they were born elsewhere

and they are older than six years, they are not allowed

to come into Singapore. These restrictions have greatly

affected  the Chinese. In the past, generally speaking,

the  Chinese  came to Singapore to earn  a  living  but

their  wives  stayed in China. They did not  know  that

after  the P.A.P. came into power they would  be  faced

with  such  restrictions, The P.A.P. claims  to  be  a

socialist Party. Hard-working people from China earn no

more than $200 a month. So it is impossible for them to

go  back to China in the course of two or three  years.

These  people  never realised that the P.A.P.  Government

would  impose such restrictions on them. They have  not

been  able  to live with their wives for the last  five

years  as  their  wives are not allowed  to  come  into

Singapore. Therefore, I say that these restrictions are

worthy of reconsideration on human grounds. I hope  the

Minister concerned will improve this situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the restriction on the entry of children,

it  is  impossible for a child who is six years old  to

live  alone away from its parents. Who is to look after

the  child?  Therefore, I hope the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs,  who is a father now, will understand parental

love  and  the love between husband and wife.  He  must

realise it is not good to curb such love.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown mentioned the Government's refusal to  allow

two representatives of the Sarawak U.P.P. to attend the

inaugural meeting of the Barisan Sosialis. I think  the

reasons have been made public in the newspapers and, in

fact,  even  the  Prime  Minister  has  disclosed   the

background   of  the  lives  of  these   two   persons.

Therefore,  I do not think it is necessary  for  me  to

repeat here again what is a public fact. It may be that

the  President of the Sarawak U.P.P is not a  Communist

Party  and  that  the  Party is  a  legal  Party - as  he

said - but that does not mean that a legal Party does not

contain  Communist or pro-Communist  elements.  As  you

know,  Sir,  no Communist will claim himself  to  be  a

Communist. Because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>



the Communist Party is an illegal organisation in

Sarawak,  therefore they must find a  legal  Party  for

their activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the middle of this year, the

P.A.P. set  up a Committee to review its work  in  the

Government and in the Party. The Member for Queens-town

was   a   Secretary  of  this  Committee.  During   the

discussions  on  the  problems  of  immigration,  if  I

remember  correctly, he did not raise the  question  of

Singapore-born  persons who had gone to  China  in  the

early   fifties   to   take  part  in   the   Sosialist

reconstruction of the mother country. He  did  not  say

anything about them. In fact, I am surprised today that

he  should champion their cause. Is it because  he  has

gone  over  to the other side of the House?  Or  is  it

because  the support of this small number of people  is

so vital for the survival of his Party?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has raised the question of the

entry  of the wives and children of Singapore citizens.

The  question of immigration must be viewed m  relation

to  the  economic  conditions of the  country.  If  the

Government wants to be popular, the easiest  thing  for

it  to  do  is to open the gate and allow everybody  to

come in. But then what will happen to the country?  The

unemployment situation will get from bad to  worse  and

whatever  new  industries the State  may  develop,  the

opportunities of employment will be quickly taken up by

these alien elements.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, the free flow of

immigrants   from   outside  has  to   be   controlled.

Immigration is a Pan-Malayan matter. Because  there  is

no restriction at the Causeway, it is just not possible

for  Singapore to adopt an immigration policy which  is

diametrically opposite to that of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these two specific instances of entry of wives and

children,  the  Review  Committee  again  has  made   a

recommendation that we should relax the restriction  of

these  two  categories  of  people,  i.e.,  wives   and

children  of Singapore citizens. The recommendation  is

that,  so long as the relationship is proved, all wives

of Singapore citizens should be allowed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>



entry.  This  recommendation has been accepted  by  the

Government  and we are now awaiting the  views  of  the

Federation Government on this matter. As soon as we get

the  Federation Government's agreement on this, we will

implement it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised at the Minister

saying  that  I never raised this point before  in  the

Committee  of Review. I have the minutes  of  the  10th

meeting  of the Committee of Review with me. I was  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> That is P.A.P. property and should

be returned!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not P.A.P. private property!

It is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I raised this important matter,

saying that - I will read just one sentence to you, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Lee says that it is the basic human right that a

person he able to return to the place of his birth.'



<br><br>But,  unfortunately,  I was overruled.  I  raised  this

point  on  many  occasions, and even the  Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Education agreed with  me

on  this. Now the Minister for Home Affairs turns round

and says he knows nothing about this. I want to ask him

again, Sir what about those people who have -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Point

of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member give way?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No time, Sir. I also want to ask

the  Minister: what about those people, now  in  China,

whose  parents  in  Singapore  are  about  to  die?  On

compassionate  grounds, Sir - I know  of  one  particular

case. This person appealed to the Minister to allow the

son  to  come back to Singapore just to see  his  dying

mother.  Confirmation that the mother  was  dying  came

from  a medical certificate saying that the mother  was

suffering  from  this and that. But in  spite  of  such

circumstances,   the  Minister  saw   fit   to   refuse

permission even for the son to come back to have a last

look at the mother. Mind you, Sir, the father of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>



son  in China had given an undertaking that if the  son

was not allowed to remain permanently in Singapore,  he

would be willing, however, to let the son come back for

only  a stretch of three months. In spite of that,  the

Minister  refused. The last time I heard of  this  case

was  about two months ago. I do not know of any further

developments. I hope the Minister will on compassionate

grounds alone, consider cases like this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not aware

of  the case he mentioned. If that is so, I shall  look

it  up  to see whether it is a genuine case. But  as  I

said,  Mr  Speaker,  it is very difficult  to  make  a

precedent  in  this  kind  of  cases  because,  once  a

precedent is made, it is very difficult to refuse other

cases, whether genuine or not. One important point  the

Member  for  Queenstown  has  overlooked  is  that  the

Chinese   Government  refuses  to  issue   any   travel

documents  to its nationals who want to go  abroad.  As

you  know,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, when  someone  lands  in

Singapore  without any travel documents, it is  not  an

easy  job to get rid of him because no shipping company

will take him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown surely must be aware, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that in 1960 the Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance was amended. He agreed to the amendment.  The

amendment  says quite definitely that if  any  citizen,

who  has at any time after the 6th day of April,  1960,

voluntarily claimed and exercised any rights  available

to  him  under  the law of any foreign  country,  being

rights   accorded  exclusively  to  the   citizens   or

nationals of that foreign country, shall cease to be  a

citizen of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all these persons might have been

born  in Singapore, but they had already exercised  the

rights  exclusively  accorded  to  nationals  of   that

foreign country. As such, according to the amendment in

the  Citizenship  Ordinance, they  have  ceased  to  be

Singapore citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I heard

the  Member for Queenstown state that he consulted  the

Minister for Education on this.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary. I

thought it was the Minister for Education. That was why

I wanted clarification.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think the Minister for Education

was too duty conscious.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I just want to clarify a point

which  the Minister for Home Affairs raised, Sir. There

is  hardly any time left. He said he did not know about

the  particular case I referred to. I can  assure  him,

Sir,  that  the father of that person in question,  who

had  seen me earlier, not only went to the Ministry  to

see  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  but  also  saw  the

Minister  in his Meet-the-People sessions. And  yet  he

has the audacity to come here and say that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order! The Member for Queenstown is

using   .language  which  not  only  slithers  on   the

borderline  but  goes  over  the  borderline.  In  this

particular  context,  I ask him to  withdraw  the  word

"audacity".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw that word, Sir. He also

raised the point about the amendment in June 1960. Sir,

I  must tell you that quite a number of Assembly  back-benchers  in the P.A.P. never knew what was  happening.

There is no shame in this kind of thing because we were

never  informed.  All  these  are  legal  matters   the

implications of which were never explained  to  us.  It

was only later on that we found that that amendment was

meant   to  stop  people  from  coming  back  by  using

technicalities,  like  saying  that  these  people  now

already exercise some foreign rights. I mean, if  these

things  had  been explained to us, I am sure  we  would

have  objected to them. They hoped to catch us unawares

on technical and legal points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, just now the

Member  for Queenstown mentioned that such a case  came

up to me. I have never come across this sort of case. I

think  the  Member  for Queenstown uses  all  sorts  of

twisting stories in the Assembly. If he ever had such a

case, put it up and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>



substantiate it, but do not just say that there  was  a

case  like  that. Put it up [Interruption] and  let  us

hear it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> He said I had come across this

case. I have never come across it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But you were approached.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to

say  that  the  amendment to the Singapore  Citizenship

Ordinance was discussed among Parliamentary Secretaries

and  taken  down  to  Assemblymen. If  the  Member  for

Queenstown did not understand all this, he should  have

asked any of the Cabinet Ministers at that time. If  he

chose  to ignore all these things, it is not for me  to

help him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,115,080 for Head 54 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 55 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 55 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the post of Commissioner of Police,

which  is still being held by an expatriate officer.  I

do  not know when will a local officer be able to  hold

this post. This is a very important post as far as  the

implications of the law are concerned. Recently we came

to  know that when the law was being implemented, there

was  prejudice  and discrimination.  We  know  the  law

should  treat all people equally, regardless of  creed,

race  or  religion. But, in point of fact, we  can  see

that taxi-drivers are being oppressed. The taxi-drivers

in Singapore number some 10,000 and they are leading  a

very  difficult life. Very often when they  pick  up  a

fare,  they are prosecuted. On the other hand,  we  see

that foreign capital concerns such as the S.T.C., whose

drivers have committed the offence of overloading, have

not  been  prosecuted. So it seems  that  this  law  is

discriminating   between  local  and  foreign   capital

concerns.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this: I am not clear about the

recent  strike by the students. According to  newspaper

reports,  there were unidentified people who  assaulted

the  students  and there were also unidentified  people

who  drove a vehicle and knocked down a student. I have

not seen any police action being taken in this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time when there was a strike in a laundry

factory,  I do not know why the police went  there  and

they  were  asked to push vehicles out of the  factory.

There    is   something   very   strange   about    the

implementation of the law which -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> On a

point  of order. I believe the Member for Pasir Panjang

is moving an amendment to item (1) of subhead 1 of Head

55.  That deals with the Police Commissioner. I do  not

think that has anything to do with the buses.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member for Pasir Panjang

has  alleged that there has been discrimination in  the

application  of  the law by the police. Therefore,  the

person  who would be responsible for any discrimination

in the application of the law would be the Commissioner

of  Police  as Commissioner of Police. The  Member  has

brought  in the buses to indicate, I think, that  taxi-drivers

are  prosecuted  while  S.T.C. conductors  or

drivers are not prosecuted. Therefore, in principle, he

is  correct in raising these points under item  (1)  of

subhead   1.   It  is  the  responsibility   of   the

Commissioner of Police to see that there should  be  no

discrimination in the application of the law.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  on  this particular  Head  we  are  not

supposed to speak on any item except the responsibility

of the Commissioner of Police?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, not necessarily at all. There are

other  items which come under "Personal Emoluments".  I

beg  your pardon. Under item (1) of subhead I,  yes - the

responsibility of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>



Commissioner  of Police. But there is an  amendment  by

the Member for Queens-town on the whole of the subhead.

He  can  then,  when it is moved, touch  on  any  other

aspects  which are dealt with by the personnel  of  the

police. Have I made that clear?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> The reason why I ask is this. We

have here on this Head ten amendments. At the rate the

debate is going on during these last few days, it looks

as  though  those Members whose notices  of  amendments

under  any  particular Head come right below  will  not

have the chance to speak. A hat I am trying to say  is

this. I have an amendment. I thought I could speak on a

particular subhead 1, but I have had no chance to speak

on quite a number of occasions.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That is exactly what I have tried to

warn  Members  about. Supply time is  Opposition  time.

When I informed the House that I had allocated time,  I

did  suggest to Opposition Members that they should get

together  and  try and share the time. Apparently  they

have  not  done so. The fact that the hon.  Member  for

Geylang Serai has not filed a motion on this particular

item   which  is  giving  rise  to  a  debate  on   the

responsibility of the Commissioner of Police  does  not

prevent him from speaking on the responsibility of  the

Commissioner  of  Police,  because  the  amendment  has

already been moved. If it has not been moved, then,  of

course, he is precluded from speaking. Any other point,

Dato Abdul Hamid?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I would like to speak on the

question  of  policy in regard to the Police  Force  on

this particular Head.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> That will come under the main Head

55 - general policy. What the Member for Pasir Panjang is

doing  now  is to pin-point the responsibility  of  the

Commissioner of Police, and he is entitled to do  that.

He  alleges that there has been discrimination  in  the

application  of  the law, and that, of course,  is  the

responsibility of the Commissioner of Police.  Mr  Tee

Kim Leng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I  have said is that the Commissioner  of  Police

must   go   according   to   the   Jaw,   without   any

discrimination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allegations of

bias  in  the execution of the law have been  made  and

certain instances mentioned. The first of these is that

of  taxis.  The Member for Pasir Panjang  alleges  that

taxi-drivers have been discriminated against  and  that

the  foreign-owned  S.T.C. has  been  left  off  quite

easily. I remember I made a reply to this same question

at  the last sitting of the Assembly; that in the  case

of  the  taxi-driver,  he is in  full  control  of  his

vehicle,  and if he chooses to flout the law  and  tout

for extra passengers, then he is in for trouble. In the

case  of  buses,  according  to  the  drivers  and  the

conductors of the buses, they cannot control the number

of passengers boarding the bus. Therefore, it sounds  a

bit  unjust for the police to go after the bus  driver.

The  allegation  that we are favouring a  foreign-owned

bus  company  is  nonsense, because  the  .drivers  and

conductors  of  Chinese  bus companies  have  not  been

summoned  or prosecuted in court. Therefore,  where  is

this  discrimination  in favour  of  the  foreign-owned

S.T.C. as against the Chinese bus companies  owned  by

local capitalists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also mentions unknown persons

assaulting  students during the boycott. I think  every

Member is aware that parents were taking their children

who   wished  to  sit  for  the  examination   to   the

examination   centre  and  that  they   were   forcibly

prevented from entering the examination centre, and  in

many  instances,  there  were  scuffles  to  block  the

students. These unknown persons - being unknown I do  not

know who they were - could well be the boycotted students

themselves or could well be the parents who  wished  to

take  their children to the examination centre. If they

were  pervented physically from doing so, or  violently

from  doing  so, I say what else could  the  parent  do

other  than  force  his  way in?  If  in  the  process,

something were to happen, no one could stop it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the laundry strike, that the police were

biased  and  interfered in the  laundry  strike,  I  am

afraid  I  am  not  well aware of this  strike  in  the

laundry. But I can assure the Member for Pasir  Panjang

that in cases of trade dispute, and when the police are

required  on  the spot, they are always  there  at  the

request of the Labour Department.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Sir, in spite of the fact

that  he is an expatriate officer, the Commissioner  of

Police, is undoubtedly a wise old man. I have no  doubt

he is an efficient Commissioner of Police. But I would

like  the  Minister to take into serious  consideration

what  I have to say, because I think, from what I  have

personally witnessed, the behaviour of police personnel

at  strike spots in front of pickets has been gradually

deteriorating.  To say the least, Sir, their  behaviour

is   one  of  indecency  and  provocative.  I  ask  the

Government Front-benchers not to laugh at this, because

if  they want witnesses, I am quite prepared to line up

thousands  of  workers to testify to what  I  say.  The

Government  Members are laughing because  they  do  not

realise  the  seriousness of the situation.  Sir,  last

week   a  few  police  officers,  accompanied   by   an

inspector,  stood  in  front  of  the  Chartered   Bank

building where about 150 workers of Guthrie and Company

were  on  strike. I was told that the police  personnel

who  were  present  there made indecent  signs  to  the

workers and provoked the temper of the workers. I think

what  happened after that the Minister is  fully  aware

of. This is just one of the instances I have personally

witnessed -  plainclothes  policemen  in  front  of  the

premises  of  the  Singapore Business Houses  Employees

Union  making  obscene  signs at  union  officials  and

calling  them out for a fight. Unfortunately, I respect

the  decorum  of this Assembly, and it is not  possible

for me to show what sort of signs were made. But if the

Minister  is interested to know, Sir, I can demonstrate

to him anywhere he chooses. But, Sir, I think this is a

serious  matter. I do not blame the Minister because  I

have  no doubt he is not aware of the conduct of  every

single policeman in the force. But I hope he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>



will  give  serious consideration to what I have  said,

and at least undertake to investigate the truth of this

statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things I would like to say here, Sir,

concerns  the  economy of the State. The  Minister  for

Finance always says that he does not have enough  money

for  development projects. But I see, Sir,  the  Police

Force  is  throwing  a  lot  of  good  money  away   on

unnecessary projects.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are now on item (1) of

subhead 1 - Commissioner of Police. I have indicated  how

the debate should go. Members should say how the Police

Force as a police force has failed in its behaviour and

so on and so forth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, what I am about to say comes within

the  responsibility  of  the  Commissioner  of  Police.

Therefore, it will be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member please continue for a

bit, so that I can decide?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I have seen and I am told that plainclothes

policemen have been sent in five or six cars to  follow

Mr Lim Ching Siong all the way round the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is an honour!



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Not that Mr Lim minds it. But I just want

to  point out the irrelevance of sending five car-loads

of  policemen and wasting public money by following Mr

Lim Ching Siong around  - cars,  their  maintenance, petrol, etc, etc.  Mr  Lim

tells  me  that  if the Minister wants to  save  public

money,  he is quite prepared to give him a schedule  of

his  activities; what time he starts,  where  he  goes,

whom he meets round the clock.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can save money and tell the

Commissioner  of Police not to send five  or  six  cars

with  odd-looking  cronies inside  following  Mr  Lirn

around.  Personally, Sir, I would like to ask  my  good

friend, the Minister for Home Affairs, -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Good friend?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - to do me a favour. I have no car, Sir,

and  I  get a few chaps, following me in cars.  I  only

hope  the Minister can instruct them to give me a lift,

so that I can save my taxi fare.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Thomson  mentions his Secretary-General being  followed

by  five  car-loads of plainclothes men.  I  think  his

Secretary-General is not that important or such  a  big

fry   to  merit  five  car-loads  of  plainclothes  men

following him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the behaviour of the police at

places  of  strike has been complained of, and  in  one

instance  the  Member  for  Thomson  mentions  that   a

plainclothes  man  made  indecent  signs  to  him.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  for  one thing, if  the  man  was  in

plainclothes,  I wonder how he could know  for  certain

that  he  was  a police plainclothes man  and  not  any

criminal  element. If he believed that that man  was  a

police  in  plainclothes, then I think he  should  have

brought  it  to  the attention of the  Commissioner  of

Police  and asked him to take action, and if no  action

was  taken in spite of the fact that the allegation was

substantiated,   then  I  think  in  that   event   the

Commissioner  of  Police was biased. But  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I do not know whether the Member for Thomson  did

or  did not make a complaint and it is not possible for

me  therefore  to investigate into the  matter.  But  I

would  like to inform him that, in carrying  out  their

duties,   the   police  are  facing   more   and   more

difficulties  in  maintaining their  neutral  position,

because over the past few months the picketing - this  is

told  to  me not just by the police but also by  Labour

officials - has become more and more unruly and  violent.

The police have complained that often they have to face

all  kinds  of abuses, and that in front of members  of

the public. They have to tolerate all that because they

have  been  told again and again by me and others  that

they  should try to cool down and keep their temper  in

executing  their  duties. One thing I  would  like  the

Member  for  Thomson  to do is to co-operate  with  the

police and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>



advise  his union members that they should observe  the

rules  of  peaceful picketing as provided  for  in  the

Trade  Disputes  Ordinance. If he  could  persuade  his

union members to observe that, I am sure there will  in

fact, be no need for the police to be present at places

of  strike where picketing is going on. The police have

always been called to the scene of a strike because the

picketing there has not been peaceful. In fact, it  has

been unruly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Pasir Panjang

require  a  vote? He has heard the Member  for  Geylang

Serai.  Time  is  getting short. Does he  wish  to  add

anything further?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish

to  say a few more words. The Minister has not seen the

workers. To my knowledge, the S.T.C. conductors do  not

like  to  have more passengers in their buses.  Why  do

they  want  to  have  more  passengers?  Because  their

employers  ask  them to do so, as they  know  that  the

Government will not prosecute them. When the buses have

more passengers, the workers will have more work to do.

Moreover, pockets are liable to be picked.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Minister gave a very

long answer to the same question posed to him some time

ago. I do not think the whole matter should be reopened

in  this manner - not in this Committee of Supply. If the

hon.  Member was not satisfied with the reply given  by

the  Minister then, he ought to have filed notice of  a

motion in the matter. Any other point the Member wishes

to make?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not take up much time, Sir,I just want to

emphasise one or two points. At the present moment, the

whole Ministry is ruled by the Special Branch. In fact,

our Minister, although he sits in this Assembly, merely

takes  orders from the Director of the Special  Branch.

Whatever  the Special Branch says, goes.  As  we  know,

Sir,  the  Special Branch has been initiated,  trained,

and  orientated towards preserving colonial  interests.

Today,  the  P.A.P. is just doing exactly that.  Every.

thing which, to the colonial master in the days of  old

looked  Communist or red, similarly today is considered

red.  I  only wish our Minister would put on spectacles

which are not tinted red. Let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>



him use spectacles which are normal coloured so that he

can really see things more in their natural colours. If

they are really yellow, let them be yellow. If they are

really  red, let them be red. But do not look at things

which  are  not red and not yellow with yellow  glasses

and red glasses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Green glasses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a great waste of public

money.  Consequent on such doings, Sir, I may add  that

they ire abusing the powers of the police in indirectly

intimidating  people. I give you one example,  Sir.  As

you  know,  our Barisan paper has come out  and  a  new

advertisers have put advertisements in our  paper.  The

moment  an advertisement is put in, the Special  Branch

will send people straightaway to look the advertiser up

and  call  him in for interrogation for hours  on  end.

This, as E say, is heavily tinted with intimidation and

should  never  be done. I hope the Minister  will  look

into matters like this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown surely must have read the Constitution Order

in  Council that other than matters concerning defence,

foreign  relations and internal security,  the  elected

government as the absolute power to do what it  wishes.

In  matters of internal security, there is the Internal

Security  Council  where three  parties  are  involved.

Other  than  matters of internal security, defence  and

foreign   relations,  the  Singapore   Government   has

absolute power to do what it wants. Therefore,  to  say

that  the  Special  Branch  is  running  the  Singapore

Government  or  giving orders to the  Minister  is  all

utter  nonsense. If the Member for Queenstown can  look

at  things  in  their  proper perspective,  instead  of

looking  through  yellow glasses, I am  sure  all  this

phobia about the Special Branch will not have arisen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegation that the Special Branch has been

abusing its powers and chasing after advertisers in the

Barisan Sosialis paper has, in fact, been raised by,  I

remember, the Member for Upper Serangoon sometime  last

week in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>



C.P.A.  Room. I told him that if he would make a formal

complaint  and  if  after proper investigation  it  was

found  correct, then I assured him that something would

be done. But till today I have not got his complaint in

writing   and,  therefore,  to  make  all  these   wild

allegations without any evidence, I think,  is  wasting

the  time  of this House and not befitting the Chairman

of a political Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  only give a very short reply to what the Minister

for Home Affairs has said. The other day the Member for

Upper  Serangoon  told  the Minister  about  a  certain

police  officer  visiting an advertiser  in  our  Party

organ. The Minister did not give any reply when he  was

asked to give an assurance in this matter.

from me to guarantee all kinds of things which I do not

know. The complaint has not been made and I do not know

exactly what sort of guarantee he wants.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 55 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 54.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a vote of $42,000 a year for 14

temporary   constables  who  are,  in  fact,   security

officers for Ministers. It has been reported to me that

the  people  who are now working as temporary  officers

were members of the P.A.P. and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>



that  they  were taken on to do this job just  to  give

protection to the Ministers from the masses  whom  they

claim  love them so much, so much so that they have  to

be protected from the love of the masses!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have discovered for myself that these so-called temporary constables who are security officers

for  Ministers  are even made to become chauffeurs  for

Ministers.  If this is the way to get public  funds  to

pay  for  one's  personal  amenities,  I  think  it  is

definitely  wrong. Do all Ministers require bodyguards?

If  their claim that they are the beloved of the masses

is  accepted, then the masses will know how to  protect

them.  Then  the Ministers do not have to be  protected

from the masses whom they claim love them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I think the same

subject  has  been raised in connection with  the  1960

Estimates. If I remember correctly, the Prime  Minister

did give quite a detailed explanation why we need these

temporary  constables for the Ministers. I  think  they

are  all  members of the P.A.P. with the  exception  of

one, and we selected them because of this fact. In  the

course  of our duties and activities, we have to attend

all  kinds  of  meetings - apart from  public  meetings,

there  are  Party meetings - and naturally we would  like

somebody  on  whom we can rely. In fact,  it  would  be

embarrassing  when  attending Party  meetings  for  the

regular police officers to be present - both for us  and

for  the  Police  Force - because they have  to  maintain

their neutrality; and II they are found attending Party

meetings  with the Ministers, all kinds of  allegations

may  be  made.  This  is very much  a  personal  matter

because  the  security officer following  the  Minister

must  have his confidence. There is no point in  having

one who is completely unknown to the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would like to put it to a vote,

Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 55 be

reduced by $100*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the names of Inche Mohamed Ali bin

Alwi and Inche Ahmad Jabri bin Mohammad Akib.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say how satisfied I am with the

general  efficiency and devotion to duty of the  Police

Force. Although the Barisan Sosialis do not like  them,

I say they are good and really first-class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to note that more and more of our

Chinese youth are serving the force. There was  a  time

when   serving  in  the  Police  Force  was   something

derogatory. This change of mind is all to the good  and

it  will be of great benefit to the people as a  whole.

However, the  point I am trying to make  is  that  the

backbone of the Police Force are still the Malays.  The

N.C.O.s and the the Other Ranks are mostly Malays.  Yet

the  proportion of Malay officers is relatively  small.

This has been the case for some time now. But with more

and  more  Malays  coming out of secondary  schools,  I

think  it  will be possible for Government  to  recruit

more of them for the officer class of the Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to touch upon is the

services of our Gurkha Police. I am not saying they are

not  a  useful unit. They are first-class policemen  in

that  they  can settle any problem which  requires  the

element  of force. But, Mr Speaker, I think they  have

passed their usefulness in the set-up we have today. Is

it  necessary  for  us  to use foreign  mercenaries  to

police our population? The time has now come for us  to

think again. Singapore is a self-governing State and  I

think  we  should  do  away with whatever  vestiges  of

colonialism that may remain. I am positive  that  given

the chance our policemen can undertake any of the tasks

that  are  now assigned to the Gurkhas. As a matter  of

fact,  we  are  now spending nearly $1 million  on  the

Unit, employing no less than 331 persons.  This  money

could well spent in employing local men.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise concerns the

licensing  of firearms and, in particular, pistols  and

revolvers. I really do not understand what Government's

policy is on this subject. I understand from Government

sources that licenses are issued to those whose  lives,

in  the opinion of the police, are in danger. I have  a

personal interest in this, Sir,I happen to have one of

those revolvers, hut last year I got a letter from  the

police asking me whether it was still necessary for  me

to  retain my revolver - mind you, Mr Speaker,  only

one.  I  carry an automatic not because I fear that  at

any time my life is in danger but because the work I do

and the responsibilities I have to carry out require me

to  meet  any  possible eventuality at any given  time.

Anyway,  the long and short of it was that the revolver

was  confiscated. Later on, I heard rumours from a very

reliable  source that the police withdrew  my  revolver

because  they  were afraid I might  run  amok  in  this

Assembly. May I assure the Minister that I have no such

intention? Anyway, Sir, what I am trying to say is that

the  Government is very discriminating in the issue  of

licences  to people, though sometimes I do meet  people

in the course of my work who carry revolvers and who, I

think  are  not really in danger of their lives.  There

was  a particular case where the revolver of a managing

director  of a firm was withdrawn, and it was given  to

the  manager  of  the  firm, and yet  the  manager  was

nothing but an ordinary employee. But, Sir, it is  mood

to  learn  that although my revolver was withdrawn  the

revolver  of  the leader of the Alliance has  not  been

withdrawn.  I do not know whether his life is  in  more

danger than mine is. At the same time, I understand the

revolvers  of all the Ministers have not been withdrawn

either. Probably their lives are in danger.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member

for Geylang Serai thinks his life is in danger after  a

peaceful period of more than a year, and if he  submits

an application, we will consider it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a number of points have been raised

about  the  police. I am glad it is  noticed  that  the

efficiency of the police has increased in general,  and

1  am  sure the rank and file of the Police Force will

appreciate that remark as well as I do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true there are few Malay officers in the Police

Force.  I  remember I also touched on this  point  last

time.  I said it had been like that for many years.  We

are  doing  out  best to increase the number  of  Malay

officers.  For the information of the Member concerned,

since we assumed office in 1959 to date, 15 Malay  rank

and  file  have  been promoted to the  Inspectorate,  2

Malays have been promoted to the rank of A.S.P. -

1962  there is a reduction of $20,000 from last  year's

estimate of $184,800. I would like to ask the Minister

why  this  reduction  is considered  necessary.  Is  it

because  he  anticipates  that  there  would  be   less

offenders - it is a good sign if there are  going  to  be

less offenders - or is it because the type of rations  is

changed thereby resulting in a reduction in the cost of

feeding the offenders?

approximately 900 in 1960 to approximately 700 in 1961.

Although  the prison population fluctuates in  response

to  the  numbers  of  convictions and  detentions,  the

Changi  Prison population is expected to drop  in  1962

because of the expanding facilities at Pulau Senang  to

accommodate  criminal law detainees  formerly  held  in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (11) is the creation of two Administrative

Assistants  to take over the two Assistant  Secretaries

who  are  already in the Establishment. But then,  Sir,

the  amount provided for in the 1962 Budget  is  $8,160

which   is   just   sufficient  to  provide   for   one

Administrative Assistant, and not two. $8,160 works out

at  $680 a month, which is the initial salary  of  the

scale. Can the Minister please explain whether he wants

two  Administrative Assistants or whether he  considers

that only one Administrative Assistant is required?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this actually is

part  of  the exercise as previously explained  by  the

Minister  for  Finance. Arising out of  Malayanisation,

there was too large a gap between the top officers  and

those  underneath.  Therefore,  the  exercise  in   the

Ministry  of  Education is really in  respect  of  full

provisions - those of Principal Staff Officer,  Principal

Assistant Secretary, Assistant Secretary (A),  (B)  and

(C). Although there is one post in which there has been

no  change  in the provision of Grade G officer,  there

has been regrading and downgrading of the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>



four  posts.  The Grade G post has been  reduced  to  a

timescale  for  the Principal Assistant Secretary,  the

Assistant Secretary (Class 3 post) has been reduced  to

a  timescale  Assistant Secretary post,  the  Assistant

Secretary post to an Administrative Assistant post. Two

posts  o Assistant Secretary were reduced to two  posts

of  Administrative Assistant. In all, there has been  a

saving of $11,880 per annum.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Minister has not replied

to my simple question. What he has endeavoured to do is

to  reply to questions which I have not asked  - in  the

other amendments which I did not think it was necessary

to move, because there had been an explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite understand the two Assistant Secretaries have

now been regraded as two Administrative Assistants. But

what  the vote provides for is only for one. I ask  the

Minister whether he wants two or one. That is all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I do not know whether the Member

for  Cairnhill is eating his own tail or whether  I  am

doing  it on his behalf. What I say is this: that there

are  five officers involved in this exercise. The  same

five officers are holding posts after regrading. So the

two Administrative Assistants have become two Assistant

Secretaries.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Two Assistant Secretaries have

become  two Administrative Assistants. If the  Minister

only knows what he is talking about! What the vote asks

me  that Inspectors of Schools are inclined to go  to

schools like secret police purely for the purpose  of

snooping  around and finding out whether the teachers

are  doing  their  work properly,  whether  they  are

sleeping, whether they have white clean shirts on, or

whether  they have socks on their feet,  what  colour

their  socks  are,  etc, etc.  Sir,  I  am  sure  the

Minister  will  not quarrel with me on the  functions

the Inspectors of Schools are expected to perform.  I

am not suggesting for one moment that we must abolish

the posts of Inspectors of Schools. We all agree they

are  important personnel in our education system.  We

ought to have inspectors and they ought to be doing a

very  important job. But if they develop  the  mental

attitude  that  they are the secret  police,  then  I

think  they defeat the purpose for which we ought  to

have  Inspectors of Schools. Sir, teachers in schools

face numerous problems in the solution of which their

own  principals  are  not able  to  assist.  When  an

Inspector comes around, naturally the teacher expects

some  assistance  to  help them to  carry  out  their

teaching  in  a much more efficient and  satisfactory

way.  It  is  only  natural  that  the  teachers  get

disgusted,   depressed,  or   disappointed   if   the

Inspectors  who  go  round the  schools, instead  of

trying  to  assist the teachers, behave,  as  I  have

said, like secret police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Education

whether  it is the policy of the Government  to  have

Inspectors  who  go round and help  the  teachers  in

their application of teaching methods, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>



whether  it is the purpose of the Government to  have

Inspectors  of  Schools purely  for  the  purpose  of

snooping  around schools to see whether the  teachers

have  white  shirts or black shirts or red  socks  or

blue socks, or whatever it is.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one gathers

from   the  Member  for  Thomson  that  he  considers

Inspectors  of Schools would now appear  to  be  like

police  inspectors - worse still,  as  members  of  the

secret  police!  We  have  for  some  days  now  been

listening  to  Members of Barisan  Sosialis  speaking

vehemently on the Special Branch, their fear  of  the

Internal  Security Council, and so on and  so  forth.

This is definitely a psychological complex of Members

of  the Barisan Sosialis. They are so afraid even  of

their   own  shadows  that  they  think  someone   is

shadowing  them.  I  am sure when the  Inspectors  of

Schools  in  my  Ministry read  this  report  in  the

newspapers  tomorrow, they will be  laughing  because

the poor Member for Thomson regards them as no better

than secret police, and making the lives of both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>



principals  and teachers of schools miserable.  Such  a

situation  could not possibly arise under  the  present

Government.  But perhaps there should be a  M15  and  a

N.K.V.D. should  the Barisan Sosialis  form  the  next

Government, if they think they could form one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, refer very briefly to the Report of the

Sreenivasan  Commission  of  Inquiry  into   Government

Recurrent  Expenditure.  It  has  not  been  officially

published,  but  I have been supplied with  the  second

interim  Report which covers the Ministry of Education.

I  had occasion to refer to this in another instance at

a   radio   forum.  This  Commission  of  Inquiry   had

investigated,  rather  in detail,  the  duties  of  the

various departments or division , of my Ministry.  They

did  indicate  under paragraph 154 that  Inspectors  of

Schools carry out routine inspection of every teacher's

work  twice a year, and also inspect the administration

of  schools.  That is their function.  They  should  be

going there to assist the principals and, if necessary,

the teachers, if they are in difficulty. It is possible

that  the  human factor might creep in where  a  little

officious  Inspector of School might  overdo  things  a

little.  But that is to be  expected now and  again  and

not to be  taken where the exception becomes the rule. I

can  assure the Member for Thomson that, as  far  as  I

know,  Inspectors  of Schools have  been  carrying  out

their  duties to the best of their ability. But  should

there  be occasions where individuals may have exceeded

these  powers. I think the teacher or the principal  is

at  liberty  to lodge a complaint. This could  then  be

investigated  and the matter put right. But  I  do  not

think it could be said that our schools are now working

in  an  atmosphere  of  fear. Here  again,  unless  the

teachers  themselves or principals are  too  active  in

politics, they have nothing to fear at all.

assure the Minister again. Sir, that I have no fear  of

inspectors,  be  they  school  inspectors   or   police

inspectors.

adopted  a  policy  of equality of  treatment  for  all

schools,   naturally  the  Chinese  school  heads   are

wondering  why  they do not have super-scale  posts  in

their  stream. After a lot of discussions, the Minister

said he would think about it when the right time arose.

The  right  time would be when the number of Government

Chinese schools would be  something like 80 per cent  of

the  total.  I suggest, Sir, that in view of  the  fact

that  there  is  now a common secondary  and  a  common

higher secondary examination, perhaps it is about  time

that the suggestion be considered to remove any feeling

that there has been discrimination.

these   three  superscale  posts  form  part  of   the

say  last year the matter would be considered.  I  wish

to  state  now that the Ministry is currently reviewing

the  Singapore  Education Service  so  as  to  make  it

say  that all teachers are entitled to apply for vacant

principalship   of  schools.  I  think  generally   the

vacancies are circularised. The teachers send in  their

applications  which  would then  be  forwarded  to  the

Public  Service Commission. The P.S.C. would then  call

them   up   for   interview  and  make  the   necessary

Last  year I brought up the question of the recognition

of  American  University degrees if  the  holders  were

found to be capable of teaching in our schools. We were

told   then   that   the  matter  was  actively   under

consideration, and a decision would be made. I  believe

so far no decision has been made. Many of these holders

of  American University degrees who have been  teaching

for  many years naturally are feeling unhappy about it.

Another  thing is that although their graduate  status

has  not been recognised as regards pay, they are  down

on  the staff list as recognised graduates. So if  they

are  recognised  as  graduates  on  the  same  staffing

formula, they would naturally assume that they would be

recognised  as  such when it comes to the consideration

of pay.

this  matter.  The Foreign Qualifications  Regulations,

1960 were published on 30th December, 1960. The Foreign

Qualifications   Committee  of   the   Public   Service

Commission  was established in May 1961. All  graduates

with  hitherto  unrecognized degrees  were  advised  to

apply for an assessment of their qualifications.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, we can see in the Budget that there will  be

284   new   posts   for  graduates   of   foreign

universities. I would like the Minister to answer

me  on  the  question  of  graduates  of  Nanyang

University.  I  want to know whether  the  second

batch  of Nanyang University graduates have  been

admitted to the Government education service.  As

far  as  I  know,  the  first  batch  of  Nanyang

University graduates have been accepted in  quite

a  great  number. This year, the second batch  of

Nanyang  University graduates have been  teaching

in   Government  or  aided  schools.  The  Public

Service  Commission interviewed them on the  15th

of  August  this year. But even when the  schools

were  about to close for the year, they  had  not

received any appointments from the Government. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>



they  are not sure whether they will be  allowed

to  continue teaching next year. The Ministry of

Education  has not made this clear to them  even

before  the  schools  closed.  The  Ministry  of

Education  must  give the graduates  of  Nanyang

University ample time. If it does not allow them

to  continue  teaching  next  year,  then  ample

notice must be given to them, so that they  will

have  enough  time to look for other employment,

instead  of having to worry about news from  the

Ministry  of  Education  whether  they  will  be

allowed  to  continue teaching next year.  So  I

would  like  the Minister concerned to  let  the

House  know  how  many of the  second  batch  of

graduates of Nanyang University have been  engaged  by the Minister and how many of them are  in

the  200-odd jobs enumerated in this  Budget.  I

want  to  draw the Minister's attention  to  the

fact  that  the  third  batch  of  graduates  of

Nanyang University will be coming out very soon.

I  want to find out from him whether this  third

batch   will   be   taken  into  Government   or

Government-aided schools next year, and  if  so,

how many.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has

requested graduates of Nanyang University

teaching in Government and aided schools to

undergo training in the T.T.C. for one year.

There are many Nanyang University graduates who

have approached me personally saying that what

they have learnt at Nanyang University is more in

quantity and better in quality than what they can

learn in the T.T.C. Many of these graduates are

required to undergo training in the T.T.C. for

the sake of physical education, such as playing

basketball and other games. So I appeal to the

Government to consider the position of the

Nanyang University graduates and recognise the

fact that they have learnt enough in the Univer

sity to meet classroom requirements. If the

Government, from the point of view of education,

says that Nanyang University graduates must be

given more time to learn teaching methods so that

the standard of education will be raised

gradually, I will say that the Ministry of

Education's requirement that Nanyang University

graduates should undergo training in the T.T.C.

will help to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>



enhance  the standard of education. Therefore,  I

ask  the Minister concerned to consider that  the

time  of these graduates should be spent  on  the

improvement  of teaching methods and that  better

measures   should  be  adopted  to  rectify   the

unnecessary  so-called training  in  the  T.T.C.,

which is merely a waste of time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang  could  have  spared

himself  a  long speech when he asked  about  the

destiny of the second batch of Nanyang University

graduates  who  are waiting for  confirmation  of

their appointments. It is true it took some  time

for  the  Public Service Commission to  interview

almost  100 graduates of Nanyang University  from

the  second  batch before coming to  a  decision,

which was passed on to the Ministry of Education,

and  all  those who have been considered suitable

after  security  clearance have been  advised  of

their appointments within the last week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the third batch of Nanyang University

graduates who are expected

to  graduate round about Christmas, I think there

will  be  an advertisement within a week  calling

for  applications to be considered by the  Public

Service  Commission  whether  they  wish  to   be

employed  as  teachers in Government  schools  or

Government-aided schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point mentioned by the Member for Choa

Chu  Kang  is one in which he claims to speak  on

behalf of those graduates from Nanyang University

who   are  now  under-going  a  special  one-year

inservice  course  of training at  the  Teachers'

Training  College.  This  course  has  not   been

instituted    purely   for   Nanyang   University

graduates, but also for the University of  Malaya

graduates.  It is an emergency scheme  purely  to

put graduates into our secondary schools, because

we  have  greatly expanded the enrolment  in  our

secondary  schools. The graduate, be  he  or  she

coming  from the University of Malaya or  Nanyang

University, is not compelled to take up this one-year  in-service course of training at all.  That

being so, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>



salary scale applicable to what we could call  an

untrained  graduate will be $355 to a maximum  of

$655.  But  if the graduate decides to take  this

one-year inservice course to give him or her  professional  training in the art  of  teaching  and

enable  him  or her to carry the message  to  the

children,  the  salary scale after completion  of

this one-year course will be $385 to $930. So  it

is  up  to the graduate himself to decide whether

he  or  she would prefer to be an untrained graduate  teaching  in  our schools or  be  a  trained

graduate  to  qualify for a more  attractive  and

higher salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think another question asked by the Member for

Choa  Chu Kang is to indicate the probable number

of   Nanyang  University  graduates  who  may  be

employed for next year in the 1962 Estimates.  We

have provided for the appointment of 50 graduates

from   Nanyang  University  for  our   Government

Chinese secondary schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Can the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I merely wish to get an explanation

from   the   Minister  for  Education  concerning

religious teachers in Malay schools. I  think  we

discussed  this matter last year.  There  is  not

much  change. The salary scale is just the  same.

There  is  no  change in their scale as  compared

with  the untrained teachers' salary scale  which

we have discussed today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, how many of the new

posts  will  be allocated to women and  how  many

will  be  allocated to men? As to the methods  of

recruiting  for these posts, are they limited  to

those  who have graduated from the Muslim College

at Klang?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question I wish to ask the Minister for

Education  is whether an opportunity  to  perform

Friday  prayers  is  given to  students  who  are

attending  schools - whether  Malay  schools   or

English schools, particularly English schools.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I am told that the teachers at present  are

insufficient in number, particularly with  regard

to   the  Southern  Islands  where  there  is  no

opportunity for the children to receive religious

education.  If  there are ample opportunities  to

receive  religious  education  on  the  Singapore

mainland,  I  feel that one teacher  of  religion

should be attached to each school in the Southern

Islands.  The position today is that one  teacher

visits  all the schools in the Southern  Islands.

This is very inadequate indeed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

first answer the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>



the Southern Islands regarding the inadequacy of

teachers of religion in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously indicated that Singapore being

a   secular  State,  we  try  to  discourage  the

teaching of religion in schools, but taking  note

of  the  special position of the  Malays  in  our

Constitution and in view of the fact that in  the

past one period a week has been set aside for the

teaching of the Muslim religion in Malay schools,

we have been maintaining that. Therefore, to have

just  one period a week in Malay Schools for  the

teaching  of  religion, we  are  making  adequate

provision for teachers of religion in the schools

now existing in Singapore. For those who wish  to

have  more religious teaching in Islam,  we  feel

the  existence of the religious schools known  as

Sekolah  Rakyat  could be made  use  of.  If  the

students are attending the morning session,  they

can  attend Sekolah Rakyat in the afternoon,  and

vice versa. That is why in providing teachers  of

religion  for regular Malay schools, it  will  be

necessary  for them to move around  to  teach  in

various schools. It will not be possible to  have

one teacher of religion per school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the comments made by the Member for

Kampong Kembangan that the salary scale of  these

teachers  of religion is on the low  side,  I  am

afraid that is due to the fact that, on the whole

those  appointed have had rather low  educational

qualifications. The minimum qualification  for  a

teacher  of  religion  was Standard  VII  of  the

Aljunied Arabic School, and many other applicants

have  rather low qualifications from  either  the

Malay  or English schools. That is why the salary

scale  is only $110-205. I do not think there  is

any discrimination as regards the appointment  of

teachers of religion according to sex. Of the  18

now in service, 3 are women and the rest are men.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the recruitment policy, of those

already  in  employment,  one  holds  the   Lower

Certificate of the Muslim

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>



College.  It is the intention of the Ministry  to

appoint a graduate from the Muslim College with a

Higher  Certificate  to  look  after  all   these

teachers of religion and to try to integrate  and

improve  the  standard of teaching. That  recruitment will follow next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I have already stated that we have at

least  one period for the teaching of the  Muslim

religion  in  Malay  schools,  and  children  are

allowed time off for their prayers in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In English schools?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That I think is a matter

students  to  perform their  Friday  prayers.  We

should  be  equally proud of this. So I  wish  to

receive  an assurance from the Minister  in  this

Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I thought I had given an

Sir,  I have to touch on items (65)*, (66)+,  and

(67)++  of which notices of amendments have  been

given in my name.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Amendment (22) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (65) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Amendment (23), also standing in the names of Mr S. T. Bani and Dr Thio Chan Bee, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (66) of subhead 1.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;++ Amendment (24) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (67) of subhead 1.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every school, duties have to be performed by

watchmen,  school servants, messengers,  etc.  In

some  of  the  schools the posts  of  caretakers,

watchmen, school servants and messengers have not

been filled. If, say, there is only one messenger

in  a school, he has to perform the duties of the

caretaker and watchman although all these  duties

cannot be properly undertaken by one man. The job

of  a  messenger  is to despatch letters,  and  a

caretaker  looks after the school  and  keeps  it

clean. It is not fair that one man should do  all

these  jobs  and  get no extra  material  benefit

other  than  his own salary. So I would  like  to

draw  the attention of the Ministry to the  lower

paid  staff  of  schools who have been  asked  to

shoulder many responsibilities. I am told that in

certain  schools children are forced to open  the

doors in order to help their parents. I say  that

the responsibilities entrusted to them are many.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply

to  the  Member  for  the Southern  Islands,  the

trouble is that the schools are expanding so fast

that  sometimes  we  cannot  catch  up  with  the

appointment  of  the employees who  go  with  the

schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is actually a formula for the staffing of

schools - for what we call the non-teaching  staff.

It  is rather detailed and I do not think I would

like  to read it, but I will give a reply. It  is

roughly like this. I will just quote one  or  two

parts  of  it.  If  it is a 48-classroom  primary

school,  there  should  be  one  watchman,  eight

servants and one office boy, and so on, until  if

there are only seven classrooms there will be one

watchman, one servant and one office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>



boy.  So  it  is  very likely that  the  man  who

probably  complained  to  the  Member   for   the

Southern  Islands must belong to the category  in

which the office boy has to do more work than the

normal  office boy of a school with a full comple

ment  of servants. We have endeavoured to get  as

much staff as we can. In fact, I will be able  to

answer  more fully when we come to item  (66)  on

the  subject  of  school servants.  I  think  the

Member  for  Southern Islands practically  ranged

over these items.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, he did indeed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> So if I may carry on on items

(64)  to  (66). We are providing as many  as  158

school servants for nine new secondary and 23 new

primary  schools. We are endeavouring  to  get  a

full  complement of staff to go with each school,

but  sometimes  there are delays in  recruitment.

This   matter   was  discussed  previously.   The

recruitment  for  Division IV jobs  is  from  the

Works Brigade and from the Employment Exchange in

the ratio of 50:50. So at times there is a bit of

a  time-lag between appointing staff and  posting

them to man the respective schools.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The debate is ranging over items

(64) to (67).



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in some of

the  larger schools, the servants have to  be  on

duty   for  the  morning,  afternoon  and   night

sessions. I wonder whether the Minister will  con

sider providing some incentive by giving the head

servant a Grade I position, his assistant a Grade

II  position,  and so on, because where  a  large

staff  of school servants are employed,  I  think

the  senior ones deserve to have an incentive for

their additional responsibilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think it would be necessary

to  refer to the Minister for Finance, who is not

here,  on  Establishment procedure. I am  all  in

favour of it. But I want to say that those who do

overtime  are paid overtime wages.  So  there  is

compensation and they are not just asked to  work

from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>



They  are paid the regular rate for regular work

and  anything in excess is either  paid  by  the

Ministry of Education

or  by the Adult Education Board if a particular

school  is  being  used as a  centre  for  night

classes.

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> I withdraw my amendment in

respect of item (64).

<br><br>6.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Chan Sun Wing -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of  item  (110)  of

subhead 1.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon):</b> I am not

moving   my   amendment  on  item   (110) .   (In

Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 7.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to ask the Minister for

Education  how  it  is that  teachers  in  aided

schools in the rural areas are not able to claim

transport and travelling allowances. At  present

all Government school teachers can get transport

allowances.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There appears to be

injustice  if presented in the way  the  Member

for Upper Serangoon has done. But, on analysis,

I  think  it appears reasonable that Government

school  teachers, irrespective of whether  they

are  in  English schools or Chinese  Government

schools - I think it should be made clear that it

is  not something meant only for English school

teachers  but  also  for  those  in  Government

schools  who are posted to the rural  areas - are

eligible to some form of compensation for  tran

sport. Why this does not apply to aided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>



school  teachers  can,  I think,  be  arrived  as

follows: a Government school teacher is liable to

be  transferred and posted to .any school and  is

expected  to assume duty in that school,  whether

it  is  10 miles from the city or whether  it  is

right in front of his house. In other words,  the

teacher has no choice in the matter. But  in  the

case of an aided school teacher, all he has to do

is  to  go  up to a principal of an aided  school

and,  if  the Committee of Management  wishes  to

employ  him,  he  can  be  employed  subject   to

approval  by the Ministry of Education. In  other

words,  the choice of the school is left  to  the

particular  teacher.  In  the  other  case  of  a

Government school teacher, there is no choice  in

the matter. If he is appointed and is asked to go

to  Pulau Brani, he goes to Pulau Brani. Or if he

is  posted to Sembawang or Seletar, he goes there

unless  he can give good reasons why he could  be

missed  and  somebody else transferred.  That,  I

think,  is  the  reason  why  the  Treasury   has

allocated  a  small provision to  assist  certain

teachers  who  are  posted to  rural  schools  in

Government service.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

explanation given, may I withdraw the amendment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Dr Lee Siew Choh -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 8.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee is not here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 22.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, this item of expenditure

regarding  bursaries to school  children  in  the

Islands will only be given to students in English

and Malay schools to enable them to come to Singa

pore  to  study. I would like to ask the Minister

to  explain how it is that this aid is not  given

to  students  who  come  to  Singapore  to  study

Chinese.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

provision is to meet the educational expenses  of

children living in the Islands where there are no

secondary or primary schools in the medium of the

parents'  choice. There has been a provision  for

14  bursaries valued at $600 per annum. They have

been  awarded to children from the Islands, seven

of  whom  are in the Malay stream, seven  in  the

English  stream. Of this, eight are Malays,  five

Chinese and one Indian.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in 1962 we can bear in mind the

possibility  of making similar awards  for  those

who  wish  to go to Chinese secondary or  primary

schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am satisfied

* The same amendment also stood in the name of

Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have moved this amendment with this aim in

view,  i.e., in reading the Budget for next year,

I  have  not  come  across any  item  on  Nanyang

University. A few weeks ago I heard the  Minister

for  Education, say that he hoped  to  solve  the

Nanyang  University problem early  next  year  or

this  year. On the one hand, the Government  says

it  wants  to  solve the Nanyang University  question,  but,  on  the  other  hand,  there  is  no

provision made for Nanyang University in  respect

of  its  expenditure.  So  I  want  the  Minister

concerned to explain.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know

this  question of aid to Nanyang University is  a

sore  point  with  many  people,  especially  the

Barisan   Sosialis.  I  am  sure  those   of   us

interested  in  education do  not  like  this  to

become  a political issue. The sooner the  Government  can  settle it with the proper authorities,

the happier the people of Singapore will be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is rather odd, Mr

Speaker,  that  we  are  talking  of  subhead  27

"Contribution to University of

Singapore" when the subject turns round to

Nanyang University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true this is a very touchy subject

and,  therefore, it is best to approach it in  an

objective manner. In the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech, we have indicated that the Government  is

always  prepared  to get down to negotiations  to

settle  the Nanyang University question. We  have

hopes it will be settled in the coming year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question of drawing up the Estimates,

say, for 1962. All the bookwork really has to  be

done during the months of January, February,  and

March,  1961. If it is possible to settle  it  to

the  satisfaction of all concerned, all  that  is

needed   really   is  to  ask   for   an   A.S.V.

(Application for Supplementary Vote).  When  that

comes,  I  hope  Members of the  Opposition  will

support the Government in its application.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

after  hearing  the  explanation  given  by   the

Minister  for Education, it seems to me that,  if

there  is  complexity in framing the Budget,  the

simplest  thing is to have a $10 token  vote  for

the item "Contribution to Nanyang University".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, indeed that could have been  done,

but  let us imagine the effect of an item of  $10

against  Nanyang University. There  would  be  an

uproar from Chinese educational circles, and  the

Barisan Sosialis would then proclaim that that is

the  value  of the P.A.P. Government's  faith  in

Nanyang University.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

from the way the notation is made under Head  57,

"Contribution  to University of  Singapore",  the

Government is already fore-stalling the  Bill  to

be  passed  by  the Assembly in the near  future,

because  there is no such institution, University

of  Singapore, today. May I say something on  the

University of Singapore? The University of Malaya

now functions as two divisions, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Division  and the  Division  in  Kuala

Lumpur.  I myself personally regret that  it  has

become necessary to split the University in  this

way.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the University of

Singapore Bill will be debated shortly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On Saturday.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Therefore, I do not think the

Member is entitled to anticipate that Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> The other question I want to ask the

Minister is this. I do not want to embarrass  the

Government,  but I know it is anxious  to  settle

the  problem of Nanyang University. I do not know

where   the  points  of  difference  are  between

Nanyang  University  and the  Government.  I  was

hoping  that possibly the Member who  had  raised

this  question would point out to the House where

the  differences were and where the guilt if  any

lay  with the Government. I personally would like

to know from the Minister, if the Minister thinks

it  is  politic,  to  say why  it  has  not  been

possible  to come to some agreement with  Nanyang

University.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think I can answer the

Member for Farrer Park about this question of the

University of Singapore. It is on the Order Paper

since  the  29th November, and because of  merger

and this Budget, it has been postponed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards discussions with the Nanyang

University authorities, we have had this  Liaison

Committee  comprising  representatives  from  the

Government    and    the    Nanyang    University

authorities. It held some meetings in  1960,  but

unfortunately they did not come to fruition. I do

not  think any guilt really is to be attached  to

either party.

<br><br>6.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the matter could gradually be resolved with

less  hot  air and more discussions  in  a  quiet

atmosphere, we are confident this matter  can  be

resolved.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 57 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 28.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same amendment also stood in the names  of

Mr Chan Sun Wing and Dr Thio Chan Bee.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two points on which I would speak

on this item. I understand that a class for adult

education  starts with about 30 or 40 people.  It

then  ends  up with two, or three, but  with  the

same  number of teachers and the same  amount  of

expenses  incurred. I wonder whether the Minister

could  tell us why this is so, and if it  is  so,

whether  it would not be better just to eliminate

such  classes and thereby the Government and  the

public would not be called upon to waste so  much

money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I want to ask the Minister

is   this.  Could  he  tell  me  how  many  adult

education  classes there are held  in  the  Malay

language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the amount under this item for last year  is

$500,000.  It  has  been increased  to  about  $1

million  for this year. However, the  results  of

adult  education this year are not too good.  The

situation  in the classes is similar to  that  in

the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government.  The  number  of

students  has been misrepresented.  We  have  not

heard  the  Adult Education Council  declare  how

many students there are in these classes. I would

like  to  know  why this vote has been  increased

from $500,000 to the present amount.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Adult  Education  Council was abolished  and  the

Government  took  it over, it  was  assumed  that

there  would be a great deal of improvement.  But

judging  from  the  results of what  happened  in

1960,  the enrolment in the classes has  dropped.

The  enrolment for 1959 was 15,942.  In  November

1960 the figure was 12,584. In 1959 the amount of

fees  collected for the first ten months came  to

$136,000;   whereas  in  1960,   the   Government

collected  only  $86,773.  We  wonder  why  there

should  now be a request to double the amount  of

contribution from half a million dollars to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>



over  a  million dollars. I would suggest,  Sir,

that  if the Chairman of the Board were  a  non-political figure, then perhaps there would be no

danger of the Adult Education Council becoming a

sort  of  battle-ground for the P.A.P. and  the

Barisan Sosialis, as in the case of the People's

Association    and   community   centres.    The

suggestion, Sir, is that if we want  to  prevent

this  important  field  of educational  activity

from  developing into another battle field,  the

Members of the Board and the Chairman should  be

non-political.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I would like, first of all,

Sir,  to  answer  the Member for Geylang  Serai,

when   he  indicated  that  classes  are   being

conducted  with  two or three  pupils.  I  would

appreciate it if he could give me the  names  of

the   centres   concerned,  because   it   would

certainly be wasteful for such a centre to carry

on.  I  do know that in certain centres we might

carry on with anything from 12 to 15 pupils. But

those  are special cases. As a whole,  we  would

like  to  have  classes of up to  25  pupils.  I

regret I am not in a position to tell the Member

for Geylang Serai the number of classes in which

Malay  is  being  taught. But I  will  certainly

supply him with this information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Upper Serangoon, the

Member  for  Tanglin  and also  the  Member  for

Geylang Serai, when they expressed concern  over

the increase in the vote for the Adult Education

Board by a hundred per cent. May I say that  the

Adult  Education  Board is not  just  purely  to

provide    classes   in   order   to   eradicate

illiteracy, which is its chief aim? It has  gone

further  by providing what are known as  further

education  classes.  The  third  aim,  which  is

something  very  unusual, is  the  provision  of

secondary  education  for  adults  to   complete

either  the Cambridge School Certificate Examina

tion or the Chinese Government Secondary IV  and

Senior Middle III Examinations. I think this  is

not to be found anywhere in South-East Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin brought up certain

figures  about  revenue. He mentioned  the  small

sums for 1959 and 1960. The 1962 Budget submitted

by  the  Adult  Education Board  is  as  follows:

Revenue   from   fees  for  basic  education   is

estimated at $108,000. Tuition fees, registration

fees  and others would come to $810,000. But  the

expenditure for the classes is expected to amount

to  $1.8 million. This is because it is no longer

possible   to  get  teachers  to  give  voluntary

service  for  night  classes.  At  one  stage  in

1959/60,  we  were able to reduce the  cost,  but

since  then  we  have had to pay  teachers  at  a

higher  rate  in  order  to  teach  classes   for

secondary education, and, therefore, the cost  of

providing  teachers  has been  brought  up  to  a

rather high level. That is why it is necessary to

ask  for  an increased vote from half  a  million

dollars for this year to a little over $1 million

for next year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

Minister   please  say  whether   the   following

gentlemen are still members of the Board? Mr Lim

Ching  Siong represented the Trade Union Congress

on  the  Board  in 1960. Mr Jek Yuen  Thong  was

Deputy  Chairman and Mr Devan Nair was Chairman.

In  view of the rivalry going on now between  the

P.A.P. and  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  could   the

Minister assure the House that there would not be

trouble with that kind of composition?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> When the Trade Union Congress

was  dissolved, the membership of Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong and Inche Mohd. Ariff bin Suradi, who  were

supposed  to  represent the T.U.C., automatically

lapsed. So these two gentlemen

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- one of whom is my colleague and he will not give

us  trouble - are therefore no longer  members  of

the Adult Education Board.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, did I

hear  rightly that the T.U.C. was dissolved, when

we  were given the assurance a few days ago  that

the T.U.C.

was never dissolved?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister

for Education about the grants-in-aid. According

to  my knowledge, there are some Chinese schools

which  did not receive any aid after the  P.A.P.

came into office. I would like the Minister  for

Education to explain why these schools  did  not

receive any aid, as a result of which they  have

stopped functioning.

to answer the Member for Upper Serangoon when he

Under   subhead  35  there  are  four   separate

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is about the training of technical

teachers.  I  would  like  to  ask  this  of  the

Minister  for  Education. There are many  Chinese

Secondary  IV  graduates  this  year.  Can   they

undergo  such training after they have graduated?

When will the Ministry open such classes, so that

they can receive this training?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to go too quickly into the

question  of the training of technical  teachers,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the Minister concerned to explain why the

provision  for scholarships has been reduced  for

1962?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The correct person to answer

the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon  would  be  my

colleague, the Minister for Finance, who  is  not

in the House. This is an item actually inserted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Treasury into my vote. All I can say  is

that   this   comes  under  Economic  Development

Division, which is under the Ministry of Finance.

Proposals  for awards are put up to the Treasury.

There  is  a  small  Committee appointed  by  the

Minister  for  Finance  which  goes  through  the

proposals.  I  do not know for what  reason  they

have  reduced the original figure of $183,900  to

$109,700.  I will get in touch with the  Minister

for  Finance and suggest that he give an adequate

reply to the Member for Upper Serangoon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Minister has said he is not very clear

about the scholarships. He wishes the Minister

for Finance to reply to it. But what we want to

argue about is something very interesting. The

Minister for Education and the Prime Minister

have stressed that in Singapore there is a

shortage of technical personnel and senior educationalists to implement our education policy.

That is why we need more local teachers to be

trained abroad. At the same time, they tell us

that we should learn the national language. But

we have not seen the Minister for Education provide more scholarships or fellowships for local

people to go to Indonesia to receive training in

the national language. The Government is asking

us to study the national language, but without

more fellowships and scholarships to enable more

people to go to Indonesia to receive specialised

training, how can we promote the national

language in Singapore and make Malay the national

language of Malaya? Therefore, in this respect, I

hope the Government will send more local youths

to Indonesia to receive training in the national

language so that in future, when the national

language is fully adopted and used in Singapore

and Malaya, these people can shoulder all the

responsibilities in education and spread the use

of the national language. Therefore, my view is

that the Minister for Education should let more

youths of Singapore, especially those who are

more versed in the national language, go to

Indonesia to receive special training.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> There is, I think, a separate

vote  for scholarships under the control  of  the

Ministry of Finance, and I am asking my colleague

to  be  good enough to turn to the relative page.

But  I  would like to answer the Member for  Choa

Chu  Kang about scholarships to Indonesia. We are

going  to  recruit 20 lecturers for the Teachers'

Training  College. They will teach not  only  our

Malay teachers to teach subjects in the secondary

schools, but perhaps to help in training more teachers to improve

on  Malay education generally. There are so  many

methods  of  improving personnel  and  local-born

staff,  etc.,  and I think it is  a  question  of

giving  us time and the opportunity to do so.  In

fact,   at  least  two  graduates  have  obtained

scholarships to go to Indonesia.

You  cannot just start off with sending  hundreds

of  people away all at one time. There  are  many

scholarships  available and most times,  Sir,  we

find  that there are fewer applicants than  there

are  scholarships, not necessarily just to  study

in Indonesia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this is the first time in this

debate that a main Head has had a chance  to  be

debated! Sir, in this respect, I would  like  to

congratulate the Minister for Education.  If  it

had  not  been for his co-operation, I think  we

would  still  have been struggling with  various

subjects before we really got to the main  Head.

I think the reason is that the answers from the

Minister has been such as to cut short all sorts

of  unnecessary discussion from this  side.  But

provoking  statements from Ministers  draw  even

more  provoking  statements from the  Opposition

benches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.57 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of people want to speak on this

main Head, so I will only touch on two points  as

briefly as possible. The first point is the  six-day  week;  the  second  point  is  equality   of

treatment  for  all streams of education - English,

Chinese, Tamil and Malay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the six-day week, Mr Mammen, I have on a

number  of occasions raised this matter and  said

that  in  so  far  as the secondary  schools  are

concerned, I am not competent to express my views

on  it  and  that it is a matter on  which  educa

tional  experts  should  formulate  a  particular

policy.  But  I have ventured to suggest  to  the

Minister that, so, far as the primary schools are

concerned,  it is an utter waste of  time.  After

two  years of a six-day week for primary schools,

I still consider it is an utter waste of time. It

has  not contributed one bit to the education  of

the  children in the primary schools, but it  has

denied them a field of education which it is  not

possible  to give them in the schools. They  have

been  denied  one  day with the  parents  in  the

family circle, and the activities that they could

have  had with the family for the sixth day  have

been denied. I venture to suggest to the Minister

that  for  children to receive a proper education

which  would fit them not only for life in school

while  they  are there, but for life outside  the

school  when  they  have  left  school,   it   is

important  that the parents, the family  and  the

school  should  take  a  hand  in  moulding   the

character and the education of the children. That

is the first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is the equality in the English,

Chinese,   Malay   and   Tamil   streams,    more

particularly in the English and Chinese  streams.

Sir,  the position in the English stream is  that

we  have a junior school training for six  years,

and a secondary school training for six years. In

the  English stream it is divided into four years

up to the senior and, after these four years, the

Higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>



School Certificate at the end of the second year.

In  the Chinese stream, the junior schools is for

six  years  and  a subsequent six  years  in  the

middle schools. Now there is argument whether  it

should be 3:3 or 4:2 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> No argument.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> No argument? I am very glad it has

been   resolved.  Sir,  to  the  Chinese   school

students,  or  those  who  encourage  them   into

thinking  that after four years in middle  school

they  should be allowed to go into the fifth  and

sixth  years  without passing an  examination,  I

would  suggest  that  that  is  not  asking   for

equality of treatment.

<br><br>7.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are asking for something more than what the

English stream enjoys. As for the English stream,

Mr   Mammen,  you  have  to  pass  your   Senior

Cambridge before you can go for the Higher School

Certificate. Not only must you pass  it  but  you

must  also pass it with a Grade I Certificate.  I

am  told  you  must  achieve  a  certain  minimum

standard   of  pass  in  your  Cambridge   School

Certificate, otherwise you have not the ghost  of

a chance to go for the Higher School Certificate.

For  purposes  of  entry into the  Higher  School

Certificate    class,   the   Senior    Cambridge

Examination   has   become  not   only   a   pass

examination but a highly competitive examination.

If   the  Chinese  stream  is  asking  for  equal

treatment - and I can understand its wanting  equal

treatment  - I beg of it not to ask for treatment

which  is  more  favourable to  it  than  to  the

English  stream. What it is asking for  is  this,

irrespective  of  whether I pass the  examination

after four years or not, never mind, let me go in

for me to sit the final examination at the end of

six years which the Director of Education - quite

rightly,  in  my view - will not allow the  English

stream to enjoy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of my statement is this, Sir,If

Chinese  education  is financing  itself  out  of

private   funds,  there  is  absolutely   nothing

against it. But where Chinese education is  being

financed out of public funds, then the request of

Chinese students, and those backing them, to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>



Minister  to  allow them to go beyond  the  four

years  without passing an examination  into  the

fifth  and  sixth  years and then  sit  for  the

examination, I suggest, is not a fair request. I

am  sure the Chinese stream, which can more than

hold its own with the English stream, should not

ask  for  special treatment. It should  ask  for

equal  treatment  with the  English  stream  and

equal  treatment, to my mind,  is  to  pass  the

examination at the end of the four years  before

entry into the higher form.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Mammen, last year I

raised a number of questions and I am glad  that

since  then  the  Minister has settled  some  of

them.  However, Sir, there are two  main  issues

that have been allowed to drag on throughout the

previous   year  and  the  longer  they   remain

unsettled, the greater the ill effects  will  be

on the school children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue is the question of the

unsatisfactory  staffing  formula  for   primary

schools. I do not wish to repeat in detail  what

I said last year, but I would like to remind the

House  briefly  that the staffing  formula  lays

down that for every ten classes there should  be

11  teachers in the primary schools. It does not

specify   whether  these  teachers   should   be

qualified   or  unqualified.  Even   unqualified

teachers  fresh from school after  taking  their

Senior  Cambridge examination  are  regarded  as

qualified  teachers. Usually the relief  teacher

is  a  teacher of a second language, and if  any

class teacher is absent, he is expected to be  a

class teacher and to carry on

in a medium in which he cannot teach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this formula has been found unworkable. It

assumes that every teacher employed in a primary

school is trained and experienced. He should  be

able to

handle a class from the time the bell rings till

the  school closes. Sir, the result of  this  is

that a student teacher, without any knowledge of

teaching, is put in charge of a class, and since

the

formula is tight, there is no time for him to go

to  the  head to be instructed in what he should

do  in  class. Instances have arisen where these

new  teachers had blundered, and when asked  for

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>

reason, the head replied that he had no time even

to  instruct them, because he himself had to take

the class of an

absent  teacher. This has been going on  for  the

last  two years, and I think it is time that  the

formula is altered. I would

like  to make one suggestion, and that is,  if  a

student teacher in the first or second year in  a

training  school is regarded as half a point  and

if  not  less  than half the staff in  a  primary

school  are qualified teachers, then  we  can  be

sure  that the primary schools in Singapore  will

be  efficiently run. At the moment,  although  we

have  many  new  schools  and  many  more  pupils

admitted,  we run a great risk that  because  the

foundation  laid is so poor, we will  be  heading

for  trouble  in  six years'  time.  Already  the

results of the Primary Six Government Examination

are not very satisfactory because the average  is

only  roughly  about  40 per  cent.  We  have  to

improve  on  that percentage, and I am  sure  the

Minister himself wants to raise the standard.  He

wants  not only quantity but quality. Unless  the

staffing formula is revised, I am afraid we  will

never  be able to achieve efficiency and  a  high

standard of teaching in the primary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue has already been referred

to by the Member for Farrer Park, and that is the

controversial issue of the compulsory  full  six-day  week. Sir, I can see how difficult it is for

the Government perhaps to change its stand, but I

would  suggest that the Minister should  approach

this  question  in  the  way  he  did  over   the

controversial  3:3 and 4:2 middle  school  issue.

How  did he do that, Sir? He mentioned to us that

he  had the support of the educational bodies  in

this  country, that the principals  and  teachers

were in agreement with him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The parents.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Then he went further and said

that  most  of the parents were also in agreement

with  him.  Lastly, judging from the  results  of

those who went to take the examinations, he  said

the majority were in favour. Now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>



if we were to approach this question on that same

basis, I am sure the answer would be found.  But,

of  course, if you want to get advice,  you  must

get  it from independent educational experts  and

bodies. You cannot ask those who are in favour of

your  political  Party to be the  advisers.  They

will naturally say yes. But if independent people

are  asked and they give independent views, I  am

sure  they  will stress that when it comes  to  a

thing  like  this,  it  is  better  to  encourage

students,  teachers and heads to produce  maximum

results  in  the minimum time than  to  encourage

them  to  produce  the  minimum  results  in  the

maximum   time.  When  contractors   tender   for

buildings,  I  am  sure the Government  does  not

select  the contractor who specifies that  he  is

going  to  complete the building in  the  longest

possible time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we approach it on the basis of the

opinions  of experts, the wishes of parents  and

the  results  obtained,  we  can  see  that  the

compulsory six-day week is having a demoralising

effect on many schools. The justification  given

was that it was done in the Chinese schools, and

therefore   the  English  schools   should   not

protest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have also discussed this matter with

Chinese  school teachers and they have  given  me

facts and figures to show that the load today  is

equivalent to a seven-day working week.  This  is

what  they  have  said,  Sir.  A  primary  school

teacher  in a Chinese primary school, before  the

introduction of this new programme,  taught  from

36  to  38  periods of 30 minutes each, making  a

total of a maximum of 1,140 minutes per week. Now

they  have to teach from 47 to 48 periods  of  30

minutes  each,  bringing  the  maximum  to  1,440

minutes per week - an increase of 300 minutes, per

week,  or  five hours per week, which means  that

they  are  working an extra day. In the  case  of

those  teaching  in  high  school,  the  teachers

previously taught an average of 20 to 23  periods

of 45 minutes each; now they have to teach 32 to

36  periods  of  40  minutes  each,  so  that  by

comparison  they were teaching 1,035 minutes  per

week before and now they have to teach 1,440



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>



minutes per week - an increase of about 400 minutes

per   week.  So  they  say  that  this  so-called

compulsory six-day week is really putting  on  to

them  the  load of a seven-day week  compared  to

what they were doing before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, Sir, that when the Minister has

consulted the experts and the wishes of  parents,

he  will make the ruling more flexible. It  could

be  a  compulsory minimum of a five-day week with

5½  or 6 days on a voluntary basis, so that those

classes  of pupils who, can do a week's  work  in

five  days  need not come to school on the  sixth

day.  In  the  case of those who are rather  slow - those who are not of the sprinter type but of the

long  distance runner type - they could be made  to

come to school for an extra half-day or even  for

the  sixth day. If parents in certain areas  feel

that  their children must be kept in school  just

to keep them out of mischief, then a roster could

be  arranged so that teachers could be there  for

recreational  or  supervisory  purposes  to  help

these children. Educationalists say that up to  a

point children can absorb knowledge, but to force

them  to study beyond that point will simply make

them dislike study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore suggest that, instead of

letting  the  issue drag on and on, the  Minister

approach it in the same way as he did on the  3:3

and  4:2 middle school issue, with an open  mind,

and  be ready to consult various opinions.  I  am

sure  he  will be able to arrive at  a  fair  and

workable solution.

<br><br>7.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another issue, and that is this

policy  towards  Government  schools  and   aided

schools.  I  am sorry, Sir, that the Minister  is

following  the line of the Director of  Education

in colonial days. Maybe he was wrongly advised by

those under him. But, in any case, in those  days

they  divided  schools into  Government  schools,

which  were  their  schools, and  aided  schools,

which  were not their schools. And it came  as  a

shock  to one of them when the Governor said,  in

front  of me, that he was wrong in assuming  that

school children in Singapore should be classified

into  two categories - Government school children

and aided school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>



children. He was told that he should regard all

school  children in Singapore as  his  children

because,  after  all,  they  were  children  of

citizens  of  Singapore, and all citizens  were

taxpayers   contributing   towards   Government

revenue  which  went  towards  supporting   the

schools. And if parents preferred to send their

children to aided schools, why should  they  be

forbidden  from  doing so? Why should  they  be

compelled  to send their children to Government

schools? Let them have their freedom of choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why I think we should allow

these two categories of schools to carry on  is

to  provide healthy competition. Sir, if  there

is  no  competition, there is no  incentive  to

heads  and teachers to do better than they  did

previously.   And   healthy   competition    is

absolutely necessary in order to keep heads and

teachers  in  both  types of schools  on  their

toes,  seeking  new  ideas  and  new  ways   of

improving  their schools. [t would be  a  sorry

day  for  Singapore  if we had  a  monopoly  of

schools so that all of them were controlled  by

the   State.   We  believe  in  encouraging   a

diversity  of  schools, more  enterprise,  more

encouragement  given to heads and  teachers  to

show  initiative, so that if they can do things

in  a better way, they should be allowed to  do

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two more points. I raised the question of

provident   fund  benefits  for  Chinese-medium

school  teachers which entered into  the  aided

school  system rather late. These teachers  are

on  the  Central Provident Fund basis, so  that

even  if they join the school at the age of  50

with only five years more of service, they  are

allowed to contribute only a maximum of  $25  a

month.  So last year the Minister for Education

and  the Finance Minister asked for particulars

of the provident fund scheme for aided schools,

and  I promised I would send particulars. I did

so,  Sir. I wonder whether anything  has  been

done  regarding retirement benefits for Chinese

school teachers in the aided school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question, Sir, the age of

retirement.  In  the days when Chinese  schools

were regarded as private schools,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>

a teacher could teach even up to the age of 70 if

physically  he was regarded as fit to teach.  But

if  he has to retire at the age of 60 and has  no

livelihood  and his provident fund  benefits  are

inadequate, naturally, Sir, such teachers will be

in  a fix. Some of them have asked whether, under

the  circumstances, in the case of those teachers

who  join the system rather late, they could  not

be  allowed to continue even beyond the age of 60

if  their  health permits it and their efficiency

is not impaired.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> On this amendment, Sir, I

would first like to touch on children who did not

get through the English Secondary School Entrance

Examination.  For  those  who  got  through,  the

Minister  has  said,  from what  I  read  in  the

papers, that he would allocate places for them in

the  schools nearest their homes. But  for  those

who were not fortunate enough to get through,  if

they  are  of  the right age for a repeat  class,

they  ware  asked to go round and find  vacancies

should  their own schools have no vacancies;  and

if they are not of the right age, then for a post-primary class. Anyway, that is beside the  point.

What  I  am  trying to stress is this. Those  who

have  passed the School Entrance Examination know

that they are getting a place; but those who have

not  passed have to go from school to  school  to

try  and find a vacancy for themselves. Could the

Government not arrange to allocate them places? I

think  that  would be better because,  first  and

foremost, it saves the poor parents, some of whom

are wage earners, from spending so much money  on

transport in going from school to school to  find

vacancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point - from the educational aspect - is

this. Those pupils who merit it will get priority

if  the  Government does that, rather than depend

on luck. Because if they go on their own and they

happen  to  go  first  to a school  which  has  a

vacancy,  they get it. And if they go  all  round

and  last  of  all come to a school  that  has  a

vacancy,  by  the  time  they  reach  there,  the

vacancy  probably is filled. It is  a  matter  of

luck more than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>



merit.  So  if the Government could  arrange  to

allocate  places, I think it will benefit  these

people   both   economically   and   from    the

educational point of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring to the

Minister's  attention  is  this.  I  have   been

approached by quite a number of people who  have

many  children  going to school.  We  know  from

statistics  that the poorer people are,  somehow

or  other they seem to have more children. These

people  find  it very difficult to buy  all  the

books  at  the  beginning of the year.  For  the

higher  classes  they may need  almost  all  the

books at the beginning of the year. But for  the

primary  classes, especially Primary  I,  it  is

impossible for them to need all the books during

the  first  three months of the year. Would  the

Minister consider allowing parents to buy  books

as  and  when  they are needed? I do  not  think

schools allow that unless the Minister makes  it

an  instruction that the principal should  allow

that. I know this is a matter for the principals

to  take up, but probably the Minister will  say

that  it is not practised in any of the schools.

If   the   Minister   could   help   by   giving

instructions  that  this should  be  allowed  in

order  to  help parents, I think it  would  help

poor people quite a bit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the 4:2 system, the Member for

Farrer  Park, as a layman, seems to  think  that

people   who   ask  for  that  are  asking   for

especially    favourable    terms.    From    an

educationist's point of view, I think  they  are

asking for something which is detrimental to the

children  themselves, because the qualifications

would  not come up to the qualifications of  the

English-educated. And, therefore, that  handicap

will still remain. The idea is to bring them  up

so  that they may stand a fair chance to compete

equally.  If the Minister agrees and says,  "All

right, do not take that exam. Go up to the top."

After  six  years, they still have not  got  the

qualifications  that the English-educated  have.

So  to me, as an educationist, I feel that  what

they  are  asking  for  is detrimental  and  not

favourable to the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would like to touch on, Sir,

is the question of the six-day week. A very sore

point that everybody



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>



seems  to be talking about! Unfortunately, I  see

that even the Prime Minister, when he talks about

it,  seems to take it from the point of  view  of

the  teachers. No one ever thinks about the  poor

children;  or  from  the point  of  view  of  the

children.  The Prime Minister says that  probably

the  solution  lies in getting more  teachers  so

that  each  teacher will have less hours  to  do.

Unfortunately  we  cannot do  the  same  for  the

children.  Let us get more children so that  each

child will have less hours to do! That cannot  be

done  for the children. While the strain is being

taken out of the teachers, the poor children will

have  to go through that strain. I think it is  a

wrong  line  of  argument to say  that  an  adult

cannot stand the strain but a child can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, in a six-day week, when a child

goes  to  school  in  the morning,  he  does  his

homework in the afternoon. If he does it for five

days,  the  sixth day is left to him to  take  up

such  activities as scouting, cadet, St.  John's,

and  other  healthy extra-mural activities  which

are  very  good training for the child. I  notice

the  Member  for  Farrer Park, as  a  parent,  is

taking  it! My children are all grown up and  are

married,  with children. I do not quite  feel  as

much as the Member for Farrer Park does. But I do

agree   with  him  that  children  need  a   home

background  and training, as well as  extra-mural

activities  which  are healthy.  If  they  go  to

school for six days, Sir, when are they going  to

take  up  these activities, because  they  go  to

school in the morning, and in the afternoon  they

do  their homework? They have to study. I do  not

know  whether  the  Minister realises  that  when

children are asked to do a six-day week, they are

expected  to  work even more than the  labourers.

The  Labour  Code says labourers must work  eight

hours  a day, and then on Saturdays, half a  day.

But  our  children work six full  days!  Even  on

Saturdays they go in the morning and study in the

afternoon.  I do not think it is fair  to  expect

our  children to do more than teachers do and  to

do more than labourers do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, in a school where you have

morning and afternoon sessions, there is no  time

for school children to go back for games, because

in  the  morning  there is  morning  school,  and

children in afternoon school cannot come  in  the

morning as they might disturb the morning  school

who  want their P.T., and by the time they finish

their  P.T. the rest of the time is too  hot  for

them.  And the children in afternoon school  take

their P.T. towards the latter half of the period,

because  when they start at 2 o'clock it  is  too

hot  to  play in the playground. P.T. is physical

training. Therefore, they have no chance to  come

back for games because of the non-availability of

playgrounds.  For  some  people,  Sunday   is   a

religious   day  and  they  take   up   religious

activities  and, therefore, for the  children  of

these people, they work seven days a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Member for Tanglin who

said  that - I  do not know whether his  word  was - "Commission"  but  I say that if  the  Government

would  appoint a commission of experts  to  study

the  effects of the six-day week on children  and

make  recommendations to Government, it would  be

helping  the children and the Government a  great

deal. When we proposed that, I heard, if I am not

mistaken,  the Minister for Education  say  "such

as" - meaning people who are not affected  by  the

six-day week. I would like to suggest this:  what

about those experts in the University who lecture

on  child  psychology and on education? They  are

not  affected by the six-day week and they could,

with   their   experience  and  knowledge,   give

unbiased recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I want to touch on is this, Sir.

I  notice  that the Estimate for the Ministry  of

Education is $89-odd million as against  $352-odd

million total

estimates of expenditure. That is a little  more

than  a  quarter of the total budget.  Now,  the

Ministry  of  Education is one Head  out  of  57

Heads,  and it is getting a little more  than  a

quarter of the total budget.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>7.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rightly so, Sir. I am not complaining about that

because  the  education  of  a  country  is  very

important. The progress of the State, the welfare

of  its people, the stability of its economy, the

standard  of health, the incidence of  crime  and

juvenile  deliquency  and lots  of  other  things

depend   on   the  education  of   the   country.

Therefore, I venture to suggest that the Minister

too would be very anxious that the best education

procurable  should be got for the  youth  of  the

country. I believe I am not wrong in saying  that

he  has  made  every effort to try and  get  good

training  for  the  teachers.  Sir,  although   I

maintain  that  good training does  make  a  good

teacher,  it  is  not  sufficient.  Besides  good

teachers,  we  need  good  teaching,  and  unless

teachers are treated fairly and justly, they  are

not  going to give their best and their  teaching

will  not  be good teaching or the best  teaching

that can be obtained. Probably the Minister might

say,  what  is Mrs Scow trying to suggest?  Does

she suggest that we are not treating our teachers

well.  I  would say not all teachers are  treated

justly. I would like to ask the Minister,  if  he

thinks  all  teachers  are treated  justly,  what

justification  is there in paying women  teachers

less?  Do they work less hours? Do they  do  less

work  in  the  same  number of hours  or  produce

inferior  results?  Is there proof  that  classes

taught  by  women teachers produce worse  results

than classes taught by men teachers? Or do girls'

schools have worse results in the Cambridge  Exam

ination  and  in the secondary school examination

than boys' schools? No, it is the reverse. In the

Cambridge examination, usually the girls  do  get

better  results.  Do  records  show  that   women

trainees in the Teachers Training College or  the

University of Singapore or Nanyang University  do

worse   than  their  male  colleagues?  Do  women

principals, lecturers and inspectors take on less

responsibilities than their male counterparts? If

they do not - as an educationalist. I know they  do

not - is there any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>



justice in paying them less? Now, Sir, as if this

gross injustice is not sufficient -



<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman  (Mr Mammen):</b> I  think  the  hon.

Member  should  give  the Minister  a  chance  to

reply. We stop at 7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I will just say this, Sir,

just  to  point out other anomalies.  Apart  from

these  anomalies there are others  more  serious.

Married  women teachers are worse off.  They  get

worse treatment than unmarried women teachers.  I

will  not go into the details of it, as there  is

no  time. But I am sure the Minister knows  that.

In  a  comparison between men and women, at least

they  can say men work more, or whatever  it  is.

Now  what about the women themselves - the  married

and  the unmarried? Do unmarried women work  more

than married women? If they do, then why is there

another   anomaly?   Those   women   who   joined

Government service before 1928 are supposed to be

better teachers than those who joined after 1928,

because the pre-1928 teachers get better terms of

service.  They  are  pensionable  and  permanent,

whereas   those   who  joined  after   1928   are

temporary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most women teachers teaching in lower primary

schools  are  teaching  children  at  their  most

tender  and vulnerable age. I feel, Sir, to  make

these teachers dissatisfied, unhappy, frustrated,

will  have  a very bad influence on the children.

If not for the sake of the teachers, at least for

the  sake of the education of the country and for

the sake of the children of the country, I appeal

to  the Minister to give his serious attention to

this matter and not to laugh it off.

Head for the reduction of $100, three Members  of

the  Barisan  Sosialis - the Member for Queenstown,

the  Member for Nee Soon and the Member for Upper

Serangoon  - have  nothing to say.  More  so  when

Members  of  the  Opposition, in the  Member  for

Farrer Park and the Member for Mountbatten,  have

commented  on the 4:2 system for Chinese  schools

and  the  comment from certain quarters - supported

by  the  Barisan Sosialis - that those who  do  not

pass the Government Secondary IV Examination will

not  be  allowed  to  take the  Government  Upper

Secondary   II  Examination  is  an  unreasonable

requirement.  They have nothing else  to  say  in

this House.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> On a point of

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I do not have time for

clarification. To proceed with the points  raised

by  Members of the Opposition. First,  to  answer

the   Member  for  Tanglin  about  the   staffing

formula.  I  believe I have mentioned  previously

that this point was put to the Teachers' Training

College Advisory Board, whether a teacher trainee

should  be  half a unit as an English schools  in

the  past,  or  one unit, as in Chinese  schools.

Finally,  they recommended to me the  formula  of

0.75   unit  for  a  teacher  trainee,  which   I

accepted. This was put to the Treasury and  would

involve as many as 750 teachers for 1962, if this

formula was accepted. It was probably thrown  out

by  the  Treasury, and I will try to  bring  this

about in three years. So that for 1962, a teacher

trainee would be treated as .92 unit; for 1963 he

would be .84 unit; and by 1964, .75 unit. This is

on the assumption that a trained teacher would be

one  unit, and he will have one free period  each

day.  Therefore, a teacher trainee will have more

free  periods than a trained teacher. It is hoped

that principals of schools would so arrange their

staff as to permit teacher trainees to have their

free period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>



during  the  day that they have  to  go  to  the

Teachers'  Training College  for  their  lesson.

That will give them sufficient time, I think, to

leave  school, have their lunch and  attend  the

courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid the statement made by the Member

for  Tanglin,  that  the primary  school  leaving

examination results are bad, is not supported  by

facts.  In 1959, only 31 per cent of the  English

primary  school students passed this examination.

This  must  be  fully blamed  on  the  defect  of

automatic promotion which we stopped, so that  by

1960, there was an improvement in the examination

results - not very much - by 34 per cent. This  year,

I  am  very  glad to say the defect of  automatic

promotion  is slowly wearing off. The  result  of

the  English  primary schools was  45  per  cent,

although the general average is over 50 per cent.

I  do feel that by 1962 the result of the English

primary  school  will more or less  average  out.

There  has  been  a definite improvement  in  the

result for English primary schools in this common

primary school leaving examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Central Provident Fund for aided

school teachers, as in the case of the Singapore

Education Service, this matter is under review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the age of retirement for teachers,

first  of  all,  I  would like to  say  that,  in

respect  of women teachers who used to retire  at

the  age of 45, we have already decided that  the

same age limit should apply to women teachers  as

to  men  teachers. We have brought the status  of

women  teachers up to that of men, which, I  take

it,  the  Member for Mountbatten would be pleased

to  hear,  because she seems to be a very  strong

woman  suffragette  in this  enlightened  age  of

ours. For those teachers who are aged 60, we have

no objection to keeping those who have passed the

normal retirement age of 55 years if they wish to

continue  after  60 and, in fact, thereafter,  if

they  are  hale  and  hearty,  and  their  mental

faculties are in order. There is one very classic

example in. Dr Chelliah who is, I am sure,  past

70,  and who has already been through his  Golden

Jubilee   in  teaching.  He  happens  to   be   a

Mathematics teacher and he is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>



of  use  to  the school, and that is  why  he  is

allowed  to  carry on. But there is  always  this

question of keeping younger men from joining  the

service.  They  do feel that the man  is  already

long retired and he could easily leave school and

give  employment opportunity for younger  people.

That is our difficulty really.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the six-day week, I have only a few

minutes  to answer this question. I do feel  that

with  the  improved staffing quota  for  schools,

with   more  teachers,  a  lightening  of   their

teaching load, which is really the crux of  their

dissatisfaction,   by   introducing    extramural

activities  in  the school curriculum  (Scouting,

Guiding,  Brigade or Junior Red Cross) - it  has

been  admitted by the Member for Mountbatten that

because   of   morning  and  afternoon   schools,

children cannot go back any more for such  extra-mural  activities - I think the teaching load  will

be  reduced.  I am glad to say that it  has  been

possible  for the Ministry to come to  a  working

arrangement with four teachers' unions - the  Malay

Teachers'  Union, the Tamil Teachers' Union,  the

Chinese  School Teachers' Union and the Singapore

Teachers' Union - for an improved version of  the

six-day week for primary schools for next year. I

think  that, given this co-operation, we will  be

able  to introduce a revised version of the  six-day week for primary schools next year. I hope it

will  prove  more satisfactory, and parents  will

also  be  pleased.  It is not a  secret.  It  has

already been agreed to, but I think it requires a

little  bit  of touching up to put  it  right.  I

think  it  will not be long before this  will  be

announced. We hope we will be able to go  through

a tranquil period in all schools, not necessarily

English schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year and the year before last when

this  particular item came up before the Assembly

during  the  Estimates debate, I brought  up  the

question  of  Government acquiring  the  Alsagoff

Estate  and  other areas in Singapore  which  are

congested  and  which would be another  Bukit  Ho

Swee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has allocated the sum of

$1.786  million for Land Acquisition for  General

Development.  I do not know whether the  Minister

concerned or the Ministers in the Government have

been  to  Geylang  Serai  and  parts  of  Kampong

Kembangan.  If  they have been there,  they  will

realise  that  the  area  concerned  is  apt   to

deteriorate. It has actually deteriorated in some

cases. If you visit the area concerned, you  will

find  that somebody's farmhouse is in front of  a

latrine,  and somebody's latrine is in  front  of

somebody's  farmhouse. I understand the  Alsagoff

Estate will be up for auction very soon. It  will

be  wise on the part of the Government to acquire

the land, cut it up and sell it to the people who

are living there. Besides the Alsagoff Estate,  I

understand  the position is the same  with  other

areas in Lorong Tai Seng and Nee Soon. Perhaps it

would  be better, I think, for the Government  to

acquire these areas under the general development

scheme. It would be cheaper for Government to buy

up  the land, cut it up and sell it to the people

concerned  than to wait for a fire to  break  out

and then build its multi-storey flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Head  18 is in regard  to  Government's

land  acquisition  policy  and  the  problem   of

resettlement.  Last  week  I  touched  upon   the

question of resettlement of squatters. Now I want

to  talk  about the question of land  acquisition

for general development. After the Government has

announced its intention to acquire certain  land,

it  starts to acquire it. But in the past, before

the Government acquired any piece of land, it did

not  deal with the problem properly, thus causing

great dissatisfaction to the people concerned.  I

do  not  want to drag an and speak at  length  on

this, but I want to raise a few salient points.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>



After  acquiring the land, the Government  should

allocate it for purposes of agriculture,  or  the

building of houses, hospitals, schools and  other

public buildings. Therefore, in this regard,  the

Government  should  know that the  people  living

there,  their properties and other belongings  in

that area would be affected, and they would incur

certain losses. So if the Government wants to ask

the residents to remove to other areas, it should

have  a  proper  rate  of compensation.  But  the

present   rate  of  compensation  paid   by   the

Government  to  these  people  is  not  adequate,

because it is insufficient for them to remove and

rehabilitate in other places. At the  same  time,

it  delays the Government's Development Plan.  At

the  moment,  the compensation rate paid  to  the

residents who are asked to remove is the same  as

that prevailing in 1957. I have already mentioned

this  point  in this House last week.  We  cannot

base   our  compensation  rate  on  the  economic

conditions existing in 1957 when dealing with the

present  problems. Therefore, the people affected

cannot   accept  this  unreasonable  compensation

rate.  The  value  of a house, according  to  the

people who live in the rural areas, costs $3  per

square  foot.  But the Government's  compensation

rate is $1 per square foot. The compensation rate

in  regard  to numerous other items cannot  cover

their     losses.    Therefore,    under    these

circumstances,  the residents who  are  asked  to

remove  cannot  accept  the Government's  present

compensation  rate to move out of  their  present

houses. If the Government wants to carry out  its

Development Plan in time, then it should increase

the  compensation rate applicable at present.  It

should  increase  this  rate  to  enable  it   to

implement its general development plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is this: after

the  Government has acquired the land, it is  not

reasonable   in  allocating  it  to  the   former

occupiers. I can give a very simple example.  The

Government has purchased a certain piece of  land

at  Bulim,  in  Jurong, which is an  agricultural

area.  There are more than 20 families of farmers

living  there. The Government has recently issued

to them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>

notices saying that their occupation of the  land

there   is   illegal.  I  want  to  stress   this

expression  "illegal".  Therefore,  the   farmers

there   will  have  to  stop  their  agricultural

activities  and, at the same time,  cannot  carry

out agricultural development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these farmers have been

occupying  the  land  legally.  They  have  house

numbers and have paid land assessment rates.  How

can   the   Government  say  they  are  illegally

occupying  the  land? It is  very  wrong  of  the

Government  to  say  so.  They  have   not   been

occupying  the  land illegally.  They  have  been

staying  there  for  scores  of  years.  Now  the

Government  is  alleging that they are  illegally

occupying  the  land. I think the Government,  in

dealing  with  such  matters, should  make  prior

investigation  before it issues such  notices  to

the residents; otherwise the people affected will

be  very  disquieted.  Mr Deputy  Speaker,  many

residents have applied to the Land Office  giving

very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>



reasonable grounds, such as helping in  the  work

of  agriculture. But the Government has neglected

this.  We must take into consideration this fact,

i.e.,  before  Singapore  is  industrialised   we

should not -
