                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the Pioneer Incentive
is intended to attract and root new economic activities into Singapore, and
to encourage companies to acquire new technologies. The aim is to
drive the growth of high value-added or high-technology industries
in Singapore. Through the Pioneer Incentive, we try to anchor what
we call "queen bee" companies to locate here and build up a cluster.
These "queen bee" companies would in turn attract other companies
in their respective clusters to locate and expand in Singapore.
In the process, they create business opportunities for our local
companies, and generate spin-offs for companies in the services
sectors, such as professional and financial services.</p>

is open to all companies. The criteria for award of the Pioneer Incentive
are deliberately set high. Companies awarded the incentive are required
to commit to generating new economic contribution of a substantive
scale in Singapore. So quite naturally, it is the bigger companies
who would tend to qualify for the Pioneer Incentive. Over the last
five years, a total of 97 companies have been awarded the Pioneer
Incentive. Of this, only 11 were SMEs, of which five were local
SMEs. The total commitments from the 97 Pioneer Incentive companies
amount to $8.8 billion in Fixed Assets Investments, $4.8 billion
in annual Total Business Spending and the creation of over 10,000
skilled jobs.</p>

[NS] Tan Chuan-Jin) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
for Manpower)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, the failure to pay salaries
promptly is an offence. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has put in
place a range of measures to ensure that employers pay salaries
to their Work Permit holders on time. The Employment Act requires
employers to pay their employees within seven days after the end
of the salary period. Failure to pay salaries promptly can result
in prosecution. In 2011, 26 employers were convicted of Employment
Act offences, of which 22 were for salary-related offences. Thirteen
other salary arrears cases are currently before the courts. Under
the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA), employers of non-Malaysian foreign
workers and foreign domestic workers are also required to put up
a $5,000 security bond that can be forfeited if salaries are not
paid promptly.</p>

measures to ensure that foreign workers are kept informed of their
salary components prior to entering Singapore. Since June 2011, employers
have been required to declare the foreign worker's basic monthly
salary, allowances and deductions when making their Work Permit
applications. These declarations are clearly stated in the copy
of the In-Principle Approval (IPA) letter that Work Permit holders
are required to present to immigration officers in order to gain entry
into Singapore. To further ensure that Work Permit holders understand
their employment terms, we have provided IPA letters in native languages
for foreign workers and will be doing so this year for foreign domestic
workers as well.</p>

and begin employment, their employers should ensure that the workers
are kept informed of their salary components by keeping a record
of monthly salary payments, inclusive of over-time earnings and
deductions, and providing workers access to these salary records.
A survey recently conducted with more than 3,000 non-domestic Work
Permit holders indicated that 91% of Work Permit holders were allowed
to see a record of their salary payments and received a physical record
of their salary payments.</p>

with our tripartite partners to conduct regular industry briefings
and dialogues with employers to educate them on their responsibilities
under our employment laws and to better understand their constraints
and challenges. We have also disseminated collaterals to facilitate
better understanding of our laws and employers' responsibilities.
Lastly, we are also studying the possibility of requiring the issuance
of payslips to workers.</p>

Sir, I would like to find out more details. Of the cases that were
mentioned by the Minister of State in his response, were they recurrent
cases, in the sense that these were employers who were caught more than
once for non-payment? Is the Ministry also looking at further fine-tuning
the system such as using a demerit point system to identify these
employers who are recalcitrant? And also for Work Permit holders
who incur high hospital bills – beyond $20,000 for example – are
there avenues to assist them?</p>

Speaker, in terms of the Employment Act prosecution statistics,
we had in 2009, 29 offences; in 2010, there were 33 offences, inclusive
of three cases prosecuted under EFMA; and in 2011, there were 26
offences, inclusive of one case under the EFMA. I do not have the
figures for recurrent offences. That is something that we would
look at. When we look at companies in terms of fulfilling their
obligations to their employees, clearly, if employers are seen to
be recalcitrant, measures will be taken. That is something that
we will look into. With regard to tightening up these measures, we
are looking at EFMA in the course of this year, especially in terms
of enforcement. We are looking at how we can tighten it and how
we can deal with companies that violate the rules and regulations.</p>

SCORE provides such employment assistance through skills training,

from Prisons into the workforce and stabilise in their jobs, SCORE
also introduced the Case Management Service in 2007. Offenders who
have successfully secured jobs are assigned SCORE Case Managers
for six months. In 2011, 1,586 offenders were case-managed at work.
Of these, 78% had stayed on the job for three months and 54% had
stayed on the job for six months. Ex-offenders who are looking for
a job or have lost their job can approach the Employment Assistance
Unit of SCORE. In 2011, 492 ex-offenders sought SCORE's assistance.
Of these, 363, or 74%, successfully secured jobs and have started
work.</p>

Mr Speaker, I thank the Member for the supplementary question. We
do not track the offenders after they have got the job. The nature
of ex-offenders is that once they have left the prison, they want
to leave the prison behind. Generally,
they do not want to have anything to do with the Prisons. However, help
is still offered to them if they want to come back or if they are
out of a job or if they need particular assistance in getting re-integrated
into society.</p>

I do not have the information with me right now as this was not
requested in the Parliamentary Question (PQ). I could provide the
answer to the hon Member, or she could subsequently file a PQ. Marriages
are of varying lengths, although we do detect that when marriages
include young couples of the age of 20 or below, these marriages
tend to be a lot riskier. Chances of the marriages failing are much
higher compared to more matured couples who marry.</p>

course, how we help marriages to continue to be sustainable and
to remain strong. We have many programmes where we work together
with partners like VWOs and the National Family Council, in order
to help families to remain intact and marriages to remain strong.
Various measures are in place. We also have the interests of the
children at heart. In the event that there are children below the
age of eight involved, there is a provision under the law that makes
it mandatory for the divorcing couple to go for counselling and
mediation. At the heart of it all is our intention to ensure that
the welfare of the children when a couple divorces is taken care
of.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">The Minister of State for Health (Dr Amy
Khor Lean Suan)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, as Chairman of
REACH and Mayor of the South West District, I have had the privilege
of being at close quarters with different segments of the population
who have responded to
Budget 2012. Since the Budget Speech on 17 February 2012, REACH
has received more than 600 feedback inputs. The theme "Building
a Fair and Inclusive Society" clearly resonates with many people.
It is gratifying for me to hear the spontaneous reactions and support
for the Budget. Words like "great", "responsive" and "caring" have
been used. It is the Government putting the money where its mouth
is.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1423</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1f3fbf37-2086-4c06-9eb9-f33075d257f2">
                  <a name="budget__id-1f3fbf37-2086-4c06-9eb9-f33075d257f2"><!--a--></a>Many feedback contributors
have said that they like the Budget as it reflects how we are part
of a community that cares for one another and, more importantly,
that the ground has been heard and their views taken into account.
I can testify that REACH does not get only pro-Government feedback
but the overall support is, indeed, encouraging. However, as with
all Budgets, we cannot be all things to all men. There will be some trade-offs,
which could lead to some stakeholder segments feeling neglected.
Already, businesses and some middle income have lamented that this
Budget offered few goodies for them. But it must be said that whilst
the middle income segment is not singled out, many of the measures
such as extending subsidies in the intermediate and long-term healthcare
sector to cover to two thirds of Singaporean households do benefit them.
Let me now highlight some key concerns raised and which the Government
could address. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-25db198b-a3ad-4f54-949b-f7388e8d6963">
                  <a name="budget__id-25db198b-a3ad-4f54-949b-f7388e8d6963"><!--a--></a>The move to increase CPF
contributions for workers aged 50 to 65 years to encourage them
to continue working is welcome. However, it can be argued that since
people are becoming more educated and skilled, living longer and
healthier and even as we increasingly embrace a performance-based
wage system, the CPF contribution rates should be similar for all
workers regardless of age and should be extended beyond 65 years.
Otherwise, the signal would still be that older workers are less
valued. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e351403-9f7b-4d43-b12c-ee8124ed80eb">
                  <a name="budget__id-9e351403-9f7b-4d43-b12c-ee8124ed80eb"><!--a--></a>It is also suggested that
the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and Workfare Income Supplement
(WIS) for the disabled be extended to Persons with Disabilities
(PWD) but who did not graduate from SPED Schools. Feedback from
the disabled community is that even those who graduate from mainstream
schools are still discriminated against and the SEC would help to
ensure that employers are not discouraged from employing them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-84ab36db-ea12-4e53-b846-2c3a512623aa">
                  <a name="budget__id-84ab36db-ea12-4e53-b846-2c3a512623aa"><!--a--></a>For businesses, the criticisms
to Budget 2012 have been sharper. There are few objections towards
the statement that Singapore needs to reduce its reliance on foreign workers
and steer its economy toward higher productivity. But, growing productivity takes
time and replacing foreign workers with more locals in a tight labour
market will be extremely challenging in the short to medium term.
Hence, there are concerns that the shortage of foreign labour may
hurt small businesses and eventually increase costs for everyone.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-17e99b3f-f7c9-43ab-bb63-5865ab1b5707">
                  <a name="budget__id-17e99b3f-f7c9-43ab-bb63-5865ab1b5707"><!--a--></a>We need to stay the course
in climbing the productivity ladder, lest cheaper foreign workers
become an intoxicant that numbs us to the need to restructure for
the long term. However, we should also not dismiss these concerns,
especially pressing when a slowdown in the global economy is looming.
Despite increases in foreign worker levies since 2010 and the Government's
gradual tightening of foreign worker employment, the number of foreign
workers in Singapore has grown. After a strong 11% labour productivity
growth in 2010, our productivity growth virtually ground to a halt
in 2011 at 1%. Although this may be attributed to a lower 4.9% GDP
growth and more jobs being created, it does show that shifting the
economy to a productivity-driven model is not so simple. It is very
difficult to wean companies off their dependence on foreign labour because
that is the quickest fix, and SMEs rarely have the luxury to think
long term when the entrepreneurs who run them have to deal with
day-to-day business challenges. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1424</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-6d55b749-c539-4f6a-82c7-896e7327e989"><!--a--></a>Besides the measures announced
in Budget 2012 to incentivise companies to improve productivity,
the Government will need to work closely with the various industry
sectors to change mindsets and more aggressively drive productivity initiatives.
Employers will also have to make concerted effort to adapt their
work processes to include more flexible work hours and better HR
policies and pay structures to accommodate older workers and other
untapped labour pools such as back-to-work women. Here, the Government
could take the lead by employing older workers and back-to-work
women across all Ministries and agencies. For work that the Government best
sources, such as cleaning and security, it could stipulate minimum
standards required of these workers, so that they will be able to
get better pay commensurate with better skills and improved productivity. </p>

that public funds are being used to boost bus capacity even though
doing so to improve service level is welcome. The Government has
always maintained that the privatisation model is the best way to
ensure that the public transport system operates effectively and
efficiently. Given their size and credit standing, the publicly
listed bus companies can quite easily raise funds via bond or share
issues to buy the buses. So, many people cannot fathom the logic
for the direct use of public funds to ramp up bus capacity. Moreover,
it is argued that these companies have been making substantial profits
over the years even though their bus business may be running operating
losses. </p>

is inevitable, then the Government must have strict oversight over
these operators and impose conditions to ensure that we achieve
the desired service level improvements and the extra money does
not go toward boosting dividends or share prices. These conditions
should be made known to the public. Some questions also remain unanswered
– if Government pays for the buses, will they be "given" to these
bus companies, or more appropriately, leased to the bus companies
at market rates? The very idea of public funds being used for the
purchase of buses for private transport companies also raises the
question whether nationalisation or some hybrid model similar to
those in Australia and the UK should be the way forward. </p>

juncture, I want to take a step back and look at the Budget from a
macro perspective. From the point of view of depicting priorities,
Budget 2012 indicates a stepped up response to realities that have
asserted themselves more and more forcefully. The Opposition would
like to think that Budget 2012 is a reaction to the GE last year.
But, clearly, deeper forces are at work. Let me organise my thoughts
under four headings: (i) a persistent problem; (ii) a fresh approach;
(iii) a social partnership; and (iv) a real danger.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4caa0dcf-2a48-4663-9ce3-39612a752b4e">
                  <a name="budget__id-4caa0dcf-2a48-4663-9ce3-39612a752b4e"><!--a--></a>First, a persistent problem.
Mr Speaker, Sir, globalisation, which Singapore has wholeheartedly
embraced and continues to do so, has two opposite effects. Firstly,
it produces big winners: a start up of the "Next Big Thing" that
goes IPO and enriches its founders by millions, top financial talent
that attract salaries and sign-on bonuses which international banks
clamour to offer, obscure artists on YouTube that go viral and draw the
attention of record companies or sports promoters. But, globalisation
also produces big losers. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-c8cc0db9-7168-4561-a19e-cf01f7362af5"><!--a--></a>While Singapore has one of the highest
percentage of millionaires in the world, the lower segments of the
population find it difficult to pull themselves out of their difficulties.
Our Gini coefficient without Government transfers and taxes increased
from 0.442 in 2000 to 0.473 in 2011. While Government transfers
and taxes have brought down the corresponding Gini coefficients
for 2000 and 2011 to 0.434 and 0.452 respectively, it has thus far
not reversed the general rising trend of income inequality. This
is despite the higher and higher amounts of funds allocated to social
development. For instance, social spending rose from $13 billion,
or 5.5% of GDP, in FY 2006 to $21.5 billion, or 6.6% of GDP, in
FY 2011, both in absolute terms and in proportion to share of overall
budget. Even so, the gaps have not closed.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-72af1a1f-0a55-4adf-875e-84264e497db5"><!--a--></a>These observations point
to deepening and chronic income divisions that need urgent attention.
This is compounded by the rapidly ageing population which many people
have noted, with the attendant problems of slowing growth in the
domestic workforce, and a higher fiscal burden for health care.
It will be foolish to jettison the dogma of globalisation and free
markets because it has brought enormous benefits to Singapore. Millions
have been uplifted from their poverty in many countries that have embraced
market reforms and plugged their economies into the global trading
system. But, we need to address the inequalities which plague dense
cities like Singapore. The problem will not easily disappear anytime
soon. In fact, perhaps alarmingly, it is likely to worsen as the
numbers of dependent aged rise. The investment in up-levellers like education,
which this Budget also offers, pays dividend only in the long term.
The persistence of the widening income gaps thus calls for a reinforced
fiscal policy to tackle the problem.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-731c83ce-07cf-4fe3-8927-d49d63ece562"><!--a--></a>Hence, my second point:
a fresh approach. When the global financial crisis broke out in
2008, central banks around the world resorted to a massive and co-ordinated
injection of liquidity to decisively unclog credit channels and
help re-start bank lending. In the US, they pursued an unconventional
fiscal policy called quantitative easing or QE, and Mr Ben Bernanke
even initiated three rounds of it. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ad35eadd-f9a9-4711-b1ba-0d886c6efa35"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, I am
not at all advocating that we start pouring vast sums of money into
the social sector, but – poor analogy as it is – there is a need
for the rough equivalent of QE for social development. In this respect,
I am grateful to Minister Tharman for heeding comments that others
and I have made last Budget about the need to raise the social allocation
even further. I call this a responsive government although some Opposition
Members would label it a populist move. But, this is not a course
correction as the Member for Aljunied, Ms Sylvia Lim, suggested
yesterday. It is the reinforcement of an existing policy.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c57e983f-8228-4bbf-ba98-24381c394f34">
                  <a name="budget__id-c57e983f-8228-4bbf-ba98-24381c394f34"><!--a--></a>What Budget 2012 implies
is a further loosening of the purse strings to help the most vulnerable
segments of the population, with full awareness that the help they
receive may be prolonged over many budget cycles. Indeed, Budget
2012 signals, in my view, a fresh approach the Government has taken
in cognisance of these social realities. It is a fresh approach
because the Government has brought to bear substantially more funds than
hitherto to try and decisively tackle the income gap. Hence, we
have a permanent GST Voucher scheme. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7dbd8fb3-dd68-4870-8b78-23673c29ed6c">
                  <a name="budget__id-7dbd8fb3-dd68-4870-8b78-23673c29ed6c"><!--a--></a>We already have a number
of "permanent" assistance schemes such as Workfare and now, we have
a permanent GST Vouchers scheme. But a "QE" for the social allocation does not and should
not negate the core principle of self reliance. The GST Vouchers
are subject to some measure of means testing and equally important
are targeted. For instance, only about a third of the GST Voucher
scheme is in cash whilst the other two portions are directed toward
Medisave for the elderly and utility subsidies. Whilst some of these
might need further refinements, we must never veer away from the
goal of all such schemes, that is to give a leg up and promote self
reliance as far as possible. At the same time, measures to ensure
social mobility for the young who may come from low income families
are crucial so as to ensure that they have a chance of getting out
of the poverty trap. We must do all we can to preserve social mobility,
which is likely to get harder over time, so that a permanent underclass
will not coalesce. </p>

Building and being an inclusive society does not just mean the Government
singularly putting in place policies to redistribute resources to help
the vulnerable. It is also as much about individuals wanting to
be helped and to help themselves, families bearing responsibility
and the community coming forward to lend a helping hand. Everyone
must chip in and do their part. This is the social partnership Singapore
needs to forge and strengthen even as we face a period of greater
economic uncertainty.</p>

done more, and no doubt, will continue to do so in the years ahead,
the problems have to be collectively owned and comprehensively tackled. They
will require a total response from everyone. Having more social
workers as called for in the Budget will help, but the problems
still cannot be resolved without the support of the family and other
stakeholders. I draw an analogy from the short video clip and frequent
announcements at MRT stations. In the clip, a suspicious looking
man boards an MRT and deposits a bag under his seat. He disembarks
the train several stations away but leaves the bag on the train.
Shortly after he disembarks, the train explodes as it enters a tunnel.
The message is clear, and is reinforced by the announcement over
the PA system – if anyone sees a suspicious object at the station
that is left unattended, he or she should alert the station staff,
lest it turns out to be an explosive device from a terrorist. The
responsibility falls on everyone so that everyone is safe.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-5384ee3c-9391-4fd8-aad6-4c82c2733ff2"><!--a--></a>Likewise, we need to pursue
a social partnership that leverages off the strengths of each party
– the Government's resources, the community's local networks, the neighbour's
alertness to specific people in need. The community must look out
for one another, and the able must stoop to help the less able.
In this way, the holes are plugged and more sustainable solutions
can be proffered.</p>

to further illustrate this. This is a case of a resident in my constituency
who alerted us of the Chow family of four siblings in a neighbouring
HDB unit. All four were afflicted by a genetically inherited disease

of them is now in a nursing home, one works as a masseuse supporting
himself and his two sisters staying at home. </p>

did not know about the family as the family never switched on the
lights − since they were blind − and slept early every night. Hence,
we never reached them even though we have done many house visits
in that block. The masseuse was able to support the family until
he tragically fell down. The neighbour alerted GRLs that this family
needs help. The CDC is now helping them with monthly cash, food rations
and other subsidies. And the RC visits them every month. I visited
them and was impressed that even though they were blind and only
the youngest sibling − already aged 50 − has some vision, they kept
their house very neat, without a speck of dust on the floor; in fact,
much neater than mine. And they were very independent, able to cook and
feed themselves. </p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
I rise in support of the Budget proposed by the Minister for Finance.
In particular, many of my unionists and residents applaud the Budget
measures focusing on older workers, disabled and needy Singaporeans.
Being the Executive Secretary of the Healthcare Services Employees'
Union representing healthcare workers and appreciating the long-term
challenges of an ageing population, I thank the Government for devoting
significantly more resources on healthcare and focusing on manpower
development of healthcare professionals.</p>

measures and handouts which were once-off and for a shorter period,
this year's Budget saw the Government entrenching many of the help schemes
such as the GST Vouchers to alleviate the burdens of low-income
families. I am particularly heartened when the Deputy Prime Minister
announced the upward revision of the income limits for the MOE's
Financial Assistance Scheme, as this was posed as a parliamentary
question for the Minister for Education to consider just a few months
ago after the opening of the Twelfth Parliament. </p>

been engaging various groups of people from unionists to residents
and various informal networks. Suffice to say, many agree to what
I have alluded to earlier but there are areas which I feel we can
do even better.</p>

of the middle income families, mostly PMEs, also at times called
the sandwiched class, I spoke to remain concerned about the high
and rising cost of living in Singapore. A family of four having
a meal out at a local fast food restaurant will easily set them
back by between $30 and $40, depending on which restaurant they choose.
Perhaps it is now $20-plus because of the recent round-the-clock
Extra Value Meal promotion at certain particular outlets. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-abd25df5-fc15-4a6b-9f32-52baaaccb922">
                  <a name="budget__id-abd25df5-fc15-4a6b-9f32-52baaaccb922"><!--a--></a>There are some benefits
for them in this Budget but many remain not "poor" enough to qualify
for the various aid schemes to adequately stave off the ever increasing
cost of living in Singapore. There are no signs that the cost of
living is relenting anytime soon. Petrol over the pump now costs
more than $2 per litre even after a Fuel Card and Credit Card discount.
In Mercer's 2011 Costs of Living Survey, Singapore has moved up
three rungs to 8th globally and 3rd in Asia, just behind Tokyo and
Osaka. Our inflation rate continues to hover between 5% and 6%,
although dipping slightly below 5% in certain months. With an uncertain
economic outlook, it is difficult to envisage huge increments or
bonuses for many employees. For a middle income earner having to
support a family of two children and elderly parents on both sides,
life is challenging indeed. Due to the high cost of living, it is
now even more difficult for middle income workers to plan for their
retirement needs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3bddb2bc-a775-4710-b379-ed6d7d0646ce">
                  <a name="budget__id-3bddb2bc-a775-4710-b379-ed6d7d0646ce"><!--a--></a>I strongly urge the Government
to consider introducing programmes that will help the middle income
sustain their livelihood and move their families up the social ladder, that
is, enhance their social mobility. This can only come through the
acquisition of new capabilities and moving up the ladder for the
main breadwinners. A senior technician should move up to be an engineer
or an executive should move up to be a manager. My view is that
the current productivity and skills-upgrading related programmes,
such as the PIC (Productivity and Innovation Credit), and increase
in absentee payroll are rather employer-focused. Even though the
training support for SMEs will be enhanced, I am unsure whether
this will translate into skills upgrading and enhanced wages for
their employees.
This is particularly so as SMEs are already facing a manpower crunch
in our tight labour situation and sending workers for training may
compromise manning levels. For one, I do not object to the "incentive"
approach in encouraging businesses to embark on training and productivity
drives. Nonetheless, we must acknowledge that the top priority of
any business or private enterprise is to maximise profits. A business
is neither a charity nor should it be expected to be a provider
of jobs. To survive, a company would sometimes need to embark on
painful measures. Moving forward, we would therefore need a better
understanding of the existing productivity and skills upgrading
schemes and areas to enhance it. We need to know how many in the
middle income bracket have or will eventually benefit from these
schemes and whether they have seen a significant increase in their
income as a result of these schemes. </p>

by foreign manpower and threat to the jobs of local PMEs has been
a concern to all PME segments. Statistics show that there has been
an almost 80% increase in foreign PMEs from 63,000 in 2006 to 112,000
in 2010. In the Budget, I am glad to note that the Government will
be tightening the inflow of foreign work permit holders although
no specific mention of Employment Pass holders. I am aware the Government has
taken measures with effect from 1 January this year to tighten the
Employment Pass criteria and I eagerly await to hear in the upcoming
months how it takes shape. I believe when we adequately control
the flow and with the tight labour market situation, our employers
would take an even keener interest in levelling up our local PMEs.
At the same time, our young local PMEs would also have a better
chance of securing employment. Currently, the unemployment rate
of our young PMEs between 15 and 29 years old stands at 3.5% in
2010.</p>

that happened to me a couple of weeks back. It was a Sunday afternoon,
and I had a couple of hours. I brought my two sons – one, seven-and- a-half
years and the other, four-and-a-half years – for a cycling venture
at the park. I bought both my sons' bicycles about one-and-a-half
years ago. The bicycles were fitted with two extra wheels from behind,
so that they would not fall when riding. But on that fateful Sunday,
three weeks ago, I decided to take the hard measure and removed
those two rear wheels from both of my sons' bicycles, and I said,
"Let us go to the park and ride your bicycle." I guided them, and
said, "If you fall to the right, try to steer to the left. If you
fall to the left, try to steer to the right. I will give you some
assistance from the rear, holding your back seat." So they tried
and tried, sustained quite a few permanent lacerations which I saw
this morning – they are still present – but after a couple of hours under
the scorching heat and sun, they managed to ride the bicycle on
their own. As a proud father, I was happy but more happy when my
son came up to me and said, "Dad, you have taught me to ride the
bicycle without those two rear wheels. I did not know it is much
more fun and much faster." They were happy children.</p>

issue of foreign manpower management. I think foreign manpower is
like the additional two rear wheels. With it, you are stable, you
can still move but without it, and focusing on your core two wheels,
you are much faster, you are more productive, and you can even go
for competitions.</p>

on to the next part of my speech on how measures in the Budget to
help the disadvantaged segments can be augmented with market realities
to make the policies more effective. Touching on the elderly, I
would like to applaud the Government for taking the bold measure
to restore the CPF contribution rates from between 0.5% and 2.5%. This will certainly
help to improve the retirement provisions for our elderly workers.
Other pro-elderly measures such as the Special Employment Credit (SEC),
the Silver Housing Bonus, family grant for maids, enhanced Medifund
and top-ups to MediShield demonstrate a committed and holistic framework
in taking care of the not-so-young.</p>

Budget, we know that there has been feedback that the Silver Housing
Bonus is not particularly attractive as most of the elderly are
accustomed to their own house and selling it is really a last resort.
The more critical aspects thereby lie in their ability to continue
to draw an income and the medical care that they are able to receive.
Our employers' attitudes are paramount in helping our elderly sustain meaningful
jobs and income. However, I worry for some quarters, including SMEs,
who face increasing cost pressures and I hope that employers will
be enlightened not to offset the costs of the CPF rate increase
through other cost-cutting measures and in a worst-case scenario,
cut their jobs. I believe the subvention provided by the Government to
them will alleviate their costs. I urge MOM and TAFEP to closely
monitor the situation when the new CPF rates are effective from
September 2012.</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Sir, in the
last part of my speech, I would like to cover an area which was not
featured in the Budget. It is on building a family. While there
will be higher provisions in the Budget set aside for the Baby Bonus
in anticipation of a Dragon Year, I would like to ask about the
overall approach of our procreation policies. We all know that men
and women are getting married at a later age and thus starting a
family at a later age. The challenge is that our strong work ethos,
out of financial need, is getting in the way of developing a balanced
and happy family life. Greater attention needs to be devoted to
how the social and work environment can be geared towards providing better
support. Even when people do get hitched, the huge financial costs
of a house and wedding are pushing our people either into debt or
cold feet, whichever may come first. In the final hurdle, the affordability
of having a child will set anyone thinking. To further exacerbate, the jobs
of working mothers are also at stake. In fact, today's papers as
well as on Monday, <em class="ph i">TODAY</em> carried a report of a lady being
terminated after she discovered she was pregnant and informed her
bosses. On wrongful dismissal complaints filed by pregnant women
which had increased by 33% to 112 cases in 2011, more than nine
in 10 of the women who filed complaints last year were sacked during
pregnancy. Furthermore, women, particularly PMEs, who leave the
workforce for extended periods to look after their child or children
also find it extremely difficult to return to their previous occupations.</p>

we find meaning in what we do but we also provide the support to
those who fall through the cracks. The principles behind which this
Budget is rolled out have shown the Government's commitment to build
a more inclusive society and to better the lives of Singaporeans. More
importantly, many of the measures embarked on are to prepare Singapore
and Singaporeans for the longer term. I believe and support the
move in growing the entire cake for all to have more and not merely
altercating over who gets how many slices, how much of the topping
or which part of the marzipan. On that note, I support the Budget.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate
and to support the Budget. I would like to begin by quoting the
late Senior Minister S Rajaratnam, who was very prescient in assessing
the challenges of developing a global city. He said, and I quote:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph hcProceduralText" id="id-97da2b92-3315-45fa-bb9c-74b3df2371e8">
                  <a name="budget__id-97da2b92-3315-45fa-bb9c-74b3df2371e8"><!--a--></a> "Laying the economic
infrastructure of a Global City may turn out to be the easiest of
the many tasks involved in creating such a city. The political,
social and cultural adjustments such a city would require to enable
men to live happy and useful lives in them may demand a measure
of courage, imagination and intelligence which may or may not be
beyond the capacity of its citizens."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4a961206-9ef9-42e9-bc3a-07d6d9f9ec58">
                  <a name="budget__id-4a961206-9ef9-42e9-bc3a-07d6d9f9ec58"><!--a--></a>That was in 1972. Yet,
there may be no more timely opportunity than this Budget debate
to recognise the continuing relevance of his words. As a Nominated
Member of Parliament with a special interest in the arts and culture,
my question is this: have we adequately made the cultural adjustments
in tandem with our fast-changing economic situation? Are we capable
of the courage, imagination and intelligence required for men and
women to live happy and useful lives here? My answer to both questions
is "Yes, but."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c4633e12-9af9-4ca3-96bc-e4089f4a3330">
                  <a name="budget__id-c4633e12-9af9-4ca3-96bc-e4089f4a3330"><!--a--></a>Yes, because Singapore's
greatest asset is its people, who continue to participate daily
in a bewildering array of cultural practices from religious worship
to community arts to cooking up a storm. In so doing, they make
life meaningful and Singapore a place of constant discovery and
excitement for visitors and locals alike. But people are also increasingly
anxious about the distribution of resources, and frustrated at limited opportunities
to participate in public debates that need to happen if difficult
issues are to be properly addressed. </p>

boasts a growing population of artists who are passionately committed
to their public, their craft, and the place they live, and who work
day and night to
honour and provoke, stimulate and delight. One of them stands before
you now. But our artists also labour against a host of bureaucratic
and financial constraints to realise the full scope of their talents,
and to meet the very human desire for free expression.</p>

is a vibrant, eye-catching cosmopolitan city with beautiful heritage
buildings, state-of-the-art facilities for arts education and practice,
and plans for further cultural development. But our cultural infrastructure
has developed much faster – and sometimes at the expense of – the
ability of Singaporeans of all tastes and ages to participate in
the arts.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-5ad08923-f539-4cbb-b162-4860f06876ba"><!--a--></a>The Arts and Culture Strategic
Review Committee recently released its report recognising this situation.
It proposes ways of bringing the arts and culture to everyone and
involving as many people as possible in arts participation, with
a view to developing "an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore",
as the theme of this year's Budget puts it. The arts alone are no
panacea, any more than economic policies are. However, I would like
to elaborate on three cultural strategies which I think are key
to achieving this vision:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-24575a28-80a6-4004-9534-79e44b8a8a0d">
                  <a name="budget__id-24575a28-80a6-4004-9534-79e44b8a8a0d"><!--a--></a>First, including many
stories. What do the arts teach us about inclusion? That it must be
qualitative, and not just quantitative. The beauty of art is that
it does not limit itself to addressing us as Singaporeans. It addresses
us as human beings – one of whose characteristics is a powerful
desire to belong, with the capacity to achieve more together than
we can alone. How important this becomes in a place like multicultural
Singapore, where we continue to welcome and live alongside new immigrants
and foreigners, jostling along together on our densely populated
island. An inclusive society is one where the arts and culture belong
to everyone and Singaporeans should be encouraged to embrace those
connections that identify them as a people, whether it is our food, architecture,
traditional customs, religious practices or language.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a7bfa49a-0fed-49b7-82ff-e189b94aaf22">
                  <a name="budget__id-a7bfa49a-0fed-49b7-82ff-e189b94aaf22"><!--a--></a>But as we increase and
extend the scale of inclusion, we also need to look at deepening
the nature of our participation. This means giving Singaporeans
a greater say in what our cultural heritage is. This should include
involvement in debates over the conservation and preservation of
our natural and historic spaces, as well as a greater recognition
of the languages we use to express our points of view. Our various
dialects, as well as Singlish, are also part of our unique cultural
identity, because culture is the way we live – it resides in our
bodies, it is in the way we communicate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-892ff4d5-f3ec-4cf1-a6e2-c9ee0518f08d">
                  <a name="budget__id-892ff4d5-f3ec-4cf1-a6e2-c9ee0518f08d"><!--a--></a>Our heritage is made up
of many different stories. The works of visual artists like Han Sai
Por and Donna Ong, the songs of local bands like Electrico and The
Great Spy Experiment, the writings of Isa Kamari, Alfian Sa'at and
Alvin Pang, the stories portrayed in the films of Royston Tan and
Boo Junfeng: all these not only give voice to the diverse experiences
of Singaporeans, they allow us to make connections with other people, places
and ideas. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-18012415-aeba-4518-9397-1c2d5009a168">

people who are connected to Singapore and to each other, we must
expect our artists to claim the space and licence to express those
varied, multiple and complex layers of the Singapore experience.
Only then can we pick up a book, listen to a song on the radio,
or catch a performance at the theatre, and say: "Yes, I feel that way
too. That's about us." </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-06eebe48-b0b2-4a49-9ed3-25522dcd626e"><!--a--></a>But Singaporeans are not a homogenous
bunch. Sometimes, we might say instead, "I never knew you felt that
way", or "I hadn't thought about it like that", or even "I'm confused!"
or "I disagree". But none of these responses stop you from feeling,
"That's about us." On the contrary, it deepens our understanding
of the often exhilarating and sometimes maddening complexity of
all human beings, including ourselves, and it reminds us what an
incredible opportunity our multicultural society offers for appreciating
that complexity in all its variety. And may I add, Mr Speaker, Sir,
that for these reasons, the Government should not shy away from
supporting creative expression that may even challenge its views.
To be truly inclusive, the Singapore Story must be the sum of stories
and experiences of all Singaporeans, and even non-Singaporeans who
have been touched by Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5b2cf2f0-9a6a-423e-9207-ef93348fede1">
                  <a name="budget__id-5b2cf2f0-9a6a-423e-9207-ef93348fede1"><!--a--></a>The second cultural strategy
towards building an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore is
developing Arts for Life. Oftentimes, we think of the arts as a
product. After all, that is how we encounter them most of the time,
right? A concert planned for, a book read on the MRT, an exhibition
visited on impulse. So, when we talk about "Arts for all", we typically
see it in terms of putting a cultural product into the hands of
consumers. But artworks are the result of a long and often painstaking
process. This process of art making challenges us to question, to
share perspectives and allow for differing points of view. It encourages
us to take risks and be accepting of failure. It serves as an excellent platform
to raise difficult issues for discussion, and through the process
of engagement, builds understanding and empathy. To say that these
processes take time is an understatement. In fact, one of the best
ways of looking at the arts is as something we make or encounter
throughout our lives. That is why the benefits of arts participation
for all, including children, young people, the elderly and vulnerable
segments of our society, cannot always be calculated in terms of
audience attendance or number of activities.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-cc13a17e-6248-45ba-ad6a-9b115a879bea"><!--a--></a>I have a story from Ms
Noorlinah Mohammed, who is an experienced arts educator currently
pursuing her PhD in the UK. She told me about teaching drama to
a group of Secondary 2 students in Singapore. There were several
cliques amongst the students in the class, and they were split along
language lines – Hokkien, Mandarin, Malay. Six weeks into the weekly
drama workshops, Noorlinah asked the students to create a 10-minute
performance. It was challenging. One boy, in particular, could barely communicate
in English. His life was tough. He had problems at home. He was
angry. He hated school, and he just thought drama was plain silly.
But he wrote an honest scene about a boy talking to his mum, expressing
the hurt caused by her neglect. It lasted 30 seconds. For a boy
who seldom expressed himself at all, a half-minute monologue is
a major feat. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-552a37b0-8079-4268-9f36-cdd090616968">
                  <a name="budget__id-552a37b0-8079-4268-9f36-cdd090616968"><!--a--></a>Later, the boy decided
he would perform his script in English. He attended school every
week just to work on this scene. His teachers were impressed that
drama was pulling him back to school. He worked hard at memorising
his script and, one day, he finally did. Despite the inadequacy
he felt speaking English, he found the courage to stand up in front
of others to tell a story that was deeply personal. The triumph
he must have felt in defeating the English language, for 30 whole
seconds! It was enough to give him a sense of achievement, beyond
school grades and exams. The following year, he went on to do digital
art, and his teacher says that he is doing quite well in that now.
I salute arts educators like Ms Noorlinah Mohammed, and the teachers
who were instrumental
in sustaining arts education in Ang Mo Kio Secondary School, where
this boy studies. They recognise that the arts can make a ground-level

Theatre for Seniors is a new group given a head start by theatre company
The Necessary Stage. In the last three years, this wonderful bunch
of more than 40 active seniors have been trained in theatre-making,
and they have brought their Mandarin, dialect and Malay skits to
over 1,000 elderly audiences in community centres and eldercare
homes across Singapore. Mrs Gladys Tan, who heads this group, tells
me that she is surprised that at her age, she has managed to find
a new lease of life. She has made new friends and it takes her back
to her pre-university days. Seen in this light, the arts have the
power to become catalysts of lifelong change. It has a role to play
in community building, in shifting attitudes and instigating positive
change. It empowers the individual, and makes them feel included
and relevant in our society.</p>

strategy towards building an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore
is the promotion of our local art. Ever since the release of the Renaissance
City Report in 2000, Singapore has been positioning itself as a
global arts hub. Culture had to be harnessed to make Singapore the
choice destination to visit, work and live. And we have done well
in this area. The Esplanade, the Singapore Arts Festival and the
Writer's Festival, and our museums consistently showcase the work
of major talents from around the world. </p>

cultural capital is not just about hosting other people's art or realising
their visions. We are not a satellite of London or New York. Sure,
we should enjoy great art from elsewhere – we just cannot adopt
it as our own. For my money, a hundred eye-popping Broadway plays
cannot compare to a single poignant local production in terms of
what it means to belong in and to Singapore today. In fact, it is because
there are powerful local works in Singapore, and a discerning audience
for them that attract international artists to present their work
here.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Tharman spoke about the need to preserve the

an integral role in helping us address this question of who we are
and what we stand for. How then can we better promote our art and
culture? Not just to the world, but, more importantly, to Singaporeans.
How do we break away from the age-old mentality that our artists
need to be proven internationally, before they are recognised back
home? How many Singaporeans, in fact, how many of us here in this
House are able to name more than a handful of local writers, visual
artists, musicians or choreographers?</p>

local musicians who lamented to me about the lack of opportunities
for home-grown bands to be seen and heard. One of them, Daniel Sassoon,
was so incensed by how indie bands have been sidelined from the
local scene that he approached his MP, Ms Indranee Rajah, about
the pressing need to develop more platforms to showcase local music.
As a result of that discussion, a free, outdoor gig featuring six
local indie bands called Lepa(r)k! was born. The name Lepa(r)k is
a pun on the Malay word <em class="ph i">lepak</em>, which is a colloquial for
"chill out" or "relax". Organised in conjunction with Tanglin-Cairnhill
CC, it was held last November in Tiong Bahru Park, and played to over
500 audiences. It was a small start, but it is an excellent example
of a ground-up initiative to promote the arts and widen audience
access to the works of local artists.</p>

take collective ownership of this process – it is not just MICA's

in your own constituency. Let us not be <em class="ph i">lepak</em> about this.
We need to hear more local music on radio, we need to see more local
films on the big screen, we need to see the works of our pioneering
artists in our museums and galleries, and promote local literature
in schools and libraries. We need to make ticket prices affordable
to all. Not all the work may be good – but some will be world-class.
That is not the point. If we take pride in our own cultural treasures,
we will encourage the production of more high quality work, and

the many stories that make up Singapore, when we give Singaporeans

Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join this debate.
I would like to thank the Finance Minister for delivering a Budget
that is inclusive and far-sighted. This year's Budget is one that
sets the foundation for several key challenges that we are facing
now and will intensify in the future. </p>

workers has led to good economic growth but it added strains on
our social infrastructure such as our public transport, recreational
facilities and schools, and this may have caused deep-seated grievances
amongst some Singaporeans. While these grievances must be heard
and addressed, whatever measures
the Government takes to address them must be calibrated and not
carry out to extremes to the detriment of our country and economy. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1436</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-705dc7dd-e40b-453a-b20e-59b159711001"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Labour Movement
is cognisant of the need to calibrate our reliance on foreign labour
and the importance of pushing for productivity to form the basis
and ensure any wage growth is sustainable in the long run. As a
labour Member of Parliament, I welcome the tightening of the foreign
workforce and the support given to companies, especially SMEs to
boost their productivity. The policy of tightening foreign labour
is thus an important step in redefining our engine of economic growth.
SMEs must adapt to this "new" normal to operate their business.
Peter Senge said, "The ability to learn faster than your competitors
may be the only sustainable competitive advantage". The challenges
that lie ahead for businesses, especially SMEs, which are to increase productivity
and send workers for training – will undoubtedly be a more challenging path
to take compared to just hiring foreign labour as a quick-fix solution.
SMEs will be affected by these structural changes and 2012 may see
SMEs making strong calls to the Government to review this policy.
I would like to call for the Government to resist such calls and
to "bite" the bullet in recalibrating the fabric of our workforce.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-402c527a-ea61-46e9-9a2e-c6fea62e49f4">

taking place, there will be many Singaporeans that will be affected
as companies restructure, especially given the fact that more than
half of our workforce is employed by SMEs. I would like to ask the
Minister for assurance that the Government will provide support
to Singaporean workers who are affected by restructuring. At the
same time, there will be a time lag as restructuring takes place
and there may be shortages of workers in the affected industries.
This may affect the level of service, and I hope Singaporeans will
be understanding and patient during this period. The key point is
that regardless of which policy we adopt, there will be repercussions. Reducing
the inflow of foreign workers will, hopefully, ease social tensions
but we will have to manage the other areas that will be impacted
by this move.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e1aff414-292b-407b-8bd9-bafa4c391865"><!--a--></a>Sir, the Labour Movement
will respond appropriately to this policy of tightening the inflow
of foreign workers. We will step up our efforts to push for higher
productivity through our Inclusive Growth Programme, Best Sourcing
Initiatives, re-training or up-skilling the workers, and encouraging
more women and elderly to enter the workforce. At the same time,
we will work with employers to ensure the road ahead is less thorny. The
workers, however, want employers to share their productivity gains
with them either in the form of better wages, higher bonuses or
better employment benefits.</p>

a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of.
In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of."
I am heartened by the measures announced to help the elderly, the
disabled and the low-income families cope with rising costs as we
strive to be an inclusive society. This is not the first time that
the plight of the low-wage workers has been the centre of attention
in Budget debates. Various initiatives had been implemented in the
past; many tripartite and working group committees formed and millions
of dollars had been spent to help low-wage workers. How did we do?
Despite the numerous measures taken, the income disparity continued
to widen, and this has been explained in greater detail by the Minister
of State, Dr Amy Khor. While many countries have implemented a minimum wage
policy, we have gone against the tide and resisted such move. Instead,
we have relied heavily on moral suasion to encourage employers to
pay fair wages to the workers and use Government social transfers
to reduce the income inequality. This year's Budget seems to echo
the same tune. </p>

low-wage workers earn better wages. While I am not advocating a
national minimum wage policy, I would like to call for the various Ministries
and Government agencies to look at their arsenal of policies, and
choose the appropriate levers to help low-wage workers earn fair
wages and employment terms. A good example is the effort by the
Ministry of Home Affairs, where together with its tripartite partners,
it has actually leveraged on the security licence to improve the security
industry that resulted in better wages for the security officers.
I also support the call by my labour comrade, Nominated Member of
Parliament Ms Mary Liew, for every Government Ministry to adopt
an industry where there are a large number of low-wage workers and
form a tripartite committee to look into improving their working
conditions and wages. I would like to stress again the urgency for
this to be done for every day we procrastinate, the longer will
be the injustice done to the low-wage workers. Gandhi once said,
"Poverty is the worst form of violence."</p>

even realising it, are underpaying for the cost of many essential
services such as cleaning, security and transport, and have caused
the salaries earned by these workers remaining low. A typical local
Town Council cleaner has to work for eight hours in a day to clean
four HDB blocks to earn $1,000 per month. Translated in another
way, the cleaner is paid about $10 to clean one typical HDB block in
two hours. If the cleaner is not WSQ-trained, he will receive an
even lower amount. Moreover, given the fact that 65% of our local
cleaners are aged 50 and above, many will find it difficult to clean
the required number of blocks within the stipulated time and, hence,
will be earning less than $1,000 per month. Sir, when I asked my
residents how much they expected to be paid to clean the corridors
of an HDB block in two hours, they quoted me $50 to $300, which
is far from what the cleaners are actually paid. I am not calling
for them to be paid this amount, but let us pay them according to
the job worth which has been partly depressed by the cheaper foreign
labour. </p>

sourcing has encouraged service providers to push down their prices
so that they could put up low bids that will win the tender. This
means that as companies cut corners, the salaries of these low-wage
workers, who are essentially the ones who are providing the bulk
of the services, are being cut. This gross injustice and slavery
of the poor must stop.</p>

that the Public Service Division is reviewing the salary for its
several thousand junior and mid-level civil servants where a pay
rise of between 5% and 15% is expected this month. Other than the
need to keep pace with those in the private sector to justify the
salary increment, there was no argument for such increase to commensurate
with productivity improvements or skills upgrading. Unfortunately, for
many low-wage workers, working based on contracts outsourced to
their companies, any wage increment must be justified by productivity
improvements and skills upgrading. Sir, the reality is that even
with training and higher productivity, any potential wage increase
would be negated by the business practice of cheap sourcing. As
such, not many low-wage workers will experience wage increments.</p>

80% of our locals working in the landscape industry shared the same
experience as well. The percentage of workers not getting wage increment in

the Government has pledged to take the lead in practising Best Sourcing
instead of cheap sourcing in the Civil Service sector. I would like
to urge the Government to do more for these workers in terms of
ensuring these workers get fair wages for their work. I would like
to call for the Government to do more to ensure Best Sourcing will
gain traction in the private sector as well. I want to repeat this
− for the Government to ensure Best Sourcing will gain traction
in the private sector as well. We must go beyond moral suasion,
advisories and guidelines, and consider making Best Sourcing to
be the market norm by making it compulsory for service buyers to
buy from accredited companies in those industries dominated by low-wage
workers. For example, let us make it compulsory for companies to
engage only accredited cleaning companies where we could then influence
the wages through the accreditation framework. </p>

the supply of foreign labour will force employers to look for other
sources of labour like the older workers. The initiatives announced
in the Budget also aim to make hiring older workers a more attractive
and viable option for employers. However, there are challenges that
need to be overcome as some employers may not have the perception
that "old is gold" and are reluctant to hire older workers. Sir,
reports in the newspapers have shown that companies such as Old
Chang Kee and Robinsons, who have been employing older workers for
years, see benefits as many of these workers are dedicated and loyal.
We must provide not only financial incentives for employers to hire
older workers, but the message of "old is gold" must be spread so
that employers are aware of the talent pool that they can tap on.
It is not only employers' mindsets that need changing, I feel that
more can be done to educate the public to be more tolerant of older
workers who are in the service sector and accept that while they may
be doing their best, they may not be as fast or nimble as younger
workers. </p>

of the <em class="ph i">Straits Times </em>yesterday entitled, "Unproductive to

this year's Budget is special. In my memory, all previous Budgets
had focused on the economy. This Budget has focused, instead, on helping
the elderly, the vulnerable and raising the income of low-wage earners.
In terms of the economy, in order to increase low-wage earners'
income, we must reduce our dependence on foreign workers, restructure
our economy and improve productivity so companies can pay more to
their workers. These measures may even slow down our economic growth.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b89cc854-5185-4ae3-a21f-2c0d319a8b5d">

after the 2011 elections, and it signals the future direction of the
Government in terms of governance and policies. From focusing on
the economy to social policy, from emphasising economic growth to
raising the wages of low-income Singaporeans, it is a major shift
in the Government€˜s thinking and mindset, and a formal display of
the Government's determination to change in the aftermath of the
2011 elections. In my opinion, this is a genuine people's Budget.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-118aa536-94d6-46db-8c36-05f652aaf90a">
                  <a name="budget__id-118aa536-94d6-46db-8c36-05f652aaf90a"><!--a--></a>Next, let me talk about
the content of the Budget. The focus of this year's Budget is to
improve productivity through economic restructure, and raise the
income of low-income Singaporeans through higher productivity. We
all hope we can raise workers' income, the faster the better, because
the cost of living has been increasing. However, it will be a long
and arduous journey to restructure the economy and increase productivity.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-95f62aa3-81a7-4a22-a48d-a79b2beea5d3"><!--a--></a>Currently, the Government's
strategy is to increase productivity by controlling the supply of
foreign labour and encourage SMEs to change their business and operation model.
Among measures designed to help SMEs, such as increasing absentee
payroll for staff training, productivity and innovation incentive
schemes and M&amp;A schemes, I wonder how many SMEs, who are already
in a vulnerable position, can truly benefit from these schemes and
transform successfully; get through the torment process of this economic
restructuring.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1440</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-fa02b8d3-1651-4ac4-8665-5a7aa93281ed"><!--a--></a>Most SMEs are run by Singaporeans; some
small businesses can only get by with enough profits to cover living
expenses. I am worried that many small businessmen will eventually
become unemployed, and I am also worried that the restructuring
will become a process of "the big fish eating up the small fish",
and the Government becomes an accomplice of "the big eating the
small". I urge the Government to be cautious in the economic restructuring
process.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7c99dd16-233f-480a-9ab5-bc576d417242">
                  <a name="budget__id-7c99dd16-233f-480a-9ab5-bc576d417242"><!--a--></a>I agree we should not
be over-reliant on foreign workers; we should not allow foreign workers
to take away Singaporeans' rice bowls. This is not protectionism,
but a responsibility of the Government to the people. However, we
also know that we have limited population, and we need foreign workers
to fill up the gap in our domestic labour market. It is not easy
to strike a balance between the two. The Government is applying a
two-pronged approach by manipulating the Dependency Ratio Ceiling
(DRC) and the foreign worker levy. I think, based on current experience,
these two mechanisms are blunt policy tools which do not differentiate
between the different needs of various industries and do not set
out customised DRC and foreign worker levy. I will discuss the issue
further during MOM's COS debate.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e4cd347-f18a-41dc-be51-66db8f931a46">
                  <a name="budget__id-9e4cd347-f18a-41dc-be51-66db8f931a46"><!--a--></a>However, the Government
should note that, as policies that attempt to compel SMEs to transform
and raise productivity by limiting foreign workers kick in, foreign
workers will become crucial to the survival of companies. Those
who are able to comply with the Government's requirements and continue
to employ foreign workers will gain the upper hand. Those who cannot
fulfil Government's requirements and, hence, are unable to employ
foreign workers and, at the same time, are unable to change their
way of doing business and do not benefit from the Government's assistance
package, will eventually decline or even close shop. Hence, in terms
of foreign worker policies and controls, the Government must be
fair to all companies, regardless of whether they are medium-sized or
small-sized companies.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-7043ad5b-f971-4ef9-9b13-05a6f20dc363"><!--a--></a>If one of the objectives
of limiting the number of foreign workers is to prevent foreigners
from taking away Singaporeans' rice bowls, then besides foreign
workers, the Government should also take note of how issuing Employment
Passes affects the employment market and raise the overall productivity
of companies. For example, in 2011, the Government issued 176,000
Employment Passes, this is 63,000 more than the 113,000 Employment
Passes issued in 2010.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5f7a5c65-4853-45bc-b262-0501a104c9c3">
                  <a name="budget__id-5f7a5c65-4853-45bc-b262-0501a104c9c3"><!--a--></a>If the trend of rapidly
increasing Employment Passes continues, how does that affect Government's
objective of reducing reliance on foreign labour? In addition, the Government
should also learn its lesson, and not be too lax in approving permanent resident
applications, as the practice of being overly relaxed in granting
permanent resident status to foreigners in the past few years has
also added pressure to Singaporeans in finding jobs. This is because
permanent residents do not need to apply for work permit, and are
not restricted by the Government's limit on foreign workers. The
number of applications approved for permanent residents has decreased
from 79,000 in 2008 to 29,000 in 2010. Looking at the current situation,
I think the Government should limit the number of approvals for
permanent resident applications to 30,000 a year. </p>

also commits to significantly increase the budget of the Ministry
of Health, from the current budget of $4 billion a year, to $8 billion
a year in the next five years. As the population ages, the medical
care required by the elderly and other related expenses have become
a heavy financial burden for ordinary Singaporean families, the move
by Government to significantly increase spending to relieve the burden
of the people is in the right direction.</p>

relaxed the requirements for applying for subsidies. Previously,
patients with monthly per capita household income of $2200 do not
get any subsidies when they stay in community hospitals; now, they
can get a 45% subsidy on hospitalisation. This is an expansion of
the pool of Singaporeans who can benefit from subsidies, from the
previous benchmark of per capita household income of $1,500 to lower
middle-income Singaporeans. </p>

debate, I spoke on the Government's move to implement means testing
in providing public service and social assistance. I said, "If the
target of our healthcare assistance scheme are households with monthly
per capita income of $1,000 or less, then does it mean that households
with monthly per capita income of $1,001 do not need similar assistance?
Certainly, low-income Singaporeans need help, but does that mean
the sandwiched class middle-income 'new poor' who face unemployment,
wage cuts, asset depreciation and bordering on low income do not
need help?"</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-23940642-c552-4180-954c-027b6d53a972">

willing to adopt new benchmarks in giving out subsidies, and relieve
the healthcare burden of the middle-income sandwiched class – this
is a welcomed change in attitude. The Government should regularly
review all the benchmarks for subsidies that require means testing,
especially in healthcare services and social services, to avoid
gaps in our social safety net, where the sandwiched class is unable
to receive the assistance needed.</p>

the Singapore Spirit, the willingness to work hard and determination
to overcome difficulties, for a better future for our children.
They should enjoy the fruits of Singapore's success. Our country

                  </span>:
Sir, thank you for the opportunity to make my maiden speech at the
Budget debate. Let me say at the outset that my reaction to the
Budget Statement is mixed. Starting with what should be commended,
I am encouraged that the Government is heeding the calls to address
social realities on the ground. The Budget has more heart. Stepping
up social policy to build a "fair and inclusive society" is something
much needed. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1442</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e453586b-c218-4a5f-95bf-e3d6a3804851"><!--a--></a>This year there are major firsts – bus
transportation subsidies, Special Employment Credits and the permanent
GST Voucher scheme. There is also substantial focus on boosting
the financial security of seniors and helping those with special
needs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bfac3ec1-50c7-44f6-b50b-de1bbd2275ea">
                  <a name="budget__id-bfac3ec1-50c7-44f6-b50b-de1bbd2275ea"><!--a--></a>I know that reactions
have been generally positive to the social aspects of the Budget. But
still I feel a bit underwhelmed. Let me explain why. First, there
is no larger vision on what Budget 2012 is founded on. On the economic
side, the Budget needs to take reference from what our new economic
model might look like, and, particularly, how we see ourselves doing
business and creating value in future. Yes, we need to wean ourselves
off cheap foreign labour, and we should aim for higher productivity
and innovation. But we do need a theme beyond the need to "restructure
to sustain growth". Of concern to me is that our nation ends up
producing goods that the developed world, in their debt-laden state,
cannot afford, and the developing world would not buy. It could be
a case of incumbents like us overshooting what the customers want,
and not being open to disruptive innovations. Increasingly, our
new customers are in emerging Asia. How then are we positioning
ourselves to be able to produce products and services that will
be demanded by these under-served populations?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-96ea310d-eabd-4b52-a824-083dcbfdaeb1">
                  <a name="budget__id-96ea310d-eabd-4b52-a824-083dcbfdaeb1"><!--a--></a>On the social side, we
likewise need to be able to take reference from a new shared vision
and new social compact. Again, without a larger vision or strategy
on which our Budgets are founded on, the Budget would tend to come
across as somewhat tired, even while new initiatives are announced
and welcomed. In fact, many elements in the Budget seem to be about
continuing with policy U-turns, playing catch-up, and avoiding future
costs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ab84ea97-8d4f-42fe-b989-545195571e98">
                  <a name="budget__id-ab84ea97-8d4f-42fe-b989-545195571e98"><!--a--></a>Certainly, we must strive
to be inclusive. But we cannot do this only through social policies
and programmes. Inclusiveness is fundamentally about how our people
treat one another, not just about what the Government can do for
its people, which, do not get me wrong, is still important because
the Government represents the people. Besides, inclusiveness is
more a mindset and value system, which the Government needs to lead
the way in but cannot deliver alone. Inclusiveness here is a sense
of belonging, of being respected and valued for who you are, not
what you should be, and ultimately, being always treated with equal
dignity and compassion, no matter how old, how rich, how educated,
what titles you hold, and how different you are. People are the ends,
not the means.</p>

must be something that Singaporeans firstly want. Otherwise, the
Government's efforts will be futile. You can give the Silver Housing Bonus
to seniors, but other residents may reject the building of studio
apartments and services for seniors in their midst. You can give
the Special Employment Credit, but employers may refuse to hire
and fit jobs to suit the disabled and senior workers. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-231ffb81-ac02-4850-b389-5c9c7990aee0"><!--a--></a>Recent signs are that
we are still not an inclusive society. In fact, I would venture
to say we are in a social recession. We see this generally in the
weakening of individual resilience, the loosening of family bonds
and a decline in community cohesiveness. The symptoms include rising
levels of mental ill-health, loneliness and increased addictions, and
it is caused by the stresses of living, and by individualism and
materialism. More objectively, we should establish a basket of social
indicators that we track each year to measure the social health
of the country. Sir, this social health index would be the social sector's
equivalent of the GDP indicator for the economy. But short of having
this, I simply looked at the social outcomes from the wider list
of desired outcomes of the Ministries in the Budget Book and compared
the achievements of the relevant KPIs of the latest year with those of the previous
year. On balance, the number of desired outcomes that worsened was
marginally more than the number that improved. And these KPIs excluded
many of the relevant ones. </p>

in the past, we would immediately be responsive and pull all our
energies together as a nation to have an economic committee conduct
a major revamp of our economic vision and strategies. We had four
recession years in independent Singapore, and four corresponding
major economic committees, with different names, to deal with them.
On the social side, we have had only two – Singapore 21 and Remaking
Singapore. And even if you do not believe, like I do, that we are
in a social recession, I think it is critical for another major
public exercise. Sir, I propose we convene a Social Review Committee
to create a new shared vision and new social compact, which were
missing from Budget 2012. We cannot tackle individual issues in a
compartmentalised way, as all systems relate to one another. Even

the debate on the President's Address last October, said that after
last year's General Election, a committee was set up to review social
policies comprehensively within Government. Sir, such a major effort
cannot be entirely Government-driven. It must be equally community-driven.
We live in uncertain times and face a complex array of social issues,
many of which the Government has limited direct control of. Hence,
citizens need to be firmly engaged in tackling the challenges and opportunities,
reflect on their ingrained values and habits, and be part of the
hard problem-solving and opportunity-enhancing work that produces
societal progress. In Singapore, one key challenge is the growing
dependency on the Government to solve all problems, big and small,
where the community disowns roles it can and should take on. We
need to break out of this unhealthy dynamic. The Government, itself,
would need to learn a new type of adaptive leadership. How do I
see this exercise progressing? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a20ac8c3-682d-454e-954d-f96307eb1eae">
                  <a name="budget__id-a20ac8c3-682d-454e-954d-f96307eb1eae"><!--a--></a>Firstly, this exercise
needs to be co-led by Government and civil society – at all levels, including
at the Steering Committee. There should be social dialogue groups
with public, private and people sector representatives being at
the table with equal status having deep discussions on a variety
of social issues and reviewing fundamental current assumptions.
Secondly, the dialogue environment must be safe. The Government
must be prepared to be transparent and participants enabled to share
freely and have equal access to data and information. Everyone needs
to feel and be a part of the change. Thirdly, the committee should
evolve into a permanent platform, or even a movement. This gives
social partners a continued platform to co-create with the State,
and the Government a way to harness the energies of the community.</p>

must be an articulation of the shared vision and values that most
Singaporeans would subscribe to, and a broad architecture of how
we want our society to be organised, with clarity on the roles and
functions of the state versus community. Any strategic blueprint
from the exercise must be a living document that is dynamic and
evolving, as many policies and programmes require experimentation, learning
and refinements before they work. </p>

on some aspects which I think this exercise could cover. I will just
touch on five: (i) a shared vision and new social compact; (ii)
defining Government-to-People
relations; (iii) defining People-to-People relations; (iv) rethinking
our social policies; and (v) improving diagnosis of social realities.</p>

               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e2986cca-1323-4ce7-9571-e2501ef36355">
                  <a name="budget__id-e2986cca-1323-4ce7-9571-e2501ef36355"><!--a--></a>First, a shared vision
and new social compact. Here, there are many questions that beg
to be answered. What are the social ethos and values that shape
our society? What is our conception of the good life? How do we
deal with each other, with increasingly divergent interests? What
are the principles and foundations of the new social compact? What
is the Government's role? For me, I believe in a more communitarian
society, with a more egalitarian ethos. The State must do more to
protect citizens from the vagaries of the market, to ensure a more
sustainable level of distributive justice and build social infrastructure.
At the same time, the State needs to do less in social and cultural activities.
Government should refrain from undertaking activities that the community, the
family and the individuals can take on. Instead, the State should
step in only when the initiatives clearly exceed the capacity of
individuals or private groups acting independently. But these are
only my beliefs. I want to hear from others.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-14f68e68-f2fd-4c5d-892c-f8cb3ff2182f">
                  <a name="budget__id-14f68e68-f2fd-4c5d-892c-f8cb3ff2182f"><!--a--></a>Secondly, in the area
of Government-to-People relations, I would advocate that the Government
focuses more on enabling and empowering citizens and civil society
to do more. This is related to my last point. Enabling means building
capability and developing leadership in the community. Empowering
means a real ceding of power, decision-making and ownership of projects,
with a tolerance for a degree of messiness and inefficiency. The
language from Government is so far more of communication and engagement,
not empowerment. Power is often seen as a zero-sum game – the more you
have, the less I have. But I believe, instead, that power is something
that can be grown and shared. We need to put more power back into
the people, both into designing their futures and into taking charge
of what affects their everyday lives, like how to design their neighbourhoods,
use common spaces, site facilities, and restrict noise levels and
other negative externalities. We should devolve power to the communities and
grassroots, away from the more centralised methods of today. There
are good process tools that community leaders can use to help people
make good decisions – through community visioning and planning,
and large group decision making centred on community values linking
the selves to groups and finally to the community. The National
Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre is experimenting with some of
these tools on the ground through our Asset-Based Community Development
approach. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e26aa4bc-1148-4ba9-844d-721be1396e20">
                  <a name="budget__id-e26aa4bc-1148-4ba9-844d-721be1396e20"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, I return to the
theme of inclusiveness, or People-to-People relations. I believe the
core value of inclusiveness is that everybody has something worthwhile
to contribute. When you look at kids play a game, sometimes they
exclude somebody in the group from playing, and it is often because
they think that the kid is not good enough and would make them lose.
Likewise, when a company does not hire a senior or someone with
special needs, it is thinking it will lose; in this case, lose money.
When we speak the language of inclusiveness, we must change our
mental models. The underlying philosophy is that each individual
has some fullness. Every person we classify as needy has something
to contribute, and we need to encourage inclusion by recognising
potential, not discounting it. For example, seniors have experience,
autistic persons have the eye for detail, and poor families have
strengths to be harnessed. When we design policies and schemes,
we must always take this strength-based approach. Otherwise, programmes
like the Special Employment Credit, which is certainly useful, would
not work.</p>

society is a society that gives, not just takes. We need to mobilise
entire communities, build relationships among local assets for mutual problem-solving and
mutual self-help. In any case, while the Government can cater to material
needs, the people need to bring in the soul and cater to social,
emotional and even spiritual needs.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1445</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ab3b92e8-ad75-491b-a4d2-f3800d7eba99"><!--a--></a>Fourthly, I think we need
a fundamental rethink of our social policies, particularly our social
safety nets. The Government's reflex reaction is that strong safety
nets erode economic incentives, undermine competitiveness, are unsustainable
and increase moral hazard. There is, of course, truth in that. But
we know that it is a matter of balance, and I acknowledge the Government's
efforts and Prime Minister's reassurance that the Government will
redress the situation. But I think we need a more radical review,
and not merely build on current policies and programmes. We need
to find a new social contract that achieves a better balance between
growth and equity, and between individual responsibility and social
insurance.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0b08424e-0880-446c-95e1-2ef229ffed4e">
                  <a name="budget__id-0b08424e-0880-446c-95e1-2ef229ffed4e"><!--a--></a>The realities today are
different. Economically, there is much more uncertainty. In our first
30 years we had one recession; in the last 15 years we had three.
The Gini coefficient continues its relentless climb, and it does
not even take into account the wealth gap. The sandwiched class
are more stressed. Inadequacy in old age savings is showing its cracks.
Social mobility has fallen. Inflation is persistently high. So,
for example, I believe the balance between self insurance and pooled
insurance is skewed in healthcare, with the Government constantly
forcing more into Medisave, a form of self-insurance. Singaporeans
are not pooling their healthcare risks enough. Some 55% of healthcare spending
is financed directly by patients; much higher than the case in other
developed countries in Asia. It is economically inefficient to have
such high precautionary savings, much of which may never be used,
except to be passed on to their kids.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1fee2c68-c27d-426c-a777-20cf39b8ccd8">
                  <a name="budget__id-1fee2c68-c27d-426c-a777-20cf39b8ccd8"><!--a--></a>Likewise, we have used
housing as a key way to store up retirement savings. We are now
a victim of that success and cannot seem to unlock its value. Even
with the Silver Housing Bonus, most would still use their existing
flat as catastrophic insurance, downgrading or leasing back only
when desperate. It would have been much better if we had controlled
housing asset inflation, kept the first home much more affordable,
at around three times the buyer's annual income, and allowed much
less of the CPF to be used for housing.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d708b9bb-db06-452c-8a5c-1e8cffe6a452">
                  <a name="budget__id-d708b9bb-db06-452c-8a5c-1e8cffe6a452"><!--a--></a>I am also very concerned
about the plight of people facing insufficient or declining incomes,
as well as income inequality. Unfortunately, education, the great
potential leveller, has increasingly become a positional good that
only the well-to-do can afford. We also need better schemes to protect
the vulnerable from the risks of unemployment and income loss, while
avoiding moral hazard. Singapore Perspectives 2012, organised by
the Institute of Policy Studies, threw up many suggestions worth
considering. And yet another major area of concern is that inflation
has risen so fast. We need new strategies to keeping costs down,
beyond appreciating the currency, so that people can get by and
young couples find it less challenging to get married and start
a family. Let it not be said that Singapore is only a good place
to live in only if you are rich.</p>

increased social spending for the future. If it is part of a shared
vision to strengthen social cohesion, I am sure the more well-to-do
Singaporeans can be convinced to finance this with higher income
taxes, instead of needing to increase GST again. The era of racing
to the bottom in global tax competition is over. But, first, I am
sure people would need to be convinced that we are exhausting other options, like re-allocating
budgets across Ministries and maximising the Net Investment Return
Contribution, which I believe has headroom to grow while preserving
the real value of our reserves.</p>

to be a short one, is that we need to have better data, information
and knowledge of social realities, and evaluation of past and current programmes.
One major complaint from academics, private sector analysts and
people working in the non-profit field is that there is a dearth
of data that will help give us greater insights. The Prime Minister
promised last October that more information would be released, but
I think the pace is not fast enough. May I suggest that the Government adopts
a negative list approach to information? Just decide what cannot
be released, and make a commitment to release everything else.</p>

that I have with our Budget statements in general, not just this
Budget 2012, is that there is little evaluation of past policies
and programmes. What is the effectiveness of redistributive programmes
like Workfare or GST transfers? There is a lack of detailed research
on how families are coping on the ground. For this, we need longitudinal
studies to track people over time because cross sectional data gives
an incomplete picture of reality. Likewise, there is also very little
evaluation of incentive programmes. Have they worked? What is the
deadweight loss? There is sometimes a perverse effect in providing
incentives. Studies have shown that people who are rewarded for
altruism become less altruistic. Sometimes, incentives mark the
thing you want to sell as a bad deal, and make it even harder to
sell.</p>

these fundamental proposals for a major review out of optimism,
not despair. Optimism because we are here today working from a position
of strength, including, quite importantly, fiscal strength. Optimism
also because I think the majority of Singaporeans would embrace
the language of inclusion. Our young have impressed me with their
high sense of social consciousness. Also, our social recession is
nowhere a social depression and, indeed, on many indicators, we
fare much better than many other countries. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-3150488f-7ca2-432f-a6ad-422dd3b5d0f9"><!--a--></a>But the world is changing
fast in a way that we cannot ignore. In particular, there is an
imperative to deal with the income divide and wealth gap, which
has clearly manifested in growing political problems – the Occupy
movements, the Arab Spring uprising, and increasing labour and political
instability in many countries. We are changing domestically and
politically as well, as outlined by many Members in this House.
It is my firm belief that we need a different type of leadership,
an adaptive leadership. This is not a straightforward kind of leadership.
But if we succeed, we will find each person, individually or in
groups, having something unique to offer to the community, because,
not in spite of, their differences. And when each of us starts contributing
meaningfully to the communities that we live in, we will feel more
fully citizens of this country and this is when a place to stay
becomes a home. And maybe then, we can rely less on incentives to
induce the right behaviours. And maybe then the Minister for Finance
will not need to have to decide whether to raise GST or to raise income
taxes. Sir, on balance, I support the Budget.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mdm
Halimah Yacob</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I rise in support of this Budget.
I went on a house visit last night and I asked residents for their
feedback on the Budget. Except for one family, the rest had no adverse
comments and were generally happy with the Budget. I have three
points to make on this Budget.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1447</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-70d2fbf7-36ba-4932-904f-6e26c62efffb">
                  <a name="budget__id-70d2fbf7-36ba-4932-904f-6e26c62efffb"><!--a--></a>First, I note that whilst
most Members in the debate strongly endorsed the increased social
spending which they see as a necessity, a couple have expressed
reservations whether this could result in over-reliance on the Government.
These are valid concerns. However, I see this Budget as giving a
strong boost and support to self-reliance, independence and employment.
Consider the employment of older Singaporeans and those with special
needs. By incentivising employers to employ older workers and the disabled
through the SEC, the Budget aims at boosting employment, and therefore helps
our elderly and disabled achieve independence and a greater sense
of self-worth, which no amount of social assistance can provide.
People want to lead dignified lives that come from earning an income
through their own efforts. By making it easier for employers to
employ them and making it worthwhile for them to work through the
WIS and the increased CPF rate for older workers, the Government
helps to boost independence and self-reliance. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5b9d6725-65bf-410b-ac83-d2d4f89b5af0">
                  <a name="budget__id-5b9d6725-65bf-410b-ac83-d2d4f89b5af0"><!--a--></a>The Government is also
sending a strong signal that everyone has a part to play, including
those who need help. It is clear that these Budget measures alone
will not make a great change in the employment of older workers
or those with special needs. Employers have to take the leadership
by redesigning their work processes, introducing technology and
changing their perceptions to view such workers as a resource and
not a liability. Take the case of Tony who suffers from polio and
who works in the dessert stall of a social enterprise called "Dignity
Kitchen". Dignity Kitchen went to great length to devise their own
training programme and modify the workplace to make it disabled friendly,
including installing a special machine to make it easier for a disabled
worker to make bowls of noodles to serve customers. Tony will benefit
from the WIS as well as a number of his colleagues who suffer from
various disabilities, from hearing impairment to autism, some of
whom are below 35 years old. His employer will be so relieved to know
that his efforts to provide employment opportunities to the disabled
is strongly supported by the Government and he will be able to enjoy
the Special Employment Credit of 16%, which is a significant savings
for him. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-96b2d3d3-d8c9-4de8-ad5e-74aed9557388"><!--a--></a>Second, this Budget marks
a shift in the Government's approach to middle-income earners. Greater
social protection has now been extended to them as they too are affected
by the rising cost of living, especially those sandwiched between
caring for their children and their frail elderly parents. I have
a resident in my constituency, a PMET, with two children and who
is paying for his degree programme at a private educational institute.
When his father's dementia worsened and he could no longer keep
him at home and had to send him to a nursing home, he really struggled
to pay for the nursing home fees as he did not qualify for the subsidies.
This year's Budget will bring him great relief as he will now pay
lower fees. Indeed, with the new subsidy framework in place, two
thirds of all Singaporeans and 85% of our elderly will now receive
subsidies. This is a significant improvement and will benefit many
middle-income families.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-32ce00ac-05d8-4ff7-91a7-74a2bfd8e1df"><!--a--></a>Johannes Jutting, the
OECD's Head of Poverty recently wrote in an article entitled "Rise
of the Global Middle Class". He said, "In today's volatile situation,
most of the middle
class is one income shock from being pushed back into poverty."
To counter this risk, he suggested "that social security programmes
should be gradually extended beyond social assistance". Our situation
in Singapore is not as severe as what he had described. Nevertheless,
we know that with an ageing population and rising costs, the middle-income
earners are also feeling squeezed and greater Government support
in healthcare will certainly help to reduce some of their concerns.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-117af96f-aebe-4242-a08d-c8ead41d89e2"><!--a--></a>Sir, other than healthcare,
PMETs will also need stronger support in job placements and retraining.
Many had worked only in one sector almost their entire career and
find it extremely difficult to switch to another sector or another
industry because of lack of skills or knowledge of the jobs available
and, in many cases, also the difficulty of having to adjust to a
much lower pay. It is not so easy for an engineer, for instance,
who has worked for 20 years in an electronic sector, to switch to
a sales or marketing job, but it is still possible with support
and assistance. We do need greater labour market intervention measures
to assist displaced PMETs.</p>

that this Budget is pro-family and, more specifically, pro-children.
Many more children will now be subsidised with the raising of the
family income level to $3,500 for student care, and the introduction
of the PCI for the enhanced subsidies under KIFAS, CFAC and student
care. More mothers could now go to work or remain in the workforce
knowing that their children will be taken care of. This continued focus
on education and children's development is important to ensure that
social mobility continues to be not only a hope but an achievable
reality for our low-income Singaporeans. I dare say that many of
us are here today in this Chamber because of social mobility. Although
an MCYS survey shows that social mobility is still alive today, it
also warned that we cannot expect the same level of mobility for
subsequent cohorts.</p>

an issue raised by many women with me and which I hope that the
NEA could look into. Many women from our low-income and needy families
want to work to earn an income to support their family or to supplement
the family income. Quite a number are also single mothers and may
be the sole breadwinners. They want to be self-reliant and avoid
having to depend on the Government for social assistance. Despite
our enhanced childcare subsidies, many of these women cannot work
outside their home because they may not only have young children
to take care of but also frail elderly parents. Some are also suffering
from disabilities or other illnesses which make it difficult for
them to secure outside employment.</p>

of these women could earn an income is through running a home-based
food catering business. They love cooking, something which they
have been doing for years for their own families. However, recently
many had received warning letters from the NEA and they are worried
and confused, and their source of income has been disrupted.</p>

I was invited by DEWI, the women's arm of the Singapore Malay Chamber
of Commerce, which held a dialogue jointly organised with <em class="ph i">Berita Harian</em>.
This was a dialogue session which was attended by more than 300
women. The women strongly appealed to the Government to relax its
rules prohibiting home kitchens. They were told to cook at central
kitchens which are commercial cooking facilities but many cannot
afford the rent and other related costs, and because of their caregiving
responsibilities they cannot work outside their homes. So using
a central kitchen is not a viable option for them.</p>

NEA's concerns over hygiene, safety and neighbours' complaints.
Therefore, in their proposal, they had suggested various measures
to address these concerns, including even devising a contraption
to absorb smoke, grease and smell from their cooking. Sir, I would
like to urge NEA to look into this proposal. The spirit of this
Budget is to build an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore.
It is in this context then that we should view the appeal from our
needy women to allow them to operate home-based kitchens. Their
main desire is to be self-reliant and to enjoy a steady stream of
income doing something which they are really good at, which is cooking.
Through this, many of them aspire and hope to build a better future
for themselves and their children. </p>

women, Sir, I note our efforts to attract more women back to work through
the Flexi Works! scheme and the WOW! Fund. Thousands of women have
gone back to work under the NTUC's Back-To-Work programme since
it started in 2007. But these two schemes have been in place for
a few years now, so it is timely to review and reassess how to make
them even more effective and relevant to the needs of businesses and
our women as feedback suggests that an overhaul is needed. Also,
with the cutback on foreign manpower, non-working mothers will become
a very valuable resource for employers to tap on and we could do
more to facilitate their employment.</p>

the IPS Singapore Perspectives 2012, Mr Tharman said, and I quote:
"Building a fair and inclusive society is at the heart of our role
as government. It is about both social and economic strategies,
as they are bound inextricably together." I want to echo that point,
which I agree with completely. A balanced social and economic development
is the only sustainable model of growth. Without economic growth, Government
will not have the means to collectively invest in people and infrastructure to
sustain social growth. On the other hand, unbalanced economic growth
will cause inequality to widen which will gnaw at the very sinews
of our society and, over time, undermine economic growth.</p>

far because of heavy investment in social capital. Not just through
this year's Budget but since the time we became independent, we
have invested so heavily in education, housing and health. But we
were able to do it because we were pulling together – the Government
taking the lead, with the strong support of the people. We need
to strengthen this social compact, not just between the Government
and the people but also between the people themselves. Even as we
debate about how this Budget will help create a more inclusive society,
we have to agree that this is a shared responsibility. Everyone
has a part to play. Take the case of Tony, who I mentioned earlier.
Tony lives in Yishun and travels by bus every day to his workplace
at Kaki Bukit. That is an example of true grit and spirit of this
person. What is sad is that Tony, who suffers from polio and has
difficulty walking, often has to stand in the bus because no one
wants to give up their seat to him. How wonderful would it be if
each and every one of us does our part to make someone else's life
a bit better by simple everyday acts of kindness.</p>

create an inclusive society. We need socially responsible employers.
We need strong VWOs who, because of their very nature, will be better
able to galvanise people and resources much more effectively than
the Government is able to do. We need those who need help to help
themselves by going for
training programmes and job placements or by supporting other measures
to support self-reliance. Finally, Sir, we need Singaporeans to
be engaged, involved and concerned about the well-being of their
fellowmen and to do their part to make ours a truly inclusive society.
On this note, Sir, I support the Budget.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
First and foremost, let me congratulate and thank the Deputy Prime Minister
Tharman and his team for a very well thought through Budget for
2012 – one that is not only inclusive but with a heart for the elderly
and the less privileged in our society, but also sets a very clear
direction for the future. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-80734472-ecbb-4cf0-bc72-a09c00cc5660">
                  <a name="budget__id-80734472-ecbb-4cf0-bc72-a09c00cc5660"><!--a--></a>What strikes me most is
the overall theme of this year's Budget – "An inclusive society,
a stronger Singapore". The Government has set forth a whole array
of social and economic strategies to achieve this. However, this
is no easy task and will always be work-in-progress. It will take
Singapore many years, or even generations, to evolve into a truly
inclusive and strong society.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d5da7931-88b5-4215-ae9b-22ad844f8380">
                  <a name="budget__id-d5da7931-88b5-4215-ae9b-22ad844f8380"><!--a--></a>There is no doubt that
Singapore has done well economically. We have transformed ourselves
from a Third World, to a First World country in just over four decades,
in spite of our lack of natural resources and many other challenges.
Our strength is in our ability to transform and adapt to the ever
changing environment, both regionally and internationally. Besides
making Singapore economically strong by constantly upgrading and
restructuring our economy, there is also an urgent need to make
Singapore strong socially, by building up social resilience among
Singaporeans. However, we are currently still far from the ultimate
goal of being a socially resilient Singapore, as evident by the
responses of many Singaporeans to many recent events, including
the SARS and H1N1 outbreak.</p>

published in the <em class="ph i">Singapore Medical Journal</em> in 2003, entitled "Heroes
and Heroines of the War on SARS", by Professor Chee Yam Cheng. And
I quote:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph hcProceduralText" id="id-8120db96-637c-473e-82fe-bfdf5d468ef6">

when the SARS outbreak began. Many of those falling victims to the
disease were colleagues. What made it especially difficult were
the prejudices nurses faced. Taxis and even buses refused to stop
at the hospital. Neighbours did not want to ride the lifts with them.
At any packed food court, there would always be a seat for a Tan
Tock Seng nurse. Queue lines would shorten when a nurse joined that
queue."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a36723a9-2789-4dd8-9a87-0ab02e455954">

an unpleasant experience demonstrating the loathsome attributes
of humankind in challenging times when I was working at ground zero
in the heat of the SARS outbreak. Indeed, there is a real fear that
fragmentation will occur in times of adversity and major catastrophes.
The Government has been fostering social resilience among Singaporean
and this effort must be strengthened to ensure Singapore can cope
with any future attacks on our social fabric.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7d13a1bf-9d4e-442e-9a9b-87003921b485">
                  <a name="budget__id-7d13a1bf-9d4e-442e-9a9b-87003921b485"><!--a--></a>Let us go back to 2011,
where the last GE introduced a new word into the political vocabulary
of Singaporeans – "a new political norm". We had witnessed several milestones
in the political arena, both in the ruling party, as well as in
the opposition. After the elections, everyone – politicians, people
and society – agreed that there is a need to forge a new social
compact based on this new political norm. One where the Government
is more receptive, more consultative and more engaging. One where
the populace is
more vocal and more aware of its rights and not afraid to voice
its opinion. This, I think, is inevitable with a more educated,
aware and developed society.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1451</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-23317775-8013-476b-8297-f5420d9791d5"><!--a--></a>While a new social compact
is forged upon this new political norm, there must be a common consensus
on the tasks that lie ahead and what we, as Singaporeans, and not just
the Government alone, must do. This is something that we have often
heard – the Government cannot do this alone, we must work hand-in-hand.
And this is no less true. An often heard Chinese adage tells us
that one chopstick is broken easily, but 10 chopsticks, together,
make for strength in unity. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-90df5299-a731-4c95-9ed7-172388620c60">
                  <a name="budget__id-90df5299-a731-4c95-9ed7-172388620c60"><!--a--></a>Yes, while we have a right
to be heard, and for questions to be answered, let us, as a nation,
be very clear about the challenges we will be facing in the future.
We have heard so much about the Silver Tsunami and calls by many
parliamentarians in the House to face this impending reality head
on. To put things in perspective, by 2030, 20% of Singapore's population
would be above the age of 65. That is close to 800,000 to 1,000,000
people, more than the total number of people living in Ang Mo Kio,
Bedok, Tampines and Sengkang today. The infrastructure and the planning
strategies needed to address this ageing problem take time to be
realised and we really need to act now before it is too late. We
need to take care of our own elderly population and that is why we
need to understand the urgency of ensuring that there is infrastructure
available to support the elderly now and in the future. We are all
getting older. Tomorrow will be our turn. Growing old is something
inevitable for every one of us. To put it very bluntly, we are actually
doing this to prepare for ourselves in the future.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-56c5e61c-1973-4de1-8082-e52eae9812fc">
                  <a name="budget__id-56c5e61c-1973-4de1-8082-e52eae9812fc"><!--a--></a>However, two recent events
have made me realised that while the Government can plan to build
the infrastructure, there needs to be a paradigm shift in the mindsets
of people such that we are all attuned and aligned to the problems
ahead. All of us, I believe, have heard of the Woodlands and Toh
Yi incidents, where residents protested against the building of
elderly facilities, such as the day care centre and studio apartments
respectively. I do agree that residents in Woodlands and Toh Yi
have a right to be heard and their views should have been sought
about the building and siting of the proposed facilities. But when
I heard some of the reasons cited, I was stunned and disappointed.
What alarms me most is what we coined the NIMBY, or Not In My Backyard
syndrome – where people refuse to have facilities sited near their
homes, but far away. Other past examples include: in 2010, residents
in Pasir Ris and Tampines objected to plans to build rental flats
close to their blocks and, in 2008, Serangoon Gardens residents
were up in arms when a proposal was made to convert a disused school
into dormitories for foreign workers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-74a164f1-7013-48df-b7f8-9b7a35b57caa">
                  <a name="budget__id-74a164f1-7013-48df-b7f8-9b7a35b57caa"><!--a--></a>The problem lies in the
fact that we do not enjoy the same sort of luxury of space as in
other larger countries. Singapore is a small country. Space in Singapore
is scarce and we need to optimise land use as much as possible.
If we do not build it here, then where? What if everyone refuses
to allow these necessary facilities to be built near their homes? During
the debate on the presidential address last year, I raised the issue
of taking care of our elderly and not sending them to nursing homes
in Johor Baru – yet, if we are not united on the need to come together
and build for the future, then that could be a very sad but real
possibility. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-895cfc08-85fe-4f92-b82d-a94f48d13344">
                  <a name="budget__id-895cfc08-85fe-4f92-b82d-a94f48d13344"><!--a--></a>Japan, too, faces the
same problem as we do – a rapidly ageing population and a huge proportion
of the elderly in the population. Yet, the Japanese people have
a common consensus on what needs to be done. Recognising that family
care giving for elderly
people was becoming increasingly difficult, the Japanese government developed
and implemented the Gold Plan in 1989 which defined specific goals
to be achieved over a 10-year period, which included the number
of day care centres, nursing homes, home care aides, etc. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1452</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2392c4b3-c862-4cb1-b81f-98ba7a315345">

commissioned each of their own municipal governments to survey the
number of elderly living in the area and draw up their own specific
action plan to tackle the issue. In making these plans from the
lower levels of the municipality and prefecture, the Japanese government
built a consensus and common understanding of the priority of building
infrastructure for the elderly. This raised the policy priority
of the issue to a much higher level within both public and private
spheres. </p>

policies from the ground up, empowering the grassroots to do their
own policies is just one way of creating consensus. We also have
often seen the Japanese coming together in drills, practising for
earthquakes, tsunamis, disasters together, even from young. We see
children participating in mass-public drills alongside adults and
the old. Whenever the drills come on, the Japanese would participate
in the most serious manner, for they recognise that how fast one
can react will determine whether lives are saved.</p>

this: a common understanding of what we as a people face is thus
just as crucial, if not more crucial, than the build-up of infrastructure

good of the population. </p>

we all know that in the second half of 2011, Thailand was hit by severe
flooding. Lasting more than two months, it was billed as the worst
floods in Thailand's history. The World Bank estimates it to cost
US$45.7 billion in economic damages and losses. But the issue I
want to raise is not the severity of the floods or the economic
damage caused. Rather, I want to highlight that while the Thai military,
aid groups and VWOs were key players in flood alleviation measures,
distributing life-saving supplies, aiding people, it is not just
these organisations and institutions which have come together to
fight the flood. The flood alleviation effort was a national one
for Thais all over the country donated food, water and clothing
to help their countrymen – far exceeding donations for previous
years. A CNN report called this true teamwork among the communities
– those who have a boat would use it to transport aid or to help neighbours
carry their possessions as water levels rose and engulfed homes.
Whenever there were donations, they were shared with fellow countrymen.
Even Thais here in Singapore, who were not affected by the floods,
pooled their pockets together and conducted fund raisers for their
homeland. The coming together of the Thais, I believe, shows how
people can come together and help one another because they have
a common national identity. In meeting our own tsunami, let us Singaporeans
realise that the building of such facilities is for the elderly,
people who are Singaporeans like our parents and grandparents. Every
Singaporean, not just the state, the Government, the institutions,
has a responsibility to make this happen. </p>

West, I have had my fair share of such instances too, when the announcement
was made that Sengkang General Hospital would be built in my ward.
Naturally, like Toh Yi residents, some of my residents were concerned
about the building of the hospital. Fortunately, the majority agreed
that there was a need to do so.
One resident even joked, "Well, if I'm sick and old, at least I
know that there's a hospital downstairs", although he was quite
young and only had recently married. I am heartened by this response,
as well as other recent examples – the Family Service Centre in
Marine Parade and a campaign by Nanyang Polytechnic students for
Singaporeans to embrace ageing. </p>

Budget has catered for the building of more long-term care facilities
and acute care hospitals, even more important is that we Singaporeans
must excogitate and reach a common consensus on what the task is
ahead and how we can all come together to help. Japan and Thailand
have done well so far, building that common understanding of what
is needed of the country to face the threats together.</p>

in the BBC last year after the tsunami and nuclear reactor disaster
that took place in Fukushima. And I thought it will be most apt
to share the story in this House: </p>

struck and resulted in a nuclear leak crisis in Fukushima last year.
It was while watching the news on television that Mr Yasuteru Yamada
decided it was time for his generation to stand up and volunteer
themselves. No longer could he be just an observer of the struggle
to stabilise the Fukushima nuclear plant. The retired engineer reported
back for duty at the age of 72, and organised a team of pensioners
to go with him. A group of more than 200 Japanese pensioners volunteered
to tackle the nuclear crisis at the Fukushima power station. The Skilled
Veterans Corps, as they call themselves, was made up of retired
engineers and other professionals, all over the age of 60. They
rationalised that they should be facing the dangers of radiation,
not the young.</p>

to take the place of the younger workers at the power station is
not brave, but logical. I am 72 and on average I probably have another
13 to 15 years left to live. Even if I were exposed to radiation,
cancer could take 20 or 30 years or longer to develop. Therefore
us older ones have less chance of getting cancer.'."</p>

resilience we see in the Japanese in the face of adversity. The

the elderly too had a role to play in our society. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-7823c7f6-695e-4460-9568-ffa93bc2ba04"><!--a--></a>I am happy to note the focus on the social
dimension of this year's Budget that addresses the needs of the
older workers, elderly, low and middle income and the disabled.
This has certainly struck a chord with many Singaporeans. While
we cannot expect a country's budget to solve all problems or address
every need, Budget 2012 adopts a long-term strategic approach to
these issues of the vulnerable amongst us. This will reap far more
social value, narrow the social divide and pay economic dividends
in the long term. </p>

touch on three areas – perception of the elderly, retirement age and
caring for our elderly. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8cb75578-9999-45d5-b44b-5b990357f4e0">

the elderly. We have heard many times how rapidly our country is
ageing. Today, we have 352,000 people over the age of 65, about
117,000 more than what we had 10 years ago. This is a 50% increase.
The number of people aged 85 and over are close to double in the
same period. These numbers are significant and they will continue
to rise quickly over the coming years, with the first cohort of
baby boomers turning 65 this year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8f952a1e-8bb8-475f-a356-12578c2479ee">

territory as a new ageing generation is forming and society is trying
to catch up. Companies are watching the age of their workforce. Policymakers
are trying to keep financial and health support systems up to speed. Researchers
and scientists are fervently finding treatments for age-related
illnesses and businesses are scrambling to provide wellness and
anti-ageing solutions. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-936e3bc5-4238-4316-8660-90e70a96366d">
                  <a name="budget__id-936e3bc5-4238-4316-8660-90e70a96366d"><!--a--></a>As the structure of our
society changes, the challenges facing us are how we can shape positive
perception towards the elderly and older workers. How the elderly
are perceived can have implications on how they are treated in our
society. Older people are generally stereotyped as sick, frail and
physically dependent on others. While names and characterisations
may vary, the message is the same: older men and women are incompetent
and lack self-sufficiency.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-912228c0-f763-48a1-a6f9-269b7c3e6c10">

taken to reduce the stereotyping of the elderly, curb ageist attitudes,
promote a sense of inclusiveness and compassion towards our elderly. Whether
it is about building or locating an elderly care centre or taking
the MRT train, caring for our elderly at home or in the community,
we need to shape positive perception to look after this special
segment of our population who has contributed and sacrificed much
for our country. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a2ad504d-aca6-4148-b0da-e99ec0e3a413">
                  <a name="budget__id-a2ad504d-aca6-4148-b0da-e99ec0e3a413"><!--a--></a>Our educators, parents,
employers, healthcare providers, journalists, the arts, media and
the Government must all step up our game to shape positive attitudes
and perception of our elderly. Our seniors are also evolving in
the way they perceive ageing. Surveys done recently revealed 87%
of respondents believe that seniors can play an active role in society.
While there may be a stereotypical view of the elderly as being weak
and frail as a result of natural ageing, I think we should emphasise
that many of our seniors are becoming more active, socially engaged,
technologically savvy, trendier and independent. </p>

on retirement. Today, as a result of improvements in nutrition,
exercise, healthcare and, generally, a focus on well-being, the
average life expectancy of Singaporeans has risen. As the population
ages, the pattern of retirement is changing rapidly in Singapore.
People are increasingly coming to terms with and understanding the
impact of living longer and the need to adequately prepare for an extended
period in retirement.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1455</p>

represent a squeeze on those of working age as well as on the Government,
as we look to provide retirement incomes and healthcare for the ageing
population. This also impacts the workforce as the retirement age
has been increased from 62 to 65 this year and will be raised to
67 later. We will have a larger pool of older employees who can
form an invaluable manpower resource as they can still continue
to contribute economically.</p>

is timely. I believe that real social inclusion is achieved when
our workforce, comprising our older workers, can contribute and
participate in the improvement of productivity and economic growth;
and has access to salaries that improve their living conditions
and the welfare of their families. </p>

today, their experience will be quite different to the one that
their parents enjoyed in the past and their grandchildren will experience
in the future. Today, seniors in their 60s are different from those
10 years ago. Advancements in health and nutritional awareness have
helped to nurture fitter and more active seniors, many of whom have
expressed their desire to work beyond 65 and continue to contribute
towards the function of society. </p>

my residents, there are rising levels of concern about the ability
to cope in retirement. It stems from fear about not saving enough
for retirement and also about ill health in retirement. Many say
that they can still continue to work with the same vigour and energy
and are disappointed that they have to either retire, or be re-employed
at a lower level, take a pay cut and see a reduction in the employer's
CPF contribution. These older workers have a wealth of experience
at their disposal and it is a waste to eliminate these experiences
through retirement. Older people who are still able to work past
their retirement age should be supported to do so.</p>

people of all ages to make their invaluable contribution to work.
We must not stereotype age, which is potentially discriminatory,
such as older people lacking of ideas or motivation. Having a mixture
of age groups in our workforce can enable companies to benefit from
a richer diversity of opinions and experiences. </p>

with dignity, especially so in employment. They should not be discriminated
against under the pretext of renewal or cost management for the companies.
Employers must appreciate their older staff and pay them fairly
for the work done. If the older workers are giving the employer
the same effort, time, talent and value as any of their younger
staff, why should they be paid any less in wages and employer CPF
contributions? The Government is making the right move in Budget
2012 to increase CPF contribution rates for older workers. I hope
that in time to come, the Government can move towards restoring
the full employer's CPF contribution for older workers aged 50 and
above. </p>

age will encourage anyone aged 65 or older to apply for jobs based
on their skills and experience, and allow employees the freedom
to work beyond the age of 65 without prejudice or employer discrimination,
unless in roles that demand exacting manual labour or involve public
safety. For instance, education is a timeless profession, and teachers who
are seniors are valued for their wealth of knowledge and experience.
I am certain there are many examples of timeless professions where
seniors would be valued for their accumulated experiences. </p>

workforce participation beyond the mandated retirement age, our
employers will need to adopt a new mindset change. Rather than view
matured workers as more expensive or slow, they can actively plan
and assist older workers to continue contributing to the success
of their organisations. This may mean providing training as well
as adopting flexibility in the job design or in the employment of
people in their 50s and 60s based on their skills and experience.
Employers should also focus on "workplace wellness" by reinventing
or restructuring the workplace for older workers to perform more
optimally and safely without a reduction in productivity.</p>

touch on caring for our elderly. Chronic illnesses, immobility, disability

Government is taking several measures to facilitate assistance for
more home-based care. There is a significant and growing number
of domestic helpers who are hired to double-up or solely look after
the elderly. Many of these pre-deployed domestic helpers are not
mentally prepared, physically able and trained to care for the elderly
sick, making them an occupational risk. It does not help that, in
most cases, the domestic worker is usually alone with the elderly
at home. Hence, I would like to urge the Ministry to put in place
training schemes for pre-deployed domestic helpers and to build
a pool of trained domestic caregivers who are certified to provide
basic care for the elderly sick or disabled.</p>

concerned with the low-income families coping with the financial
burden of care-giving at home. I would urge the Government to consider increasing
the grant to fully cover the domestic helper levy for hiring domestic
helpers to care for the elderly with disabilities. For such cases,
domestic caregiver is a necessity rather than an option. It will
encourage family members to continue with their jobs while at the
same time ensuring their loved ones are well looked after and making
them more productive and better workers.</p>

the Government to consider extending the monthly $120 grant to low
middle income families caring for their family members with severe
disabilities regardless of his or her age. A person with severe
mental retardation, or someone who had suffered from a stroke, will
need more intensive support and supervision for his or her entire
life. Many will require full-time care and will benefit from full-time
domestic help. I do urge the Government to consider extending the
monthly grant to these families too.</p>

Finance Minister's announcement to help the elderly unlock the value
of their flat and putting cash in their pockets. I do hope that
this good policy measure would not be negated by a lack of sufficient
smaller or studio flats for them to downgrade to and realise the
benefits of the Silver Housing Bonus. Many of the elderly have also
indicated that they are unwilling to relocate as they have lived
in their homes most of their lives. They have forged friendships,
developed roots and a sense of belonging. Thus, a more flexible
Silver Housing Bonus scheme or an enhanced Lease Buy-Back Scheme should
be put in place to convert their existing asset to cash without having
to move them.</p>

to see the coverage extended to 90 years of age. The twilight years

A person living long beyond the age of 80 would probably have stopped
working for at least 15 years. Thus, it may be the case that they
would have used up most of their savings accumulated in their working
life. Their children may also have progressed to become senior citizens

said that he sees this Budget as a change in the mindset and psyche
of the Government – that the Government had previously focused on
the economy and is now focusing on social development. Mr Speaker,
I think this is too one-sided. As a little red dot with no natural
resources, Singapore has no choice but to constantly develop the economy.
I had worked in the Economic Development Board of Singapore for
10 years, so I realise the importance of this. A country needs to
have effective economic policies, only then will the country be able to
generate wealth for the society, enjoy surplus and do more for the
people with the surplus.</p>

significant in the way that the Government has shown its heart for

of all, the Government has shown confidence and courage to build
an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore for the future. </p>

we further future-proof our people? If you go to Singapore Art Museum
today, there is an exhibition called "The Singapore Show: Future
Proof". Showcasing more than 35 works by 26 local artists and collectives,
it is one of the biggest exhibitions of home-grown art in recent
years. It captures how these promising young artists view Singapore
and how they wish to change the viewers' perspectives of home. Ms
Donna Ong's "Crystal City" is a beautiful installation of bottles
that reflects the skyline of a glass city. In her work, she mirrors
the fragility of dreams and aspirations. I can identify with that. </p>

aspirations of some anxious parents and children are given new hope.
During his Budget speech, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced
the Development Support Programme (DSP) that will look into meeting
the needs of children with mild speech, language and learning delays.
Some 2,000 children will benefit from this new Programme when it
is fully rolled out. This is, indeed, heartening news. </p>

aware that according to the MOH, there is presently an estimated
22,000 children under 18 years old with learning difficulties. We
have about 230 psychologists and therapists in Government-related
learning assistance programmes as well as in SPED and mainstream
schools. This suggests that one psychologist or therapist could
be looking after about 95 children. According to Professor Ho Lai
Yun, Senior Consultant at the Department of Child Development in
KK Hospital and Director of MOH's Child Development Programme, about
5% to 6% in every cohort of pre-schoolers have developmental needs
that could affect their learning. This works out to about 2,000
children a year. The shortage of psychologists and therapists could
seriously circumvent the outreach to these children. Even with the
impending launch of DSP, we may still be under-serving this community. </p>

and none should fall through the crack due to lack of resources. We
need to make the learning environment more inclusive and more supportive
for these children at the formative age. The outcomes for these
children can be improved with early detection and the necessary
therapy. By narrowing the gap before they enter Primary 1 in mainstream
school, they can have a better chance of coping and succeeding within
mainstream schools. </p>

to ask the Government to strongly consider adopting a whole-of-Government
approach in ramping up the manpower capacity and building the necessary
capabilities in these areas. May I propose an inter-Ministry steering committee
be set up with the mandate to drive a manpower capacity and capability development
plan that meets the needs of children with learning difficulties?
An inter-Ministry taskforce is much needed, for this challenge requires
a holistic and child-centric approach that cuts across education,
health and training, not just MCYS. This could be led, however,
by MCYS, as it spearheads an Enabling Masterplan. This inter-Ministry committee can prioritise
the types of therapists needed, whether it is speech and language,
occupational therapy, behavioural or even child psychologists. An
inter-Ministry team will allow us to draw upon the complementary
strengths of various Ministries to pull their respective levers
and resources to address the issue. </p>

a two-pronged approach: firstly, to boost the number of trained
child therapists and psychologists through education and training;
and secondly, to develop ways to tap the latent pool of manpower.

agencies like the WDA or even the NCSS and CDCs. In Mandarin, please.</p>

a two-pronged approach. Firstly, the Ministry of Education can review
the future direction of our tertiary institutions to attract and
train more talent in this field. Currently, four tertiary institutions
offer courses on therapy and special education. We need more talent
interested in this field. According to a survey by the National
Research Institute at the University of Chicago, last year, physiotherapist
and special needs educators ranked third and fifth respectively,
among the happiest jobs in the US. Recently, MCYS launched a new
campaign to attract people to become social workers. Should we also start
a campaign to attract people to become physiotherapists? Secondly,
MCYS can also help to look for talent pool that has not been explored,
for example, retired teachers with teaching experience. The Workforce
Development Agency can also encourage PMETs who are looking for
a mid-career change to become therapists. Housewives or women looking
to re-join the workforce can also become therapy assistants. </p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>In addition
to these suggestions, may I, at this juncture, ask the Government
to consider PCF's example of how they tackled the shortage of therapists. Through
innovative job design, PCF created a new position, five years ago,
the role of a Learning Support Coach for its organisation nationwide.
The main role of a Learning Support Coach, LSC in short, is to train
and work with PCF teachers to support children with learning difficulties
across all PCF centres in Singapore. Its first LSC is 31-year-old Ms
Fiona Woo. She has trained 200 PCF teachers and 80 principals in
one-to-one sessions over the past five years. A former pre-school
teacher, Ms Woo was qualified in special needs education and was
a Speech and Language Therapy Aide. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fd4b978a-9c61-4038-b251-146a97b09cd4">

Woo provides short-term direct early intervention support to PCF
pre-schoolers with learning difficulties in mainstream pre-school
environment. She arms teachers with practical strategies and tips
on how to manage and include these children in their class. In addition,
Ms Woo teaches parents, caregivers, teachers and principals the
ways to help these children adapt to a mainstream pre-school environment
without putting the spotlight on these children. She also coordinates
the specialist support for the children's special learning needs.
As part of her work, Ms Woo conducts screening tests for dyslexia
in PCF. She shared with me her passion. I quote: "The best reward
for me is to see the child with learning difficulties being able
to socialise and learn well in mainstream school environment. That
means I was able to make a difference in the child's life at his
formative stage." </p>

will look at this model of training and support used by PCF for the
impending DSP. PCF now has a nine-member Special Education Needs
team that includes two Learning Support Coaches, four Learning Support
Educators and three social
workers in the HQ. The team has built a holistic network of support,
knowledge and skills transfer linking the teachers, principals,
specialists, therapists, parents and caregivers. Each group has
a different role and competence level that feeds into an "ecosystem"
of skills to support the children with learning difficulties. </p>

Singapore faces the twin challenges of an ageing and shrinking workforce.

can make today's job obsolete tomorrow. The recent Budget measure
to further reduce the Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs) amid a tight labour
market means that many businesses could be affected by the shortage
of workers. As our economy restructures, it will have to explore
different ways to increase productivity and to maximise their human
capital. While the PIC and the SEC given by this year's Budget can
help bring some relief, the Government can certainly do more to help
our businesses increase their manpower capacity, at the same time,
future-proof our workforce for the long-term. </p>

Deputy Prime Minister Tharman suggested that to attract local workers,
jobs could be better designed or redesigned with the worker in mind,
that is, a worker-centric approach. Can we explore the idea of nurturing
a healthy skills eco-system with job redesign for better skills
deployment? There is, indeed, a chance, and this is an opportune
time for us to develop a skills ecosystem, especially in our services sector
where skills are more easily portable and transferable across industries
and companies. For example, as part of Australia's Skills Ecosystem
National Project, Queensland Community Services and Health Industry
Training Council partnered two large not-for-profit healthcare service
providers in a job redesign project to tackle labour and service
quality in aged care. As a result of their collaboration, the jobs
for allied health aides were redesigned to improve both their autonomy
at work and career development opportunities. </p>

approach helps create an environment where more accurate information
on skills demand and supply can be easily communicated between the various
stakeholders, and that facilitates a better matching of skill supply
and skill demand. This way, we can better address the availability
or development of skills as well as its application. For this to
succeed, we need to harness the full capacity of Government, the
industry and the community to open up new possibilities for skills, innovation
and productivity. In her most recent <em class="ph i">Harvard Business Review</em> article, "Enriching
the Ecosystems", Rosabeth Moss Kanter suggested that enhanced linkages and
collaborations between innovation, enterprises and jobs can bridge
the gaps between business, academia and policy leaders. The resulting
ecosystems will generate more ideas, start-ups, company growth,
globally-competitive companies and, certainly, prosperity. A healthy
skills ecosystem approach needs to be catalysed and nurtured by the
Government no less, and not be left to market forces. There are
strong reasons for the Government to play an active role in this.
Potential benefits could be: (1) better alignment with economic
restructuring; (2) support for both the workers as well as employers;
(3) more efficient distribution of manpower resources; (4) ability
to support job redesign
through policies and interventions where needed; and (5) closer
alignment with institutes of higher learning. </p>

Government's long-term view and objectives to be met in order to
successfully future-proof our workforce. Due to the pressures of
the bottom line, businesses are certainly prone towards meeting
short-term aims versus the long-term investments needed in job redesign.
Job redesign is certainly here to stay. Today's jobs are being challenged
by tomorrow's demands, all too quickly. If we can maximise our manpower
capacity and capabilities through clever work organisation and job
redesign, we have a chance to re-create value, increase productivity,
provide long-term employability and future-proof our workers for
the better. </p>

challenges may appear difficult, but if I can liken it to another exhibit
in the Singapore Show by Ms Genevieve Chua, entitled "After the
Flood", these mono-chromatic images of forests with hand-painted

rainforests in Orchard Road. This is in Orchard Road. According
to Ms Chua, her work explores the fear of the unknown and the fear
of new narratives. It is very natural to be averse to uncertainty
and changes, but beneath the new narratives or developments, is
the strength of the forests and the foundation that we have built

Sir, I thank the Finance Minister for a Budget for the future. It is
a Budget that makes real the dream that was unveiled by the Prime
Minister two years ago when he spoke of an "inclusive" Budget. Spending
public monies is not just to ensure economic growth, but growing
together, and also growing in a qualitatively different way from
what we had in the past. That was a Budget which stressed togetherness,
the need for good, valuable work, for a dignified and fulfilling

level. Here and now, we face limitations of capacities, including
transport and housing. Here and now, we have a new political landscape,
where more want exceptions to be made, rules to be rubbery if not
bent altogether, and we also want a collective decision. And we
also want our own personal individual interest. </p>

quite different sort from the last, which may be thought of as almost
a purely political one. We all know that the Singapore Government has
been fairly good at tackling policy, engineering type of problems.
Give us a technical problem, with clear KPIs and a good team of
professionals and we can turn out world beaters, for example, ERP
for congestion, flats by the thousands, best airport, best seaport,
etc. The political problem, however, appears to be the "one that
is not like the others". Or is it?</p>

at the heart of all we do, and this Budget, to be truly a Budget
for the future, must speak to the transformation of the political
vision and climate of our country as well. When we speak of the
future, we need to speak of change. And if we adopt a dialectic
view, we would see that social conflict is the key driving force
of social change. A society without conflict will be a society of
fossils and die for the lack of change. For German philosopher Karl
Marx, the capitalist society is one in which those who have capital
exploit the working class. In 1848, Karl Marx points out that it
is in the interest of those who exploit that society does not change. </p>

some people uncomfortable by talking about this because conflict
is not a nice word. And when we say "Marx" and "1848", the word
"revolution" comes not far behind. These words are not those that
give you a warm fuzzy feeling. They are not like "harmonious society"
or "consensus building" or "collective interest" with "collegiate
processes". Yet dialectic is what drives us forward. If we all agree,
if we all have no new ideas, if we were all a homogeneous lump,
then we will not have progress. </p>

I thought I ought to make two clarifications. The first is that
not all conflict is useful or productive. For example, opposition
based on false ideas and scurrilous attacks is not only unproductive,
but also counter-productive. The second is about the need for a
new climate. The new climate needs to be one that tolerates robust views
and debate, but it also needs to be one in which the marketplace
of ideas quickly decides which ideas are valuable and which worthless
and need to be discarded. </p>

like to cite a survey by American academics at the University of
California at Berkeley. Over the years, these academics have seen
an increase in self-admiration among young people, including feelings
that they are "special" and better than other people. Dr Jean M
Twenge and Mr W Keith Campbell wrote a book on this phenomenon and
they called the book <em class="ph i">The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age
of Entitlement</em>. The book describes a movement that started with
the best of intentions, an attempt to boost self-esteem, and ended
with extreme self-admiration. It is partly the result of two or
three generations of prosperity and well-meaning parents who want
the best for their kids, telling them, "You are the best, you are
special, you deserve the best, you will get all the support that
you need to excel!" All these words sound familiar, do they not?
And I believe many of us have heard doting parents saying these
to their children.</p>

of parenting leads to what some call an "indigo generation" – a
generation who has a higher sense of their own importance and also
their place in the world. Dan Kindlon, the child psychologist writes,
"Indigo children come into the world with a feeling of royalty,
have difficulty with absolute authority, they simply will not do
certain things. For example, waiting in line is difficult for them."
These are Kindlon's words to describe the emerging phenomenon in
America. More seriously, and more
directly relevant to Singapore, this epidemic creates a sense of
entitlement and encourages incivility. </p>

America, but I would like us to be able to share the ability to
look at ourselves as critically, honestly as they have done. I do
not know if we, too, have a Narcissism epidemic here. But I do know
that we feel entitled to many things. And quite rightly so. Peace
and quiet in our homes, enjoyment of urban spaces, best schools
for our children, prompt and helpful replies to our emails. </p>

is the difficult thing. I agree that people are entitled to quiet homes
and urban spaces and the best schools and prompt replies. I agree.
But as a collective nation, how do we do this if, at the same time,
we need to dig to build tunnels for new MRT lines, if we need space
for eldercare homes, if we need to limit school places so that teachers
will give their best attention, and if we reach the biological limits of
human attention span? </p>

there right answers anymore? If it comes to collective good and
individual loss, what do we do? From an external point of view,
a cool-headed and cold-blooded rationalist would say "the collective
wins". That may have worked in the past, for the reasons of the
past. But today, it may not work in the current and new atmosphere.
And I again, agree. I agree that the collective should no longer
ride roughshod over the individual, that we need to take more care,
and that various assorted interests must be balanced sensitively
and carefully. But how do we do all this? </p>

to keep the discourse. Increasingly, in our public interactions,
we see more anger and verbal aggressions. My colleagues who work
at the frontline in the Civil Service, in schools and hospitals,
tell me that they, too, are beginning to experience this. Second,
I think with the future becoming more complex, and more demands
being made on the collective resources we all own, such as land,
air and space, we need increasing participation in the process of

philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre "an intellectual exists in order to draw

people, politics may be an alien territory. To many people, it is
only during times of crises that politics becomes a noble calling.
In times of peace, many among us would apply our energies to business,
arts, our professions and our families. With the need for a new
generation of politicians in mind, I believe it is time for us to
consider a platform, either under Parliament or any other such suitable
agency, to gather the minds of our youth. I have recently met my
counterpart from Malaysia and he told me that his Ministry is looking
into a Youth Parliament to engage young people, invite them to contribute
ideas, involve them in policy deliberation process. I think this is
something that warrants consideration. I know some of our educational
institutions have organised mock Parliament for students to play
the role of parliamentarians and, through the process, cultivate
constructive political discourse and sensitise them towards the
reality of life. But these efforts are <em class="ph i">ad hoc</em> and not structured.
More can be done by the Government in this area so that our youth,
the future leaders, are not only academically well-tuned, but are
also socially and politically in tune.</p>

speech I began my speech with the "Dream Riders", about a group
of seniors in their 60s and 70s who wanted to relive their youthful
glories in their sunset years, on their motorbikes. This year, I
want to end my speech with the "Dream Makers" – they are our Singapore
young people. Our system is such that we create a world-class education
to nurture our young. But we have not made a conscious effort to expose
students to how our country is run, how the civil service functions,
how policies are made. More importantly, how politics is played
out in our system and in other countries. We simply leave all these
to them thinking that with good education, they will figure out
all these one day, and decide for themselves at the age of 21 at
the ballot box. We simply leave all these to chance. But our youths
are so vital to the country. Social and political reality tests
are subjects in the world classroom. They ought to be given adequate
exposure early.</p>

the future, we see the young chasing their dreams and creating some
for us along the way. They are the future of Singapore. They are
the purpose of this Budget! Hence, I urge the Government to give

is a Budget for the future, just as Deputy Prime Minister Tharman emphasised,
the Government's immediate task is to uplift and restructure the
economy through improving our skills, creativity and productivity,
so as to raise Singaporean's wages. Recently, the Budget is hotly
discussed among all quarters and I have gathered a lot of feedback.
Today, I want to focus on crisis mentality and "wealth does not
last for three generations" in my Budget discussion. </p>

being forward-looking and having a sense of purpose, an awareness
of adversity and accountability. It heightens our awareness towards adversities,
and motivates us to overcome difficulties and take on challenges.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Forbes</em> magazine
recently published its ranking of the world's richest nations and Singapore
ranked third, after Qatar and Luxembourg. Both Qatar and Luxembourg
have an estimated per capita gross domestic product of over US$80,000
while Singapore's GDP per capita is US$56,694. This shows that Singapore
has achieved great economic success within just over 40 years. </p>

to celebrate. There is a Chinese saying that goes "wealth does not
last for three generations". The complete phrase says if we pass
on good values to our children, it will last 10 generations, and
the next most enduring qualities are diligence and education, followed by literary
knowledge and culture; however, if we only pass on wealth to our
children, it will not last more than three generations. </p>

real life too. The first generation are the builders – they are thrifty,
hardworking and motivated to strive for success; the second generation
are the keepers – they witnessed the hardship of their fathers and
are deeply influenced to work hard and look for opportunities to
expand. But the third and fourth generations are different. They
grew up in very good conditions and seldom go through hardship.
They are like flowers in a greenhouse and are inferior to their
forefathers in terms of foresight, vision, ability to withstand
stress and adversity quotient. It is not uncommon to see such examples
in many family businesses. </p>

world, it is likewise among countries. Looking around the world
today, it is not hard to find such examples. Greece, for one, is
a good example. Other countries, like Japan or America, are going
on a downward trend in the hands of their third and fourth generations
after experiencing 40 to 50 years of prosperity. However, even a
broken ship will contain some valuable materials, Japan and the
US have strong foundations, as long as they are willing to endure
hardships now, they would be able to make a comeback in a matter
of years. Singapore, on the contrary, must be careful as any misstep
would drive us into the deep end.</p>

has entered the era of the second generation. My parents' generation
had been working hard in this land since the 1940s. Their generation had
created a miracle and brought Singapore from the third-world to
the first-world in a matter of 30 years after our independence.
I am considered a second generation Singaporean and, like others
in my age group, we have worked hard to build the nation in the
past 20 to 30 years. I am now in my 50s. In another 10 years' time,
the third generation has to take over the baton to continue the
race in this marathon that has no ending point. The third generation
has to face more challenges and shoulder more responsibilities,
thus they have more stress. </p>

needs. I suggest setting up a youth parliament to create a platform
for young people to air their views – besides economic development, it should also pay
attention to ideologies and social culture. While it fulfils young
people's desire of participating in social management through vibrant
discussions, it should also strengthen social cohesion and sense
of commitment. </p>

I said that in 2011, we had approved 176,000 Employment Pass applications,

It refers to the S-Pass numbers. I am sorry that I have misread.
The correct figure should be: in 2011, the Government approved 176,000 Employment
Pass applications as compared to 142,000 Employment Pass applications approved
in 2010. That is an increase of 34,000 in the number of Employment

Mr Speaker, like many of my Parliamentary colleagues who spoke before
me, I am glad that Budget 2012 continues and expands upon this Government's
policies that address the needs of the vulnerable in society – the
elderly, especially older workers; the disabled and the poor. This
reflects the values that are central to a compassionate society
and a fair and inclusive Government. Longer term challenges in society,
such as the ageing population, education, healthcare and reducing
the income gap for low-income families, are also addressed. I believe
these measures will serve us well for building an inclusive and stronger
Singapore.</p>

of thought and discussion about whether this Budget represents a
fundamental shift in the philosophy and ideology of government.
The question as to whether this signifies a "shift to the left"
has been brought up. Our Government has generally considered itself
as taking a centrist approach, reaching out to all citizens, but the
external perception of both the party and the majority of our society
has been that we are moderately conservative and pragmatic. People
assume we swing to the right because
of our macro-economic policies. However, in truth, we have adopted
a mixed stance depending on the needs of our nation. There are many
examples where our social policies have been developed from leftist
ideas that were appropriate for our society, especially in helping
the most vulnerable. </p>

it is now argued that demonstrates a shift to the left, is the announcement
that the Government will be spending $1.1 billion on buses. This
sum needs to cover more than just the cost of buying the buses,
and will need to take into account the manpower and operating costs
associated with the expanded fleet.</p>

Minister see this as representing a shift towards the left, where transport
companies are being further subsidised by the Government? The overall approach
of our public transport system has been to incentivise private companies
to make a profit within a tightly regulated market. As private entities,
should it not be the responsibility of the companies to manage their
operating and manpower costs? Why is there a need for the Government
to fund publicly-listed companies, such as SMRT and SBS Transit,
which, at the end of the day, are accountable to their shareholders?
Can the public be assured that the funds will go to benefit the
citizens and not the shareholders? How will the Government measure
the return on this investment in terms of buses and support of operating
costs?</p>

providing Government and public support to private transport operators?
If the taxi industry suffers, will the Government provide funding
for it as well? What will happen in the future as our MRT network
expands in rail length and cross-connectivity? There had previously
been a push to rationalise some bus services, especially closer
towards a hub and spoke model, so as to move ridership to the MRTs. If
the bus companies are already struggling now, what will happen with
the increased competition from the MRT and further manpower shortages
in five or 10 years from now? Will the Government then 'bail out'
the public transport operators? If the ridership of the bus companies
falls over 15 years, might the projected planned investment in this year's
Budget in buses possibly be used to defray some of the costs of
replacing the existing fleet rather than lead to a genuine expansion?
Is this just the start of a creeping nationalisation? If so, why
not just nationalise properly and reap the full benefits, instead of
suffering the worst of both worlds?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c4fee8eb-0de8-4782-ad1d-d48e216f2845">
                  <a name="budget__id-c4fee8eb-0de8-4782-ad1d-d48e216f2845"><!--a--></a>Sir, some of the factors
in support of the nationalisation of public transport are that it
can potentially bring about lower fares and better performances
in terms of availability. Factors that argue strongly against it
include a greater inefficiency, a dependent mindset amongst transport
operators, and that it is very, very expensive both in the first
instance and in terms of ongoing expenditure. However, Sir, if we
consider this to be a public good, might we not accept some degree
of inefficiency as a fair price to pay for the continued provision
of an essential service? If there is always going to be a bus service
available for the citizens, sometimes a particular bus will operate
at sub-optimal efficiency. This occurs anyway, currently, as a result
of the constraints on service imposed upon the public transport
operators.</p>

with no real consumer choice, can we be sure that the current model
is in reality driving maximal efficiency? In considering the argument against
complete nationalisation, we should not forget to factor in the
ongoing cost of operating
LTA as a surrogate for the effect of market forces in controlling
our public transport operators.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-3f88675b-f977-4076-8e55-ff9553c4662f"><!--a--></a>Despite the significant
increase in cost, there are successful models of nationalised public
transport systems, such as Taipei. If one were to broaden the definition
of successful, and accept a significant degree of ongoing expenditure,
one could include an example, such as London, where all public transport,
including cycling and walking, has been brought under the aegis
of a single body, Transport for London. This has enabled a transitional
approach to transport strategy, where citizens are not seen as being
either drivers, or cyclists, rail commuters or pedestrians, and
being potential consumers that the different modalities and the
providers need to compete for. But, rather, recognising that any
given individual can be all those at different times, and the correct
public transport infrastructure strategy can encourage a driver
to become a passenger, a passenger to become a cyclist or a pedestrian.
And in this model, instead of worrying about competition between
and within a transport modality, this body has allowed a broader
approach to be applied. This offloads the public transport systems where
possible and results in a whole host of other external benefits.
Can we take a lesson from London?</p>

nationalisation is too expensive and too inefficient, then why not
just privatise properly? Sir, if we look at our transport operators,
can we even think of them as being privatised? Yes, they are responsible
to shareholders and yes they can make significant profits, but both
SMRT and SBS Transit have posted operating losses mostly due to
increases in staff and fuel costs. Last year, both companies submitted applications
to the Public Transport Council (PTC) for total bus and rail fares
to be raised by 2.8%. But instead, the PTC only approved an increase
of 1%. If they were both truly private entities, they would both
be able to respond based on market demand. If a service was undersubscribed
or unprofitable, they can cease to offer it, thus releasing resources
and assets for use where they were needed. So while our public transport operators
are private entities, they operate under significant constraints
and burdens that reduce their flexibility and their ability to optimise
operations in response to market forces. There are examples of privatised
transport systems where the public transport operators are encouraged
and allowed to generate significant revenue from other sources,
such as retail outlets and advertising, and thus cross subsidise
fares. For this to work at maximal efficiency, a significant deregulation
of our market would be needed, allowing true competition and true
consumer choice.</p>

privatised nor adequately nationalised. In the past, this hybridised
model has been held up as an exemplar of what was possible with
good governance. Sir, it may represent the best of both worlds,
but has recently been interpreted as the worst of both models. Can
the House and the public be assured that this hybridisation continues
to be the best way forward for Singapore?</p>

and criticisms, I remain a fan of our public transport system. I
took my boys to school on a public bus this morning. I then took
another to KK Hospital and I came to Parliament on the bus Number
166. All three services arrived on time. The duration of journey
was as predicted on my iPhone. Most of the time, there are seats
available on these services, and usually I get to read quite a few
of my emails. At the end of today's sitting, I will walk over to
Clarke Quay Station, and take the North-East Line, and 25 minutes
later I will be in my constituency in Punggol. Our system does its job
and does it well. It is safe, clean, and reliable. I agree that
it has its faults and its problems, and any enterprise can always
be improved. One area that I feel needs further consideration and
development is that of "last mile" connectivity. Rather than just assuming
that when the network is eventually dense enough, people will be
happy to cycle or walk to the nearest MRT station. We need to work
proactively at changing and encouraging this mindset. We need to
examine footpaths, cycling facilities, lighting, access ramps and
the location of amenities, with as much attention to detail as we
can, as it is often these factors that alter the choice of the individual,
where a choice is possible. I believe our current public transport
system is one of the most efficient, reliable and pleasant in the
world, and I benefit from it on a daily basis. I look forward to its
continued growth and development. Nevertheless, we have to consider
deeply where we want to go from here. What is the impact of the
decision to invest $1.1 billion in the bus companies? Is it a significant
shift and does it reflect the start of a fundamental change?</p>

Budget as a whole, I would like to consider how our values as a
society are reflected within it. No doubt, the primacy of honouring
and respecting our elders is reflected in many aspects that support
seniors, assist in their healthcare and help them to maintain their
homes, independence and their dignity for as long as possible. Along
the political spectrum, is this an idea from the right or the left?
I would suggest that in our cultural context, in our story of our
nation, it transcends political ideology and is very much part of
our cultural DNA. On the other hand, the subsidies and transfers
that go towards assisting and funding the education of the lower
income families surely derive from the language of the left. In
our philosophy and in our policies, we articulate clearly that the
education and opportunity presented to our children cannot be left
to unchecked market forces, for fear that equality of opportunity
and social mobility will be rapidly eroded. This drive to ensure
social mobility and equal education speaks to a social desire for
a more egalitarian society, something which has long been at the
heart of many Government policies. </p>

the political spectrum is not without representation in our Budget.
The importance placed on self-reliance and one's own family as the
first line of support borrows heavily from the language of the right.
The primacy of employment and the link between the provision of
financial assistance and continuing to remain employed, exemplified
by the Workfare policies, speaks to our belief that incentives should
drive us to work hard and benefit from our own hard work. Coupled
with our low taxation, this has made us a dynamic and responsive
economy.</p>

days, my parliamentary colleagues and I will speak repeatedly on
what are euphemistically known as "cuts". Very few, if any, of us
will be asking for a cut in expenditure, more likely the opposite.
In a time of global economic uncertainty, where parliamentarians
in other nations, First World or otherwise, are arguing over which
austerity measures to effect, which reductions in spending to push
through and which increases in revenue to risk, we are instead going
to debate how best to increase our expenditure. How fortunate a
position to be in? How remarkable that we have the luxury to ask
and ask and ask for more? But one question I would like to ask is:
what is at the heart of our values? What in the Budget do we feel
about so strongly that it defines us and the ideology of our society?
What are the choices we make that can help illustrate our beliefs?
There are indeed many things we need to spend on. But there are
also things that we choose to spend on, and sometimes we do not
even see it as a choice, but simply as a given, part of the backdrop, because
we believe them to be non-negotiable, when, in truth, they are.
If we examine these choices, we can begin to better define ourselves.</p>

suggest four candidates for these choices. First, we must continue to
support the elderly and vulnerable within our society. To do so
speaks neither to the left nor the right, but to our humanity and
our culture. Secondly, we should protect the subsidies and transfers
that allow children from low-income families to pursue their education
and their dreams. For if we choose to remove that, that would be
to deny the dream of social mobility and progress that is at the
heart of our nation's narrative. This is an idea from the left,
and it is a good one. Third, we should keep central the idea that keeping
people in work and allowing them to enjoy the benefits of their
hard work drives our progress and prosperity. This is a philosophy
from the right that results in low taxation and a link between work
and assistance. It has worked well for us and we should continue
to choose to implement.</p>

one idea from the left, one from the right, and one that transcends
political ideology as being at the core of the values that we should
choose to see reflected in our Budget. The fourth and last idea
is that of a balanced Budget. Many nations, First World or otherwise,
are unable to achieve; some do not even feel they should try. Nevertheless,
for us, it is a cornerstone of our Budget. A remarkable feat that has
been quietly repeated year on year on year, but receives very little
commentary – quite understandably because the headline, "Finance
Minister delivers yet another Balanced Budget" is not going to sell
many newspapers. But it is a remarkable feat for any nation. Where
along the political spectrum does this lie? It is an idea supported
both by the Government and clearly by the Opposition. There are
nations of varying ideologies that fail to manage this, and, those
that do, represent a wide spectrum of philosophies.</p>

more fundamental than a political ideology. It is more like the
advice you get from your mother, "spend within your means". Fiscal
prudence – good advice for an individual, good advice for a household,
good advice for a nation. This fundamental part of our policy approach
should be given more prominence. Its importance in getting us to
this point in our nation's story cannot be over-emphasised. We spend

Gerald Giam Yean Song (Non-Constituency Member)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, the initiatives in Budget 2012 demonstrate a shift in
the Government's mindset in providing much needed support for our
low-income workers, senior citizens and people with disabilities.
I commend the Government on this shift in the right direction. While
we need to grow our economy, we also need to ensure a fairer distribution
of our nation's prosperity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-eb802ddb-1bbf-46b9-9139-9aec5efdf0d6">
                  <a name="budget__id-eb802ddb-1bbf-46b9-9139-9aec5efdf0d6"><!--a--></a>Sir, it has been said
that "SMEs are the lubricant of Singapore's economy, without which,
Singapore's economy may not survive". There are about 150,000 SMEs
in Singapore, making up 99% of all enterprises. They contribute
to about half of Singapore's GDP and employ about 60% of the workforce.
Clearly, the SME sector is critical in our drive towards higher
productivity and real wage growth. We must do all we can to uplift
the SMEs as we restructure our economy. This Budget provides some support
for SMEs, and I believe more can be done.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f0d280f7-ac1b-4c04-b854-72e1a106c088">
                  <a name="budget__id-f0d280f7-ac1b-4c04-b854-72e1a106c088"><!--a--></a>One area often cited as
a major challenge facing SMEs is that of manpower, especially skilled
manpower. The growth of successful SMEs is often constrained by their
ability to attract more capable and talented Singaporeans to work
for them. Many successful SMEs pay competitive salaries and offer
exciting career prospects, yet they often get overlooked as graduates
make a beeline to jobs in MNCs and the Civil Service.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c5412aa7-c3a7-4c7a-83b3-1357582df7b6">
                  <a name="budget__id-c5412aa7-c3a7-4c7a-83b3-1357582df7b6"><!--a--></a>Our Government scholarship
system has been successful in bringing in and retaining many bright,
young Singaporeans in the public sector. I would like to propose
the introduction of an SME scholarship programme to help bring more
talent into SMEs. The Government could work in collaboration with
business federations and SME associations to create and administer
this programme, which should be done on a cost-sharing basis. Promising
SMEs could then be given funding to award scholarships to top JC
and Polytechnic students who, upon graduation, will return to work
for them for a minimum number of years, and hopefully stay longer
to grow the business further. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58434d8c-130d-47c3-8e1d-707b8c6d9a5e">
                  <a name="budget__id-58434d8c-130d-47c3-8e1d-707b8c6d9a5e"><!--a--></a>I am glad that this Budget
has made it easier for companies to claim Productivity and Innovation
Credit (PIC) benefits on their in-house training costs, by removing
the requirement to have these training programmes certified by WDA
or ITE. I would urge the Government to take a step further and provide
more funding for On-the-Job Training (OJT). OJT is recognised as
one of the most effective forms of training, especially for those
in vocational work. There should be greater government funding for
companies to provide structured OJT programmes for their workers
and new hires. This could include payroll subsidies and more funding
for OJT supervisor training. Boosting OJT subsidies could help companies
overcome their resistance to hiring Singaporean workers who may
lack the necessary skills and experience. In addition, workers do
not need to miss work in order to attend training.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-42f8b1c1-20bd-4b6e-84fb-942a0caf377e">
                  <a name="budget__id-42f8b1c1-20bd-4b6e-84fb-942a0caf377e"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to now
share some thoughts on the social development initiatives in the
Budget. The Government has always warned that we must avoid the
path of excessive social spending, which could result in crippling
public debts. While I share the Government's concern about uncontrolled
spending or unsustainable social entitlements, this should not be
a convenient excuse to hold back much needed social investments.
Income inequality in Singapore is already among the highest in the developed
world. There is much research that has pointed to the detrimental
effects that income inequality could have on a society, including
reduced social mobility, higher crime rates and increased social
tension. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1472</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-20da92b3-2214-476e-83e9-219eec9582d5">
                  <a name="budget__id-20da92b3-2214-476e-83e9-219eec9582d5"><!--a--></a>There is a pressing need to reform our
social compact to not just contain, but reduce income inequality.
We also have a moral obligation to provide more help to our elderly citizens,
who built this nation to what we enjoy now. I affirm the Budget's
focus towards countering the adverse implications of our growing
income gap. The Silver Housing Bonus is a good attempt to help increase
the retirement incomes of the elderly. However, I believe the Bonus
would be more attractive if the elderly received a greater portion
of the proceeds from the sale of their previous flats in cash, rather
than having most of it returned to their CPF accounts. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-73b18700-db5a-4354-9607-772b27200e64">
                  <a name="budget__id-73b18700-db5a-4354-9607-772b27200e64"><!--a--></a>In the example that the
Finance Minister gave in his speech, the elderly couple receives
only $23,000 in cash, or about 9% of their net proceeds from the
sale of their flat, even after the Silver Housing Bonus. This is
because, to benefit from the Silver Housing Bonus, flat owners must
use the cash proceeds from the sale of their previous flat to top
up their CPF Retirement Accounts to the Minimum Sum. I propose that
they be allowed to pledge the value of their new studio apartment
towards meeting up to half of the Minimum Sum. This will allow them
to get more cash after the sale of their previous flat.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4d019ef8-2d86-43e2-bce6-03a7670a3a9c">
                  <a name="budget__id-4d019ef8-2d86-43e2-bce6-03a7670a3a9c"><!--a--></a>Since they will still
be meeting their Minimum Sum, there is no need to apportion $5,000
from the Silver Housing Bonus to their CPF Retirement Accounts.
The full $20,000 Silver Housing Bonus could be given to them in
cash. While a larger Retirement Account may get them more per month
in CPF LIFE annuity pay-outs, many senior citizens may have more
immediate needs for cash, for example, to pay their medical bills.
Why not give them this option to have more cash on hand? If they
want higher annuity pay-outs, they can always voluntarily top up
their CPF Retirement Accounts. In any case, most elderly folks prefer
to remain in their current homes, rather than get displaced to unfamiliar
surroundings in their old age. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db0b6bc7-923d-4f37-b70e-071ed2cde47d">
                  <a name="budget__id-db0b6bc7-923d-4f37-b70e-071ed2cde47d"><!--a--></a>To give the elderly more
choices, the Lease Buyback Scheme should be extended to owners of
4-room or larger flats, just like the Silver Housing Bonus. Currently,
only owners of 3-room or smaller flats are eligible. This could
be a reason for the low take-up rate. An enhanced Lease Buyback
Scheme will enable more of our elderly to age in place, and to live
their golden years in familiar surroundings, without having to worry too
much about finances.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1011ca38-f3c7-4878-acb3-b9dcf1a0cdd1">
                  <a name="budget__id-1011ca38-f3c7-4878-acb3-b9dcf1a0cdd1"><!--a--></a>Sir, moving on to eldercare,
I think many families will welcome the additional grant for hiring
foreign maids to help them care for infirm elderly parents. This
grant adds to the existing concession for households with elderly
persons. But instead of all these grants and concessions, I suggest
completely doing away with the Foreign Domestic Worker Levy for
these families, so as to provide further relief for them and simplify administration.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-cbb73777-89cc-4173-92bd-d7d89f8746d7"><!--a--></a>Extending the maximum
MediShield coverage age from 85 to 90 years old is a move in the
right direction. However, would the Government consider removing
the age limit completely? There are only about 9,000 Singaporeans
aged above 90. Many of them would have outlived their own spouses,
siblings or children, and may have no immediate relatives to care
for them. We should do all we can to help this small group of seniors
who have worked tirelessly to build up Singapore to what it is today,
instead of pulling the rug from under their feet when they need
it the most. There are several other
MediShield enhancements that I believe should be made, while still
keeping the insurance scheme solvent. I will share these during
the Committee of Supply (COS) debate.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1473</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ee38e2c-1bae-4055-a3f4-2ddb20aa7a6e">
                  <a name="budget__id-8ee38e2c-1bae-4055-a3f4-2ddb20aa7a6e"><!--a--></a>I agree with the Finance
Minister that the GST is a regressive tax. The GST Voucher Scheme
moderates this impact, although the policy falls short of supporting
many more in need. The Voucher offsets the GST payments of only
half of retiree households. Younger, low-income families also do
not get their full GST payments back. To achieve its aim, GST Vouchers
should cover all HDB households whose incomes are within the bottom
20%. The GST Voucher values must also rise over time to keep pace
with inflation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-24804bfc-e493-4b62-9ea7-e0257267023f">

increase in CPF contribution rates for older workers. But increasing
the employee contribution rates in fact reduces workers' take-home
pay. Since the Government is providing an 8% Special Employment
Credit (SEC) to companies for employing older workers, the increase
in CPF contributions should come entirely from employers, not employees.</p>

has provided more childcare support to lower income families, which
is something I welcome. However, many young, middle income families still
struggle to pay well over $1,000 each month for childcare, even
after subsidies. Those of us with young children would agree that
childcare costs are one of the most significant expenses for families.
I urge the Government to provide more childcare subsidies for middle-income
earners, as this would not only lighten their burden, but may make
them consider having more children.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9fd55cd-3bcc-4919-a59b-1bc712bc8f6c">

would like to share some thoughts on the poignant video that the
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister screened at the end of
his Budget speech. Tears welled up in my eyes when the little girl
from a low-income family shared her dream of buying a house for
her parents when she grew up. While I admire her love for her parents,
it pains me to think that given our widening income gap, increasing
high inflation, and slowing social mobility, many little children
like her will find it hard to afford an HDB flat of their own, much
less a house for their parents.</p>

as Members of this House, to do all we can to speak up for these
young ones, to enable them to fulfil their dreams and build a better
life for themselves, their children and their parents. This is what
the Budget of the Future should be all about. We can do more. We
must do more. Mr Speaker, I support the motion.</p>

that will benefit SMEs significantly and we should give more funding
and support for OJT so that they can have the option to be able
to use OJT in order to train their manpower, train their workers,
who may not be skilled at the time that they take on the job. Sir,
I believe that this will help to hire Singaporean workers who are
able to join the company even though they may not have the full
skills-set. So, while they are doing OJT, they can pick up the skills
and this will make Singaporean workers a bit more employable.</p>

I think the evidence out there is self-evident in many ways that
there are many families who find it hard to keep up with the pace
of life, keep up with the cost of living in Singapore, and it is
not a stretch of imagination to say that many children would find
it difficult to afford houses for their parents.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand
in support of the motion raised by the Minister for Finance, Mr
Tharman Shanmugaratnam. Sir, this year's Budget is one that is well
thought out, timely, prudent and yet responsive to many pressing
social needs. I concur with the hon Member, Dr Janil Puthucheary
who said earlier that this is a balanced Budget and we can be sure
that the Singapore Government will not spend beyond its means. I
consider this Budget to be one that responded best to the pet concerns
of my 15-year tenure. I like the caring component of this Budget
that addresses the plight of our vulnerable groups in our society.</p>

Budget is "An Inclusive Society and a Stronger Singapore". Today,
I would like to start my speech on an inclusive society in relation
to policy making. All these years, our policies have displayed strengths
in operational excellence and effective outcome, the success of
which had been the envy of many countries, especially those policies
that steered Singapore out of storms, the global financial crises, SARS,
the Asian Financial Crisis and so on. We have been very successful
in anticipating problems and solving them. My question is whether
we could have done better in the implementation of population policy
recently; in relation to anticipating the impending stress on the
locals, and on all the infrastructure demand resulting from such
policies. My next question is whether it is worthwhile and timely
to modify our policy-making model. Policy making that not only emphasises
the technical, on what is feasible or unfeasible, but also on political
constraint. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b58ecdcf-c07e-4599-b0e0-97f55fddd32d">
                  <a name="budget__id-b58ecdcf-c07e-4599-b0e0-97f55fddd32d"><!--a--></a>I feel that we need to
make adjustment on our policy making that caters to the sophistication
of today's populace. The rational model of policy making may be
more suitable than the incremental model. The rational model explores
all alternatives and looks at the consequences of each alternative
strategy and calculation of the probability of these occurrences.
The incremental model gives analysis to a few somewhat familiar policy
alternatives differing only marginally from the status quo; it gives
greater analytical preoccupation with side effects to be remedied
later, featuring sequence of trial, oversights and revised trials.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-010c34b4-d0b2-4d13-a635-a0c98f4368d6"><!--a--></a>We all know that public
policy must be multi-disciplinary. This means that policies produced
should be inter-crossed among fields, such as MOF, MOH, MCYS, MOT
and so on. Often, policies made by one Ministry can be synergised
with other Ministries to minimise duplication of efforts and for
a better outcome. Sir, is this practice being exercised in earnest
in our Ministries, are avenues in place to strengthen this approach in
policy making among our Ministries, from formulation stage to implementation stage?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-592022ec-53a8-4da9-ae16-dfe766d0e805">
                  <a name="budget__id-592022ec-53a8-4da9-ae16-dfe766d0e805"><!--a--></a>Better skills on interpersonal
nuances that help connect better with the end users are an important
tool. It will bridge the feedback stage to get better inputs during
the formulation stage, and it gets acceptance from the communities
during the implementation stage, the latter is especially so, if
the policy has bitter after-taste that requires tolerance from those
affected. This approach begets the question whether our present
feedback system is robust enough, and whether our service-centric
culture is efficient. As we grapple with increasingly complex issues,
compelling various differing sections of society and higher expectations
of the masses, there is a need for more options on the importance
of being in touch on the ground in policy making. Most times, even the most "bitter
pill" can be made more palatable with better communication and explanation.</p>

a fair and inclusive society. I applaud Finance Minister's important
move on stepping up social policy. One of the key challenges in
this area is inequality. I concur with the Finance Minister when
he said that the widening income gap would not go away soon. Singapore's
open nature economy and globalisation have played a key part in
creating income disparity here. In recent years, strong adaptations to
the tax structure and Government's manpower policies towards attracting
foreign talent have further intensified the problem.</p>

lowest income group is that they are not earning enough to cope
with rising costs. They are stuck in poverty and struggling and,
thus, if left on their own, they will deteriorate further. It is
reassuring to hear from the Finance Minister that "we cannot leave
our social compact vulnerable to market forces. We have to do all
we can to contain inequality, and to sustain social mobility in
each new generation". </p>

Voucher Scheme to offset 7% GST will lessen the difficulty of the

better off last year in household income. But according to the Singapore
Workforce 2010 report, some 400,000 workers or 20% of the resident workforce
earn $1,200 or less in a month. In the past decade, the bottom 20%
of households by income have had to increase their spending. In
2007 to 2008, this bottom 20% consisted of 218,280 households. In
1997 and 1998, the Average Monthly Household Expenditure (AMHE)
of this lowest 20% of households was $1,693. This figure increased
to $1,760 in 2007 and 2008. This group had to spend more, the income of
these households could not cover all their expenditure and they
were thus in financial hardship.</p>

residents staying in HDB rental flats in my constituency. The average
income per household for these families is $783 per month, but the
average expenditure per household on basics is $903 per month. Those
with children need to spend an average of $66 per month for each
child. This survey showed per capita deficit of $81 per month for
these households. The average household that I surveyed has four members
but in Singapore the average household has 3.5 members.</p>

(WIS) Scheme plays a significant role in lowering income inequity;
kudos must go to our Government for launching WIS in 2008. Therefore,
WIS should be adopted as a permanent scheme. More importantly, WIS should
be reviewed yearly to ensure that pay-outs could be meaningful enough
to prevent the lowest income households falling into poverty. About
300,000 low-wage workers received about $300,000 in WIS each year.
This works out to an average of about $1,000 per year or about $83
per month. I suggest yearly review based on average Monthly Household
Expenditure (AMHE) of this lowest 20% of households. May I beseech
the Finance Minister to tweak WIS to make it truly meaningful assistance
for low-wage workers? From my own calculations, those who earn about
$1,200 per month will need at least twice the average presently
given WIS allocation despite GST vouchers.</p>

reassurance from the Finance Minister when he said, "We have to
do everything we can to keep up social mobility in each generation,
and prevent a permanent underclass from forming in our society".
I support the two main solutions: high quality education for the
children and upgrading of the skills for parents. Parents of young
children of low-income and disadvantaged families need special intervention
to improve their predicament and to give this group an early start
with more resources, such as those mentioned in the Budget statement:
pre-school subsidies, MOE financial assistance scheme, student care
assistance. </p>

up a permanent system approach for a comprehensive community social
mobility strategy; a system to facilitate identifying these families, tailoring
the assistance to individual family's needs, monitoring progress
and following up on a long-term basis for their children? This set-up
is for the purpose of good take-up rate and to improve the long-term
outcome of such families through hands-on intervention and follow-up.
This will help these parents plan a better life for themselves and
for their children and to increase their children's educational
attainment. Social workers can be assigned to each family to look
into the varying needs, such as pre-school education, after-school
care, financial issues, parenting support, nurturing home environment,
student care, secondary school education and so on. Early identification of
such families with young children, similar to identifying children
who missed going to schools, should be adopted. Work-related participation
requirements might be part of a broader goal to improve long-term
outcomes for entire families, such as job training and skill upgrading
for both parents.</p>

passionate about helping the growing numbers of older Singaporeans
to live comfortably. I am impressed by the slew of measures aimed
at achieving this goal and I totally agree with these strategies.
More subsidies for firms to hire older Singaporeans will tap an
available valuable resource, especially in a tight market, to join
the workforce, benefiting businesses and the economy. More importantly,
occupation is a good way to keep older Singaporeans physically and mentally
fit and healthy. This aptly applies to the common saying "use it
or lose it".</p>

their assets for revenues to see them through retirement. May I
ask the Minister for Finance whether he can consider lowering the
CPF lock-up for older residents, especially those aged 65 years

care for patients is a necessary step in our ageing population with
an increasing dependency ratio. Such assistance in step-down care makes
good economic sense, as it will lessen the reliance on expensive
institutions, such as hospitals. With $8 billion spending over the
next five years, hopefully, home care, another type of step-down
care, which is non-existent presently, to enable the sick elderly

Health to become a reality.</p>

Inc? No, it does not refer to Singapore Incorporated. With Budget
2012, our terms of reference have changed. Singapore Inc 2.0 stands
for Singapore INClusive. In Singapore Inc 2.0, the economy remains
our basic building block. But real progress is in building an inclusive
society, a stronger Singapore. So, three cheers to the Minister
for Finance and the Civil Service for a conscientious Budget.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7d3eac60-e648-47d8-acfb-5fce005eade6">
                  <a name="budget__id-7d3eac60-e648-47d8-acfb-5fce005eade6"><!--a--></a>In this speech, I would
like to give some Budget feedback, suggest a new Singapore Inc balance
sheet framework for us to think about things, and also offer three
critical innovation strategies. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-857fc974-e46f-4d42-99a8-9d917c36681e">
                  <a name="budget__id-857fc974-e46f-4d42-99a8-9d917c36681e"><!--a--></a>On Budget feedback – first,
social. Sir, Budget feedback has been largely positive. Many praised
the efforts to address retirement adequacy, healthcare, education, demographic
concerns and rising social deficits. Singaporeans warmly welcomed
steps to bridge income gaps, reinstate older workers' CPF rates,
make permanent GST vouchers, higher wages for social and healthcare
workers, and also welcomed specific steps to upgrade and employ
the seniors, the disabled and needy Singaporeans. But the Budget
is not all a bed of roses. The business sector felt thorned by the
measures to tighten foreign workers. We want to reduce our reliance
on foreign workers, but SMEs struggle with cost concerns. Many employers
I spoke to acknowledged that there are too many foreigners. But
when asked whether they would employ Singaporeans, they said, "Unlikely,
because it costs more and Singaporeans do not want to do the job!"
Further, many SMEs feel choked by rising rentals, especially those
who are in the REITs property. This has been spoken about by many
of the Members here. And it makes me wonder: have we not learnt
from the global financial meltdown? Real businesses should be better prioritised
against rent-maximising financial instruments. There are 160,000
SMEs that contribute about half of our GDP and employ more than
half of our workforce. With negative headwinds in sight, businesses
face triple whammies. SMEs do need some more help to get fitter.
So I see the foreign-worker tightening measure as a form of an overdue
business diet plan. We want fitter, not fatter companies. We want
lean and mean productivity, not borrowed cheap labour. Health brings
wealth. But how to fast and eat less overnight and with no pain?
It is not possible. Old habits do die hard.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0e9b0f3e-af65-4058-b8de-b7238abdcb25">
                  <a name="budget__id-0e9b0f3e-af65-4058-b8de-b7238abdcb25"><!--a--></a>But the good news is that
the Minister for Finance is allowing time and also giving out vitamins
and supplements to give companies the energy boost while achieving
their fitness goals. Carrots, like SME grants, the Special Employment
Credit, PIC, all of these, far outweigh the stick of tighter foreign-worker
measure. The public purse is being used to help employers "do the
right things", and I think businesses should take heed.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-ae2692ce-4969-48bd-9059-4f15d3b716de"><!--a--></a>Sir, Budget 2012 has many messages that
are worth spreading, and there are many real deliverables that we
can cheer about. But we need to be able to communicate these to
the ground and also to the businesses alike. We need to do much
more to spread these messages.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-69bd7fed-641f-4208-9e2e-8a0049fe3387"><!--a--></a>Sir, on shifting paradigms,
at the IPS' Singapore Perspective 2012 Conference, the Minister
for Finance, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, remarked, "As we take further steps
to build an inclusive society, we must be able to sustain what we
do financially and not store up problems for the future." Indeed,
we are custodians of our future. It is easy to call for more cash
upfront, more handouts, more, more, more. But we also have to remember
that if we are careless and populist in our approach, then what
do we tell our children? The eyes of the future look back at us,
hoping we see them now. For this reason, I wish the Budget can go
further in advocating bold transformational systemic change to address
looming socio-economic challenges. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7fd64942-4e03-448c-a012-a8e76ad5434a">
                  <a name="budget__id-7fd64942-4e03-448c-a012-a8e76ad5434a"><!--a--></a>Let me offer a framework
to think about this. As Singapore Inc transforms, our national balance
sheet may look something like this − if I could refer Members to
the handout that has just been given out. Note that this is a simplified
version for discussion purposes, but it offers a sufficient peek
into Singapore's position amidst changing times. On the left hand
side, you will see that those are our assets. Assets are, of course,
our revenue generators and they comprise human capital, economic
capital, natural capital and infrastructural capital. On the right
hand side, normally called "liabilities" that requires paying up,
we have social obligations or social deficits which this Budget
seeks to address quite a lot of them, and they include things like
social inclusion of an ageing population, the poor, the disadvantaged;
social cohesion, that of our social fabric; social disconnect of
a transactional urban city environment; and social justice, especially
in the midst of globalisation and the spread of Arab Spring and
Occupy Wall Street movements. Last but not least, we have equity,
which are existing financial and social resources that help us to
weather rainy days. And we saw this financial equity prowess during
the recent financial crisis. It gives us the resources to keep business
running, invest in training and keep life as normal as possible.
It gives us great comfort and confidence. Then, there is also this
layer on social equity which, in fact, if you remember, saved our
nation from tearing apart during the SARS scare and 911. Without
them, Singapore could be a very different place today.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fa9e4203-e8ea-4748-b0ca-c5c6cd311c16">
                  <a name="budget__id-fa9e4203-e8ea-4748-b0ca-c5c6cd311c16"><!--a--></a>Currently, our balance
sheet looks good. We are in a healthy equity position, with robust
assets that ranked top in the world, and social deficits that are
somewhat bearable. However, it is not time to party. Not just yet.
If we project this sheet into the year 2030, with ageing demography
and low fertility, what would it look like? We call ourselves "a
city in a garden". Indeed, our present condition looks like a flower,
smells like a flower, blooms like a flower, but will also wither
like a flower, if we do not provide a counterweight to market failures
and externalities associated with growth. It is well documented
that, ironically, wealthier urban tribes suffer from higher social
deficits. Corollary, the complexity and demand for public goods
also increase. The problem is that the market system has no incentive
to supply such public goods. So, how can we meet the demand for
such rising obligations? Sir, I think the answer lies in system thinking;
the answer lies in us. In Chinese, we say: “万事皆人为”.
               </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-258a7ddf-343b-416d-87fd-ddae727fc377">
                  <a name="budget__id-258a7ddf-343b-416d-87fd-ddae727fc377"><!--a--></a>First, we need all hands
on deck, from the top to the bottom of society, to form a new alliance
of responsibility, a new high-trust, high-touch social compact.
In a fast-moving urban
city, no one can be a free rider. We need a hand-up paradigm to
build national resilience, not handouts to build dependency. This
is conscious compassion. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-c671fda6-0149-457f-b76e-9f4348cc2fc8"><!--a--></a>Second, the people sector
has to increase productivity levels and aggressively expand to meet
the rising social deficits.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1480</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-95b71c94-5f96-4f8e-b933-e5fed059ee59">

must take care of the needs of stakeholders, not just shareholders.
It must create sufficient economic profits and social dividends
for the common good. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8f881daa-1cbf-4814-be7f-d0b34f95f1b7">
                  <a name="budget__id-8f881daa-1cbf-4814-be7f-d0b34f95f1b7"><!--a--></a>Fourth, the public sector
is, in fact, the systems thinker who sets the direction, the rules
of the game, an incentive framework to form an inclusive, sustainable
and stronger Singapore. Perhaps the question then is: how do we
get started? Here, I boldly suggest three game-changing innovation
strategies to the Government. They are: (1) public policy innovation;
(2) service innovation; and (3) social innovation.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-59fbe773-cf9b-4f52-a06a-8d5875de3d44">
                  <a name="budget__id-59fbe773-cf9b-4f52-a06a-8d5875de3d44"><!--a--></a>On public policy innovation,
remember that the Government provides the incentive framework that
shapes business behaviour. So, instead of working in silos, that
means having one set of policies that is completely pro-business,
another set to collect revenue and yet another set to fund public
goods, why not have a holistic approach of crafting policies that
reward good business behaviour and scale socially responsible enterprises?
Go further: why not design the financial system to invest in a fairer
and more sustainable economy that produces real goods and real jobs
for the masses rather than maximising short-term financial gains
for the few? Go even further: why not craft procurement policies
that generate demand for socially responsible businesses and social
enterprises? This will result in billions of dollars worth of new
business to spur the growth of good corporate citizens. Such policy
innovation will generate new jobs and real jobs, reduce the externalities
or clean-up cost for the Government and add to our national equity.</p>

It is ironic that while services make up 70% of our GDP, there is
insufficient understanding on how productivity carrots may be applied
to the service end. The concept of service innovation should be
taken on a value-chain approach – from service production to service
consumption. Let me cite an example – the little acts of service
innovation that are taking place in our restructured hospitals.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-997415c9-0871-48cf-9832-82daacdba710">
                  <a name="budget__id-997415c9-0871-48cf-9832-82daacdba710"><!--a--></a>Recently, I visited a
PAP Community Foundation (PCF) teacher who suffered a stroke and
was warded at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). I was told to pre-register
my visit a day earlier to avoid long queues at the counter. Upon
arrival, a SMS alert informed me that the visitor quota was currently
full, so I had to wait my turn. While I sipped coffee, another SMS
alert came and told me that I could now visit my teacher. Swiping
my IC through the gantry was hassle-free. While at the ward, we
chatted and she was, thankfully, recovering well. Then a nurse came
in, entered the patient's vital statistics and signs electronically,
and medicine was dispensed with the help of IT to ensure accuracy.
Apparently, patients can also enter their food choices through the
PDAs. Just then, I received another SMS alert telling me that new
visitors had arrived and were waiting to visit. Obviously, I did
the necessary.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-112ce6d5-7d92-440e-a5a8-6474c95d9991">
                  <a name="budget__id-112ce6d5-7d92-440e-a5a8-6474c95d9991"><!--a--></a>This is human technology
and efficient service at work: "human" because technology adapted
to the behaviour and expectations of the visitors, patients and
healthcare staff; "efficient" because accurate real-time information
is seamlessly communicated to users and integrated into the mainframe
for better decisions. In a labour-hungry economy, we need such service
innovation to help each person produce better and more, and earn more.
Cross-pollination of ideas and collaboration is crucial for this
to succeed. </p>

subject of social innovation. Again, I declare my interest. Wikipedia
defines "social innovation", and I quote, as "new strategies, concepts,
ideas and organisations that meet social needs of all kinds – from
working conditions and education to community development and health
– and that extend and strengthen civil society". In short, social
innovation reduces social deficits and builds social capital that is
crucial to our new social compact. In this new social compact, building
an inclusive society is not just about redistributing resources
to help the poor. It is about empowering our people, building mutual
trust, self-reliance and resilience.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7ae16e6f-8618-46a9-a7a5-00672ae31b85">

impaired social entrepreneur, wrote a song about society's perception
of the disabled. And she said, I quote, "My abilities are only limited
by your imagination." This is most insightful. By our own norms
and expectations, we limit the potential contributions of those
who are different from us! This 3% of our Singaporeans can be our
assets too, if we could shift our paradigm. The elderly alike can
be and are an asset to Singapore. See not disability. See special
abilities. Like savants.</p>

try a very quick brain gym exercise. You think problem, and then
you think social innovation. So problem put in security – why not
design vertical city farms? Land scarcity and transport woes – why
not embrace Hiriko foldable green cars or even reintroduce car pooling
via "show-nearby apps"? Insufficient social workers – why not foster
local community caregivers' support networks. Tuition fees too high
– why not embrace free online tuition and peer-to-peer sharing?
Barrier-free access – why not employ wheelchair bound and elderly
to be our infrastructure experts and auditors? In wine connoisseur,
perfume and scent-related jobs – why not employ the visually-impaired
with well developed sense of taste and smell?</p>

The big question is: how are we helping each person to find their
best fit to reap premiums in a job? Square peg, square holes; round
pegs, round holes. Or do we continue to do more of the same of ill-fitting
them into subsidised wage jobs that leave them vulnerable when the
subsidies are withdrawn? </p>

and well-being are at the heart of Singapore. Everyone deserves a
dignified life. When we have demonstrated that effectively to our
citizens, there will be greater social equity. Singaporeans will
develop a depth of generosity and graciousness, from a position
of security and well-being to welcome diversity, people who are
different and people from everywhere. So I want to repeat my call
to the Government. Make social innovation a cornerstone in our nation's
development, not afterthoughts or <em class="ph i">ad hoc</em> efforts. To do this,
the Government can start with a mapping or auditing exercise of
the social innovation landscape and players in Singapore. Consequently,
establish a value chain approach from seeding ideas to fruition.
Involve the schools, involve the elderly, involve the community,
involve everyone on board. Leveraging on exisitng players, fund
it, scale it, multiply it through collaborative innovation. This requires
a whole of Government, and not just MCYS alone. I will be happy
to explore and help with any Ministry or agency on social innovation
projects.</p>

in our quest to be a city in the garden, we need to let a thousand flowers
bloom. We invest hundreds of millions of dollars into making Singapore
liveable and beautiful. But true beauty is in growing strong roots,
and cultivating resilience of a thriving garden, through interdependency
of the bio-diversity in an ecosystem. Our Government is the gardener
who cares a lot. But amidst the urgency of the changing climate,
we need to shift paradigms and innovate boldly, leverage on our
assets and equity to reduce our liabilities. Singapore needs to
come together as one Team Singapore – to build a more inclusive,
sustainable and better city in the garden. This is a cause that
concerns us all. This is the cause worth fighting for. I believe
in this Government, and I support this Budget.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, economic cycles have shortened in the last two
decades. We have weathered the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the
aftermath of 9/11 in 2001, SARS in 2004, the 2007 global financial
meltdown, the slowdown in 2010 and now in 2012, we are bracing for
the impact of the European debt crisis. It is important that the
Government continues to show the same level of commitment to its
people – that whatever form the crisis takes, it has a framework
in place and to safeguard those who find themselves out of work.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-171b9ad2-f3b6-4e17-b3fa-3aafb3e751f3">
                  <a name="budget__id-171b9ad2-f3b6-4e17-b3fa-3aafb3e751f3"><!--a--></a>We not only have to find
ways to boost employability and mobility of all our workers and
ensure our economy remains resilient, but also look at securing
a social safety net for the lower income groups. I applaud this
Budget for its moves to help the elderly, the low income and the
less privileged. And I would like to appeal to the Ministry of Finance to
review its tax relief policies again and see if more can be done
to increase personal tax reliefs and reliefs for spouses and dependants. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-59ffe2ff-c61f-484b-9daa-3264acddb642">
                  <a name="budget__id-59ffe2ff-c61f-484b-9daa-3264acddb642"><!--a--></a>Sir, health, after all,
is an important asset. As an elderly gentleman once told me, if the
chickens are not healthy and strong, we cannot be assured of an
egg every morning. The health of our nation is dependent on the
health of our people. I am happy to see the increase in the public
healthcare budget. But I hope the Government could also look at how
it can continue to ensure sufficient medical insurance coverage
for all. Yesterday, the media reported that hundreds of Singaporeans
did not pay their hospital bills. The total arrears owed by these
patients in a restructured hospital amounted to about $110 million.
The top-ups and GST Vouchers for Medisave are good moves, but by
no means sufficient. I believe MOH should continue to restructure
MediShield coverage so as to protect
more and ensure it does indeed help shield Singaporeans in times
of crisis and illness. We should also look into how we could help
the 8% who do not even have Medisave.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1483</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-029086ee-720d-47a3-9734-9feaa7857e98"><!--a--></a>At the workplace, I hope
the Minister for Finance could consider more incentives to encourage
companies to adopt portable medical benefits (PMBS). Since 2004, employers
implementing PMBS enjoy a higher tax deduction cap for medical expenses of
up to 2% of their employees' remuneration, compared to 1% for those
who are not. However, to qualify for the tax incentive, the companies
must either contribute at least 1% of the employees' monthly salary
into their Medisave Account or fully subsidise the employees' Shield
premium. From our experience, companies who qualify by making 1%
Medisave contribution have not been effective in ensuring that all
employees purchase any form of insurance, including the Shield plan,
and many continue with the Group Hospitalisation and Surgical (GHS)
Insurance Scheme, which is a duplication and not portable. To require
that only full subsidy can qualify for tax incentive has been prohibitive
as the cost of full subsidy is higher than the cost of GHS coverage.
As a result, many companies found it costly and no incentive to
switch to the PMBS scheme. I would like to suggest that MOF review
the tax incentive criteria to allow companies who fund at least
half of the Shield premium to also qualify for the tax incentive.</p>

that the enhancements to our Workfare scheme to benefit SPED graduates
and those with disabilities. Workfare has been very successful in
topping up the wages of the low-income families. Seeing as wages
and the cost of living are going up, I would like to propose that
the Workfare eligibility criteria be reviewed more frequently to
ensure it remains fair and truly encourages the economic mobility
of those who benefit from it. Can the Ministry also review the cash
and Medisave component proportion as well? Some lower income workers
told me that they wish the cash component could be more.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-f956e487-5c23-4acf-9917-5af15ee70f61"><!--a--></a>On the issue of encouraging
employment among low-income earners, as a labour Member of Parliament,
I would like to highlight the important role played by the public sector.
One area that should be looked into is the social responsibility
of Government service buyers. I would urge all Government agencies
to set a good example as service buyers and support the Best Sourcing
Initiatives advocated by the Labour Movement. When outsourcing their
work, they should adhere to best sourcing practices. Commonly, when
tendering for a contract, to get ahead of the competition, vendors
are likely to offer a lower price – at the expense of their workers.
The lowest quote often suppresses the wages of the contract workers,
unfortunately. For example, at MOE's schools, many of the cleaners'
salaries remain around $700, unchanged for many years. This is not
fair to the workers. Public agencies should walk the talk and take
the lead. I am pleased to learn that the PAP Town Councils are taking
the lead and, now, thanks to the skills upgrading and an overhaul
of the tender system, their cleaners have been enjoying a 30% pay
increase since year 2008.</p>

our social and financial support systems, we must remember to maintain
our economic fundamentals. Economic growth is important and we must continue
to drive it. In the social media, some talked about lowering our
economic growth – this is a worrying mindset. We have done well
to grow our economy by 3.6% on-year in 2011, despite the various
challenges brought on by the slowdown in the United States and the
Japan tsunami. But to deliberately slow down economic growth is a short-sighted
and unsustainable model. It is a dangerous slippery slope to go
down. We can see from other developed countries how unemployment
shoots up when the economy slows down. The best way for all of us
is to continue building our economy and enlarge the economic pie,
as the best "welfare" we can offer as a nation is full employment
with a strong economy. Nothing better than a tight labour market!
A job-creating economic growth is more than compassionate. </p>

I am happy that the Prime Minister has highlighted the need to support
Singaporean families. I would like to highlight the need to support
less traditional families. With divorce rates going up, we are seeing
more single-parent families. This is an unfortunate trend that is
made all the more challenging due to the difficulties caused by
high rents and difficulties applying for a new flat. Single mothers with
young children especially are struggling.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7744c3b6-ffad-4610-b313-34fafed6927e">
                  <a name="budget__id-7744c3b6-ffad-4610-b313-34fafed6927e"><!--a--></a>Rental rates are going
up. A check of the median rental rate shows that the average rate
for a 3-room flat in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $1,888, up 33%
from the same period in 2009 ($1,419). It is definitely much higher
now. This makes renting a flat quite prohibitive but, at the same
time, these families find it difficult to apply for a new flat as a
second-time applicant. I think HDB should review its policies concerning
single-parent families and consider these mitigating circumstances.
Can HDB consider giving them the same priority as the first-timer
homeowners or priority above the second-timer homeowners? Their
situation is desperate especially when there are children involved. </p>

vibrant society that is keen to share its views and participate in
discussions. This is encouraging. But we also see a small group
who abuse these platforms by derailing discussions with baseless
comments and hide behind anonymous identities. As the Government
and Singaporeans evolve to become more open with its communication
with each other, we must remember that freedom of speech is a responsibility
and must be taken in good faith. For anyone who wants to participate,
we should encourage all to do so, but would also hope that all be
above board and honest about individual identity. Sir, I will continue
my speech in Mandarin.</p>

Budget, we should allow Singaporeans to have more channels to express their
views and participate in nation building. However, after considering
different kind of views, we need to craft out feasible and effective
policies according to the actual conditions and implement them in
a practical manner. Political leaders should seek common ground
while embracing differences and make a concerted effort to serve
the people. They should also encourage Singaporeans to become active
but rational citizens who are willing to speak up and take actions,
so that together we can write a new chapter in the Singapore Story.</p>

a story by Nan Huaijin, a master of Chinese Culture. During the Ming
dynasty, a man fervently prayed everyday in the middle of the night
for several years. One day, a deity was moved by his devotion and
appeared to him. The deity said, "You are a very devoted believer
as you pray to the heavens every day. Tell me, what your wishes
are so that I can fulfil them for you." The man thought for a while
and answered, "I do not wish for anything. I just want to lack nothing,
travel round the world and be of good health and finally die peacefully."
After listening to the man, the deity smiled, "What you are asking
for is the good fortune that can only be enjoyed by deities. If
you have asked for earthly things, I can easily grant your wish.
But to live like a god, I'm sorry, is something I can't give." </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-e1826ad1-c02c-4499-b949-ef0896e8dd8b"><!--a--></a>This story reminds us that we are after
all human beings. We can have dreams and aspirations but not fantasies.
Instead of fantasising about becoming deities, we should feel proud
about being Singaporeans. We cannot listen to some of the unrealistic pictures
or mirage painted by some politicians and think that they are real.
Because what Singapore achieves today is the result of national
stability, our people's hard work and the ability to stay united
in difficulties. Currently, our world is intensely competitive,
just as the recently deceased superstar Feng Feifei sang, "The world
changes faster than the weather." During this period while many
countries are facing rising unemployment, it is commendable that
we have full employment. Real wages in many countries are stagnant
but we have achieved real wage growth for our workers. The purpose
of this Budget is to sustain Singapore's pragmatic and inclusive
growth. We want to encourage the tripartite partners to continue
working together. We want to encourage everyone to participate in
our growth and gather ideas from everyone. </p>

The service industry has provided 75% of the total job opportunities.
After this Budget, tripartite partners must weed out deficiencies
and come up with specific measures to cut down our dependency on
foreign workers. Local companies need to learn from a recent <em class="ph i">Straits
Times</em> report and turn "bad" jobs in service sector into "good"
jobs. The report stated that some American companies are upgrading jobs
to attract more local workers. Singaporean businesses should follow
suit, of course. I am aware of some local businesses, such as Wing
Tai, which have been doing a good job in this aspect. I hope the
tripartite partners will continue to work together to encourage
all our service industry players to upgrade jobs so that Singaporeans
can have better jobs and better wages. </p>

ideas from everyone. The new media is an important platform. But
I hope that political supporters and the general public will hold
an open mind and be responsible when they participate in discussions
online. Besides hoping that the various Ministers can better explain
their policies online, many grassroots representatives expressed
their concern about the many misleading viewpoints discussed online.
They hope that netizens will be real people with real identities
and not hide behind anonymities. We hope all discussions can be
conducted in a frank and open manner, knowing the people's real
identities, sharing views and ideas in a civilised manner. We want
to encourage people to discuss issues with an open mind, confine ourselves
to the issues and not make personal attacks or spread rumours. </p>

Analects about Zengzi's mother. Zengzi was a student of Confucius
and he was a man of noble character. One day, someone told Zengzi's
mother that her son had killed someone. Initially, she did not believe
the story as she knew Zengzi was a good man, so she continued weaving
her cloth, ignoring the person. But one after another, several people
came and said Zengzi had killed someone. Thus, she became uneasy
and decided to put down her work and look for her son to find out
the truth. This story from the Analects tells us that even the trust
between mother and son can be breached, what more other types of
relationships. A mistruth, after being repeated many times, will
begin to sound like the truth. If we keep calling a deer a horse, after
some time people will believe that the deer is indeed a horse. Singapore
cannot handle the possible social and racial segregation caused
by such over-politicalisation. We need to stay united and not be
led astray by specious views. </p>

need and came to seek our help. We should help him voice out his
need and guide him to the right avenues, in this case, see if HDB
has any assistance schemes that can help him. We should not just
tell him that, based on our own understanding, there is no way out
for him and he is on his own. This is a question of responsibility. </p>

does not mean letting others work while I stand and watch. Political
mandate are not words of sweet nothings. We need political leaders
who are pragmatic and keep to their promises. Confucius said in
the Analects that some people sounded very clear and logical when
they speak and people tend to assume that they are noble people
who can be entrusted with responsibilities. But that is wrong! Because words
well-spoken are merely words. Confucius reminded us that it is not
enough to hear if someone speaks well but we need to find out if
they put their words into action. There is an ancient saying, "You
hear the footsteps but see no one come down the steps." Therefore,
we need to be clear that when a lizard severs its tail, it is not
the same as when a warrior severs his arm. Using a hammer as an
analogy, if it only makes noise but cannot craft anything, then
it is not a good tool, or not even a tool! </p>

growth and not just a quick one. As a union leader, I believe, without

that we all have a stable income and a better life. Quoting from
the master of Tzu Chi Foundation in Taiwan, "In great times, one
needs to understand great truths." Mr Speaker, Sir, everything we
have today is just as described in Li Maoshan's song "Things don't
come easy". Indeed, everything did not come easy. This is our Budget

is a shift in priorities. There is a little less emphasis on short-term
growth to catch the wind of opportunities or what critics have termed

itself. There is more emphasis now on how to transform our economy
for long-term sustainable growth. Equally important is that the
Budget also pays more attention to how the disadvantaged, weaker

of Workfare Income Supplement to work-capable Persons With Disabilities
(PWDs) and the extension of Special Employment Credit (SEC) to employers
who hire PWDs are over and above what the Enabling Master Plan 2012
to 2016 Report has recommended. While I am eager to hear the other
recommendations in the Report whether the Minister for Community
Development, Youth and Sports would endorse, I would like to urge
the Ministry of Manpower to do a little bit more for the special

PWDs at 16% of the employee's monthly income is an encouraging start.
Besides social enterprises, companies that have high potential to
hire PWDs are likely to be companies that are heavily relying on
foreign workers and they are seeing a reduction in the Dependency
Ratio Ceilings. To help them tilt the balance further, I hope MOM
could consider each employee with disabilities as two Singaporean headcounts
for the purpose of calculating foreign workers quota. Such a measure
will help and will further enhance the employment opportunities
for the PWDs. I also hope that the $120 grant per month for hiring
foreign domestic helper meant for taking care of the infirm elderly
could also be extended to families with disabled person. </p>

past few months, I have the opportunities to meet different groups
of SMEs to hear their business concerns particularly on the reliance
of foreign workers. The most recent meeting was last Thursday, a
few days after the Budget announcement. Initially, many CEOs of
SMEs expressed very strong views on the need for continuous reliance
on foreign workers. They are of the view that their expansion paths
would be curtailed and Singapore competitiveness will be affected
if we do not rely on foreign workers. Eventually, most CEOs understand
the need to restructure the economy so that we are less reliant
on foreign workers for future growth. However, they need more help
in a few areas. The SME CEOs ask for more time as we have heard
from different Members of Parliament here to adapt to the new situation.
While they accept that it would be difficult to hire additional
foreign workers, they hope that MOM will be able to be more lenient
with the renewal of work permits, especially for workers with good
track records. </p>

hand holding to improve productivity. For example, Mr Sok Hang Chaw,
Managing Director of Kingsland Pte Ltd, in the construction industry has
expressed the desire to improve productivity. However, unlike bigger
companies, Mr Sok does not have the economy of scale to engage consultancy
firm to help them restructure the company and would like Government
agencies to provide better assistance. To date, he has not been
able to tap on the grants managed by SPRING and IE Singapore for
capability development to upgrade productivity. Perhaps, more efforts could
be made by the two agencies to help this kind of SMEs who have the
desire to improve but need help to tap on the grants that the Government
has already put in place. </p>

in the past decades has resulted in massive job outflows from developed
to developing countries. In the 1980s/1990s, the US lost many manufacturing jobs
to Singapore and other newly industrialised countries. In the last
two decades, Singapore in turn has also lost a lot of manufacturing
jobs to China and a few South East Asia countries. In a recent <em class="ph i">New
York Times</em> article which was reproduced in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em>,
US President Obama asked the late Mr Steve Jobs what it would take
to manufacture iPhones
in the US instead of China. Mr Jobs was quoted replying, "These jobs
aren't coming back."</p>

problems. As long as employers can take advantage of much lower
labour costs in other countries, there is no compelling reason for
them to bring these jobs back. According to Jeff Faux, economist
and founding president of the Economic Policy Institute, "This global
supply of workers can be trained to do everything from design to
production, maintenance to marketing". More and more revenue will accrue
to executives, board members and shareholders who can leverage on
this massive supply of productive, hungry and skilled workers anywhere
in the world but not in the home country. This trend leads to the
suppression of wages earned by the manual workers in the related
industries and is one of the main causes of rising income disparity between
the rich and the poor in the developed economies. So, how could
we help the low-wage workers?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-51285763-8870-4f81-8c44-ab4bcf10d39e">

of low-wage workers is that they lack the skills and need training
to move into better-paying positions. What are the better paying
positions? Doctors, lawyers, bankers, accountants? Even as we have
more graduates in Singapore, we will not have enough such high paying
jobs for them. For every doctor, we need more nurses, allied health
professionals, technicians, customer service officers and even cleaners.
These are the service jobs that cannot be moved outside of Singapore.
It is the same for other industries such as retail, transport, F&amp;B,
etc. This is in sharp contrast with the manufacturing jobs that
can be easily relocated out of Singapore, as mentioned earlier. </p>

workers to fill a big proportion of these service jobs. It is not
sustainable and many Singaporeans do not want that. What is the
alternative? We need to encourage more Singaporeans to do the service
jobs. I agree with the editorial published in the <em class="ph i">Lianhe Zaobao</em> yesterday
that doctors and nurses are equally respectable professions. Similarly,
construction workers are also holding respectable jobs. But construction
workers in Singapore are earning less than 10% of the doctors' pay
as reported in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> last month. Doctors
in Hong Kong and Singapore earn about the same pay but a construction
worker in Hong Kong earns about 25% of a doctor's pay. And this
explains why most of the healthcare and construction workers in Singapore
are foreigners. The same can be said for cleaners and others holding
low paying service jobs. </p>

on foreign workers for growth, how then can we encourage more Singaporeans
to take up these service jobs? As mentioned by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang
earlier, there was also a newspaper report on how do we turn "bad
jobs" in the service sector into "good jobs". This was pointed out
by the visiting Assistant Prof Zeynep Ton from MIT Sloan School
of Management and was reported in <em class="ph i">The </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Straits Times</em> last
week. Prof Ton argued that these service jobs are not bad in nature.
If you invest enough on the service worker and improve the hygiene
factors, these service jobs can be attractive.</p>

We have to increase the pay substantially to attract Singaporeans,
amongst other measures. If the pay increase is equivalent to the
increase in productivity, technically, we do not have to pay more
for the services. But life is not so simple. </p>

precinct complained that their void decks were very dirty and often
not cleaned for days. I visited the areas a few times alone and unannounced.
I took photographs of the state of the area and sent it to the Jurong
Town Council. The cleaning contractor did not improve despite repeated
warnings, citing difficulties in getting workers; Singaporeans do
not want to work for them, and all the other excuses. As a result,
the Jurong Town Council called for a new tender and awarded the
job to a new contractor who subsequently performed very well. The performance
of the new contractor was so good that the previously dirty precinct
was awarded the "A litter-free Environment" and the award was given
out by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for the Environment and
Water Resources on 15 January this year. However, the change in
the contractor came with a price. The new contract was about 30%
higher than the last contract, despite the new contract being one
of the cheapest quotes submitted. The new contractor cited reasons
such as higher foreign worker levy, the need to pay more to hire
Singaporeans and that they deploy better equipment, etc, to justify
the higher price. For this case, the Jurong Town Council has absorbed
the increase in cost and did not pass it on to the residents. If
all the cleaning contractors increase their price upon renewal,
the situation can be tricky. Are Singaporeans prepared to pay more
as we hire more Singaporeans to work in the service sector?</p>

agencies, as the largest consumer of services, could take a lead
to pay the increase in costs for the outsourced services such as
cleaning, security, construction, etc, provided that the increases
are due to the higher cost of paying Singaporean workers. 羊毛出在羊身上. While
I am tempted to suggest more spending, I am quite mindful of how
to fund them. The Government cannot keep increasing expenditure
and run into deficit. At some point in time, Singaporeans have to share
the costs. Perhaps, those who are in the higher income brackets
may have to pay more, as suggested by Mr Hri Kumar and Ms Denise
Phua yesterday, so that we can move towards a more inclusive society.
We do not want to end up like other countries whereby their social
spending exceeds the Government's ability to pay and hence we have
to burden the next generation.</p>

are thankful that this Budget provides timely assistance to the special
needs community though we hope MOM could do more to induce companies

utilise the various Government grants to increase productivity as
we reduce reliance on foreign workers. Lastly, Singaporeans must
be prepared to pay more for the services so that we can have more
Singaporeans to do the service jobs when we turn "bad jobs" into
"good jobs". With this, I support the Budget.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Vikram Nair (Sembawang)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, I am honoured to speak in support of this Budget. When
I initially came here, I only had two main points I wanted to make
but after listening to a very intriguing speech by Mr Chen Show
Mao, there are a couple of ideas that can be detailed and, hopefully,
we can come up with some very good suggestions for this Budget indeed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c471a248-7f37-44d6-97bd-be59efc8fced">
                  <a name="budget__id-c471a248-7f37-44d6-97bd-be59efc8fced"><!--a--></a>Let me start with what I most welcome
about this Budget. What is truly heart-warming about this Budget
is the emphasis on helping the needy and the vulnerable. For many
of us who have been helping on the ground, we have seen the real
issues that the vulnerable groups suffer. The added measures in
this Budget will help those groups in a great many ways. I filed
more than 10 cuts for the COS, which I will go into the details of
how these things may work out in different Ministries, and I would
not repeat that here.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1490</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c02477bf-193a-4a3f-9bb1-ffb2b7f69075">
                  <a name="budget__id-c02477bf-193a-4a3f-9bb1-ffb2b7f69075"><!--a--></a>The second aspect that
is very important is the emphasis on balancing the Budget. Now,
this has been brought up by many speakers and I am happy that speakers
on both sides of the House agree with this. Because this is, in
many other places, not automatically something that people would
agree with. In fact, one of the things that has been of greatest
concern to me is that in many of the developed and what you might term
"First World democracies", there is a tremendous pressure for parties
on both sides to spend more, to basically say "Let's do more". Because
what is the benefit of saying "Let's do more"? It means that you
can spend money on a particular group and get the support of that
group. Now, where does that money come from? Invariably, from the Government.
It is always "Let's do more", and Government pays more.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3157a7ea-83fc-48cf-a1a6-278d9a0b11b0">
                  <a name="budget__id-3157a7ea-83fc-48cf-a1a6-278d9a0b11b0"><!--a--></a>Now, the impact of doing
that, of course, is that someone ultimately has to pay the price.
That price can be paid in two ways. One, you go on a deficit. If
you go on a deficit, everything may look fine for the moment but,
you know, sometime in the future, the future generations will have
to pay the price which is what is happening in many developed countries
now. The second way we can pay the price is with higher taxes. Now,
in most developed countries, the taxes are substantially more than
Singapore. Median income earners will easily pay more than 30% to
40% tax, something which is almost unheard of here. And this has
happened over the years in a sort of creeping fashion because governments
always say, "Let's do more, let's spend more." And, of course, they
never talk of where this money is going to come from. So, eventually,
the money comes from the people because, ultimately, government
is from the people and the people have to pay the price at some
point.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-15d1a562-c13d-4b65-a27f-91e08b90187b">
                  <a name="budget__id-15d1a562-c13d-4b65-a27f-91e08b90187b"><!--a--></a>One of the greatest gifts
that we have received from our previous generations of leaders is
that they have actually strived to balance the Budget so we do not
have to carry the burden of the deficits of a previous generation.
And I think one of the most important gifts that we can give to
the next generation is not to pass on the burden of our deficits.
So, in this regard, I know that many speakers here have highlighted
areas where they think more can be done, and I think many of these
come from noble motivations and many of these are in areas that
all of us feel for and understand. But the reality is that if you
agree that balancing the Budget is an important objective, then
the real question is what trade-offs do you make when you want to
do more, and I think this is the real challenge we face.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aa884dd5-f7c0-48eb-afe0-d693749461df">
                  <a name="budget__id-aa884dd5-f7c0-48eb-afe0-d693749461df"><!--a--></a>This is why Mr Chen's
speech was particularly intriguing. Now, I am wearing a shirt here
that is blue-and-white striped. I do not really mind whether the
idea comes from the blue party or the white party. As long as it
is a good idea, I think it is something we can all run with. Initially,
I must say that some parts of Mr Chen's speech were a little bit hurtful.
I will just flag this just out of openness. The part that I found
hurtful was when he started off by saying the Government has heeded
the call for inclusive growth. That is our long-held belief. Now,
the insinuation from this is that the Government previously did
not care about inclusive growth but it is something that he had
personally believed in all the time.</p>

different areas where he thinks more can be done, particularly in
relation to the needy groups and vulnerable groups, and he says, "Let's
do more, let's do more, let's do more." But "Let's do more" is a
wonderful rallying cry because it does two things. First of all,
by highlighting the vulnerable groups, he shows that he understands
their plight; second, by saying "Let's do more", he is suggesting
that the Government is not doing enough. In that sense, it is a
wonderful way to score political points which is a fair game. But
I found it a bit hurtful because it suggested we were not doing
enough and we did not care. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1491</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-aa4b8e27-ff51-4cb6-a645-34ec955f40be">
                  <a name="budget__id-aa4b8e27-ff51-4cb6-a645-34ec955f40be"><!--a--></a>The message that we did
not care came out even more strongly in his third point when he
says the burden of the vulnerable group "should not be seen as a
challenge or a problem", thereby attributing to the Government and
the PAP, I guess by insinuation, that we had somewhat categorised
them as a challenge or problem, and he came up with a new word.
He said, "They should be seen as investments", thereby putting a positive
spin to it. </p>

to convey here again is that we did not care, but, of course, he
did and he was going to invest in it. This was hurtful because I
think many of us here had been working year in, year out, helping
the vulnerable groups and it is pretty hurtful to come from Mr Chen
because he might have held this belief for a long time but he only came
back quite recently to help in this. I certainly hope that he will
not make further insinuations against the character or the heart
of our party because we certainly share the same belief that this
vulnerable group should be helped and it is in this spirit that
I look at the remaining points. </p>

Mr Chen's idea was the idea of an investment that pays for itself. I
am not as smart as Mr Chen; I am certainly not the Wei Zheng of
this House, so I must press him for a few more details to understand
how this self-funding investment works. I know he used the word
"investment" to put a positive spin to it but, unfortunately for me,
the term "investment" – maybe because I was scarred in my younger
days – does not have quite so positive a connotation. </p>

that he could take delivery of a multi-million dollar shipment of
oil, he would be able to pay me back a million dollars the next
week. I was a student, I did not have $10,000 at that time, so I
never took part in that investment. But I subsequently learnt that
this was a scam. Imagine my hurt.</p>

does not always have the same positive connotation to it that Mr
Chen does. But it might well be that, in Mr Chen's case, these investments
are genuine and pay for themselves. We do not know based on the
level of detail he gave us. Let me just press for some details. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a628d576-1c4f-424e-a319-48f88995fe11">

was about investing in social capital. He was saying that we need
to invest in social capital – in the elderly, the disabled and the
poor, and I agree. In fact, from what I have seen, that is one of
the most fulfilling things that we can do as a Member of Parliament.
We look for the vulnerable groups, we help them out in the meantime and we try
and empower them in the long term. But we are not as smart as him
because our investments certainly incur costs; they are certainly
not self-funding. What I was really impressed by was when Mr Chen
loudly shouted, "Let's do more"; he also said that since these are
investments, we do not have to make provisions for them in the Budget,
we do not have to raise any revenues at all. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1492</p>

I thought maybe we have to put an outlay first. Even the Nigerian
scheme required you to put $10,000 upfront. But Mr Chen€˜s scheme
does not even require a short-term provision. It is not even a deficit
for one year. No, no, no. It will pay for itself because it is an
investment. So, I would like him to explain how he expects these
schemes to pay for themselves because, if they do, I will wholeheartedly
support it. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-47804c5b-09f0-4f42-81c4-91f17ab84a89">
                  <a name="budget__id-47804c5b-09f0-4f42-81c4-91f17ab84a89"><!--a--></a>He also mentioned that
we need to set up agencies to think about this, for example, agencies
like EDB, A*STAR and SPRING. As far as I know, these agencies employ hundreds
of people and there is a cost in doing it. Not only that, but there
are already agencies like CDCs, e2i and SCORE that do look out for
help for these vulnerable groups. So, what I am really curious about
is why he intends to set up additional agencies and, more importantly,
how these additional agencies will pay for themselves? Because if that
is indeed the case, then I have no qualms at all setting it up.
But I myself still struggle to think about how the underlying principle
that you can have an investment that requires no revenue provisions
and which will yield wonderful returns. And, mind you, the wonderful
returns are really good because it is not just economic returns,
it is also social capital and cultural returns. It is even better
than the Nigerian scheme because you do not have to put in any money
at all and you get more than money in return. I would wholeheartedly
endorse it but I need the details, the nuts and bolts, on how this would
work. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-875b0e7c-92e4-4d5b-b4f6-c70b7d9b10ba">
                  <a name="budget__id-875b0e7c-92e4-4d5b-b4f6-c70b7d9b10ba"><!--a--></a>And it is not just the
elderly, the disabled and the poor that he is interested in. He
also said that these same ideas can go into education and schools
training our workers for jobs and empowering our workers. Again,
all wonderful things, and all things which there are already many
agencies and institutions set up to deal with. So, again, what I would
like to hear from Mr Chen is how exactly we can do this "Let's do
more" without any requirement to raise the revenues or costs to
meet these demands. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-14e480d0-0bc4-4d7b-966f-0f8087d68323">

worker dependency, which was quite interesting, actually has, I
would say, two sides to it. Mr Chen recommended in his speech that
we should reduce the dependency. He recognised that we are reducing
the dependency ratio, and then he asked the rhetorical question,
"How effective will the proposed measures be in reducing our dependence
on foreign workers?" The insinuation and, of course, he then repeated
his favourite phrase, "Let's do more". So, when we put these two
statements together, the inference we draw is that the current measures
are not enough to stem the inflow of foreign workers. I must say
there is some irony in that this is coming from a man who spent
more than half his life abroad and came back to Singapore shortly before
the elections now complaining we are having too many foreign workers.
But be that as it may, I do agree that there is an issue with us
having too many foreign workers and we are doing our best to keep
it down. The flip side of that is this – this is a claim that many
other Members of this House have struggled with – when we tighten
foreign worker numbers, there is a trade-off. It is not trade-off
free. The people who suffer at the moment are the SMEs. Many different
people in this House have raised the plight faced by SMEs. So, if
Mr Chen has any suggestions on how we can reduce our dependency
on foreign workers
without hurting the SMEs too much, then I am all ears because we
did not hear how these trade-offs would work. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bc6f89ed-bfb8-4df1-998f-8059478328f7">
                  <a name="budget__id-bc6f89ed-bfb8-4df1-998f-8059478328f7"><!--a--></a>To be fair to him, he
did mention something. He did mention that we should have a Government
agency looking into different ways of categorising the sectors and,
quite interestingly, he said that we should not set up another agency
or more bureaucracy to deal with this. What he said is that the
Government should consult industry more. Again, if we think about
it, how does the Government consult? The Government can consult
in two ways. One, it can employ more people to consult which, by
the way, means additional costs. Or, two, it can add to the workload
of existing civil servants, which basically means they work a lot
harder for the same pay, if you do not want to pay them more. So,
either way, you are putting additional strain in demanding this
consultation. Having said that, from what I understand, a lot of
consultation already takes place in the Government with industry
leaders. As a Member of Parliament, I can also tell you that certainly
in the Trade and Industry Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC),
led by Ms Jessica Tan, we also consult industry leaders and SMEs
to find out what are their demands for labour, and so on. Not just
the Government, but the Members themselves also consult. There is
a lot of consultation that takes place already. When Mr Chen said that
more consultation is needed, "Let's do more", I would like to know
what exactly are the nuts and bolts of this "more" and how it would
pay for itself.</p>

I agree entirely that if we have investments that pay for themselves
and can achieve the benefits he has promised, it should be done
and all Members of this House will stand behind it. I just hope
that we can have the details to do that. </p>

would make, call me a very boring old-fashioned person but given
that we believe in balanced budgets, I also think it is very important
to be accurate with facts when we come forward and make demands
for budgets. I would just like to highlight a couple of points,
and these came up mostly in Mr Giam's speech earlier. When Mr Giam
was asked by various Members of this House the basis of various propositions
he was making – by Mr Ang Hin Kee and Dr Janil Puthucheary – he
did not give a straight answer on exactly what his source was for
the various representations. In Dr Janil's case, I think he made
an allusion to a report by the MFA on income inequality between
generations. Is that right? I guess we can address that later. But
from what I understand, from the executive summary of this report,
the report actually finds that based on the current cohort that
is being studied, income mobility in Singapore is moderately high
and higher than the US. It also says that it makes no finding in
relation to future generations, precisely because the future generations
have not yet matured. So, it does not have the data to make that
finding. But, based on existing facts, income mobility inter-generational
is actually moderately high. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d34ff11a-020a-474e-99c7-32cb79fca8ec">
                  <a name="budget__id-d34ff11a-020a-474e-99c7-32cb79fca8ec"><!--a--></a>The second point I will
make is that I think Mr Giam also mentioned that we should have
scholarships to get bright people to the SMEs. Again, this is something
that is good but it is something that is already being done. In
fact, SPRING Singapore has scholarships specifically for the SME
sector. So, once again, before you shout, "Let's do more", it is
important to know what is being done and then explain what more
you want to do and, more importantly, how you would finance it if
you agree that a balanced budget is a good thing. By and large,
I think the points I have highlighted today are largely points to
emphasise that I agree with my friends on both sides of the House
that there is more we can do. But if we believe a balanced budget
is important, then I think my
friends are also obliged to explain the trade-offs involved before
we go into this "Let's do more" and how exactly it will be financed.</p>

Sir, I would like to thank the Member for such a close reading of
my speech. I have no clarifications to seek from him on his speech because
most of it was about my speech, on which I have no questions. But
I do wish to make a point, and that is, as a general rule in this
country, we do not earmark Government revenues for particular spending.
Therefore, the discussions of how particular spending programmes
would be funded would of necessity entail a discussion of our total
Government revenues and our spending. My point was that when we
talk about spending – especially those in policy areas of social
policy, meaning social security, public housing, education, healthcare,
infrastructure and the environment – we should bear in mind that
we are not just talking about, in most cases, spending to be incurred
in this one term but instead it should take into account the benefits
that will accrue and these, in addition to economic benefits, could
include social and cultural benefits of the sort I mentioned in
my speech.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Pritam Singh (Aljunied)</strong>
                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, I support many of the initiatives proposed by the
Government, particularly measures directed at the social well-being
of Singaporeans, especially the elderly and the disabled. I am going
to speak on two issues covered in the Minister's speech.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3d94166d-e7ba-42ea-aac7-4e1e0b54685b">
                  <a name="budget__id-3d94166d-e7ba-42ea-aac7-4e1e0b54685b"><!--a--></a>Firstly, the measures
introduced to unlock the wealth older Singaporeans hold in their
HDB flats. I note the Finance Minister's concern about the older
generation of Singaporeans who have very limited cash savings and
low CPF balances because wages were much lower 20-30 years ago,
and because of the lower Minimum Sum then. I would, however, caution
that low CPF balances ought to remain a permanent concern of the
Government as future wage increases look likely to be moderated
by inflation and the cost of living.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3cac0551-c869-4119-8e36-ba0b6f15f899">
                  <a name="budget__id-3cac0551-c869-4119-8e36-ba0b6f15f899"><!--a--></a>More importantly, the
high cost of public housing relative to wage growth is likely to result
in mortgages that are marked by a longer pay-back period, inevitably compromising
the ability of Singaporeans to grow their nest-egg. Nonetheless,
I commend the Government for raising CPF contribution rates. While
I empathise with SMEs who already face short- and medium-term difficulties
with regard to labour-related overheads, the national interest dictates
that the post-retirement well-being of all Singaporeans, including
those very employees that keep SMEs competitive, must remain a primary
social objective of any Singapore government.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c69cd0d3-0973-4a59-a72e-737b3c7f0007">
                  <a name="budget__id-c69cd0d3-0973-4a59-a72e-737b3c7f0007"><!--a--></a>I am encouraged by the
Silver Housing Bonus of $20,000 which will be extended to older
Singaporeans who wish to sell their existing flats and downgrade
to other flats. I do ask that the Government consider extending
the policy to all HDB households, so as to give retiring Singaporeans
more options. Equally, it is also noteworthy that the Government
has sought to make the Lease Buyback Scheme more attractive by doubling
the incentive from $10,000 to $20,000.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-90286994-6677-41f3-adc5-3e7afcf05d81">
                  <a name="budget__id-90286994-6677-41f3-adc5-3e7afcf05d81"><!--a--></a>I see the enactment of policies that allow
older Singaporeans to monetise their flats as a central pillar in
ensuring Singaporeans live out their retirement years with reasonable
dignity, as they stand to receive a larger CPF LIFE payout.</p>
            </div>

                  <a name="budget__id-e1e1f1f7-22c8-4b33-bf02-cffbb560d063"><!--a--></a>Like many Singaporeans,
I am disturbed when I see older Singaporeans having no choice but
to work because they cannot afford to retire. Their health may not
allow them to stay on their feet for hours on end, but they have
no choice, as they need the money to survive. While I admire the
drive, determination and self-respect of such Singaporeans, I feel
the Government need to introduce more policies that ensure as many
of our elderly live out their retirement with a sense of accomplishment,
with full-time post-retirement employment – a choice and not a necessity.
For that reason, I think the Government has done well with the Silver
Housing Bonus and the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1495</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-30d559bd-c4ae-450b-9170-c78960405625">
                  <a name="budget__id-30d559bd-c4ae-450b-9170-c78960405625"><!--a--></a>However, I am not certain
how these two schemes will work out in practice. In fact, I note
that the initial response to the HDB Lease Buyback Scheme was not
encouraging. Introduced in March 2009, the take-up rate has been
low. In fact, according to HDB statistics, it stands at 2% of all
total eligible households, or 446 households. Mr Speaker, Sir, the
Government may want to keep an extra close watch on both the Silver
Housing Bonus and the Enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme and consider
publicising a yearly report card on the take-up rate of both initiatives.
The public character of such a report card, apart from signalling
a robust attitude to accountability, would also reinforce and institutionalise
the importance of the Government's elderly policy in the public consciousness. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-634d72ca-3056-41bc-84bd-cf42132a11a4">
                  <a name="budget__id-634d72ca-3056-41bc-84bd-cf42132a11a4"><!--a--></a>Greater awareness of the
Government's elderly policy is also likely to have positive effects
on nation building and our national identity. If the take-up rate
is poor, it would be clear that the Government would need to do
more, and I for one would support the Government wholeheartedly
in this endeavour. If the take-up rate is good, it would simply
reflect positively on the Government's 2012 Budget. I sincerely
hope both the Silver Housing Bonus and the Enhanced Lease Buyback
Scheme are closely tracked as their success potentially portends
how Singaporeans can expect to live in their retirement years, especially
in terms of financial security, in a Singapore that is already one
of the most expensive cities in the world.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-6671aa9e-5130-427d-b5bf-07e316b7ccf6"><!--a--></a>Moving on to the second
issue, Mr Speaker, I would like to register my concern for the Bus
Services Enhancement Fund, as announced by the Minister. No one
I have met since the Minister's Budget Speech really disputes the
benefits of additional buses on the road, particularly if, in the
Minister's words, it will serve to reduce crowding and waiting time.
But there, nevertheless, remain some very serious questions about
this $1.1 billion "one-time" commitment to help fund the purchase
of 550 buses.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2404a040-5709-4ece-bfca-3d72514f4278">
                  <a name="budget__id-2404a040-5709-4ece-bfca-3d72514f4278"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, many Singaporeans
are asking why the shareholders of our publicly listed bus operators
are being extended this unusual generosity by the Government. According
to both their 2010 Annual Reports – both of which are available
online – SBS Transit has a market share of 75% and around 3,000
buses on the road, while SMRT has slightly less than 1,000 buses.
In the case of SBS Transit, the top five shareholders of the company
hold 83% of all shares of that company. The largest shareholder
of SBS Transit is ComfortDelgro which owns 75.11% of the company,
while the four next largest shareholders
of SBS Transit are BNP Paribas Securities Singapore, DBS Nominees Private
Limited, United Overseas Bank Nominees Private Limited and Citibank Nominees
Singapore Private Limited.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9cf82534-2b60-412b-ad11-7db6baf4fe3f">
                  <a name="budget__id-9cf82534-2b60-412b-ad11-7db6baf4fe3f"><!--a--></a>The public unhappiness
over the Bus Services Enhancement Fund since Minister Tharman's
speech has been very apparent. Part of the reason for this, I hazard,
is because this Government has traditionally been quick to urge
Singaporeans to choose the path of self-sufficiency, reminding ordinary
Singaporeans that there are no free lunches and no one owes us a
living. It would be useful for this House to remember that both
SBS Transit and SMRT pay their top management market-rate salaries,
pay their shareholders regular dividends, while operating in near-monopolistic
conditions. By any stretch of the imagination, these are not broken-back
companies.</p>

Transit 2010 Annual Report also stated the company's intention to
purchase new buses in addition to funding additional capital expenditure.
For that purpose, it launched a note programme in May 2010, issuing
a $100 million fixed rate note, which is due in 2015. So not only
is the company not a broken-back entity, it clearly knows how to
raise money too. And in FY 2010, SBS Transit paid it shareholders dividends
amounting to $27 million, while SMRT paid out $102 million to its shareholders.
SMRT, as I mentioned earlier, 75% of its operations comes from rail operations
so that dividend figure probably needs to be put in perspective.</p>

and sensible Singaporeans have been quick to eschew the Government's
$1.1 billion windfall for SBS Transit and SMRT Corporation. While
I appreciate the Government's intentions to put buses on the road
quickly, I would urge it to claw back the $1.1 billion of taxpayer
money expended on these bus operators over a fixed period of time,
but after consultation with SBS Transit and SMRT. There ought to be
nothing unusual about clawing back taxpayer money as the Government
already extends many direct and indirect financial subsidies to
both these profit-generating private operators. For example, they
are exempted from bidding for Certificates of Entitlement and they
are also exempted from the Additional Registration Fee, the main vehicle
tax and the duty on diesel. In addition, both these operators are
allowed to keep their buses on the road for 20 years, twice as long
as almost all other vehicles. They are also charged a nominal rent
for space their interchanges take up, while reaping the profits
their advertising revenue generates.</p>

reminded of a resident who runs an SME, who spoke to me at one of
the Aljunied Constituency Committee's Lunar New Year Dinner celebrations earlier
this month. He implored me to petition the Government in Parliament
to reduce or subsidise the COE of goods vehicles for SMEs. As Members
would know, the COE for goods vehicles and buses are classified
under Category C COEs. While our two profit earning operators do
not pay a cent for their COEs, this small time businessman will
pay in excess of $50,000 for his COE based on today's market rate.
While this is not an apple for apple comparison, I would say, it
does say something about the perception the man on the street has
about this Government's apparent lack of desire to communicate why our
bus operators are being extended this $1.1 billion gift. I understand
the Transport Ministry will address this issue in the upcoming COS
debates and I certainly hope it fully addresses the genuine misgivings
many Singaporeans have over the Bus Services Enhancement Fund.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2f038b3b-acd1-4e88-91bd-ae9e1e7b23e5">
                  <a name="budget__id-2f038b3b-acd1-4e88-91bd-ae9e1e7b23e5"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, I have
a second query about the figure of $1.1 billion for the Bus Services
Enhancement Fund. I had to learn from the media that the figure
includes the total
operating cost for the vehicles for 10 years, and it also includes
the salaries of bus drivers. According to the 2010 SBS Transit financial
report again, in that Financial Year, SBS Transit placed an order
for 600 buses, more than what the Government has committed to, comprising
300 award-winning Euro-5 compliant Mercedes Benz low-floor single
deck buses and another 300 Volvo double-deckers, all for the price
of $268 million. Taking into account inflation over the two last
years, I hope this Government gives the public a detailed breakdown
of the operating costs and the salary component that was set aside
for the Bus Services Enhancement Fund, in addition to all other components
that may not have been publicly revealed so far. Too much of this dispensation
of taxpayer dollar to these two profit generating quasi-monopolies
is currently unknown to the public beyond the big figure, and some
transparency would be very helpful.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-52587f88-6297-4add-ab48-6c8333b1bfac"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, a third
concern I note that dominated the online media, in particular, concerns
the unspoken implications of 800 additional buses on the road. The
routine questions are – is the Government planning for another spike
in immigrant arrivals, if so, how many are being planned for? And
what sort of planning parameters is the Government working with?
Is this $1.1 billion a harbinger of things to come, in terms of an
even larger population size? It would be apposite for the Government
to answer these queries because there is already a sense of an over-crowded
Singapore where public space is at a premium.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cf4405df-0ef3-42a4-959c-3dd13bd6fc71">
                  <a name="budget__id-cf4405df-0ef3-42a4-959c-3dd13bd6fc71"><!--a--></a>Other questions also dominate
the public realm about this $1.1 billion. What will this cash injection
do for bus fares going forward? Are both operators going to use
the profits generated and invest them overseas? Should Singaporeans
anticipate similar ostensibly one-time gifts to other publicly-listed
entities or companies of national consequence such as companies
in which Temasek Holdings or GIC own a stake? And can the taxpayers
now demand greater transparency from all companies like SMRT and SBS
Transit which receive taxpayer injections? Beyond just educating
the public on how their taxpayer dollar is spent, I believe such
accountability would generate greater trust between citizens and
the Government.</p>

billion is a whopping sum by any stretch of the imagination. This
Government should clearly set out how the figure was arrived at
and what this policy move of extending cash injections to publicly-listed
entities that perform a public function implies for policy-making
going forward. Mr Speaker, I support the motion.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, let me express my gratitude at being allowed to
take part in this debate. Unlike some of the hon Members, yesterday
I received no special request, so my speech would be entirely in
English.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8129b6dc-1246-4646-b373-bfd58a5a8ddc">
                  <a name="budget__id-8129b6dc-1246-4646-b373-bfd58a5a8ddc"><!--a--></a>This year's Budget is
a significant one, as it includes a number of adjustments to long-held
policies and also includes a host of measures that signal an evolving
vision of what we want our society to become. We are currently facing
a challenging global environment, with uncertainty surrounding the
European economies as well as that of the United States, and potential
instability amongst our Asian neighbours. It is not clear if China
will face a hard landing following its meteoric rise to the ranks
of the world's superpowers.
And India's internal political and security challenges are holding
up its progress to challenge or overtake China as an Asian economic
powerhouse. The global threat of terrorism has become a reality
for all nations, and simmering tensions in the Middle East as well
as a nuclear Iran and possibly North Korea are other security concerns
affecting the whole world.</p>

is experiencing change of its own. Following the much-watched General
and Presidential Elections in 2011, it is clear that the electorate
are more vocal when expressing what they want through a range of
channels and media. Among the things that they have said they want:
a home that feels less like a hotel during peak season, filled with
foreign visitors who crowd them out and a country which takes care
of them in times of hardship or when they get old.</p>

Budget 2012 has laid out two targets in its broad mission: to build
an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore. As other hon Members
have already pointed out, the measures introduced in the Budget
aim to achieve both these targets while creating a place that Singaporeans
are proud to call home, where they feel they have a say, a stake
and a sense of belonging.</p>

the Government for rolling out a ream of measures that address a
truly broad spectrum of sectors in our society. A Budget that, as
Dr Amy Khor mentioned earlier, puts its money where its mouth is
but also where its heart is. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-259d0bd8-efa7-4c4e-94d6-bb8149657c7e">
                  <a name="budget__id-259d0bd8-efa7-4c4e-94d6-bb8149657c7e"><!--a--></a>Budget 2012 has measures
aimed at restructuring our economy, lessening our dependence on
foreign labour, boosting productivity of Singapore firms and assisting companies
as they make the necessary transition. It also has schemes to help
our seniors, Singaporeans with disabilities and lower-income households.
It takes into consideration the views and desires expressed in recent
years by the public, and attempts to focus its impact by moving
away from a broad-based, "something for everyone" approach commonly
seen in the past.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0175503b-4232-4dd1-ad32-6ab1f618ad05">
                  <a name="budget__id-0175503b-4232-4dd1-ad32-6ab1f618ad05"><!--a--></a>The increase in social
spending marks the continuation of a gradual shift in recent years
to extend more state support to the elderly and low-income workers.
This departure from the previous emphasis on individual responsibility,
a lean social security and growth over distribution is no doubt
due in part to the evolving social compact. The former approach
towards policymaking is best suited for countries with a young population,
full employment, rising wages and rapid economic growth.</p>

through globalisation, sound policies and leveraging on technological
advancements. This also means that the environment we live in has definitely
changed. Gone are the days of double, or even high single-digit
growth. Rising socio-economic tensions have led to political pressures
and the movement towards a "new normal", and a different social
compact. The new Budget addresses this in large measure.</p>

aspects and mechanisms of the Budget will no doubt be debated and
addressed in the Committee of Supply debates in the days to follow.
For now, please allow me to raise three broader considerations in
relation to this year's Budget: the first is communication; the
second is competition; and the third is passion.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-71f7348d-f2bc-483e-b67b-7f828f7684bf">
                  <a name="budget__id-71f7348d-f2bc-483e-b67b-7f828f7684bf"><!--a--></a>Firstly, the concept of
communication, I believe, is key to the success of any plan of action.
If the best-laid plans are not effectively communicated and explained
to the stakeholders
involved, it will amount to little when it comes time for execution.
If there is no buy-in by society, we will be like a spanking new
car which has wheels that rotate in different directions. Some will
seek to drive the car forward while the others go in reverse. In
this case, no matter how powerful the engine, the car will either
remain at a standstill, go around in circles, or, worse, move backwards.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1499</p>

into account the views and wishes of Singaporeans, and has sought
to address some of the main dissatisfactions that have been expressed
in recent months. The move to curb foreign labour is a good example.
Despite the positive impact such workers have had to many of our
industries, there is concern that their increasing numbers will
test the limits of our space and infrastructure, and could even
affect the Singaporean nature of our society.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-fdce4b72-f0e4-4359-a919-af87dfe69f1a"><!--a--></a>The Government has acted
to address this, and also the fundamental issue that increasing
dependence on foreign workers is not sustainable in the long run.
The cutting of the Dependency Ratio Ceilings with effect from this
July will go some way towards ushering companies to adjust to the
new reality of a tight labour market. But Singaporeans must be aware
of what other likely effects this will have. Yes, our MRT trains
and buses may become less crowded, our social spaces may become
less congested with foreigners and the pressure on our housing infrastructure
may ease. At the same time, our industries will face a shortage
of labour given what is almost already full employment here in Singapore
and the plan to tap sources of workers such as homemakers and early
retirees is a good one, as it seeks to optimise our local workforce.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dfd4d9db-2a90-4d0f-a0d8-68d9eaa02103">
                  <a name="budget__id-dfd4d9db-2a90-4d0f-a0d8-68d9eaa02103"><!--a--></a>But will Singaporeans
want to take up the jobs vacated by foreigners? And if they do, they
will likely ask for comparatively higher salaries. And while the
Government is extending help to companies in the form of, for example,
the Special Employment Credits to help the hiring of older workers,
there is no guarantee that this will be enough to stop rising costs
from being passed on to the consumers in the form of higher prices. Companies
which are unable to find enough workers, or cannot cope with the
higher costs, may go under. This is part of harsh economic reality
and Singaporeans must be made aware of these implications.</p>

wants of society is a major priority for the Government. I believe
this Budget is a result of listening to what Singaporeans want and
aims to help us achieve that. At the same time, communicating the
full range of implications of the various measures is essential
to ensure that people are educated and informed about what their
wishes mean if they come true.</p>

has highlighted and explained clearly the measures detailed in this
year's Budget. I am sure that all the details of the various schemes
and measures will continue to be spelt out by the Government and
reported to Singaporeans via the various forms of media that we
have. But communication is not a one-way street. The onus also lies
on people to ensure that they are fully informed, to ask and clarify
if they are unsure, and to understand what their choices mean, and
what impact their voice will have, should they choose to exercise
it.</p>

point of competition. I am referring here to Singapore's competitiveness
as a small but strong economy in a sea of big fish. Our historical success
has largely been based on sound policy, especially in the realm
of economic planning, and also on a strong and transparent Government
that has created a stable and
healthy environment both for living and for business. As part of
my work, I have the opportunity to interact with partners and affiliates
from around the world. A common refrain I hear from them is praise
and admiration for Singapore and what we have achieved in the almost
five decades since Independence.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-1839b7fd-842e-44ef-97fa-053462b1bfcc"><!--a--></a>Recently, many of them
have asked for my thoughts on what they perceive as a shift in our
political environment, with a more active and vocal Opposition,
partisan politics and an electorate that is more savvy and articulate
than in years gone by. They wonder if this will unsettle the stable
working environment they have long admired and enjoyed. At the same
time, local observers say this is part of a natural evolution, and
that we are becoming more "normal", like other countries around
the world. Maybe our new normal really is "normal".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8cbe12ba-3a33-4e3f-92ea-f9360e5cbc97">
                  <a name="budget__id-8cbe12ba-3a33-4e3f-92ea-f9360e5cbc97"><!--a--></a>But is this what is best
for Singapore? A democratic system where the views of all are represented
in a fair and transparent way cannot be a bad thing, and it appeals intrinsically
to a sense of fair play and inclusiveness, where the interests of
all are heard and valued. At the same time, if we consider other
global democracies where sound policies are sacrificed in the face
of partisanship, where governments govern with one eye on upcoming
elections instead of long-lasting policies that are truly for the
benefit of the nation, I do not think that is necessarily a better
alternative. In such cases, we often see administrations which are
hamstrung in what they can actually do due to the need to appeal
to the populist vote in order to stay in power.</p>

of countries which are stuck in such cycles, but still manage to
survive, thanks to the safety net of natural resources or other
competitive advantages which enable them to keep moving forward.
Singapore does not have such luxuries. What we do have is a stable
business-friendly environment, a reputation for a clean and capable
Government, and a hardworking and dedicated workforce. If we lose this,
we lose our competitive edge when we go up against our regional
rivals, who are hungry and eager to take our place as an attractive
destination for work and play. Already, we are seeing rising costs
of things like housing beginning to affect our reputation as a global
liveable city.</p>

a dog-eat-dog world out there and we cannot afford to allow domestic
squabbles to tarnish our international reputation, even as we move
towards a new social contract that is acceptable to every Singaporean.
What then will be able to draw all of us together, to work and live
as a united people for our sustained success and prosperity? Sir,
it is my firm belief that we need to discover the passion that drives
us all as Singaporeans in order to answer that question. Now, I
am referring to a passion for the good of our country, a passionate
desire to see that we as a people continue growing in a positive
way towards success.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-166d12a2-df90-4861-8e58-bb82abe9ca55"><!--a--></a>There are many components
to this idea of passion. Among them is a sense of home, of belonging
to a place that gives us warmth and comfort. It is a place that
we can be proud of, with a shared history from which we can derive
confidence in who we are, that enables us to stand tall. It is a
place which we love and would fight to defend. To have passion,
we also need to have a sense of purpose, a clear direction set by
leaders at all levels who we can look up to and who inspire us to
achieve more than we thought we could. Passion can be intangible.
It is hard to cultivate and once found, it can be easily lost. It
can be developed through pursuits such as sports, and as my fellow
NMP, the hon Janice Koh said so eloquently this morning, arts and
culture which can give us a sense of common identity and connectedness.
Shared passion can bind us together as a people and a nation in the face of divisive
forces that arise in every society. And it can be a source of grit

passionate about who we are and what we stand for, and about our home

Members have said earlier, this Budget is one with a heart, and
represents our priorities as a nation, not just dollars and cents.
I would say that, for us to achieve the aims spelt out in Budget
2012, we as a people have to develop a passion and a soul as well,
in order to build a truly inclusive society and a stronger Singapore.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister and his team for putting together a Budget that
will hopefully make Singaporeans sit up and think about the society
we want to have, and to consider how we can do more to help those
around us, in order to become stronger as a nation. Sir, on that
note, I support the motion.</p>

Budget has a great impact on the economic development of Singapore
and the interests of workers. So, this afternoon, I would like to
represent the Labour Movement to air my views. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b1d5b5a6-9a57-4532-9215-5281767b78c1">
                  <a name="budget__id-b1d5b5a6-9a57-4532-9215-5281767b78c1"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, the Singapore
of today has its strength and advantages. Our economy is growing
healthily, we have full employment and our standard of living is
constantly improving. To achieve all this is not easy and it is
worth cherishing. However, we do not live in a perfect world, of
course, and there will be imperfections in Singapore. Hence, we
must constantly keep up with the times and improve. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e5bfb5b5-7ca1-487f-a2d1-fd9a7d5ca029">
                  <a name="budget__id-e5bfb5b5-7ca1-487f-a2d1-fd9a7d5ca029"><!--a--></a>There are now 3 million
workers in Singapore. If we allow the number of workers to increase
3% annually, 10 years later, these 3 million workers will increase
to 4 million. Foreign workers may make up 40% of the workforce.
If we continue this way, we will face even more and bigger challenges.
For example, the pace of economic restructuring in Singapore will
slow down, so will the pace of productivity growth. If we allow
this situation to continue, will the Singapore economy still be
able to move upwards in the next 10 to 20 years? Our country will
be more and more crowded. Can Singaporeans still live harmoniously
with the increasing number of foreign workers? </p>

do not change will become poorer for it. I believe if we want to
prevent the Singapore economy and society from getting into a difficult
situation, we must constantly look for new ways of thinking and
make new inroads. Hence, the Labour Movement understands and supports
the 2012 Budget and policy directions announced by the Finance Minister.
The question is whether we can translate these ideas into action. If we are
unable to quicken the pace of economic restructuring and there is
no continuity; if we lose our economic competitiveness, we may lose
our existing investment projects and cannot attract more and better
investment projects, what problems will the Singapore economy face?
If Singapore companies, especially SMEs, cannot adjust to the process
of economic transformation, how will they survive?</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1502</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ad59afe9-bf5b-46e2-b513-59daaf781717">
                  <a name="budget__id-ad59afe9-bf5b-46e2-b513-59daaf781717"><!--a--></a> If Singapore workers,
especially older workers and low-skilled workers, cannot improve
the level of their skills and their productivity, will they still
have a place in the future Singapore economy? In other words, what
I am most concerned about is, if our plan to transform the economy
is not successful, in this world where one is racing against the
tide, our economy will go into decline. Worse, our unemployment
rate will go up and our real wages will continue to decrease. In
other words, I am very sure that if we do not change, we will end
up poorer for it. That is why I support this year's Budget. However,
it is not certain that if one makes changes, one will definitely
find a way out. We cannot assume that if we have this new policy,
which is also a good policy, the transformation of the Singapore
economy will happen naturally. Hence, I hope that our entire nation
will try our best to ensure success, because the price to pay, if
we fail, is too great.</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang"> (<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Mr Speaker,
Sir, it is important, it is crucial that we restructure the Singapore
economy towards one that is more sustainable, driven by productivity,
driven by innovation. There is no guarantee that we will succeed
because there are many countries out there, many economies out there
taking the same path. But many of them either did not succeed or
succeeded to a different extent. In the case of Singapore, speaking
for the Labour Movement, we embrace this policy because we believe
this is good for the future of the Singapore economy but, more importantly,
this is good for the Singapore workers of today and tomorrow.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4a1c664c-2217-4335-86e7-58a9b60fdabc">
                  <a name="budget__id-4a1c664c-2217-4335-86e7-58a9b60fdabc"><!--a--></a>We believe that as we
restructure the Singapore economy towards one that is driven by
productivity and innovation, we ought to make sure that three important
outcomes are achieved. Firstly, the restructuring must include enterprises
of all sizes – small, medium, large. The strength of the Singapore
economy is not in any particular enterprise, not in any particular
cluster, but in many enterprises and in many clusters. The reason
why we have full employment today is because we have many companies
– small, medium, large and in many clusters – doing well. Therefore
it is very important, very important that with a restructured economy,
we pay attention to enterprises of all sizes.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-af4705d7-6d7c-41ff-baa8-0f14765d2514">
                  <a name="budget__id-af4705d7-6d7c-41ff-baa8-0f14765d2514"><!--a--></a>The SMEs deserve special
attention because they are the largest employer group. At the same
time, the strength of any cluster in Singapore is defined by the
weakest link. And the SMEs form a very important link of the Singapore
economic clusters. In that respect, the Labour Movement is glad
that the Government is extending special support to the SMEs. Take,
for example, in the area of manpower development. The Government agencies
have always extended special support to the SMEs in terms of training
grants. </p>

Prime Minister Tharman announced that the training grants for SMEs
will go up further. Earlier, Member Mr Gerald Giam suggested that
we ought to introduce scholarship to support the SMEs. I am happy
to share with Mr Giam that actually the scholarship for SME is already
in place. SPRING Singapore administers a scholarship whereby 70%
of the scholarship is funded by the Government, and the SMEs need
to fund only 30%. Many industrial associations are also encouraged
to set up their scholarship scheme with the funding support of 70:30
by the Government. Furthermore,
SPRING Singapore managed a scheme, known as Management Associate, to
help the SMEs to recruit fresh graduates to join them. For 18 months,
for these fresh graduates with employment with the SMEs, SPRING
Singapore provides training and development grants to send them
for training, not just locally but overseas as well. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1503</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3397a746-89f4-4d0f-81e8-59974fb8e30b">
                  <a name="budget__id-3397a746-89f4-4d0f-81e8-59974fb8e30b"><!--a--></a>I am also very happy to
say that the Government is supporting innovation in the SMEs because
the SMEs cannot compete just on low cost but with better product
and services. So, innovation is very important. In that regard,
again, we are very happy that Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced
the increase of the Innovation Grant from 50% to 70% this year.
I am told that SPRING Singapore also gives Innovation Vouchers of
$5,000. And all the SMEs need to do is to submit a two-page online
application, and thousands of them are today recipients of this
Innovation Grant. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ce4e86c3-6633-4740-922e-c2af96d119e3">
                  <a name="budget__id-ce4e86c3-6633-4740-922e-c2af96d119e3"><!--a--></a>We are even happier that
the Government agencies are doing more to help the SMEs to build
up their business capabilities, for example, from service innovation
through customer-centric initiatives (CCI) to branding, to intellectual
property management, and so on. On the whole, we believe that a
lot is being done to support the SMEs and, of course, we hope that
more can be done, and we believe more need to be done. So, for the
SMEs out there, yes, we know that life is tough for them, especially
the pace of rapid restructuring. However, we want to assure them
– I think it is important for the tripartite partners to assure
them – that we will not neglect them. In fact, in this economic restructuring,
we, as a tripartite partner from the Labour Movement to the Government, to
the industrial associations, are going to go the extra mile to support
them and to reach out to them. Why? Because their interest is also
the interest of the Labour Movement, as they are the largest employer
group in Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-acf7cf68-420b-4d4b-8caf-58848b4c0497">
                  <a name="budget__id-acf7cf68-420b-4d4b-8caf-58848b4c0497"><!--a--></a>If you look at countries
by size – small countries, medium-sized countries, large countries
or SML countries – Singapore is not even a small medium-sized nation.
We are one of the smallest, a tiny nation; yet, because we are able
to adapt, we turn our small size into our advantage and we respond
quickly. As a result, the Singapore economy is today one of the
most dynamic and most competitive. I think the same can be said
of the SMEs – turn your small size into your advantage and adapt
to situations. In fact, many of them, we believe, can ride this
wave of economic restructuring as well. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9d9290df-5e5c-4ff1-bed9-977ff0a2f5db">
                  <a name="budget__id-9d9290df-5e5c-4ff1-bed9-977ff0a2f5db"><!--a--></a>Sir, the second important
outcome for the Labour Movement is to ensure that this economic
restructuring will include workers of all ages at all skill levels.
Some of the older workers and the low-skilled workers, as reflected
by some of the labour Members, are concerned whether they will be
left out in this particular restructuring exercise. It is important
for us to recognise that, in fact, the tripartite partners – the
Labour Movement, the Government and the employer – have never neglected
the low-wage workers and the older workers. If you were to look
at recent years, the Government introduced the Workfare Income Supplement
– not a low-budget programme – started from $400 million, and went
up to $440 million. I think it will be probably much higher than
that this year. So, it is a big commitment by the Government to
support the low-wage workers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f94245bd-7a0e-49ce-96a3-564f74cda5b2">
                  <a name="budget__id-f94245bd-7a0e-49ce-96a3-564f74cda5b2"><!--a--></a>Housing Grants – MND introduced
special housing grants for the low-wage workers. ComCare – MCYS
championed for ComCare with all the grassroots organisations. Just last
year, we introduced the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) funded
by the Government, championed by the Labour Movement. Today, more
than 20,000 to 30,000 low-wage workers are under this programme
where they are going through job redesign and skill redevelopment. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c9700186-720c-4b6b-be01-cc5d7a714d51">
                  <a name="budget__id-c9700186-720c-4b6b-be01-cc5d7a714d51"><!--a--></a>Re-employment of the older workers – we
started that programme five years ago, even though the law has come
into effect only this year. We implemented it five years ago. And
just this year, we hear the good news of the restoration of the
employer's contribution for the older workers. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1504</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f0ec33d6-4c65-4876-b9c3-6235481ea297">
                  <a name="budget__id-f0ec33d6-4c65-4876-b9c3-6235481ea297"><!--a--></a>On the whole, we are encouraged
that a lot has been done for the low-wage workers and for the elderly,
matured workers. But, of course, we recognise that a lot more needs to
be done, a lot more can be done and a lot more must be done. In
this regard, as a Labour Movement, we hope that we make this focus
on low-wage workers, older workers, a national effort. Every one
of us can play our part to help the low-wage workers. When I was
the Environment Minister, I visited our hawker centres. I noted
that our hawker centre cleaners not only received low wages. In
fact, they did not even have proper uniforms, proper working shoes
and proper cleaning equipment. So, we changed all that. We redesigned
their uniforms, we redesigned their jobs, retrained them to upgrade
their skills, and today we are going to take a further step to upgrade them. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6ced3474-f4b5-464b-9a4f-674b4f68e08e">
                  <a name="budget__id-6ced3474-f4b5-464b-9a4f-674b4f68e08e"><!--a--></a>Another example is despatch
riders. At the Meet-the-People Session one night, one despatch rider
in Bedok, a resident, came to see me. He received a fine for illegal
parking. I asked him, "What caused you to park your motorbike illegally?"
He said, "Mr Lim, I am a despatch rider. My job is to run from building
to building to do despatches. I do not have much time. Many of these
buildings do not allow us to go into their car parks. So, I have
no choice but to park by the roadside in front of the building or
next to the building. And many of these buildings are in CBD, so
they have these double yellow lines, and that is the reason why
I received a fine on that day." And I asked, "Is your company going
to pay for you?" He said, "No, all $70 must come from my pocket."
So, of course, I appealed for him. But that got me thinking: why
is it that nobody paid attention to the interests of the despatch
riders? I came back to NTUC located in SLF building, and asked my
building management, "Every day we have despatch riders coming to
our building. Do we have parking lots for them?" They said, "No,
we don't have, because nobody has anyway." I said, "Then make sure
that One Marina Boulevard building will be the first one in Shenton
Way to have parking lots for the despatch riders." And we implemented
the programme a few months ago. My point here is this: yes, we can
talk about low-wage workers, the plight of low-wage workers, the
plight of matured workers but, at the end of the day, talk is not
good enough, we need action. And action does not have to come from
the Ministers, the Ministries, the Members, and so on. I believe
that everyone of us, in our daily lives, if we pay enough attention
to them, can do our part to help them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3c5de58d-226f-4ec3-8c86-d5fb58304f76">
                  <a name="budget__id-3c5de58d-226f-4ec3-8c86-d5fb58304f76"><!--a--></a>Sir, the third outcome,
which I think is a very important outcome, is that as we restructure
the economy, we must also make sure that we include both the local manpower
and the global manpower. I feel that this is an important point
to emphasise because there is this sentiment that under this new
policy framework, we are now turning off the tap for foreign manpower.
Sir, it cannot be the case. If we turn off the tap for foreign manpower
suddenly, if we try to reduce the number of foreign workers in Singapore
to zero, I think the Singaporean workers and the Singapore economy
will have a lot of suffering to face. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7688265f-9bf3-441c-8fc9-97a844270d39">
                  <a name="budget__id-7688265f-9bf3-441c-8fc9-97a844270d39"><!--a--></a>The idea – as a tripartite
partner, the Labour Movement supports it – is that we have to manage
the growth of the foreign manpower, not to reduce the number of
foreign manpower. For the Labour Movement, "Singaporean First" does
not equal to "Singaporean
Only". I think it is very important for us to recognise that we
are doing this for the interests of our Singaporean workers. </p>

if we are successful in our foreign worker policy and economic restructuring,
we should expect foreign manpower to continue to make up about one-third
of our workforce. In other words, for every two Singaporean workers, we
should expect to have one of them around because we need to have
them to supplement and complement our workforce. But what we want
to make sure is that Singaporeans will form the core of the Singapore
workforce and that one-third of them will still be here to complement
and supplement us, and not the other way round. In that regard,
we believe that all employers ought to make better use of every
worker, both local worker and foreign worker. For the foreign workers,
please do not use them just because they are cheap. Rather, we should
use them for their strength. In other words, in the recruitment
and hiring of foreign workers, we hope that all employers will, likewise,
pay closer attention to their skills and capabilities, and train
their workers – whether they are local workers or foreign workers
– so that everyone can be productive and add to the strength of
the Singapore economy.</p>

we succeed? Today, we have a good policy, we have a good debate
in this Parliament. The question is: will we have good implementation
after all this debate is over? I believe that as we go through this
process of change, there will be pain. Some workers will feel the
pain because they have to go for re-training. Some SMEs will feel
the pain because they have to go for re-positioning. Some clusters
will feel the pain because they have to re-group themselves. So,
Sir, there certainly will be pain with change, but we must always
remember that there will be bigger and longer pain without change.
Therefore, as we go through this process, let us not try to hope
for a "painless" process – it will not happen. Let us, as Singapore
United, go through the pain together; let us go through the change
together, so that at the end of the day, there is a gain for us
to share together.</p>

will not end because of the 2011 elections, because Singapore of
the past has not been a failure. The future chapter of Singapore
will also not begin because of the 2011 elections, because the political
interest is not the major focus of the Singapore Government. The
process of nation-building is long and full of opportunities and challenges.
The strategy used in the process of nation-building must thus change
with the times. However, the people-centred, nation-first approach
cannot be changed and will not change. Thus, I urge all Members
of Parliament to take a non-partisan approach, to fight for a more
perfect Singapore in this imperfect world. </p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget 2012 calls for efforts to build an inclusive
society and a stronger Singapore. Having heard many of the speeches by
fellow Members of the House yesterday and today, most are in general
agreement that we have before us a caring Budget, one that serves
to fill the gaps that previous budgets did not address.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1506</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1be2bb9e-6424-45ec-903c-7b5cb9bbed2e">
                  <a name="budget__id-1be2bb9e-6424-45ec-903c-7b5cb9bbed2e"><!--a--></a>Let me begin with a story. One day, a
mouse saw the farmer and his wife come home with a mousetrap. Worried,
he retreated to the farmyard and shouted, "There is a mousetrap
in the house!" The chicken clucked and said, "Mr Mouse, I can tell
this is a grave concern to you, but I cannot be bothered by it."
The pig sympathised with him and said, "I am so very sorry, Mr Mouse,
but there is nothing I can do about it but pray." The cow said "Wow,
Mr Mouse. I am sorry for you, but it is nothing to do with me."
So, the mouse returned to the house dejected, to face the farmer's
mousetrap alone. That very night the mousetrap snapped shut. The
farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught but was bitten by a
poisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The farmer rushed
her to the hospital and she returned home with a fever. Everyone
knows you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup. But his wife's
sickness continued, so friends and neighbours came to keep vigil.
To feed them, the farmer roasted the pig. The farmer's wife, unfortunately,
did not get well and she passed away. So, many people came for her funeral
and the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide enough meat for
all of them. The mouse looked upon all of these from his crack in
the wall with great sadness. </p>

is that there is no problem too small or insignificant that it does not
affect all of us eventually. We are all at risk even if we do not
seem to be directly affected. Therefore, amidst the tremendous rate
of growth that we have experienced as a nation for the past few
decades, we must ensure that those who lag behind for various reasons
are not left behind.</p>

this at many levels. Yet, just as there is no Budget that can address
all groups, this Budget is not a magic cure for everything.</p>

small businesses struggling against the tide of competition and
rising costs.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-064e3491-3d44-4365-b115-eb1cb47ea301"><!--a--></a>While from an economics
point of view, unproductive business should be shown the door, let
us pause and remember the story of the mousetrap. It is easy for
us to lose sight of the reality that many of these small shops,
small factories, family-run, community-supported form the very backbone
of our economy. They work hard to earn a living and to support their
families. The few foreign workers that they may have, supplement
what is often a dwindling workforce for crafts that cannot solely
rely on mechanisation to replace.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f335857e-a0f5-4340-b67a-85806347e00c">
                  <a name="budget__id-f335857e-a0f5-4340-b67a-85806347e00c"><!--a--></a>As such, the reduction
of the Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) is a major sledgehammer to
their businesses. Many lament that they are, as the oft-repeated phrase,
working just to pay the rent. One real life example is one Mr Chua
Lian Thye, a carpenter and a family man at heart. I met Mr Chua
recently during my regular house visits. Supporting a family of
five, including three lovely children aged between six and 15, he
and his three blood brothers have been running a small carpentry
and woodwork factory for close to a decade. His eldest brother who
heads up the operations has been in the business for almost 20 years.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e98a4982-e56a-440a-8715-07a186c89e7a">

what was perhaps a viable way of really using their hands to make
a living has proven to be getting from challenging to nearly insurmountable odds.
Not only has their rental increased exponentially in just a few
short years, they are now facing intense competition from across
the Causeway in Malaysia where the costs of materials and manpower are much cheaper.
In addition, very few, if any, young Singaporeans are willing to
take up an apprenticeship to do woodwork – hard work, dusty environment,
tough conditions. Many of their own staff that they have currently are
already in their 60s. They are getting on in their years and looking
forward to perhaps less strenuous work.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1507</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ff2918f-66ee-4e45-83e0-96a6f10e83c8">

for the Chua family could not have come at a less welcomed time.
This is not for the want of trying that they do not have enough
locals wanting to enter the industry. For a small outfit like theirs
with low capital outlays, investments in technology and machinery
do not make a whole lot of sense to them. Many like Mr Chua and
his brothers are simply doing what they do best using their hands
to make an honest living.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd7b3b03-8a10-4e62-bb2d-1aeebab189f1">
                  <a name="budget__id-bd7b3b03-8a10-4e62-bb2d-1aeebab189f1"><!--a--></a>It may seem callous that
we must keep up with the times and get onto the productivity bandwagon.
From a Labour Movement perspective, I applaud the billions that
we have invested to increase productivity to benefit especially
our low-wage workers. At the same time, I cannot but feel that ordinary
Singaporeans like Mr Chua and his siblings, though business owners
themselves, are workers too.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9fce569-ea47-4f52-a0cc-90f26e7a6e88">
                  <a name="budget__id-f9fce569-ea47-4f52-a0cc-90f26e7a6e88"><!--a--></a>Therefore, I urge the
Ministry of Manpower to handle with a delicate touch some of our
SMEs who are truly feeling the heat from all sides; perhaps a review
of the mousetrap of DRC categories to broaden the categorisations
and therefore allow for higher ratios for some deserving firms.
It will not be easy, it is not clear-cut, but in one way or form,
these companies do deserve an equal shot at playing their part in
our economy, no matter how mouse-like and small a player they may
be. There are many existing programmes to help SMEs. But for varying
reasons, some SMEs have not come on board at all. Perhaps, more
information should be issued to encourage them to do so.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-b299790f-694e-4bf6-8b0b-7884935308d9"><!--a--></a>I mentioned low-wage workers
earlier as well. I would like to turn my attention to a group that
would have much to benefit from a proverbial "cash-cow" of a Budget.
These are older Singaporeans, especially older workers. One particular
area, of course, is the reinstatement of CPF rates for older workers.
This is something that the Labour Movement has pushed forth for
many years and I am definitely certain that our older workers welcome
this as well. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-58451e0f-df9a-4327-aba3-8cf4b8a2172c">
                  <a name="budget__id-58451e0f-df9a-4327-aba3-8cf4b8a2172c"><!--a--></a>Yet, comprehensive though
this Budget may be in attempting to address the concerns of older
Singaporeans and older workers, the test of the pudding is in its implementation.
Last evening, after the end of Parliament, I went with my wife to
a hawker centre in the Chinatown area to have dinner. Finishing
the meal, out of our usual habit, we cleared our bowls and carried
the tray over to an elderly cleaning lady who was clearing the tables.
The elderly lady gestured to the table that she was cleaning and asked
that I place the tray on it. I did so, smiled, and the elderly lady
said in Hokkien and I translate, "Next time, just leave the table,
we will clean it. If anyone or TV crew takes a photo or video of
us, then <em class="ph i">dai-ji-liao-liao</em> (we will have lots of problems)."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2d5fd814-0000-4ec6-8896-1605b5718ec3">
                  <a name="budget__id-2d5fd814-0000-4ec6-8896-1605b5718ec3"><!--a--></a>I was kind of taken aback
but said good night and shrugged to myself as we walked away. But
somehow it nagged at me no end. I then found out that she was worried
about two things. One, she was worried about being told that she
was not doing her work well enough to the point that diners like
myself had to clear our own tables. Secondly, she was concerned
as well that if more customers cleared their own tables, she would
be out of a job.
For someone like her, bent of back, with halting steps, it somewhat
pained me that this could not possibly be the face of the re-employment
of older workers.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1508</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c7354742-85b6-468c-b585-3a841f042182">

Employment Credit will be welcomed by employers and I welcome the
prospect of older Singaporeans who want to continue working being
able to do so, I also urge that the Government ensure that we do
not create a scenario of phantom workers or older workers made to
go through unsuitable work simply because they are now "subsidised
workers". Let us not have the cash-cow of SECs become the mousetrap
for older workers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-821daba2-5169-49e4-abf4-d6a0ddf2a954">
                  <a name="budget__id-821daba2-5169-49e4-abf4-d6a0ddf2a954"><!--a--></a>For young workers, many
whom I had the privilege of interacting with since the Budget announcement,
they see it from two extremes. On the one hand, they see it as a caring
Budget, the compassionate community moving forward together. In
the same breath, they are concerned about their own prospects. Young
couples wanting to start off in life continue to see some bleakness
in the housing market; the rising costs of living standing partially
in the way of starting a family. It is hoped that some of the measures may
become clearer during the COS and I look forward, as they do, to
hearing from the respective Ministries.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-3cb7ac1f-f4d5-4d72-bfbf-9ce5aec47932"><!--a--></a>Sir, we have a good opportunity
to set the groundwork for the coming years with this Budget. Yet,
what is being called a "Budget of the Future" cannot but raise questions
in my mind that, as a younger Singaporean, the future cost of this
Budget is not immediately clear. GST Vouchers, SECs, productivity
push, new buses, all this is certainly not a one-off capital cost.
Some call this a social budget; some refer to it in hushed tones
as creeping welfarism. But whatever it is, we must be sure that
we are spending responsibly and within our means, and not just be
populist for populism's sake. Are the reserves that previous governments
have worked hard to build being eroded? What does the future hold
for young Singaporeans? More importantly, is this "Budget for the
Future" also getting its budget from the future?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a38679ff-19c6-47cd-a598-2cfb18ecf24f">
                  <a name="budget__id-a38679ff-19c6-47cd-a598-2cfb18ecf24f"><!--a--></a>These are major social
investments that we are introducing and they will have their costs.
I, therefore, hope that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Tharman would be able to help Singaporeans understand how these
will be paid for and, more importantly, clarify if higher taxes
are to be expected or even dreaded in the near future. Just like
the mousetrap, everything may seem to be going great at the moment,
but how will our economy look like 10-20 years from now. </p>

in closing, as we progress, let us progress together. As we strengthen
our own capabilities, let us also strengthen this nation we call
our home. Just as in the story of the mousetrap, we are all part
of each other's tapestry of life, all on the same journey. We should
keep an eye out for each other and make an effort to encourage each
other along the way. With that, Sir, I support the Budget.</p>

Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to participate
in this debate.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1509</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9b50238-1f83-43cd-98bc-7ae882c51701">
                  <a name="budget__id-f9b50238-1f83-43cd-98bc-7ae882c51701"><!--a--></a>Sir, after the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Finance read the Budget Statement on 17 February, my
immediate thoughts were that this Budget is a People Budget, one
that shows our Government's care towards our people more explicitly
and more directly than before. It is also one that takes a long-term
view. Having enjoyed considerable economic growth over several decades,
I believe we have the capital and the responsibility to make strategic
long-term social investments now. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-57c19453-3426-4735-8fb6-9aee593c6dbf">
                  <a name="budget__id-57c19453-3426-4735-8fb6-9aee593c6dbf"><!--a--></a>At the same time, I also
saw this Budget as building and reinforcing an integral aspect of
Singapore – the quality of resilience – resilience economically,
socially and individually. Let me explain.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b6c97b37-41c4-44d8-9232-58a33fdfb19e">
                  <a name="budget__id-b6c97b37-41c4-44d8-9232-58a33fdfb19e"><!--a--></a>First, on Economic Resilience.
The need for economic resilience is clear. We are facing unfavourable
global conditions. The developed economies are not doing as well as
before, and Singapore faces stiffer competition from emerging economies,
especially in Asia, snapping at our heels. In the face of these
challenges, the Finance Minister has rightly pushed us to focus
on: (1) developing our human capital; (2) driving innovation and
increasing productivity; and (3) encouraging companies to tap on
latent workforces in Singapore. Only so can our economy continue
to do well, and Singaporeans can look forward to good jobs and opportunities
in advancement.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7a04fc3b-ad9c-42c5-b660-98b21c05ef3c">
                  <a name="budget__id-7a04fc3b-ad9c-42c5-b660-98b21c05ef3c"><!--a--></a>But we must not underestimate
the pains and the costs of pushing our businesses through this transformation.
The bigger firms are probably better equipped to change than the
SMEs, and SMEs will certainly face a tough time. Many Members in
this House have talked about the problems faced by SMEs. Some of
my grassroots leaders and residents who run SMEs also tell me about
how worried they are about cutting back on foreign manpower. Some
have also made useful suggestions which I would like to share with
the House today. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-19471686-6920-433b-b8ae-5aa16c383643">
                  <a name="budget__id-19471686-6920-433b-b8ae-5aa16c383643"><!--a--></a>For example, one resident
suggested that local businesses which meet the quota be given assurance
that they will get to keep foreign workers whom they have painstakingly trained
and who have gained so much experience within their firms. It is
already painful enough for businesses to have to adapt their operations
and for some to downsize their businesses. I think we can make it
less painful by preserving the skills and experiences already built
within these firms. Another suggestion to help make the transition
a smoother one is to give more flexibility to firms in sub-sectors
that are highly unpopular with locals, or that require specialised
skills that Singaporeans do not yet have, or where labour requirements
simply cannot be reduced by improved productivity. I hope the Finance
Minister will consider these suggestions favourably.</p>

Social Resilience. Social resilience comes from Singaporeans having
a shared destiny. We cannot have social resilience if our society
is split between the "haves" and "have-nots". Instead, we must build
within our people a deep sense of community, a deep sense of participation,
ownership and sharing. This means that we need to give a leg up
to those who are disadvantaged and help them to achieve their full
potential. I am therefore glad that the Minister for Finance has
chosen to focus help on the elderly, low-income families and those
with disabilities. In particular, I applaud the bold moves to introduce
the Special Employment Credit (SEC), expand and enhance the affordability
of the Intermediate and Long Term Care healthcare and to make the
GST Vouchers a permanent feature. </p>

I had spoken at length in this House about the need to do more for
the elderly who had done so much in building our nation and I am
most glad that the Government has come up with an extensive package
of measures to help this group. But the Government cannot act alone;
the private and people sectors need to play a part too. For example,
I hope that the businesses will take advantage of the SEC to hire
more older workers. Employers should not take it that because of
the restraints on foreign manpower that they are left with "no choice"
but to hire older workers. Instead, I hope they will invest in their
older workers, and if need be, tap on Government's schemes such
as Advantage Fund to redesign jobs for them, and hence enable them
to become valuable resources in their companies. This will also enable
older workers to improve their lives, and continue to make meaningful contributions
to Singapore.</p>

it is not possible to cater to everything and everyone in one single
Budget, I hope the Finance Minister will not forget other groups
who are equally deserving of our attention. In particular, I would
like to speak for Singaporeans requiring mental healthcare. They
are neither disabled nor elderly, but they too face particular challenges.
For example, in school or at work, their tension and energies are
often sapped by their constant battle with their emotional and mental
struggles. At home, family members may not fully understand or know
how to live with them. For those with more serious conditions such
as psychosis, they will face great difficulty eventually when their
caregivers, often their parents, pass away or become unable to care
for them any further.</p>

estimates that, globally, one in four people will suffer from mental
illness at some point in their life. This is a significant statistic
and the story in Singapore is not that different. Yet, despite the
prevalence of mental illness around the world, this category of
illness continues to be plagued by stigma that discourages social
acceptance and prevents those who need help from stepping forth
to seek the treatment that they need. Therefore, I hope more can
be done to: (1) de-stigmatise mental illness further; (2) promote
greater social acceptance; (3) enhance accessibility and affordability
to professional mental healthcare; and (4) strengthen the community care
and support framework. With timely and proper interventions, mental
illness can be managed effectively and those with mental conditions
can be employable, take care of themselves, rely on themselves and
enjoy a better quality of life. In essence, a truly inclusive society
has no place for stigma and so we must also combat stigma and help and
care for everyone.</p>

on individual resilience. While I support sharing more with Singaporeans
in the Budget, the Budget should not be simply about giving <em class="ph i">hong
baos</em>. We know that the Government does not create free money
to give out; the revenues in the Budget has to come from somewhere
and ultimately will come from our people through taxes. So, yes,
we should share the progress of the nation with all Singaporeans,
but we must also guard against the seeping in of a sense of over-dependency
and entitlement. We are not there yet but we should guard against
it.</p>

to grow and progress to where we are today because of the capabilities
and efforts of our people. Our forefathers possessed enormous resilience; they
toiled and saved, and built up our nation, so that we are able to
increase our social spending and help more groups of Singaporeans,
but let us never lose this resilience and tenacity of our forefathers.
Apart from upgrading ourselves continuously, it is important that
we remain grounded in core values, retain a strong sense of personal responsibility and
self confidence, and make sure that we do not cultivate a sense
of self-handicap and learned helplessness. Otherwise, very soon,
we will lose our edge and drive, and end up living off our inheritance.</p>

glad that this year's Budget will include an injection of funds into
the Edusave Endowment Fund. This enables our students to have continued
access to enrichment programmes and additional resources that can
supplement learning. I hope that more of these resources will also
be used to emphasise character building from young, on top of equipping
our students with textbook skills and knowledge. We must help Singaporeans
from young, to learn that when we fall, we have to muster our strength,
pick ourselves up, deal with the pain and move on. </p>

Singapore can respond to a difficult global environment is more
fundamental than nurturing lean, productive, outward-oriented and
forward-looking companies, in other words, more fundamental than
building economic resilience. The most basic factor to ensure that
Singapore can continue to thrive is by ensuring that Singaporeans
retain the individual resilience to stand firm in the face of adversities,
and the unity and social resilience to surmount challenges as one
people.</p>

I have asked various people, ordinary citizens, for their feedback
on the Budget. So far, the feedback that I have received has been
positive. While some commended the initiatives for our elderly,
others lauded the efforts and steps taken to care for the disabled

have been done to promote green efforts, affordable tertiary education

I asked, I was particularly intrigued by the comments made by some
young Singaporeans I met. They did not lament the lack of <em class="ph i">hong

disappointing at first look that there is no <em class="ph i">ang pow</em> this

bodes well for our society and nation. It shows that Singaporeans,
including young Singaporeans, understand that the Budget cannot
be solely about personal interests, but must be about uplifting
those who are less capable, and enabling all to move ahead together.
Allow me to now make a very short remark in Mandarin.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate. I
would like to congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
for Finance in this Budget not only for the items that have been
given but really for his fine ossicular balance. The ossicles are
those items in the year which help you retain your sense of balance
when everything else is sort of going up and down. This Budget is remarkable
because of the way it balances things. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ebc39098-a179-4840-a857-b2f4403e8ca9">
                  <a name="budget__id-ebc39098-a179-4840-a857-b2f4403e8ca9"><!--a--></a>The first item which I
think has not been sufficiently highlighted is that there have been
so many calls, that there have been rising costs, and how are we
going to manage that. What is sufficiently appreciated about this
Budget is that it is actually a10-year plan. It is a continuation
of the Budget of the previous year, which was that we anticipate
that in the next 10 years, cost of living is going to rise. Now,
if your wages remain the same and your cost of living rises, then
you have a gap and Singaporeans are going to be disadvantaged. The
strategy that has been worked into this Budget – it started last
year but it has been continued this year – is that you get your
wages to go up as well as to follow the costs that are going up
and you keep the differential between wages and costs, so that at
the end of 10 years, we have 30% growth and we are able to keep
up with rising costs. That kind of strategic vision is not something
which you find in many other budgets in other countries in the world
and I thought that that sense of balance – balancing costs and the
wages – was something which defined the ethos of this Budget, which
is preparing us for the future.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cdb452b2-8b16-4c22-8550-fd21f8eda332">
                  <a name="budget__id-cdb452b2-8b16-4c22-8550-fd21f8eda332"><!--a--></a>There was another aspect
of the Budget in respect of which I thought it showed neat or fine
calibration and delicate balance which was achieved and that is
with respect to foreign workers. There have been many calls in the
past few speeches about, maybe, not reducing the quota of foreign
workers by this much. In this Budget, there were three features
about reducing dependence on foreign workers. The first, raising
the eligibility criteria for Employment Passes or S Passes; second,
calibrated reductions in the DRCs in manufacturing and services
sectors; third, we may have to consider an increase in the foreign
worker levy beyond July 2013. I listened to the calls for we should
not reduce the DRCs, we must have more foreign workers and then
I wondered has anybody recalled the cry at the last General Election
where people said, "We have too many foreigners in Singapore. Our transport
is overcrowded. Our hawker centres are overcrowded. There are too
many foreigners here."</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1513</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-95e4ebab-7126-4abf-a0cf-6ed74834dd69">
                  <a name="budget__id-95e4ebab-7126-4abf-a0cf-6ed74834dd69"><!--a--></a>Where does it square?
Because on the one hand we are saying there are too many foreigners
here, the Government responds and listens and to be fair to the
Government, the reason why it is reducing the DRCs is because we
recognise that we cannot be continually dependent on foreign labour
and you cannot also be forever increasing the numbers but the answer
is to cut down and that is the response. It is also a response to the
sense of Singaporeans that perhaps there are too many foreigners
here and then the next response is, "Oh, but we must have more foreigners."
That just illustrates the dilemma that any good government faces,
that sense of balance – how do you balance this? And I think the
balance in this case has been achieved correctly by calibrating
the reductions in the DRCs but also recognising that once you cut
back on the number of foreign workers, you still got to find another
way to achieve growth and how do you do that. You have to look at
productivity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b4f8d84d-3e62-43c6-9777-255b44dccc8c">

position taken by the Workers' Party what they had suggested was perhaps
to have different industry clusters for dependency ratio ceilings.
I noted with some interest that they suggested that one cluster
should perhaps be finance, aerospace, biomedical and professional
services which I would loosely term as the high-end services and
they suggested that for those you can cut back on the number of foreign
workers. Then they suggested another cluster – social services,
public healthcare and construction for public infrastructure – which
I would classify as sort of middle to low-end – and suggested that
for those, we may need less stringent foreign manpower policy to
keep the costs low. In other words, for the lower end, have more
foreign labour. </p>

to the call at the General Election which came from the Workers'
Party, amongst other Opposition parties, that we must have fewer
foreigners here. It also runs counter to what we are trying to achieve
for low-income workers in Singapore. We want them to be fully employed.
We want them to have more jobs. If you relax the requirements and
you have less stringent manpower policy for those sectors, then
what happens to Singaporeans in those sectors, and they are the
ones who need the jobs more than those at the higher end. So this
sense of balancing and trade-off is a very difficult thing to do.
But I think that this Budget tries very hard to achieve that and as
we move forward, we are going to have to calibrate it again.</p>

need to increase productivity is also, I think, important. I applaud

to the next point, there was something else which Mr Chen Show Mao
had said with respect to the quotas of foreign workers. I think
he had asked the Government to work more closely with different
stakeholders in different industries to get their input, rally their
support and render assistance. I thought that this sounded reasonable.
Then I asked myself, what does it actually mean because is this
something that we are already doing? As I understand it, we have
quotas for the different industries. Those quotas and the standards
have been arrived at in discussion with people from those industries,
with input and with said support as well.</p>

with respect to setting quotas is this: to what extent or degree
or detail that you delve into it? You can do as the Government is
doing now, broad quotas for various industries and you let the industries
self-regulate. At the other end of the spectrum, and I am not sure
this is what Mr Chen was suggesting, perhaps not, but I just want
to examine it. You cannot, as a Government, say "X company, I give
you five passes; Y company, I give you 10 passes; and Z company,
I give you 20 passes." Because as a Government, you have no idea
how much they need. What you do is you take your foreign worker
levy, which is the cost, and then you look at the company, look
at that cost and decide for themselves, depending on their profitability, depending
on their productivity, how many foreign workers they feel that they
can support. And then you let the companies decide for themselves
because the Government should not be micromanaging the quotas.</p>

ends of the spectrum, I am sure you can arrive at something in between.
But to the point that the Government should work more closely with different
industries to get their input, as far as I can see, this is already
being done. To what extent you calibrate it and you try to micromanage
it, I do not think that you should try to micromanage it too much,
because companies must have the flexibility to decide how they want
to run their businesses and they would know what is most efficient
for them. </p>

the productivity point which is that if we are going to cut back the
number of people, then something has got to give and you have got
to be more productive. On this point, I would like to say something
about productivity in Government services. I think that, definitely,
there is a need to improve productivity in the private sector. But,
equally, I would think that there is also a need to improve productivity
in Government services and I think this is especially so at the
frontline as well as in the middle.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-0e1ccf70-aeee-4451-b76b-5f7744632264"><!--a--></a>Let me give Members some
examples of what I mean. I think there is a need for greater productivity,
in terms of quality and in terms of initiative. This is a simple example
– the ramps in Tiong Bahru market. Tiong Bahru market is an old
market and there are steps there. When I did my walkabout, owners
asked me for ramps for the elderly. I thought, "Okay, great idea."
So I asked NEA, "Can you put in the ramp?" NEA said, "Yes, we would
put in the ramp." Then a few months later, I came back, there were the
ramps. But they were like alpine ski slope at 45 degrees angle and
the senior citizens were slipping down. I said, "Any reason why
this incline is so steep." He said because our land ends there.
I said, "Why don't you extend it there?" He said, "No, that is LTA land."
I said, "Go a bit further." He said, "No, that is NParks land."
It so happened the NParks and LTA officials were next to me. So,
I looked at the NParks guy and said, "Have you any objection?" He
said, "No." I said to the LTA person, "Do you have any objection?" He
said, "No." I looked at the NEA guy and said, "So you extend it
a little bit." And they did, a few weeks later, and sent us the
ramp. So, I had a 30 to 35-degree incline ramp, instead of a 45-degree
one.</p>

have been avoided with some discussions to begin with, with more
coordination between the agencies. To be fair, it was done at the
end of the day, but it was not the first instinct. This keeps playing
itself out in various scenarios. My Robertson Quay scenario which
I had spoken about. Let me explain the problem because every time
I raise it, I get a quizzically raised eyebrow. The problem with Robertson
Quay is that you have young people there who cannot afford to go
into the outlet that sells alcohol. What they do is they buy alcohol
from a convenience store nearby
and they sit on the bridges, they sit all around Robertson Quay,
because they want to listen to the music from Zuok, but they do
not want to pay the cover charge. I understand that. They are all
young, they do not have the same kind of budget. But the difficulty
after a while is that when they get high, then it becomes extremely
noisy. Then you have the shouting, the screaming, you also have
the puking which is less pleasant, and it just detracts from the
environment there. So, one thing I suggested was maybe we could
have "no alcohol" zone. Then everybody looks at me and thinks "party
pooper". Okay, fine, then maybe let us not go to that extreme, that
is, try conventional measures. I looked at LTA because there are
two bridges, and bridges come under LTA. I said, "Could we not clear
the place?" LTA said, "No, Madam, this comes under the Street Works
Act. Under the Street Works Act, we can only remove objects. People
are not objects. So, we cannot remove them." So, I looked at the
Police, "Maybe we could do something to move them along." "No, Madam,
because they have not committed any offence. They are rightfully
there." I am left with a situation where I have residents and businesses
there who have this concern. Till this day, I have not been able
to resolve that.</p>

Draycott Park is something I have raised with LTA many times and
the problem is still not resolved. They have these tour buses which
are there, and they are parked there illegally. The residents feel
that their place is being turned into a high-class carpark for tourist
coaches. I asked LTA for enforcement. Some is done, but I am told,
"Whenever we go there, the buses move away." To which my response
is, "It might be a good idea to have one person in front and another
enforcement officer behind so that they are caught in between, or
perhaps you take the number before you go and speak to the driver."
It is a recurrent problem. It has not been solved and I have been
asking the Tourist Promotion Board to work together with LTA on
this.</p>

at Tong Huat Road, same thing, enforcement by LTA. It has been going
on for some months. I have a lot of sympathy with the Government
agencies because they have a loss on their face. But I think that
there is more that can be done, in terms of improving productivity,
looking into how there can better coordination between the different
agencies so that they can be more responsive. Sir, I would urge the
Finance Minister to also look into the incentives to encourage Government
agencies to be productive, responsive and to show initiative. </p>

Sir, Singapore is the world's third richest country, according to <em class="ph i">Forbes</em>.
Is this cause for cheer or for concern? Well, it depends on your
perspective. The economic achievements of this small city-state
can be a source of national pride if you take the macroeconomic
point of view. It shows that Singapore and Singaporeans can achieve
a lot with the right policies, despite the odds. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e5eaba6f-06a4-4742-bd9a-87834f005ab6">
                  <a name="budget__id-e5eaba6f-06a4-4742-bd9a-87834f005ab6"><!--a--></a>Most of the other rich
countries on the <em class="ph i">Forbes</em> list – Qatar, Kuwait and Brunei,
for example – rely on natural resources to fill their coffers. In
contrast, Singapore generates its wealth from being plugged to the
world as a technology, manufacturing and finance hub. But there is
a price to be paid for living in a wealthy global city – high prices
and a widening income gap. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1516</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-df872ad8-c3ae-4514-a0f0-c78289a834ee">
                  <a name="budget__id-df872ad8-c3ae-4514-a0f0-c78289a834ee"><!--a--></a>Indeed, Singapore has
one of the highest income disparities in the developed world. While
a sustained period of strong economic growth has lifted our people
from absolute poverty, it is clear that the benefits of growth have
not been distributed evenly, and our high levels of income inequality
have risen further.</p>

used data compiled from the IMF, Singapore has a GDP per capita
of about S$71,000 after adjusting for purchasing power parity. However,
our average cleaner or security guard does not earn a tiny fraction
of that. The news that Singapore is the third richest country in
the world would not give him much cheer. If we continue in this
trajectory, we will be an increasingly rich and unequal society
with an upper class of the super-rich and an underclass. An underclass
of Singaporeans stuck in low-paying jobs can only lead to more social
tensions.</p>

workers at our MPS. Some are angry and hurt by the life that they
have in this city and they felt hard done by. One security officer,
aged 61, told me his salary was about $1,000 a month and it has
remained stagnant for the last 20 years. He came to see me for financial
assistance to help support his family and cope with the rising cost
of living. He is working on contract, which gets renewed every two
years. So, he dare not make a complaint against his employer. Another
resident told me that he has been earning $700 a month as a cleaner,
he is also on contract, but he has been earning this same amount
for the last 10 years, and he needed help with his escalating household
bills. </p>

class also feel the pressure – they compete for largely the same
scarce resources as the rich – places in good schools, housing in
prime areas, COE for cars. The super-rich have contributed to inflation
in the prices of some of these goods. Many of the middle class,
being better educated, have high life expectations. Now, to their
dismay, they find themselves struggling. </p>

I commend the Finance Minister for a Budget aimed at building a

have been many conscious attempts to increase the wage and skill
levels of our low-paid workers. The Workfare Income Supplement and
the Workfare Bonus help to top up the wages, but they do not go
far enough. </p>

I have asked for a review of the qualifying criteria, the quantum
and frequency of the Workfare pay-outs, so I will not belabour the
same points here. But the Workfare scheme should be reviewed sooner
rather than later. The push to encourage best sourcing and productivity
is another important step. But the pace of change is painfully slow. </p>

that for many families, the rising cost of living is a real concern.
Not a few find themselves short of cash at the end of the month.
Their situation can easily tip over with a major life change, such
as a divorce, the death of a spouse, the loss of a job, an accident,
the discovery of an illness or the need to care for a sickly elderly

Medifund and an array of welfare schemes, but most residents tend
to seek such help only as a last resort and, by that time, their

us at MPS, they have fallen into depression. Such residents would
find some relief in the Budget's initiatives to uplift and support

the years, there has been increasing Government transfers to the

it fell to 0.26. In other words, Luxembourg achieved a 0.19 point
reduction in the Gini coefficient, following its tax and transfer
policies, compared to the 0.02 point reduction in Singapore. Luxembourg
is also a more self-reliant society with a healthy domestic sector.
It respects quality plumbers, builders, and service staff. Its cleaners

Qatar, which is ranked the richest country. It has a Gini coefficient
of 0.45, also about the same as Singapore. But it has an entirely
different society from ours. Citizens make up only about 15% of
the nation's 1.6 million people. They live luxurious lifestyles,
and enjoy the benefits of living in an oil-rich country with free
electricity, healthcare and other perks. The underclass is formed
by the army of foreign labourers from developing countries who do
whatever jobs the Qataris feel are beneath them. But even with the
country's oil wealth distributed generously to the citizens, the
country is riven with increasing tension, anger and frustration
between the Qataris and foreigners. In other words, the country
is rich, its citizens are rich, but the level of social cohesion
is very low. </p>

that the income gap will widen further. How much more Government
transfers each year are we prepared to make to close the gap? Where
will the money come from? Sir, we need to forge a consensus on what
kind of society we want. We want a fair and inclusive society. We
have been saying this for the last few days but how fair, how inclusive?
This is the core issue that defines the character of the Singapore
society. The social compact between the Government and its people
must be underpinned by this consensus. But I feel that we do not
yet have such a consensus. </p>

and marginalised groups need support and encouragement to contribute
as citizens so that they do not remain at the edge of the community
as passive recipients of handouts, dependent and undervalued. Defining
people as needy and trying to comprehensively fill those needs with
more services and more handouts may not be the best way of helping
them. More can be achieved by directing investment towards citizen
initiatives that build relationships which mobilise people to make
a difference, thereby building bridges from the margins to the centre
of community life. </p>

our estates, and how we treat the more vulnerable groups in our

                  </span>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing
me to join in the debate. We are living in incredibly fast-paced
and exciting times. The two elections last year are a portent of
our rapidly evolving political scene. Yet, it has also been a sobering
time, as Singaporeans take stock of the nation's capacity to tackle
the external challenges of a sluggish global economy as well as
issues closer to the home and heart – on the rising cost of living,
preserving our Singaporean identity, and working towards building
a more integrated, inclusive and compassionate society for all Singaporeans. </p>

desire for a Government that is both responsive and sensitive to
the people's needs. Mr Deputy Speaker, before I go into the three
points that I would like to raise, which I think are important tenets
of an inclusive society, I would like to pause and show why Singapore
is indeed an exception in the globe today. If you were to look at
any leading international newspaper, prime pages are dedicated to
how Governments are grappling with austerity measures, how to seek short-term
haircuts to spending, how to cull expenditure. Juxtapose or contrast
that with what the Deputy Prime Minister and his Ministry and the
Government are trying to do today. Here, we are taking a long- term
view. We are sowing. We are ploughing seeds for harvesting generations
to come. Short-term versus long- term, culling versus sowing, who
will harvest more? The answer is obvious. </p>

Budget and a long-term view in the environment that the globe presents
us today, that is, in and of itself, an achievement that we should
all be proud of in the House today. So, what more could we do to
fine-tune it? I said before that it is laudable that we have a balanced
Budget and, therefore, I would seek how we can allocate within that
Budget, different priorities. And three priority areas that I would like
to talk about today, if they can be notched up a further few places
in the priority list, are: </p>

many Singaporeans I have spoken to is the need to take care of our
elderly Singaporeans – a group of elders on whose shoulders we now
stand, for whom we have so much to be grateful for, for helping
to build the Singapore we have today. Therefore, I am very heartened
by the Government's concerted effort to take care of our Singaporean
elders by incentivising employers to employ our elders through credits
and also taking a long-term view of our elders' healthcare needs.
In light of this concerted effort by the Government for our Singaporean
elders, let me share my views on the matter, which reflect many
of the views shared by my elderly residents in Ulu Pandan. </p>

people will be above 65 years old, or about 15% of the population.
The Minister for Health, speaking at a Ministerial Committee on
Ageing dialogue session recently, has rightly stressed the urgency
of the situation. The Government's long-term vision with respect
to this issue is encouraging, and the importance of ramping up aged
care services and facilities in anticipation of the materialising
needs of an ageing population cannot, and should not, be underestimated. However,
there is wisdom in foresight, and concerns by industry players that
Singapore is not developing the eldercare sector quickly enough,
with issues such as funding and manpower hindering progress, should
be taken heed of and concrete measures taken to expand our present
operational capacities.</p>

pledge of commitment towards focusing on elder care this year. Planning
policies from previous years have come into fruition, especially
in the aspect of community convenience for daily living. Common area
facilities for the elderly, such as ramps, railings and even exercise
parks, are standard features in many HDB estates today. The retrofitting
of towns with elder-friendly features will now be done comprehensively
in four estates with sizeable numbers of old residents, with the
programme set to be implemented across the nation over time.</p>

to the needs of the elderly should continue to feature heavily in
the planning process and the budget, for example, in terms of the improvement
works which have since expanded beyond community provisions to indoor
provisioning, where attention is given to accident-prevention at
home and even the positioning of switches and taps for the convenience
of those who are less physically mobile. </p>

in spearheading a multi-dimensional approach to the challenge of
caring for the old is reflected in the Health Ministry's commitment
to looking into new care options and raising the quality of care
for society's elderly. This shift from a purely quantitative to
a more calibrated, qualitative approach is to be lauded. Indeed,
it addresses one of the most oft-neglected aspects of caring for
an ageing population – by recognising that the needs of the elderly
are not confined to, nor adequately resolved by, mere improvements
to physical infrastructure or purely institutionalised measures
that ignore the elderly individual's social and emotional concerns. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1bd12dbd-409f-4c24-9537-d4e847efe928">
                  <a name="budget__id-1bd12dbd-409f-4c24-9537-d4e847efe928"><!--a--></a>This was explicitly affirmed
by the Minister for Health – and again repeated by the hon Member
Ms Irene Ng – who reiterated in the dialogue that aged care involves
not just responding to the functional or health-related issues of
our seniors, but their social and emotional needs as well, with
the ultimate focus being that of the quality of life they have as
they age. In recognising the "overwhelming demand" for day care,
dementia and rehabilitative services by elderly residents in the
designated elder-friendly town of Bedok, the Minister for Health
made clear the thrust of his Ministry's focus for this year, that
is, to have the elderly "age in place" or grow old in their own
home instead of an institution. The importance of building more
day-care centres which are bigger than the existing ones and which
provide a range of services and facilities catering to the elderly who
require varying degrees of care and attention cannot be underscored
enough. Besides being prime platforms for the elderly to socialise
and enjoy communal interaction, they serve the dual function of
allowing seniors to continue living with their families, in line
with the objective of enhancing care services to support the care
of seniors at home or close to home. </p>

Government should be mindful not to neglect the needy elderly, or
those who do not have the benefit of familial love and support.
Targeted efforts must be made to improve the conditions of the elderly
who have neither relatives nor monetary finances to tide them through
their silver years. Special regard must be had to existing funding
schemes which do not sufficiently address elderly needs. The Government
could consider creative alternatives which have been mooted, such
as a co-funded model between the Government and service providers
that is specifically used for serving the elderly in the community.
Also, in line with the more quantitative approach alluded to earlier, perhaps the
Government should consider assessing directly the needs of the elderly
in determining who should qualify for these schemes, rather than
looking at the income of applicants as a blunt criterion, so as
to minimise the numbers of those who fall through the cracks. </p>

one as a population that is not only growing bigger but also older
has resulted in a spike in demand for healthcare services. Many
elderly patients, indeed many elderly residents in my constituency,
have multiple medical conditions and are more likely to require
hospitalisation. This has given rise to related problems, such as
that of attracting and retaining manpower. In this area, the Government
must think out of the box and come up with innovative solutions
to sustain the passion and drive needed to fuel such jobs, which
have been described by many outside the industry as "continuous,
tedious and mundane". To this end, I am glad that the Government
has announced fee revisions for those working within the industry.
To tap on groups of potential labour, such as retirees and housewives,
the Government should work with the relevant service providers to
redesign jobs, for example, by introducing flexi-hours and making
salaries more attractive. </p>

support needed to tackle the "silver tsunami" ties in heavily with
recent calls for more awareness of palliative care and the sacredness
of the life doctors and nurses treat. Public education and awareness
of the crucial role of encouraging palliative care in raising the
quality of life for patients with chronic, life-threatening illnesses
would go a long way towards making treatment a positive experience
for both the healthcare givers as well as the patient.</p>

topic: enabling the disabled. Even as Singapore is working towards
making our society a more elderly-friendly one and expanding our infrastructural
capacities to boost healthcare for seniors, much more can be done
still in terms of integrating the disabled into society, in line
with aspirations of becoming a truly first-class, inclusive society.
As one forum writer to the <em class="ph i">TODAY </em>paper passionately argued,
every Singaporean with disability should matter and be given every
opportunity to maximise his or her potential so that he or she may
contribute to society in his or her own way and be respected and
accepted without prejudice. One way in which this can be achieved
is by making our public housing estates and educational institutions
barrier-free and eventually totally accessible for all citizens
with disabilities. The Housing Board, for example, is now working
to help the elderly and disabled by replacing steps outside certain
old flats with ramps. This is part of a broader policy under which
all new Housing Board flats must be built based on a universal design,
which means it must be suitable for everyone, regardless of age
or physical condition.</p>

invested close to $170 million in a sustained bid to make public
transport more accessible to the disabled. Ramps and lifts have
been installed in MRT stations, enabling wheelchair-bound commuters
to navigate the stations more easily, and operators have been tasked
to have an entire fleet of wheelchair-accessible buses by 2020.
The existing framework must, however, continue to be fine-tuned
in order to ensure a seamless experience for disabled commuters,
with especial attention paid to even small slopes, or 45-degree
slopes in Tiong Bahru market, and steps which could be difficult
for passengers in wheelchairs to negotiate. </p>

for her severely disabled son. Attention should be given to those
among the disabled who need specialised vehicles, apart from which they
have very few alternatives. The Government should note that the
issue raised here is not about London cabs per se, but how to provide
affordable and accessible public transport for the increasing number
of disabled commuters. Accordingly, they must take a proactive stance
as the issue is really one of universal access for all, and not
just one of welfare. </p>

great strides economically and continues to make way for the infrastructural
needs of future generations, it is imperative that this objective
be tempered by the need to preserve and retain local sites that
are rich in history and culture for our descendants. Unless we want
Singapore to become a nation characterised solely by its pursuit
of material needs – a society without heart or soul, which is not
what we are – we should be vigilant about preserving the physical
spaces that create shared memories of our nation. </p>

over the former railway corridor, which actually runs quite substantially
through my constituency, are testament to the inevitable tension
between heritage and modernity, especially in the context of land-scarce
Singapore. The Government's approach to developing the former Malaysian
Railway land has been commendable thus far. The Ministry of National
Development, in particular, the Minister of State Tan Chuan-Jin,
has from the start been engaging public and interest groups on what
to do with the land and which inputs will go into the Master Plan.
I know this intimately because I had worked with Minister of State
Tan on this project and see how we can preserve as much greenery
as possible within operational limits for the residents of Holland-Bukit
Timah GRC. Such engagement allows for maximum accommodation of diverse
views on the matter, tempers it with realism and indicates the Government's willingness
to work together with the people and be responsive to their suggestions.
The partnership between civic groups and the Urban Development Authority
(URA) as well as other Government agencies should be encouraged,
in order to garner a wider range of views and, in particular, reflect
the interests and aspirations of younger generations. </p>

experts and the public on specific areas in history and culture,
the Government's approach to the railway corridor is indeed a good
act to follow. The decisions made will determine the value placed
on the collective identity, the collective nature and the collective
tradition of all Singaporeans. The genuine interests of citizens
and residents, which lie in their rootedness to the land via these
old spaces and places, are also important. </p>

Singapore continues to move forward, it is my sincere hope that we
will not just be a forward-looking nation that has forgotten about
its past. We are not, certainly
not. We take a long-term view rather than a short-term view on things.
So, let us be a people characterised by a spirit of remembrance
and gratitude for the works of our pioneers, whose struggles and
successes serve as an inspiration for future generations of Singaporeans
to come. With that, I support the Budget.</p>

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate. Sir, in the
past, the Budget was analysed by experts in Raffles Place, Shenton Way
and Cecil Street. Then, overnight, Budget Fact Sheets would be prepared
to study impact. Pundits would begin to make predictions on the
economy and social development. The man-in-the-street, on the other
hand, wanted to know just the income tax rate. He went about his
life knowing that whilst the Budget was a major Parliamentary event,
the Minister for Finance would always get it right anyway. Generally,
everybody accepted that the then Ministers for Finance would always
do the right thing and look after everyone's needs. There is a lot
of truth in this. Our successive generations of Ministers for Finance,
including the present, have always been brilliant economists with
agile minds, good hearts but always with their feet firmly on the ground.
They have always been dream makers and not dream breakers. The only difference
between them is in their briefcases which carried the Budget. </p>

It is a new kaleidoscope. Whatever the hon Minister has painstakingly
thought through and spelt out is scrutinised and weighed. The debates and
deliberations have moved from the financial centre to the heartlands;
from the good old coffeeshops to the new and trendy cafes; from
Kopitiams to Toast Boxes, and to even community clubs and common
corridors. This is as it should be. </p>

is no different. It is people-centric. It is termed inclusive. In
style and substance, it is. The hon Minister for Finance has tried
his best to cover every strata of our society. The Budget is a bold
one in many respects. It is visionary in others. It will act as
a quick jab for some. It will be a slow medicine for others. It
is practical in parts. It is not so perfect for others. For the
very poor and the aged, the Budget is much-needed oxygen. The employers
and industry, on the other hand, may feel winded by, for example,
the cutback on foreign workers. </p>

can give us all what we want. I noted that this year's Budget is
about 16% of our GDP. Our resources are, therefore, limited. Our
Minister for Finance can only attempt to give us what we need. In
that sense, the hon Minister's Budget, whilst it does not have everything
for everybody, has something for everyone. </p>

that appears not to have received a significant amount of attention

kept pace with inflation. Many of these households have expenses
that are considered discretionary but, in today's world, can be
considered basic, for example, handphone bills, personal computers,
internet charges, etc;</p>

financial need but are financially very vulnerable. A small disruption
could easily make them slip into the last 20th percentile of earners,
and the indigent group. Beyond CPF, this group does not have a lot
of savings and, sometimes, if any at all; </p>

Potong Pasir, though the smallest in Singapore, has a representation
of the aged, the well-to-do, the sandwiched class and the poor.
Wherever I went in my constituency, the Budget appears to have brought
some general relief among the aged and the poor. The well-to-do
feel they can manage. Budget changes have not had a significant
impact on them. But the sandwiched class may be struggling. They
have no one to reach out to. They have no safety nets and yet they
represent a significant portion of the everyday Singaporean on the
street, on our buses and the MRT. They feel concerned as any economic
downturn affects them the most. They do not seek help. But they
need help so that they do not fall down the rungs, but instead are helped
to climb the ladder. They need hope and help to address financial
vulnerability. They need hope that, with the Government's help and
their effort, their children will do better than them financially.
They need hope that social mobility is kicking and alive in Singapore. </p>

be crafted to achieve not just quantitative targets, but the qualitative
and perhaps even the abstract element of hope. What policies can
be put together that will engender hope and not despair? What policies
can be put together so that the sandwiched class can rise above
the miasma of envy to the politics of hope? What can we do for them?
Sir, I have two suggestions:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-74febf34-d983-4f16-a126-0d0baabe9e77">
                  <a name="budget__id-74febf34-d983-4f16-a126-0d0baabe9e77"><!--a--></a>One, giving a small monthly
or yearly subsidy for education and other necessities. Education
remains one of the single most aspirations of these households and
the backbone of their hope. They need help and encouragement. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a571f34c-fc11-43d6-97df-e736a3546dfd">
                  <a name="budget__id-a571f34c-fc11-43d6-97df-e736a3546dfd"><!--a--></a>Other financial safety
nets, such as insurance and education endowment funds, should be
made more easily affordable and available. This can be done without
these households having to bear the brunt of an additional financial
burden of paying for these. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-237a7f15-94fe-49c8-91ed-83d17d8a7731">
                  <a name="budget__id-237a7f15-94fe-49c8-91ed-83d17d8a7731"><!--a--></a>This becomes even more
telling when sole breadwinners are out of work because of increased
competition or retrenchment, illness or workplace injury. For every
successful story
like Mohammed Fairoz's, there may be corresponding stories that
wrench the hearts of every Singaporean. Many single-income families
worry about what happens when their sole breadwinner is out of work.
These are families that are not only low-income, but are also not
earning enough to be considered middle-income. As prudent Singaporeans,
they look for all kinds of safety nets for their families. These
include insurance (personal and medical), education endowment funds,
etc. In the past, these products were something only the rich could
afford. But they have become a necessity in today's modern Singapore,
especially for the sandwiched class. They are aware of these safety
nets, but do not have the means to be able to afford them. </p>

cognisant that the GST is a progressive tax regime that is meant
to maximise revenue from high-earning citizens who have the means
to consume more goods and services. Unfortunately, it has become
a real burden and an unavoidable expense on the shoulders of the
sandwiched class when they have to pay GST for necessities. Can
GST for necessities be reduced or removed with a corresponding increase
for luxury goods and services? That way, maybe, just maybe, a balance
can be achieved. </p>

will, of course, have to find the resources. It has always been our
mantra that we spend what we can afford and be prudent with our
savings. I am sure that every Singaporean is proud to have worked
hard, sometimes very hard, to raise their children and make them
productive and successful members of our society. I am not advocating
that we clear out the bank in trying to help the sandwiched class
also. Whatever little we can do for this significant class of Singaporeans,

approaches each year, many ask for their share of the goodies. But
can we see that not all the benefits will be direct? All of us are
indirect beneficiaries of a strong economy, of good growth, of appropriate
foresight, vision and planning for the coming years. It may not
be so obvious, but, believe me, it is there.</p>

budget for the Future; a budget for a better and stronger Singapore;
an all- inclusive budget; and a budget with a "heart". So we have
all heard. Let us look at the definition of "inclusive". It means
"taking everything within its scope and being comprehensive". </p>

to put the definition in more practical terms. To ensure inclusivity,
we must assist those who have lost their ability to compete or to
be competitive in our society. This Government stands by the ethos
that no Singaporeans who want to study should be denied education;
no Singaporeans who want to work will be denied a job; and no Singaporeans
who need help will be denied.</p>

earlier that he felt emotional looking at that little girl in the

that she may not be able to see her dream come true to get that

little girl. I wanted a good home for my parents too. We had humble
beginnings. And through all the Government's incentives, policy,
scholarships, assistance, opportunities, well, I am glad to say
I have that home, my parents have that home. If I can do it, so
can that young girl, so must that young girl. Because she is of
the future generation and we must improve from generation to generation.
That is what we do as Members. And as the Government, what we do
is we make sure that we have something sustainable even for the
next generation and generations to come.</p>

Finance mentioned the formation of a permanent underclass, it worries
me because it means we are not able to be inclusive. This group
represents the resource-poor or the resource-depleted Singaporeans,
whom we need to uplift in a variety of ways. Why is this underclass
forming? There are various postulations: the number of unskilled
jobs is declining; the mindset, the attitude, being too choosy about jobs,
and the economic changes that we see, etc.</p>

too fast? From 1987 to 1997, we averaged at 9.3% growth, and from
1998 to 2008, it was 5.4% average growth every year. Despite some
quarters thinking thus, I do not think we grew too fast. If we did
not have the growth in those years, we would even be worse off now.
We need to have the economic growth and impetus to keep us going,
to fund all our numerous programmes, including social programmes,
infrastructure development, etc. We are a small, open and global economy. If a superpower
so much as sneezes, we will feel the draught. If the global manufacturing
industry contracts, we will get a reduction in orders from the west,
from Europe. How much can we do with and expand our own internal
market, which really is a fraction of our tiny little red dot? Globalisation
is indeed fluid and complex. And when we face crisis situations,
the Government and Ministries come up with innovative and productive
aid packages and social assistance for our people.</p>

however, must continue to have a social purpose. These include,
for example, HDB and NEA. Meeting business KPIs must not be the
only way forward. Let me illustrate: in our hawker centre stall
allocation programme, there is the open tender (which involves bidding
and the highest bidder gets the stall); there is the closed tender
(where if there are more than one person vying for a stall, the
one offering the higher rental will be allocated the stall); and
walk-in schemes (where an individual can apply for a stall and pay
the administrative fee of $92.70).</p>

downturn, people in the group with the potential to become the economic
underclass are affected. They may be retrenched, lose their jobs and
face tight financial situations. These are the people I see asking
for a stall to set up business. This is what they can do and turn
to as they are non-professionals, they lack specialised skills.
But can these people compete and bid with the businessman types? Even
to pay the administration fee of $92.70, some of them have applied
for ComCare fund. Can we help them with simple and easy stall allocation
for them to work and be independent rather than have handouts and
assistance all the time? </p>

dialogues with the community, there were feedback and suggestions
on a variety of issues. One was for the Ministry of Transport to
employ seniors as public transport ambassadors. These seniors can
assist with instructions to bus drivers at busy bus-stops, can assist
to get people to move to the back of buses at peak hours and even
assist other less mobile seniors moving on public transport. Perhaps
they can even be paired with the non-local drivers of our buses
for a non-driving position. This will be an example of job creation
for the elderly, perhaps for a social reason and empowering the
elderly as well.</p>

policy and schemes at the macro level, but we must ensure at the
micro or individual and family level, people understand and utilise
these. It is not good enough to have an excellent policy but people
do not understand, are not aware and do not tap on them. </p>

of inclusivity, let me also discuss women. This is an area we still
have some catching up to do. Surveys in Singapore have shown that
gender ratio equality in workplaces is maintained at only the entry
level. As we move up the corporate hierarchy, there are significantly
fewer females than males. Women hold about 7% to 8% of boardroom
positions in listed companies in Singapore and we have only about
20% women in Parliament. </p>

much sacrifices − they drop out or go part-time in the workforce
much earlier than men, what with their share of family responsibilities,

may even have to delay marriage and parenthood over socio-economic
considerations.</p>

more home-based work and part-time work with childcare arrangements.
In Singapore, there are now some 40% of untapped women labour power.
How can we make it attractive for them to come and join the workforce?
How can we train them? When are our work places going to all be
pro-children and child-centric? They can be the answer to our challenge
to increase the productivity by 2% to 3% per annum and to 30% in

for some of the measures announced to counter certain aspects of
these three challenges. The elderly are disproportionate users of
healthcare. With the current proportion of elderly at under 10%,
we are already feeling the strain. By 2030 when the elderly will

find out and take advantage of the available schemes and programmes
to improve themselves and their families. One thing that I would
like to emphasise is for our community to learn to achieve work-life
balance.</p>

that is made available to upgrade work skills, the education assistance
schemes to go for further studies, and the housing programmes for
the low-wage group and those with financial problems. The benefits
from these subsidies are plentiful.</p>

if we look at it, many families that are less fortunate, with low income
and are facing difficulties, may not know about the schemes that
they can utilise and ease the burden on themselves and their families.
By getting the assistance that is available, perhaps even the fathers
do not need to take on two jobs. By doing that, they can spend more
time with their children and family and, hence, improve the quality
of their work-life balance.</p>

and enhance ties between the family members, as well as promote
further understanding. The generational gap can also be narrowed
if parents are able to talk and discuss openly and closely with
their children, and engage in social activities together. The problem
of dysfunctional families that breaks down due to misunderstanding
and quarrels can perhaps be reduced.</p>

pertinent to our community is health issue. Our Malay community
has the highest rates of chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes,
high levels of fat and cholesterol, and obesity, compared to other

is also prevalent in our community.</p>

people, in their 30s, who are at the early stages of these chronic
diseases. They do not take their medicine frequently and consult
their doctors because they do not develop certain symptoms. This
will lead to complications much earlier and affect the health and
lives of themselves and their families. Our community must invest
wisely in their health much earlier. Have a healthy lifestyle and
diet, and do not neglect regular health screenings.</p>

                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to join in the
debate. It is indeed an honour for me to be here today. I am indeed
privileged to be the first representative of the newly included
people and civic sector with my own platform of environment and
heritage. I pay tribute to previous NMPs, Mr Edwin Khiew and Dr
Geh Min, who had also during their tenure as NMPs spoke up on various
environmental concerns. I especially pay tribute to the organisation and
the people who nominated me, the Nature Society Singapore. It is
the credit to the integrity of the Nature Society Singapore built
up over the last 30-odd years that I am here today at all. It is
also a testimony on the part of the Government, the Government agencies
and the Society for being able to engage in a more meaningful conversation with
each other over the years. </p>

Sir, I am not here just to represent only the Nature Society or
environmentalists or heritage or nature lovers. To limit myself
to those roles would be an injustice to the wide range in which
the natural environment and heritage impact on all of us, regardless
of race or religion, income or social status. I believe the sector
I represent has relevance to all Singaporeans, including the people
who are specially mentioned in Budget 2012. </p>

of today, we heard Members of the House share their perspectives
on the Budget. We heard a few Members yesterday wonder what is it
about our education system – whether the ITE, the polytechnic or
the university – that perhaps may not have prepared our citizens
with the necessary skills for the workforce. In fact, Mr Zainudin
Nordin also mentioned that school-leavers seemed to be "book-smart",
he said, but not "work-smart". We also had Members emphasising self-reliance.
Allow me now to expand on the discussion and present my own personal
perspectives. </p>

have missed. Sir, I do believe that an inclusive society, a stronger
Singapore, can and must include placing emphasis on the intangible value
of the natural world. In this regard, I am thrilled to hear the
words "values-based education" spoken by our Education Minister
some time last year. A cynic may wonder what then has our education
been based on all this while. Be that as it may, I believe this is
where nature comes in. Nature itself is already a values-based educator. </p>

I have worked with students from as young as 10 to young adults
of 22 for some years now. While for the most part I have found these
young people intelligent, in the words of Mr Zainudin Nordin, "book-smart",
I am also struck by how disconnected they are from nature and the
environment as they revealed to me that either they have never been
or have seldom been to nature areas or even when they have, these
are usually for the purposes data collection for a school curriculum
or hurried post-examination trips meant to get them out of the way
of teachers marking examination papers. More importantly, I am struck
by the impact this disconnect has on their relationships with other
people and the world around them. And what is worse, their relationship
with their own selves. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f8d85697-aed0-491c-afc5-08b59b9dd8cd">
                  <a name="budget__id-f8d85697-aed0-491c-afc5-08b59b9dd8cd"><!--a--></a>It is no longer news that
Singapore is a very wired nation. We only need to look around when
travelling in the MRT to see how almost everyone is plugged onto
their gadgets. It is easy enough to blame technology. That would
be disempowering. Blame only makes us victims. Technology is a tool
and a very useful tool it is, too. The question is whether we see
a problem with over-dependence on technology, the consequences of
that and what we can do about it. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a28d0c3b-0e5f-4961-9e4b-177bd4a12ae2">
                  <a name="budget__id-a28d0c3b-0e5f-4961-9e4b-177bd4a12ae2"><!--a--></a>Mr Deputy Speaker, in
the course of my work, taking young people for nature walks where
they are encouraged to touch, to feel, to hear, sometimes even to
taste what is around them, here is what I found: not distracted
by laptops, encumbered by worksheets or the goal of data collection,
they are free to experience as their senses take them. It is said
that the ultimate state of learning is when you are open to what
you see, what you touch, and what you hear. Stopping to focus to
really observe, to really listen, these young people learn that
this is really what being connected is all about. Imagine the value
of this when young people step into the working world. With some
music students that have been taken only to walks as a prelude to
their music composition classes, they have even found that nature
walks help them become more creative with their music. </p>

many times the words "innovation" and "creativity", today as well.
From my reality, nature and environment education is what will lead
us there. I am struck, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, by the number of
times these young people use the word "awe" and a "sense of wonder"
at the end of such experiences. These are words we rarely hear anymore
in the cynical blase world of many young people these days. It seems
to me that what is happening is that young people are remembering
something they have forgotten – once again, they are beginning to
feel.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Faizah Jamal</strong>
                  </span>: Sarawak,
my apologies. He noticed how the little trees were overshadowed
by the big ones. Far from being a competition and contrary to all
that we have been taught in school, it turns out that Nature is
actually collaborative. When we understand that Nature is collaborative,
not competitive, we learn that we too can do the same as we respect
and celebrate all views, all perspectives and all differences. In
short, "an inclusive society, a stronger Singapore". </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b086f515-7752-4ed4-bbd7-8da3124d7cd8">
                  <a name="budget__id-b086f515-7752-4ed4-bbd7-8da3124d7cd8"><!--a--></a>When we understand that
in Nature, the greater the diversity of species, the stronger the
forest, we recognise and appreciate that each one of us is unique
with our own individual gifts. We are not just economic digits to
be boxed into whatever the changing economic demands of the day
may be, good though it is to fill an economic need. In short, "an
inclusive society, a stronger Singapore". </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-435b81aa-a0da-4b3c-a5cc-397673c266bc">
                  <a name="budget__id-435b81aa-a0da-4b3c-a5cc-397673c266bc"><!--a--></a>When we see how in Nature,
there are no straight lines; rather, it is twists and turns, and
curls and twirls, we too understand that we need not expect our
lives to be one linear path. Our young people need not beat themselves
up when they have stepped off the path, in despair that they are
"not good enough". It is all right to turn back and choose another
path, and start again. This allows young people to know that they
do not have to be perfect. Imagine the value of this as they leave
the safe confines of school and into the stressful world juggling
personal needs, family and work.</p>

of this House mentioned the word "passion" for the work that we
do. Many years ago, I was a corporate lawyer specialising in intellectual
property law. I have since given it up to pursue my passion for
nature and environment education. Many people think I am crazy.
It was a risk, as my two daughters were very young then. However,
I have learnt that when we understand that to be out in wild nature,
with all the risks, perceived or real, which to many young people
in Singapore is really a big step out of their comfort zone, we
realise that it is at the end of our comfort zone that the real learning
begins.</p>

in Nature, all things are interconnected, we understand that this

I have shared is not convincing enough, allow me to expand on what

the World Oceans Summit where experts discussed at length the meaning

growth. As an aside, the irony is not lost on me that here we are
hosting the first World Oceans Summit with luminaries like World
Bank President Mr Robert Zoellig and Mr Peter Seligman, the CEO
of Conservation International, which incidentally has an office

does not even have its own marine conservation laws! But that is a

the Summit is well-known Mr Pavan Sukhdev, Founder and CEO of GIST

capital"? According to the definition of the International Institute
of Sustainable Development in Canada, "natural capital" is land,
air, water, living organisms and all formations of the earth's biosophere
that provide us with ecosystem goods and services imperative for
survival and well-being. In short, the basis for all human activity.
Some people call it "eco services".</p>

enough in our economy that it is the natural world that has given
us these services, without a fee, without which our economy cannot
function. Mr Peter Seligman, the CEO of Conservation International,
at last week's World Oceans Summit had this to say: "A society cannot
survive if it does not value its natural resources." </p>

to say that Singapore does not have "natural resources", let us
not forget that small though we may be, the biodiversity we have
in places like Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Sungei Buloh and Chek
Jawa is immense. Lesser known to most people, except to members
of Nature Society, at least up until now, is the rich biodiversity
in a place like Bukit Brown, a fact that more and more Singaporeans
are beginning to appreciate only very recently.</p>

than just a sense of physical, mental and emotional well being.

people, I have found that they are weary of the message of extremes

opportunity for creativity; a creative new way of life through new
jobs, new businesses, new cities, new civilisations. Yesterday,

wisdom that says, <em class="ph i">tak kenal maka tak cinta</em>. Loosely translated, it
means "you cannot love what you do not know". Young people have
told me that as a result of their experiences in Nature, they have
discovered a new sense of love for the place. It would not be too
much of a stretch to say that this can extend to the love of our country.
Imagine what this can do for national identity, and to give reasons
for staying when the going gets rough.</p>

be a purist, I must admit, and see Nature as inherently valuable in

value and to see the relevance of the word "natural capital", if
this is the language that the Government and business understand and if this will jumpstart
the Government and the private sector to start valuing the natural
world, and to take this into account in economic growth.</p>

yesterday and today and all that is in the Budget will come to nothing
if we do not recognise Nature not only as an educator but as a partner. Learning
from nature though is not a linear process. It takes time, it takes
people who know how to facilitate such learning; it takes civil
society who know the value of such places to educate the public;
it takes companies who know that when they value our natural spaces,
they can continue to exist at all and be sustainable; it takes policymakers with
the vision and foresight who are aware of the need to preserve and
conserve such natural places over and beyond immediate economic
needs. It takes the engagement of all three sectors – people, private
and public – to make this work. In short, it takes an inclusive
society. More importantly, it takes the very presence of such natural
spaces in the first place.</p>

when we were ourselves undergoing some major life challenges, it
is to Nature that we turned to, not the shopping malls. As a mother,
I intuitively know that it is these experiences in the wild that
has put us all in good stead, long after the experiences are over.
It has kept us grounded, emotionally secure, and gives us a sense
that it is not what happens to us, but how we respond to what happens that
makes us empowered. Nature has been our best teacher. I suggest
that this can be the same for many people in Singapore as well.</p>

warned that the economic forecast is not good. When we are so used

between the Government and the voices on the ground that are getting
louder and louder, and which cannot be ignored.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr
Desmond Lee (Jurong)</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this
Budget has both "heart" and "resolve". "Heart", because it puts
the interests of our most vulnerable at its front and centre. "Resolve",
because it sends a clear signal on two fronts. First, that our economy
needs to undergo painful restructuring to remain globally competitive
and yet retain our Singaporean core. Second, that we are committed
to tackling the challenges of a rapidly ageing population and growing
income inequalities.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-79eccac0-6028-4e3a-b960-5f19b1955b5b">
                  <a name="budget__id-79eccac0-6028-4e3a-b960-5f19b1955b5b"><!--a--></a>Sir, a document, entitled
"Budget Highlights – Financial Year 2012", was distributed on Budget
Day. It is full of numbers, charts and spreadsheets, but these are
my main take-aways:</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-98215665-d874-4278-980f-561e684c2bc2">
                  <a name="budget__id-98215665-d874-4278-980f-561e684c2bc2"><!--a--></a>First, over the past five
years, Government has increased expenditure significantly on our
social infrastructure. In 2006, spending on education was $7.2 billion;
in 2010 it was $10.3 billion. In 2006, investment in healthcare
was $2 billion; in 2010, it was more than double: $4.2 billion.
And over the next five years, it will be double to $8 billion. Singapore's
social development bill last year was $21.5 billion, or 45.2% of
total Government spending. I believe this Budget, the Government's
spending on social infrastructure will grow even further. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ac44e26d-fc48-4660-87a7-5d090750bb41">
                  <a name="budget__id-ac44e26d-fc48-4660-87a7-5d090750bb41"><!--a--></a>Second, Government's commitment
to building a more inclusive and caring society is a long-term,
sustainable one. This is seen by the many endowment funds, which Government
regularly tops-up, to cater to the needs of disadvantaged Singaporeans. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-343e08a1-908e-4e06-a058-09b221836ab7">

Medical Endowment Fund for those who cannot afford medical care,
$6 billion Edusave Endowment Fund to level up opportunities for
our children, $2.5 billion Eldercare Fund for needy patients requiring
long-term care, and $1.5 billion ComCare Fund to assist low-income
families.</p>

times, our Government has been in a strong fiscal position to provide
special transfers to help buffer Singaporeans against global challenges.</p>

gave out more than $3 billion for (i) Growth Dividends; (ii) Medisave
Top-Ups; (iii) Cash grants for SMEs; (iv) Workfare Special Bonuses;
(v) Special Employment Credits; (vi) U-Save Rebates; (vii) S/CC

has been hardwired as a permanent social transfer for lower income
Singaporeans. </p>

rightly pointed out in the course of today, we should quietly contrast
this with the position many other governments in Europe now face.
Instead of being able to give more in a crisis, they are faced with
the painful decision of cutting even more.</p>

to invest in our people is linked to strong, stable economic growth
and prudent stewardship of our budget. Last year, the three biggest
sources of revenue were corporate income taxes, personal income
taxes and GST. Without a growing economy, without companies setting
up shops here, without tourists spending money, and without people's
incomes growing, I do not think we will be in any position to spend
more on social infrastructure and support. So, we need to grow the
pie wisely in order to provide more support for Singaporeans.</p>

Government's focus on vulnerable Singaporeans, there are two groups
of voices whose concerns need to be addressed. The first group is
concerned about who will be paying for these growing social investments.
They ask if the cost of capital would have to be borne by future generations.
They point to massive structural deficits in other countries such
as in Europe and the US, and want to be sure that we never talk
ourselves into the same trap because no one will be there to bail
us out if we spend beyond our means. I hope Government will assure
Singaporeans that even as we strengthen our safety nets and enhance
social infrastructure, which we must do, these are fiscally sustainable
over the long term. </p>

about Government's plans to restructure the economy. This has been
the subject of many, many earlier speeches but I thought it was important
enough to bear brief repeating. Sir, last night, I went for a haircut.
News about the Budget was on the radio. So, my barber naturally
struck a conversation about how difficult it was to hire Singaporeans.
He was prepared to hire unskilled workers and train them up as apprentices,
but Singaporeans did not want the job because they thought it paid
too little, involved standing for long hours, and ate into weekends.
I was seated snugly in the chair and he was speaking animatedly
as he wielded his scissors around my head. So, I made sure that
what I have said did not cause too much excitement. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6c85b29d-1344-46ec-81ab-2a4af2622700">

proposals, including the Special Employment Credit for older and
disabled workers, enhanced Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC), enhanced
training support and the SME cash grant. He suggested that he reviewed
his starting salary for new employees and sent his name cards to
the CDCs, SCORE and other agencies. At the end of the discussion,
he was still worried but slightly more optimistic about the future
of his business. And I was quite relieved as well. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a8de052c-5ee6-47cb-b84a-e33c989c20d0">
                  <a name="budget__id-a8de052c-5ee6-47cb-b84a-e33c989c20d0"><!--a--></a>Sir, even though many
SMEs may successfully transition into higher productivity gear and
wean off foreign labour dependence, the fear is that many Singapore businesses
might fall by the wayside. Will the cost of transition be too high?
Will there be too much collateral damage? Traditional SMEs may not
be fully aware of the many schemes that the Government has put in
place, they may not have the critical mass, capital or the sophistication
to maximise them. I hope Government and SPRING Singapore can proactively
reach out to these SMEs, and set up innovation hubs to help share
ideas and innovations with such companies and businesses.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4b02af73-3bd1-4560-adea-ddc6cecbc851">
                  <a name="budget__id-4b02af73-3bd1-4560-adea-ddc6cecbc851"><!--a--></a>Sir, I said earlier that
the Budget has a lot of "heart", but on its own, it will not create a
compassionate society. It will not on its own build an inclusive
society, or generate social mobility, or foster a sense of ownership
and belonging among Singaporeans. For example, Budget 2012 will
give businesses significant rational financial incentive to hire older
or disabled Singaporeans but that, Sir, will not make them embrace
Singaporeans over cheaper foreign labour, or encourage them to make
adjustments to accommodate older or disabled Singapore workers,
unless they themselves see the inherent value of hiring Singaporeans
and the benefit that this brings to society at large.</p>

and incomes will improve the lives of Singaporeans, but it will
not bring pride and dignity to work, unless Singaporeans respect

it will not automatically cause people to erase the prejudice that
may be in their hearts towards ex-offenders. </p>

fortunate, where nobody feels marginalised. </p>

small example. In Jurong, there is a charity known as Loving Heart.
It runs a School Partnership Programme with 24 primary, secondary

Loving Heart provides more than 700 pupils from disadvantaged families
with pocket money for breakfast and more than 200 students with
sports, tuition and mentoring. The charity's hardworking and young social
workers cooperate very closely with Jurong's grassroots leaders

West CDC and the NTUC. </p>

an inclusive society is not just about Government redistributing resources
to help the poor. It is about building a society where at its heart,
people retain a deep sense of responsibility for their families
and seek every opportunity to improve themselves and do better.
Where employers treat workers with respect, value their contributions
and reward them fairly. Where the more successful step forward to
help others in the community, because they feel for their fellow
citizens. And where Singaporeans actively participate in causes
that will make this a better society. An inclusive society will
only blossom if we grow this spirit of responsibility and community."</p>

                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity to join in the
debate on the Budget. It is heartening to see that the Government
has taken bold moves to address the needs of needy and elderly Singaporeans,
who may be more adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions.
In support of this year's Budget, I would like to speak on three
issues – first, on assistance for social mobility for lower income
Singaporeans; second, on social integration and inclusivity; and
third, on contributions to society especially by the young. Sir,
please allow me to continue my speech in Malay.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db38fb08-8219-4bbc-9cd2-1f21bc07fdf3">

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In Malay</em>): [<em class="ph i">Please refer to Pg
1562 for <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=028_20120229_S0016_T0013.pdf"">Vernacular Speeches</a>.</em>]</span> For most Singaporeans, a good
education paves the way for a stable and well-paying job and, hence,
the means to support the family. A good education is also a way
out of the poverty trap. But attaining a good education may not
be easy to some, especially those in the lower income groups who
may struggle with even basic costs for such an education. This is where
self-help groups such as MENDAKI, SINDA, CDAC and EA have played
significant roles in helping lower-income Singaporeans attain a
good education so that they can have more opportunities in the future.
For instance, MENDAKI'S Max-Out programme has seen various success
stories that we can be proud of. The Max-Out programme is designed
to help youths who drop out of school to get back into mainstream
education, prepare them for the GCE "N" Level examination and proceed
to either obtain work skills certification or continue their education
at the ITE for their NITEC or Higher NITEC. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1b6765e1-814a-43e9-8ddc-65af382ab04e">
                  <a name="budget__id-1b6765e1-814a-43e9-8ddc-65af382ab04e"><!--a--></a>Farhan is one example
of our Max-Out student who achieved success that we can be proud
of. Farhan dropped out of school when he was 15 years old and studied
in Secondary 3 in the Normal stream, because he was less well off
and did not like to study. After three years of doing part-time
work and hanging out with his friends, he decided to go back to
school and sit for his "N" levels. He joined MENDAKI'S Max Out programme
and took his "N" levels last year. He managed to obtain four distinctions
and will continue his education at the ITE in Aerospace Engineering
this year. When I met him at the Max-Out graduation ceremony a few
weeks ago, Farhan shared that previously, he did not think he was
able to even sit for his "N" levels. Now, he is full of optimism
and dreams of getting a university degree eventually. He would also
like to contribute back to society and inspire new Max-Out participants.
This is the spirit of mutual assistance and gotong royong within
the Malay/Muslim community that should be continued. I am proud
of his achievement and determination all this while.</p>

success stories similar to Farhan's. And to help them realise their
hopes and aspirations, our self-help groups must be supported. The
$10 million set aside for self-help groups and the CDCs that was
announced during this year's Budget is generous. However, more may
be needed so that the required assistance can be sustainably rendered
especially in terms of helping the lower income. Mr Deputy Speaker,
allow me to continue my speech in English.</p>

                  <span class="ph hcInline hcLang">(<em class="ph i">In English</em>): </span>Other than assistance
to the self-help groups, I am happy to see in the Budget, generous
assistance for lower income families for education, childcare, general expenses
and utilities. However, there are still those who may need assistance
other than financial ones. For instance, there are lower income
Singaporeans who have married foreign spouses but who have found
it difficult to get Permanent Residence or even Long-Term Visit
Passes for their spouse because of their educational qualifications and
income levels. This results in difficulties in keeping their families
together − both physically and financially. </p>

Koh, who works as a machine operator earning less than $1,500 monthly,
is married to a Vietnamese lady. They have a two-year-old son. Although
their son is a Singapore citizen by birth, Mrs Koh is unable to
obtain even a Long-Term Visit Pass. She is here on a social visit
pass, and can stay in Singapore for a maximum of three months at
a stretch. For the most part of the year, Mrs Koh and her son live
in Vietnam so as to cut down costs incurred for their airfares.
I feel sorry for the little boy who needs to travel between two
countries each year just for his family to be reunited. I hope Singaporeans
such as Mr Koh can be given better opportunities to start, raise
and keep their families together.</p>

elderly and disabled in this year's Budget are generous, I would
like to make a pitch for a group that may have been overlooked.
Patients with rare diseases, like what the hon Member Mr Seng Hang
Thong talked about yesterday, need more support and assistance from
the Government. For instance, Chloe Mah, the first Pompe's disease
patient in Singapore, has to spend about $200,000 to $300,000 annually on
her medical treatments. There are no healthcare policies for patients
like her in Singapore. To add on, Chloe cannot quite be categorised
as someone with special needs or disabilities and be entitled to
such financial assistance schemes that are available. In the spirit
of inclusivity, I believe the Government can do more to help patients
like Chloe.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4bd67410-06b1-4889-adc8-24fd5c74aa4a">
                  <a name="budget__id-4bd67410-06b1-4889-adc8-24fd5c74aa4a"><!--a--></a>Other than assistance
given to help those who need a little leg-up, it is necessary to provide
opportunities in the social realm for integration and to ensure
social inclusivity. For instance, in our schools, while we try to
cater to different academic abilities and individual proclivities,
it is also important to ensure that our students are well-integrated and
are able to understand and accept the diverse abilities, backgrounds
and culture of other students. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bdfe4bbf-4d43-48f9-b8c0-8a30967efa92">
                  <a name="budget__id-bdfe4bbf-4d43-48f9-b8c0-8a30967efa92"><!--a--></a>To elaborate, students
from the different specialised or independent schools must be able
to communicate and work with one another and with students from
neighbourhood schools. I recall overhearing a young trainee teacher
remark that she had a culture shock when she was posted to a neighbourhood
school to teach. Having attended top schools, she said she was not
used to the way students in the neighbourhood school spoke or behaved.
Similarly, a school boy I once taught told me he could not tell
the difference between Tamil and Malay languages. This was because
he did not have any Indian or Malay classmates or schoolmates. </p>

that creating an inclusive Singapore society goes beyond providing
assistance to help those who are in need or vulnerable. It also
involves creating opportunities for social integration and social
equity.</p>

having the Government provide needed assistance and more opportunities
for social integration and inclusivity, it is necessary for Singaporeans,
especially the young, to proactively and positively contribute to society
in their own ways. </p>

highlight the work done by the Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE) in
Nanyang Technological University. Their social cause is to help
stay-at-home-mothers and housewives enhance their employability
by honing their culinary skills. They work with existing VWOs to
help these women get certified as cooks or cooking instructors and,
thereafter, act as the intermediary to find them employment and
publish their recipes for distribution. These NTU-SIFE students
do this voluntarily as part of their co-curricular activity but,
more importantly, they recognise the need to give back to society
and pay forward what they have benefited.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-bb176796-c058-4e06-b7ce-c3a479dc7906"><!--a--></a>The inculcation of values
such as responsibility, empathy, care and magnanimity among Singaporeans,
especially our young, is an important one. While some may think this
is to be done through the schools and is the responsibility of teachers,
the Government or the relevant agencies, it must be recognised that
such values begin at home, within the family.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-27cb4696-28b6-422d-8639-3b6a4c3a6ec5">

hear from some of my elderly residents that their grown-up children
are not able to provide for them financially or take care of them
even though there are three, four or five siblings among them and
they are gainfully employed and living in purchased dwellings. There
was one resident aged 70 years old who was expected to work on his
son's factory just so he can get lodging and pocket money. If he does
not work, his son will not give him any pocket money. I feel for
him – his anger, hurt and, eventually, resignation.</p>

our success is not ours alone. What we achieve in life is due to
many people – our family, our teachers, a good government, our society.
Hence, it is important to pay forward what we have reaped. This
helps ensure that the gaps between the have and have-nots, and the
able and less-able do not widen. We must perpetuate positive values
through our contributions to society in our own little ways. We
can start with our own family.</p>

say this year's Budget is an inclusive and people-centric one – one
that focuses on different groups of individuals with different needs.
I believe that the Budget will help to support other initiatives
to further assist lower income Singaporeans, create more opportunities
for social integration and inclusivity, and allow Singaporeans, especially
the young, to contribute to society in their own ways.</p>
