<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND CONTRIBUTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Payment of rents and rates)</b></div>







<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Labour, in

order  to  help alleviate the present cost of  living

problem, if he will consider amending legislation  to

allow  Singaporeans  to use their  Central  Provident

Fund   contributions  to  settle  their  income  tax,

property tax, rents for Housing and Development Board

flats and Public Utilities Board bills.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Central Provident Fund was  set  up

to  provide workers with savings for their old age or

in the event of their being permanently disabled. The

Government has already allowed members in the  lower-income  and middle-income group to utilise their  CPF

savings to purchase publicly-built flats. This is  in

accordance with the aim of providing for the workers'

future  and old age. To extend the use of CPF savings

for  the settling of income tax, property tax,  rents

for  HDB  and  PUB  bills,  however,  would  not   be

consistent  with the purpose for which the  Fund  was

established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore regret to inform the Member for Thomson

that  it is not proposed to amend the CPF legislation

to  allow  the  use  of  CPF  contributions  for  the

purposes indicated by him.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Increase in revenue)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and  Communications  whether   the   $18

million  or  9% increase in income from  electricity,

gas  and water in 1975, stated in the Economic Survey

of  Singapore.  1975, was due  to  the  increase  in

consumption  or  to  the increase  in  the  rates  of

charges;  and  if he will ascertain from  the  Public

Utilities  Board  the  rates  of  charges  for,   and

consumption  of, electricity, gas and water  in  1974

and in 1975.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the increase in revenue for the PUB

for  1975  is estimated at $46 million, and  not  $18

million  as mentioned by the Hon. Member. $18 million

is the increase in the added value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To earn the extra $46 million, the PUB has spent

$207.74  million in 1974 and $285.93 million in  1975

on  the provision of infrastructure necessary to meet

the  increasing demand for power, water and  gas.  In

the  last  three  years, the PUB  has  spent  $758.35

million  on  capital expenditure and  had  to  borrow

$410.34 million to finance development projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumption of electricity has increased by 7.2 1%

and  gas  by 9.47% in 1975. In both cases, there  has

been no increase in tariffs since February 1974, and

the increase in revenue can be said to be due largely

to the increase in consumption or sales.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tariff for electricity, for the information of

Members,  is  based on a fuel oil price of  $160  per

tonne,  and I would like Members to note that  though

the price of fuel oil increased to $182 per tonne  in

October  1975,  that is, an increase of  13.75%, the

tariff  for electricity has not been raised. For  the

time being the PUB is able to absorb this increase in

fuel  oil  price  and  other higher  operating  costs

without  passing it on to consumers, largely  because

of   increased   efficiency  in  the  generation   of

electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for gas, because of greater efficiency,

the PUB is also able to absorb increases in the price

of naphtha without increasing the price of gas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water tariffs, however, were revised upwards in

October  1975, and this was to encourage  economy  in

the use of water. It was also because the PUB had  to

spend  $1  37.3  million on two  major  water  supply

projects, i.e, the Upper Peirce  and  Kranji/Pandan

Schemes,  to  augment our water supply,  storage  and

treatment capacities in order to cope with increasing

consumption. Consumption for 1975 increased by 8.47%.

It also costs more to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



treat  raw water which is as polluted as the kind  we

are getting from the Kranji/Pandan Dam. Incidentally,

we are most fortunate in that we are able to complete

these  schemes before the recent drought.  Otherwise.

Members  would  have to miss their  daily  baths  and

would not look as clean as they do now. And if we had

not  completed these projects, there would have  been

water  rationing or some other form of self-restraint

would have been necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water, as we know, is becoming increasingly

expensive  to  tap  as the PUB has  to  develop  less

economic sources of supply. Excessive use and wastage

of  water  must be discouraged and I hope members  of

the  public  and  Hon.  Members  too  will  keep   on

reminding  themselves that, rain or shine, water  is

precious and must not be wasted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member wants, I can read out a long list of

PUB tariffs (See Appendix, cols. 611-6).

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister

for  his detailed reply, which will give consumers  a

clear  idea  on  how  to calculate their  consumption

rates.

<div align="center"><b>TELEPHONE APPLICATIONS ON WAITING LIST</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications

if  he  will  ascertain  from  the  Telecommunication

Authority  of Singapore the number of applicants  for

telephones  on the waiting list on 1st March, 1976;

the   average  number  annually  of  applicants   for

telephones  and the number of telephones provided  by

the   Authority  since  1971;  and  what  plans   the

Authority  has  to  meet  the increasing  demand  for

telephones.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

at  1st March, 1976, there were a  total  number  of

32,082 applicants waiting for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



telephones. The number of applications for telephones

and the number of telephones provided by the

Authority since 1971 are as follows:



<pre>

     Applications     Direct telephone

                      lines installed



1971    21,715            19,864

1972    27,098            20,257

1973    35,894            24,244

1974    40,876            25,240

1975    48,879            33,612

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing urbanisation and affluence, the

growth  in  demand  for telephone services  had  been

phenomenal.  In the 10 years since 1966, applications

for  telephones have almost increased five-fold  from

11,000 to 51,000 today. The number of exchange  lines

installed  has  more  than  tripled  from  64,000  to

210.000 today. Likewise, the number of people waiting

for  telephones has also increased. Actual growth  is

running  at the rate of 20% per year while  projected

growth was only 1 5% per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep pace with this rate of growth, the

Authority  is  investing  vast  sums  of   money   on

equipment and cables as follows:



<pre>

Financial       Capital Expenditure

   Year              Million $

1971                    35.7

1972/73                 29.9

1973/74                 27.6

1974/75                 53.6

1975/76 (estimate)     108.0

1976/77 (budgetted)    152.0

</pre>



As development gathers momentum, the waiting list for

telephones  which  is  now  1  5.4%  of  total  lines

installed would be brought down progressively to just

over  10% by the end of this year, and to 8%  by  the

end  of 1977. The Authority's long-term objective  is

to keep the waiting list to about 5%.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, I was told that

when  the  TAS  introduced  colour  telephones,  they

levied  an  extra  charge on those  who  applied  for

colour   telephones.  But  this  charge   was   later

withdrawn.  I  want to know what is the justification

for  the extra charge in the first instance, and  why

was it withdrawn later.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the reason for levying an

extra  charge  in the early stages of the introduction

of  colour telephones was because there were a limited

number of colour telephones available to meet the high

demand  for them. But since then the supply of  colour

telephones  has  been adequate, and it  has  therefore

been decided to withdraw the extra charge.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I do

believe it must have been bad planning on the part of

the TAS because -Mr Speaker: Mr Baptist, are you

asking a

supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Yes, I am asking a

supplementary  question, Sir. The  Minister  of  State

must  have been aware that there has been bad planning

on  the  part  of the TAS. According to  his  figures.

actual  growth was 20% per year and the TAS  projected

only

1 5%, that is, about 25% off the mark.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> I am just wondering

whether  or not the Hon. Minister of State would  take

steps to ensure that this error will not occur in  the

projection  for the next five years. From the  figures

he has given, things are getting from bad to worse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> As has been given

in  my answer earlier. Sir, this waiting list will  be

progressively reduced from the current rate  of  15.4%

to  8%  by  the  end of 1977. It is  not  possible  to

provide  a  system or service where there would  be  a

100%  fulfilment, or a "zero" waiting time. There must

be   some   amount  of  waiting  time.  The  long-term

objective,  as I have mentioned earlier,  is  to  keep

this waiting list down to the minimum and I can assure

the  Member that every effort is being made to achieve

this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, arising from the

Minister  of State's answer to my question in  respect

of  the  charge  for  colour telephones, may  I  know

whether it was because the TAS had to pay more for the

colour  telephones, or whether they charged it  simply

because the people demanded it. What is the difference

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



cost between the colour telephone and the conventional

black sets?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I do not think

there  is any difference between the cost of a  colour

telephone and an ordinary black telephone.  I  do  not

know what the actual reasons were when the colour  set

was introduced, but I believe the extra charge was  to

deter the high demand at that time.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, sometimes the statement of accounts from the TAS is

confusing, and sometimes it takes three or four months

to arrive.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, are you

asking a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, Sir. Will the

Minister  take steps to ensure that the  statement  of

accounts will be sent regularly every month?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> It is assured. Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MOTOR-CYCLE AND SCOOTER RIDERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Dangerous driving)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and Communications if it is  feasible  to

confine  motor-cycle  and scooter  riders, especially

provisional  licence holders, to the  inner  lanes  of

carriageways and to limit their speed so as to prevent

them  from  weaving their way through the traffic  and

endangering other road users.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Sir, I wish to inform

the  Member that existing traffic regulations  already

disallow  dangerous  weaving through  the  traffic  by

motor-cycle  and  scooter riders.  If  caught  by  the

traffic enforcement officers, they will be booked  for

inconsiderate  or even dangerous driving.  Motor-cycle

and  scooter  riders  should  move  with  the  general

traffic  and observe the speed limits imposed for  the

stretch of road they are travelling on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, it is desirable to segregate and to have

separate  lanes for the different types  of  vehicles.

However, in Singapore the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



shortage of land and limited road space have made  it

difficult, if not impossible, for this to be so, and

serious problems especially at road junctions will be

encountered if segregation of vehicles is  practised.

A  good  example is our bus lane which is not without

its  problems. However, in this case the benefits far

outweigh the disadvantages. Even then, bus lanes have

been introduced only to certain main roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a requirement of law, as well as simple

courtesy,  that slow-moving vehicles should  move  on

the left lane to allow faster vehicles to proceed  on

the  lane  to the right without hindrance.  The  left

lane  is  thus meant for use by slow-moving  vehicles

such as buses and goods vehicles. It would, hence, be

most  unfair to confine motor-cycles and scooters  to

the  left  lane  as  they  would  have  to  move   at

unrealistic slow speeds among the heavy vehicles  and

this  is  dangerous for them. The existing  situation

allows flexibility and is desirable since most of our

carriageways have only two lanes. If a motorcycle  or

a  scooter rider is moving slowly, he should keep  to

the  left lane. If he moves faster and wants  to  by-pass a slow-moving vehicle in front, he can do so  in

the outer lane to the right. However, at all times he

should  observe all traffic regulations, and  traffic

enforcement  officers are keeping a  sharp  watch  to

ensure that this is being done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts will continue to be made to educate motor-cycle and scooter riders on the rules and regulations

regarding  road  use.  The requirement  as  from  1st

January,   1974  that  provisional  driving   licence

holders  should pass their Highway Code  test  before

being  allowed to drive or ride on the road has  also

helped  to  reduce  traffic  offences  and  accidents

caused by motor-cycle and scooter riders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I am just wondering

if  the  Hon.  Minister of State is  aware  that  PDL

holders are, in actual fact, endangering the lives of

other  road users. In addition, is the Minister aware

that  many  PDL  holders continue to  hold  PDLs  and

nothing else year after year? They are unable to pass

the road



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



test, and they are still being issued with PDLs. This

system   is  making  the  traffic  situation   almost

impossible. What action is he proposing  to  take  on

PDL  holders  who continue to renew their  PDLs  year

after year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> In answer to the

question  raised  by  the Member  for  Potong  Pasir,

action   is   being  taken  to  see  that   this   is

regularised.  As I have said, as far as  the  learner

drivers are concerned, they should observe the  rules

and regulations governing road use. It is very much a

question  of  public courtesy and mutual respect  for

other  road users. No amount of enforcement of  rules

that we are able to introduce will make our roads any

safer   without  the  cooperation  of   the   drivers

themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I am not talking about PDL

motor car drivers. I am talking about PDL scooterists

and  motor  cyclists. Where they are concerned,  they

can ride the scooter without a tutor sitting by their

side to guide them where proper driving is concerned,

which  is  impossible because he would be sitting  on

the  road)  I  am  talking  about  motorcyclists  and

scooterists  and I am wondering whether the  Minister

is  aware  of the fact that they do not even  go  for

road  tests. They are quite satisfied with displaying

the   L-plate,  the  red  letter  "L"  on   a   white

background.  In  addition, they are the  ones  mainly

responsible for most accidents on the roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, in my earlier answer I did

mention  that they now have to go for a Highway  Code

test, which was not required in the past.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I do not believe that a

Highway  Code  test  will  actually  give  them   the

practical experience on the road. A Highway Code test

is  merely  a written examination as well as  pushing

little toy cars and motor-cycles around.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> I would welcome

constructive suggestions from the Member  on  how  to

overcome this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Most certainly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head O (cont.) --



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question (17th March, 1976).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item lal of subhead AAA

3020."-(Mr  N. Govindasamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I would like to

make reference to the Housing Board's policy in

regard to restrictions imposed on visitors using

their car parks when calling on friends living in

Housing Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Government proudly announces

that  public housing provides accommodation for  more

than 40% of Singapore's population and has urged  the

people  to develop a greater sense of neighbourliness

not only in their own estates but also with those  in

the  estates  around  them. On the  other  hand,  the

Housing  Board appears to be determined  to  stultify

every  attempt  at neighbourliness by imposing  petty

restrictions, such as the closing of car parks at  10

p.m, and even at 7 p.m, in some estates. This  makes

it difficult for residents to receive friends for any

length of time in the evenings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is difficult to comprehend the rationale

behind  this  restriction if  the  Housing  Board  is

really   sincere  in  their  attempt   to   encourage

neighbourliness and cohesiveness among the  residents

in  the  housing  estates. I  believe  that  in  some

housing  estates  visitors are  allowed  to  use  the

Housing Board car parks until 11 p.m. If this is  so,

why  is  it not allowed in other HDB housing estates?

This  extension will at least allow friends  to  meet

for  a  few  hours after work. In fact,  the  Housing

Board  should  permit visitors to utilise  their  car

parks until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



midnight.   I   am  sure  that  there   can   be   no

administrative problem in keeping the  Housing  Board

car parks open till midnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have suggested extension of use of the car

parks  until  midnight because as  Singapore  becomes

urbanised   so   also   must   the   life-styles   of

Singaporeans  change. Thirty years ago when  we  were

less urbanised and less industrialised, life went  on

at a slower pace and most people retire early to bed.

Living in flats and apartments and the tempo of  life

today, including television, have all contributed  to

encouraging or even compelling Singaporeans to  sleep

late.  Because of longer working hours and  transport

problems,   social  calls  to  friends  are   usually

possible  only  after  8 p.m.,  and  if  visitors  to

residents  in  Housing Board estates  have  to  clear

their cars out by 10 p.m, it leaves very little  time

indeed  for  them to socialise. We  have  not  got  a

wonderful  public transport system to encourage  them

to travel in public transport. They therefore have to

travel in their own motor cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, young couples living in Housing

Board  flats  have been encouraged  to  invite  their

parents  to  visit them frequently and to  help  look

after  their  children when they  are  out.  But  the

Housing  Board's car park rules make this practically

impossible if grandparents who make the visit by  car

have to clear out by 10p.m. This 10 p.m-deadline  has

a  very  unsettling and unnerving effect on  visitors

because if, by any chance, they are delayed by a  few

minutes they may find their cars locked in or parking

posts  chained  at  the whims of  the  Housing  Board

officials. Moreover, they will also be subject  to  a

heavy penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that the officials of the

Housing Board are insensitive to the requirements and

wishes  of the residents of the flats, although  they

have  been  administering the flats for more  than  a

decade.  May I, therefore, request the Housing  Board

to  take  a  closer look at its rules and regulations

and  consult  the  residents through  the  residents'

association or other organisations and work out  more

pragmatic schemes not only in respect of car



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



parking  but also in other matters. This  will  be  a

more   democratic  approach  instead  of  introducing

arbitrary rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such arbitrary rule which puzzles me is why

residents  who  are allotted car park  lots  are  not

allowed  to  park their cars for a few  hours  in  an

adjoining car park when vacant, if they have a reason

to  do  so. Apparently the Housing Board's rule,  for

reasons best known to themselves, is that "you  shall

park  your  car in your given lot and nowhere  else",

even if there are vacant lots in adjoining car parks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Housing

Board is determined to forge a regimented society,  a

society  that  will obediently abide  by  their  many

arbitrary  rules and regulations, and  may  not  seek

redress.  This attitude of the Housing Board  appears

to stem from their monopoly in public housing. As the

biggest landlord, they appear to be succumbing to the

thirst  for  power by dictating the rules instead  of

arriving at mutually acceptable rules and regulations

that  will  equally provide discipline necessary  for

the efficient management of housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to seek clarification from the

Minister  as to the reason for abolishing  the  half-hour parking in Housing Board estates at a rate of 20

cents  and substituting it with a minimum fee  of  40

cents  in the hour. This new rate means that  anybody

who parks his car there even for a short while has to

pay  the  minimum rate of 40 cents for a  full  hour.

This appears to be an arbitrary decision without  any

justification  whatsoever. It excites suspicion  that

the  Housing  Board  merely wishes  to  increase  its

revenue.  In most cases people stop by at  these  car

parks  for  a  few  minutes only to  speak  to  their

friends or to have a quick meal at the restaurant, or

to  make some purchases at the supermarket there.  So

although they may be there only for 15 to 20 minutes,

they now have to pay the minimum fee of 40 cents.  In

the past it was 20 cents for half an hour, and it  is

difficult to understand the reason for the increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Housing Board is really honest in its

declared intention to encourage greater intermingling

and  interaction among the residents of the different

Housing Board estates, these arbitrary rules do  pose

a  serious  problem because in the  not  too  distant

future more than half of Singapore's population  will

be  living in Housing Board flats. And if the Housing

Board  continues  to  build  artificial  barriers  to

prevent  the  free  interflow of residents  in  those

estates



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, you have taken more than 10

minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I am closing it, Sir, I was saying

that  the  residents will soon be cut off from  their

friends and neighbours and remain isolated, living in

solitude within the four walls of their little  flat.

I  can  only  express the hope that this increase  in

parking  fee from 20 cents to 40 cents is the  result

of  an  honest  mistake on the part  of  the  Board's

officials  and not a perverse desire to  isolate  the

residents.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, much

has   already   been  said  about  the  Housing   and

Development Board and my first thought was,  perhaps,

sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is one point I would like especially

to  make  and that relates to the Tanjong Rhu housing

estate, and I hope this will not be considered  as  a

particular  or  special  pleading.  The  Tanjong  Rhu

housing  estate was constructed in 1962,  quite  soon

after  the HDB replaced the old Singapore Improvement

Trust. The flats raised at Tanjong Rhu were, in fact,

sometimes  described as "emergency  flats"  aimed  at

making  up for the backlog of people that had  to  be

housed  urgently  at  that  time  and  at  resettling

displaced families. Quite a lot of fire victims  from

Geylang and Crawford were moved there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since that time the quality of HDB accommodation

has improved tremendously. When I compare the Tanjong

Rhu estate with the new estates like Marine Parade in

the  next  door  constituency - in  fact,  with  your

constituency of Joo Chiat, Mr Speaker, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>





with  Ulu Pandan, or Bedok and soon - I am struck  by

the comparative shortage of amenities that we have in

Tanjong Rhu. Tanjong Rhu estate may well be unique in

the   spartan  considerations  that  went  into   its

construction. On this basis I think consideration  of

priority  ought  to  be  given  to  this  estate  for

whatever improvement that may be planned, and I think

Tanjong  Rhu estate deserves a special look  in  this

direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it could have a community hall of

which some other estates have several. Could we  have

this  early? Could the lay-out and appearance of  the

market/hawker  centre be improved, and its  potential

for   service   to  the  community  extended?   Could

additional  car parking facilities be made available?

Many  of  the tenants are living in extremely crowded

circu  mstances;  perhaps if the  Minister  makes  an

examination of Tanjong Rhu estate, he might find  the

highest  number  of people with very  large  families

living  there. Could consideration be given as  early

as   possible  to  rehousing  those  people  in  such

circumstances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very reluctant to want to receive special

consideration,   but   I  think   the   history   and

circumstances of Tanjong Rhu estate may well  warrant

some special attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the other points that have been

raised, especially relations between Housing Board

officials and the people living in housing estates -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> You have a swimming pool there.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I will come to the swimming pool a

little later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think every effort should be made to emphasise a

spirit  of  cooperation  and  understanding  of   the

problems of one side with the other. With the kind of

idea  that many people have about the Housing  Board,

it  would be a pity indeed if it is thought of  as  a

cow  that  gives good milk and then kicks the  bucket

over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to this red herring that has been

raised, the swimming pool is not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



meant  for  the  people  in my constituency  but  for

everybody  around there within an adequate  radius  - Mountbatten  and J00 Chiat - and if  the  Member  for

Bras  Basah  wants to have a swim he is  entitled  to

come over for a swim too.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang):</b> Let me first answer the question

raised by the Member for Telok Blangah. Together with

a  few other Members, he has raised some observations

on the need to improve the standard of workmanship in

public  housing.  As a result of their  observations,

the  Ministry of National Development issued a  press

statement on 21st February, 1976, explaining in great

detail  the causes of the poor workmanship. I have  a

copy  of the statement here which could be handed  to

the Member at a later stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> I have read it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> I am glad the Member has read it.

The second point which he raised is whether the Board

could  refund the proportion of the unused fee for  a

season   parking  licence  taken  by   one   of   his

constituents. The Board cannot make such a refund  to

a  resident who has already been allocated a  parking

lot.  This  means  that  he had  been  successful  in

balloting  for  a parking lot and had  thus  deprived

another  person of that particular parking  lot.  The

same principle applies to a person who pays road  tax

to  the  Registry of Vehicles. If he decides to  sell

his  car, he cannot ask the ROV for a refund  of  tax

for  the unexpired period. It is between him and  the

purchaser.  The  same  principle  applies  to  a   TV

licence. But, to satisfy the Member, should  the  car

owner deregister his car immediately, that means,  he

really  takes it off the road, then the  Board  would

allow  a  refund  of  the  unexpired  season  parking

charges, to keep in line with Government's policy  of

discouraging  car  ownership.  In  respect  of   this

particular  car.  I have checked with  the  ROV  this

morning   and   I  found  that  it   has   not   been

deregistered.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised by the Member is about the

Housing  Board  being  a stickler  of  principles  in

regard  to  the  processing of  plans  for  community

centres.  Let me reply by simply saying that whenever

the People's Association decides to build a community

centre in a Housing Board estate it forwards its plan

to  the  Ministry of Finance for endorsement. In  the

meantime  the  Housing  Board  goes  ahead  with  the

processing  of  the plan. At this  point  it  is  the

normal practice for the Housing Board to request  the

People's Association to pay for the piece of land  as

soon as it can. In fact, a six-month extension period

is  normally given. It should be borne in  mind  that

whatever  the  Housing  Board  charges  the  People's

Association, the price of the land is kept  extremely

low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question raised was in regard to helping

the  tenants and the contractors. As he has correctly

pointed  out, contractors are licensed by the Housing

Board.    But   if   complaints   about   them    are

substantiated,  then  the  Housing   Board   can   do

something;  perhaps their licence could be terminated

and  their deposit of $5,000 forfeited. They can also

be   black-listed  and  debarred   from   doing   any

renovation work in any Housing Board estate. I  think

I  have  covered all the queries raised by the Member

for Telok Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has raised a number of

points.  The first was about the provision of  better

maintenance  services for residents of Housing  Board

flats. I think it is well understood that the Housing

Board   is  continuously  striving  to  improve   the

standard  of maintenance and services in its  housing

estates.  A good example is the introduction  of  the

Essential  Maintenance  Service  Unit  and  the  Lift

Emergency   Unit   which  provide  a  round-the-clock

service  to attend to urgent calls for correction  of

any defective electrical installation or to attend to

complaints  of normal choking of sanitary  pipes  and

fittings. The present charges for these services  are

well  below actual cost and, in fact they have to  be

subsidised. To give some figures, the expected income

from the collection of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



service  charges  is estimated to  be  $52.8  million

against  an expenditure of $58.4 million. My Minister

has  indicated yesterday that for the next  financial

year  the Government will subsidise the Housing Board

to  the tune of $46 million. Part of this money  will

be  used  to  subsidise the maintenance and  services

section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised by him is on the Survey. It

is   only  fair  that  I  should  g  ye  the   actual

interpretation of the Survey by those who wrote  this

particular  article. It has been  indicated  that  in

1968  a  large percentage of the residents were  from

resettlement  cases cleared from  the  slums  in  the

Central   area.  Therefore,  75.2%  of   the   people

interviewed  have  indicated  that  it  is  obviously

cleaner  to  live  in housing estates  compared  with

their  previous environment. However, in  1973  there

were  fewer clearance cases and some of the residents

had  moved from the older housing estates to the  new

housing  estates  as  a result of  the  splitting  of

families,  etc. Therefore, only 49.2% of  the  people

consider that their new environment is an improvement

over the old housing estate environment. However,  in

the 1973 survey only 9.6% of the people consider that

cleanliness in the Housing Board estates is  inferior

to  their previous environment. Therefore, it  cannot

be  interpreted that the cleanliness in  the  Housing

Board estaies has deteriorated in the last few years.

think cleanliness depends both upon the residents and

the  maintenance and service team of the HDB. If  the

residents  do  not adopt clean habits, no  amount  of

maintenance  by the HDB can really keep  the  estates

spick and span.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point raised is the suggestion that perhaps

a  top civil servant should be appointed Chairman  of

the Housing and Development Board. The present system

of appointing a part-time Chairman to the Housing and

Development   Board  has  proved  to   be   extremely

satisfactory. The intention of appointing a  Chairman

or members to sit on a statutory board is to reap the

richness  of the expertise of top executives  in  the

private   sector.   Obviously,   the   intention   of

establishing a statutory board is to ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



that   it   has   more  flexibility  and   that   the

administration    could   function    smoothly    and

efficiently  and not be bogged down by too  much  red

tape  and bureaucracy, as in the case of a department

of the Government, like the Land Office or the P\ND.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on which the Member has expressed

concern is in regard to the coordination and planning

of  new estates. It is not fair to compare the  older

estates  with  the newer estates. I  can  assure  the

Member  that  the very fact that Ang Mo Kio  will  be

vastly different from, say, the old Alexandra Estate,

must clearly indicate that the HDB has been receptive

of  ideas  and observation from the Backbenchers  and

the  public  in improving both the design and  social

amenities  in the new housing estates. I  can  assure

the Member that this is so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his particular complaint about Toa Payoh Police

Station, according to the Housing Board's record, the

piece  of land was reserved for a police station  for

the  last  three  to  five  years.  But  somehow  the

programme  of  the Ministry of Home Affairs  did  not

meet with this requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member touched on the public tender

system.  I  can  only refer again  to  my  Minister's

statement  made  in  this House yesterday  afternoon,

when  he said that the existing public tender  system

has proved to be satisfactory and there is really no'

reason to change what has already been proven to be a

good system. Moreover, a fixed price system does  not

ensure that consumer products will be cheaper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that there is a

constant  review of the administration and policy  of

the Housing Board in conjunction with the Ministry of

National   Development,  with  the  main  object   of

improving both the concept of public housing in terms

of design and the administration of public housing in

terms of running these housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has raised a number of

points. First of all, let me tell him why there is  a

need  to  charge  for use of the  Housing  Board  car

parks.  The  object  of  paid parking  is  merely  to

control car parking either



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



in  public  housing estates or on the main roads.  It

also ensures that there is proper use made of the car

parks.   If  there  is  no  control  of  car   parks,

inconsiderate car owners can easily cause obstruction

and  create problems for other car owners. Therefore,

a paid parking system will eradicate this problem. It

will  also  prevent any encroachment by  lorries  and

trailers  and  also  stop  junk-yard  operators  from

dumping  their  vehicles in the car parks  meant  for

residents of the housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be aware that the HDB has very

recently  (I  think  it was last week)  introduced  a

pilot  scheme  whereby parking lots are reserved  for

visitors to park their vehicles in the HDB car  parks

after  11.00p.m. To give some details,  visitors  are

required  to  pay  $1  for a  permit  to  park  their

vehicles  from 11.00 p.m, at night to  7.00  am,  the

next  morning. This scheme has been implemented as  a

pilot  project  and it is being carried  out  at  Toa

Payoh   West,  Toa  Payoh  Central,  Stirling   Road,

Henderson  and Buona Vista housing estates.  If  this

scheme  proves to be successful, the Board may extend

it to other areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has complained about the

unreasonableness  on  the  part  of  the   car   park

attendants  in  not  permitting visitors  to  housing

estates  to  stop  just to pick  up  a  passenger,  a

friend,  or  a baggage. The Housing Board now  issues

pink  tickets for such vehicles to enable the  driver

to  park  for a duration of five minutes without  any

charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why has the minimum parking fee

been increased from 20 cents per hour to 40 cents per

hour,  and why is there the need to restrict  parking

up  to  10.00  p.m, or 11 .00 p.m, for visitors.  The

answer is that it is mainly due to the administrative

problem of shift work. For example, we cannot  change

shifts  at  midnight. Members should  grant  us  that

little     administrative    ability.    Owing     to

administrative difficulties there are certain ways to

go  about  exercising restraints. To illustrate  that

this is an administrative decision, the charge in the

minimum  fee of 20 cents for half an hour parking  is

slowly being withdrawn from the public car parks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



under URA. There are administrative difficulties. Let

me assure him that it is not an honest mistake. It is

a  deliberate  and  well-thought  out  administrative

procedure.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me answer the Member for Katong. He has

sadly  lamented on the old estate at Tanjong Rhu.  It

is  a  fact  that the Tanjong Rhu housing estate  was

built  under  the first five-year building  programme

when  the  standard of public housing  was  obviously

among the lowest. Because of numerous complaints  and

so on, attempts have been made to improve. Again, due

to  the  restricted site and the lack  of  additional

space around to expand, there is very little the  HDB

could  do. But despite that, we will try our best  to

make  some improvement to the hawker centre that  the

Member  mentioned,  but  it could  only  be  a  minor

improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we have sacrificed green areas in this

estate  to make way for more car parks. To compensate

for  this  lack of facilities or social amenities  in

the  old  housing  estates, not  necessarily  in  the

Member's  constituency  alone, the  Board   is   now

systematically  studying the various housing  estates

to  provide additional facilities, wherever possible,

within  each  estate if land is available.  Based  on

this  particular policy, a swimming complex,  as  the

Member  has mentioned, has been built off Mountbatten

Road, but correctly pointed out by him, it is  meant

not  only  for the residents of Tanjong Rhu but  also

for the residents in the Old Kallang Airport Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> And also for the Member for Bras

Basah!



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> The Board is now

building  another swimming pool, south of  MacPherson

Estate,  for  the  residents in  MacPherson.  Another

swimming  pool and sports complex will be  built  off

Alexandra  Road  to serve the residents  in  the  old

housing estates in Bukit Ho Swee and Redhill. Another

sports complex will also be built at the junction  of

Jalan Bukit Merah and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



Henderson  Road  to  serve  the  residents  of  Telok

Blangah New Town as well as Tiong Bahru and Henderson

Hill Estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I am aware of the reply

given  by  the  Housing Board on the  26th  February,

which the Minister of State has referred to. The fact

is  that the Housing Board was preparing a reply  to,

perhaps.  "my  last  outburst" as  they  call  it  in

respect  of shoddy Housing Board flats. If  they  had

studied  the  speech  I made last  time,  they  would

realise that I had pointed out all the problems  that

they  now have. And if the Minister of State had only

listened  to me yesterday, he would also know  of  my

appreciation  of  the pressure the Housing  Board  is

undergoing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how many more flats it has to build. What I

am  asking  for is that the Housing Board  should  be

more  vigilant  in its supervision  of  the  work  of

contractors.  In its reply of the 26th February,  the

Board  said, "More than 90% of the house  owners  did

the  floors." In other words, it is saying that since

everybody is redoing the floors, why make the  floors

suitable?  They are redoing the floors  because  they

are bad. It is not because they want to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other point about the refund of car

park  charges, I do nbt know what the Minister  meant

by   ``immediate  deregistration"  because  immediate

deregistration could be effected within  a  month,  a

week  or even the next day. I am not too sure whether

this particular car has been deregistered or not, but

I know that it has been taken away from Telok Blangah

estate.  This  is a special case. In the  history  of

Singapore, when has the Government imposed a tax  and

then  withdrew it? In the case of the latest increase

in  road  taxes, there was a withdrawal and,  arising

out of this, the man decided to deregister his car.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was very happy to hear that the Housing and

Development  Board  officers  will  look   into   the

complaints of residents about contractors who do  not

honocr  their  obligations in respect  of  renovation

work.  I  only hope that the Minister will  pass  the

word down to his officers. What I know is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



that  if any complaint is made to the Housing  Board,

they  say,  "Look,  this  is  a  private  arrangement

between  you  and the contractor." This has  been  so

thus  far.  As  from today, if the HDB officers  look

into it, I think the point has been made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter that I am quite happy about

is   that  from  now  onwards  perhaps  the  People's

Association  can  make application  to  the  Building

Control Division for approval of the construction  of

community centres six months before getting the money

from  the  Minister for Finance who is not here  nnw.

Sometimes  the Minister for Finance takes  more  than

six months to approve payment in respect of the land.

I  said that if the Housing and Development Board  as

landowner can sign the plans of the community centres

even  before  receiving payment, then  I  think  that

community centres can be built at a faster pace  than

they are being built now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N. Govindasamy, since you are

happy, would you like to withdraw your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> No, Sir, I think other Members

would like to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first  of all, I would like to thank the Minister  of

State for his explanation. At the outset, I think  it

is  necessary for me to place on record that  when  I

suggested that the Government should have more direct

control   and  to  that  extent  we  should  consider

appointing   senior  Government  servants   to   take

control,  it  was not my intention to  discredit  the

contribution  made  by  past chairmen.  I  think  the

present  Hon.  Minister for National Development  and

Communications was largely responsible  for  breaking

the  back  of the very acute shortage of  housing.  I

believe he was decorated for this and I would like to

place  that  on record. It was not the  intention  to

discredit past achievements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the other points. The Minister of

State  quoted some rather impressive figures  to  try

and convince us that the housing costs are reasonable

because they are being subsidised. First of all, why

are they subsidised? Could it be that it is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



being  run efficiently? The very substantial  figures

quoted'  by him show a turnover of $1 10 million  per

annum,  that is, $52 million revenue and $58  million

expenditure making a total turnover of $110  million,

do support my point that much greater emphasis should

be laid on the maintenance aspect and not just simply

to development. That was my point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to another point, I did express some doubts

about  how reliable statistics are as they depend  on

the  assumptions one makes. But the Minister of State

has made some assumptions now, and I am beginning  to

question his assumptions here. He stated that by 1973

only 49.2% of the people felt that the change had not

been  for  the better, and it was on account  of  the

fact  that they had moved from older estates  to  new

estates.  I  would have thought .that there  was  the

constant emphasis on qualitative improvements. Surely

second   generation  flats  are  better  than   first

generation  flats.  So  by his  own  figures,  he  is

suggesting that the second generation flats  are  not

better  than the first generation flats. It is worse,

in fact!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of coordination, there is a little

bit  of  passing the buck as regards Toa Payoh Police

Station. How about Jalan Kayu? It is a new estate.  I

talked about the traffic situation and the impact  on

the   traffic  situation,  but  that  obviously   was

overlooked. Jalan Kayu housing estate is a new estate

and not an old estate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I would like to assure the

Hon.  Member for Telok Blangah as far as his  request

for  an  assurance on those two points are concerned.

But  to  be fair to the press release issued  by  the

Ministry of National Development - I have it right in

front  of  me  -  he  mentioned  that  there  was  no

substantive suggestions given to his observation. Let

me simply quote something positive:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In cooperation with the Public Utilities Board, the

sanitary pipings are now tested before the flats  are

ballotted and any leakage is made good before handing

over the flats to the residents.'



<br><br>In  fact,  there is another paragraph  right  at  the

bottom which also answers his query. As I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



said,  if he is satisfied generally, we will stop  at

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the deregistration of that particular

vehicle,  the simple reason why I know  about  it  is

that   the  Member  had  written  to  me  about  this

particular  car, a Volkswagen, which came  up  during

his  meet-the-people session. All I am saying is that

if he can produce the deregistration certificate from

the  ROV, I can assure him that the parking fee  will

be  immediately refunded for whatever period that has

not expired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the Member for Jalan Kayu, all I

can  say is that our public housing is at the  moment

the  cheapest form of housing accommodation available

in  Singapore. I think it is because of  the  subsidy

that  land is assessed at way below the normal market

price,  and I do not intend to query or quarrel  over

the figures because they were supplied to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the qualitative aspect, I think that

where the statistics and the survey are concerned, it

merely   points  to  cleanliness.  That   means   the

maintenance of the estate as a whole is comparatively

cleaner. I do not think .- I may be wrong - that the

qualitative aspect, improvements of social  amenities

and  so on, is taken into consideration. But I  stand

to be corrected.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in view of the assurance

given  by  the  Minister of State,  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 3020*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Dr Chiang Hai Ding and Mr Chin Harn Tong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to add some points to what

many Members have already brought up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in recent years, in its efforts to

meet  the  increasing  demand  for  housing  for  our

citizens, the HDB has to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



great  extent eased the grave shortage of housing  in

our  Republic. And in the course of doing so, it  has

helped  to shape the new skyline of our island state.

These  glorious achievements of the HDB have won  for

our  country  international acclaim in  many  foreign

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, although my humble comments here in this

House will not in any way cause any weight to fall on

the  performance of the HDB, I would like to draw the

attention  of  the authorities concerned  to  certain

problems  which  are  the  end-result  of  the  rapid

resettlement of our citizens in HDB flats. This  mass

resettlement  has  created a  series  of  new  socio-economic problems in our society which, if allowed to

go on unchecked, may produce adverse repercussions on

our way of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first problem is the oft-repeated complaint

about  quarrels between neighbours over  trivialities

such as noise nuisances or of wash-drippings from the

upper floors, and insecurity of lifts. I believe  all

this  is due to a lack of self-discipline and  civic-mindedness of the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is no suitable open area for large

social  gatherings such as a wedding  function  or  a

religious ceremony. At the moment such functions  are

being  organised  in HDB car parks,  for  which  high

charges  have  to  be paid. Alternatively,  temporary

wooden  structures are erected at the  roadside,  but

these  often  obstruct the free flow of  traffic  and

cause   congestion.  Still  other  alternatives   are

available, but they too cause great inconvenience, as

mentioned by the Member for Bras Basah just now.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly. HDB shop tenants are facing a lot of

hardship,  and so do the many hawker stallholders  in

HDB market centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these problems which I have packed at random

need  to  be thoroughly studied in relation to  other

problems, and effective solutions must be found.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, if I may venture to offer two humble

suggestions to the authorities for serious

consideration, I believe they could, in the least,

contribute to an improved relationship between

residents who live cheek by jowl of one another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to establish a Special Duties Unit, headed

by a Public Relations Officer, to promote good

neighbourliness and to handle

any problems such as those I have mentioned. This

Unit should also be entrusted with a certain amount

of autonomous authority to dispel the hidden fear

among officials of retaliation or victimisation,

hence rectifying the cause of malpractice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we know that Citizens Consultative

Committees and Management Committees of Community

Centres have rendered invaluable service to the

Housing and Development Board to deal with the

problems of residents which occur every now and then.

However, members of CCC and CCMC, who are not

appointed by the HDB and therefore do not have direct

relations with the HDB, have nothing to do with them.

They feel that they can only render service to the

HDB if they are so requested. In the circumstances,

therefore, I support the view, just mentioned by the

Member for Bras Basah, that now is the right time to

consider the feasibility of setting up Residents'

Representatives Committee under the supervision of

the Special Duties Unit in the various constituencies

which have got HDB flats so as to assist the HDB in

tackling problems of residents.



The HDB was chaired by our capable Minister in the

early 1 96Os and we are fortunate that today it is

still under the charge of the same Minister, who by

this time would be more knowledgeable and more

experienced. His contribution to the task of nation-building is immeasurable. And together with the

Senior Minister of State who himself is a man of

reputable talent and calibre, there is no doubt at

all that these socio-economic problems in these

housing estates will be solved with ease and that the

HDB will continue to further develop and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>



achieve  greater success. But, Sir, I would  like  to

know  whether the Minister and his Minister of  State

share  my  views  on the problems  in  Housing  Board

estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

touring  my  constituency  on  several  occasions   I

visited  a  few blocks of one-room HDB flats,  and  I

must say that I was rather taken aback by what I have

seen.  To be fair to the HDB, the blocks of  flats  I

visited are the old types. On each floor two rows  of

flats share a common corridor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first unpleasant impression I received on

setting foot on each floor is that of entering into a

dark  tunnel. It may well be that each corridor would

be  well-lit at night. But as it was day-time and the

lights  were switched off, it took a bit of time  for

me and my friends, having stepped in from the sun, to

adjust  ourselves  to  the gloomy  condition  of  the

corridor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously the corridor was not so dark because

each  flat  had an opening near the top of  the  wall

lining  the  corridor. Because of such  openings  the

corridor  was  quite  bright. Moreover,  the  opening

allows air to circulate more freely in each flat  and

serves to ventilate the corridor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was given to understand that these apertures were

bricked-up to contain any possible outbreak  of  fire

in  any  of  the  one-room flats sharing  the  common

corridor.  If  it  is so, I would like  to  know  how

frequent  does fire break out in such one-room  flats

as  to  justify the bricking-up of such openings.  My

concern  is  that the flats were originally  designed

with  such openings to facilitate the ventilation  of

the flats and the corridor as well as to brighten  up

the  corridor during daytime. As it is, the  existing

environmental  conditions of the occupants  of  these

one-room  flats,  which must have been  the  greatest

density  of  occupants  per room  in  Singapore, are

miserable  enough without being further  worsened  by

the adoption of such measures as to the sealing up of

ventilation apertures. I hope that the HDB  can  look

into  the  matter  and  find an  alternate  means  of

containing  any  possible outbreak  of  fire  without

resorting to the drastic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



expedience of bricking-up ventilation openings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Sir, if I may be permitted to join the

debate  at this juncture. The subject raised  by  the

Member for Aljunied is very close to my heart because

there are 19 one-room blocks in Leng Kee constituency

whose  ventilation openings have just been closed  up

by  the HDB. I was told by the HDB Area Office in  my

constituency that apart from fire hazards  there  are

two  other  reasons which prompted HDB  to  implement

this.  The  first is to prevent mischievous  elements

from throwing things into the flat. The second is  to

keep away peeping Toms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree to all the reasons put forward, but one

must  also  realise that the moment these ventilation

openings  are closed up, then whatever little  cross-ventilation  that  might have  existed  before  would

automatically  be lost. I did suggest  to  the  Board

towards  the end of last year whether it was possible

to  consider replacing the glass sheet which was used

to close the opening above the door to each flat by a

set of glass louvres. Sir, all of us know that if the

Iouvres are adjusted to a correct angle of slope they

will  certainly  make  it more  difficult  for  those

mischievous elements to throw things inside.  As  far

as  peeping Toms are concerned, if they still  insist

on  peeping,  then  with a proper adjustment  of  the

Iouvres, what they could see will be only the ceiling

and  not what is going on at the floor level. I  hope

the  Minister  of State will care to comment  on  the

cost-effectiveness of the proposal I have  suggested.

If  he  says  that the glass louvres are  not  to  be

fitted because of fire hazards, perhaps he would care

to  comment  on why Iouvres are more fire-prone  than

glass sheets which they have now introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I was elated to hear the

Minister  mention  yesterday that  priority  will  be

given  to a transfer from a one-room flat to a three-room  flat, so that there will be better environment,

more space, and so on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



and  so forth. I do believe that the constituents  of

many  of  the  Members in this House are  also  amply

pleased.  We  have  a Government  policy  that  gives

priority  to a two-child family, i.e, father,  mother

and two children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will you give way to the Minister. Mr Baptist?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> May I correct the Member? I did not

say that priority will be given to application for a

transfer. I said that consideration will be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I stand corrected. A very

intelligent and Hon. Minister most certainly must  be

right.  I  must be suffering from, what is termed  by

the Ministry of Labour, noise-induced deafness.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Baptist, flattery will not help.

Will  you please carry on with what you are going  to

say?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Yes. Sir. As I was saying earlier,

the Government policy is that a two-child family will

be considered more favourably than one that has more.

I  am just wondering, all things being equal, whether

the  Hon. Minister will give preference to "Dad,  mum

and  two  children" or "Dad, mum and eight  children"

when applications for transfer are made?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, I have just one

question to ask. I want to find out from the Minister

whether  the  HDB  will allow  its  tenants  to  make

payment of PUB bills at the Board's Area offices.  At

present  private commercial banks accept  payment  of

PUB bills from the people, including HDB tenants.  If

this  can be done, why can't the Board allow the  HDB

Area  offices to accept payment of PUB bills  by  its

tenants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I merely wish

to  make a small point. I understand, and I stand  to

be  corrected, that junior employees of  the  Housing

and  Development Board such as maintenance inspectors

and the hawker liaison officers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>



etc, are not given any training at all prior to their

postings. These young employees of the Board are  raw

and  inexperienced.  They are  simply  recruited  and

posted straightaway to their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this state of affairs is rather undesirable

because  the  nature of their work brings  them  into

contact with the public frequently. My suggestion for

the  consideration of the Minister is that we  should

get  these  young  officers to undergo  an  induction

course  so as to provide them with some understanding

of  human  relationship. There are lots of complaints

about  the  way these young officers go  about  their

duties.  They  are inconsiderate, rude and  at  times

aggressive.  Something must be  done,  otherwise  the

good  image of the Government may be ruined by  these

young  officers. Sir, you may agree that it is almost

a  threat  that the HDB is fast becoming a government

within the government. Unless something is done then,

as  I  say,  the  image may be ruined.  So  the  best

solution  is  to  let  them go through  an  induction

course. If this is done, they will be more polite and

we  can  still maintain the good image that  we  have

created.  I hope these matters will be given  serious

consideration.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would just like to make two points. One concerns  the

question of one-room HDB flats. I have asked in  this

Chamber  before as to the possibility of the  Housing

Board  considering,  at  some  time  in  the  future,

pulling  down these units completely and then rebuild

new  ones  in their place. I was given the  assurance

that it would consider so. Till then, it would appear

to  me that the people living in these one-room flats

will  continue  to live in these dark  tunnels  minus

ventilation,  and  hopefully minus peeping  Toms  and

other nuisances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed appalling that in our visits to

the  one-room  flats  we  do frequently  come  across

something like eight, 10, 15 or more people  live  in

them.  I can certainly name one instance where  there

were about 23 people crowding in a one-room HDB flat.

This is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



fact.  They  were  living  on  different  layers   of

structure  put  up  within that  one  room.  This  is

certainly  an  exceptional case. I have  quoted  this

case  in  order to draw the attention of the  Housing

Board that conditions in these one-room flats can  be

appalling  and  if  these people  have  asked  for  a

transfer, they should be given priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second point which has been

raised by two of my colleagues, and that is, priority

for  a  transfer - whether transfer to a bigger  unit

should  be  given to a family of four, i.e, father,

mother  and  two  children, or to  one  of  10, i.e.

parents plus eight children. I understand that it  is

our  Government's  policy to encourage  small  family

units  but we must recognise the fact that the family

planning   policy  was  instituted  only   of   late.

Therefore,  people  whose  established  families  are

large cannot be blamed for actions for which in  many

instances they are not entirely to be blamed  or  are

responsible for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of this argument, let me say this. From our

own experience with our constituents through the meet-the-people  sessions,  we have come  across  numerous

instances  where small family units have applied  for

transfer.  Although they were following  Government's

policy, yet they were told by officers of the Housing

and  Development Board that "because your family unit

is  too small, seven and less, you do not qualify for

transfer." I am very confused and I should  certainly

appreciate  the  Minister  giving  us  some   logical

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my

Minister,  I  want  to  thank  the  Hon.  Member  for

Henderson  for  his  very kind compliments.  But  the

answer to most of his queries will be "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has correctly pointed out that the

complaints  of noise nuisance, the washdrippings  and

vandalism  of  lifts  and so  on  are  definitely  an

indication of a lack of civic responsibility  on  the

part  of  residents. In that direction there is  very

little the administration of the HDB can do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is a valid observation that there is

this  lack of a big community hall for functions, like

weddings  and so on, to be carried out. But  one  must

bear   in  mind  that  while  we  are  improving   the

facilities  in the newer estates, as I have  indicated

earlier, there must be priorities. Everybody is asking

for  facilities,  such as sports  fields  and  playing

fields.  It  is  now suggested that we should  have  a

community  hall for social activities. With  a  little

bit  of  initiative, perhaps renting  a  hall  at  the

community centre or some school hall could make-do for

the sort of function that the Member has in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is need for a little clarification

here.  When my Minister mentioned that there  was  90%

success,  he  was  referring to shops  on  the  public

tender  system, and there was no implication  of  such

success with hawker centres in housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member's query on the setting up of a

special  unit  to  promote social activities.  I  have

already stated earlier on that the answer is "no", The

reason is this. Members may be aware that the Ministry

of Home Affairs is already looking into a proposal for

the   setting  up  of  a  Block  Committee  comprising

national  servicemen and volunteers from  amongst  the

members  of the public, including members of the  CCCs

and  MCs  if  they  are available, to  assist  in  the

prevention  of crime, vandalism and other  anti-social

activities  in Housing Board estates. It is  therefore

premature  for  the  Housing  Board  to  consider  the

proposal  for  another special unit. I  would  suggest

that  we  wait for the performance of this  particular

unit  which  is being set up by the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs,  and if the need should arise we  can  always

reconsider his request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied is a bit disappointed with

the  dark  corridors  in  the housing  estate  in  his

constituency.  As  I  have earlier  pointed  out,  the

Tanjong  Rhu housing estate and the housing estate  in

his constituency belong to the older generation of one-room  flats.  I  think the only way to  convince  Hon.

Members is that, if one goes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



to  the  one-room  improved type  of  flats  at  Telok

Blangah, one can definitely see an improvement in  the

design, lighting, and so on. The main reason has  been

enunciated  by  both the Member for  Aljunied  and  my

colleague, the Member for Leng Kee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no actual cost-effectiveness of glass louvres

versus simple glass versus weld-mesh openings.  But  I

think  it  can be said that Iouvres are more expensive

If  he  is  interested.  I will  give  him  a  reading

tomorrow  on  cost-effectiveness. I think the  several

incidents of fire that had occurred in these  one-room

flats  have prompted the HDB to initiate this  action.

While  the  HDB  is  aware that substituting  concrete

blocks   for   these   weld-meshed  openings   reduces

ventilation, it  is  a necessary  precaution  against

spread of fire in these congested one-room flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we should await a serious occurrence

of fire for this to be tested. But to satisfy Members,

we  have  done an informal inquiry into the  situation

after  a few Members of Parliament have complained  to

the officers of the Area Offices. We have got a survey

which  shows  that approximately 70% of the  openings,

that   means   the   previous  weld-meshed   openings.

completely closed. In addition, some 25% to  30%  were

partially closed prior to this decision to close  them

up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some figures. In Toa Payoh East, it was

found  that  70%  or these openings  were  closed.  In

Henderson,  70%  were  totally  closed  and  25%  were

partially  closed. In Balestier. 70%  were  completely

closed  and 30% partially closed, which means  a  100%

coverage  by  the  survey. I  think  the  question  of

privacy and the nuisance of having things thrown  into

one's  flat is uppermost in the minds of the residents

as far as they are concerned. But from the HDB's point

of view, what is most important is that these openings

are definitely a fire hazard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to double check the reliability of these

statistics,  the HDB will select a block  of  one-room

flats  due  to  be completed soon and  provide  larger

openings  along the walls fronting the access corridor

to test the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



ventilation, and to observe its effectiveness  during

the next 12 to 18 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten has correctly pointed out

the  need  of  a  good public image  for  our  public

housing  programme. I think we share  his  sentiments

and, in fact, this is precisely what we are trying to

do.  I  would like to inform him that the Board  does

conduct periodically training courses for all  grades

of  officers when they first join the Board  or  some

time  after  joining the Board. Such courses  include

HDB orientation programme, and for those involved  in

finance    there    are    courses    on    financial

administration,   management   report   writing   for

executives,  training  within  industry,   and   also

courses   on   job   relations,  job   methods,   job

instruction,  courtesy  to the  public,  handling  of

public requests and how to serve the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all other organisations. HDB officers are

instructed  to be courteous and polite to members  of

the  public. But being such a large organisation with

nearly  10,000 employees, it is therefore  inevitable

that  complaints are made against some employees from

time  to  time.  But  in  all  cases  of  complaints,

investigations are thoroughly carried  out.  I  would

like to assure all Hon. Members that if they have any

specific  complaint about any particular  officer  in

any  particular area, please let me know and we  will

investigate into it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to answer the contradiction implied by the

Member  for Potong Pasir and the Member for Kim  Seng

on the two-child family concept versus a large family

of seven to 10 children. Let me first merely say that

if the observation of the Member for Kim Seng is that

there  are  23  occupants in one room, then  I  think

probably most of them are illegal immigrants. As  far

as   administrative  implementation  of  transfer  is

concerned,   where  I  am  directly  responsible   as

Chairman  of  the Allocations Committee,  discretions

are  exercised  between, say, a  seven-member  family

versus  a  family of father, mother and two children.

In  all  cases  of transfer special consideration  is

given  to the human aspect. For example, in a  family

of   seven   where  one  member  of  the  family   is

unfortunately not in a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



good  condition,  then  I  think  we  will  have   no

hesitation  in  giving preference to that  particular

family.  On the other hand, for example, if a  family

of father, mother and two children wants to apply for

a  five-room flat, when we feel that they  should  be

quite  contented  with a two-room flat,  then  unless

there is urgent reason for somebody else to have  it,

we  have  no hesitation in giving preference to  this

family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a transfer registration involved. In

other  words, we have to take into consideration  the

length  of time he has been on the waiting list.  Let

me   assure   Hon.  Members  that  while   there   is

contradiction, seemingly so, the  administration  of

the  implementation of transfer preferences  is  done

after taking all factors into consideration.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to answer the Member for Kim Seng. In the

case  of Tiong Bahru, if I am not mistaken, the  one-room  emergency flats have been knocked down  and  in

their   place  one-room  improved  flats  have   been

erected.  But  here again, the priority of  providing

more  new  HDB  flats  is  uppermost  in  our  minds,

Therefore,  priorities come into  play.  But  let  me

assure  him  that wherever there is an  urgent  need,

there will be no hesitation in knocking down the very

old  one-room emergency units with common  corridors,

and  common facilities and building the new  improved

one-room units,



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, am Ito understand

that  the Minister of State is willing to go  against

Government's policy to consider preference.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Did he say that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> He did say that he would give

consideration. It was all cloudy. He has made it very

difficult for me to try and understand him. I am just

wondering whether he could just come to the point and

state  whether  or not he is willing  to  go  against

Government's policy in administrating it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister of State has not

answered  my question on the payment of PUB bills  at

the Area Offices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Let me first answer the Member for

Delta.  The answer is no. The reason is very obvious.

In most housing estates we do provide facilities like

the Post Office Savings Bank. In some of the estates,

like  Queenstown,  there  are  also  sub-branches  of

banks.  Since they are providing all the  facilities,

theme is no justification in further loading the Area

Office by granting that request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Member for Potong Pasir could at least

appreciate the difficulties of the administrators  in

implementing  certain policies. The  Member  for  Kim

Seng has already indicated that the policy of the two-child family concept was enunciated sometime in  1972

or  1973. Frankly, in those cases where there are  10

children in a family, it is totally not applicable. I

have  indicated  that a good administrator  uses  his

discretion  and decides on the merits of  each  case.

There  is  no such thing as saying straightaway  that

there is a policy or it can be so streamlined that we

can  say effectively that this is the policy. If  the

Member     can    appreciate    the    administrative

difficulties,  then he will understand  what  I  have

been trying to say, rather than to imply that we  are

woolly and cloudy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been

excellently answered. Thank you.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I indicate to Members that we have

only about a couple of hours left for this particular

Head of Expenditure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I

crave  your  indulgence  because  judging  from   the

comments made by many Members seeking attention  from

the Housing Board for better amenities and the manner

in  which the Minister of State has answered  on  the

priorities  for  the different claims.  I  thought  I

might  as well take this opportunity, in seriousness,

to stake the claims on behalf of my residents who are

aspiring to become Housing Board flat tenants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have got the right simply because they are

living in the slums. They were the victims of a  fire

some  two  years  ago. I do not know whether  it  was

their misfortune that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



the  fire  was  quickly put out by the Fire  Brigade,

with  the result that they were allowed to remain  in

their  old houses. Only those people whose huts  were

gutted  were rehoused in Housing Board flats.  I  was

not  joking when I said it was a misfortune for them.

On  the day when the fire occurred, the victims  came

to  the community centre to get immediate relief.  No

life  was lost. In fact, there was a little look  of,

shall  I say, happiness among them because they  were

going  to be housed in beautiful Housing Board  flats

nearby.  However, a constituent in that area came  to

me  showing more frustration than the others who were

directly affected by the fire because his hut was not

gutted.  He asked me in a very frLstrated manner  why

he  was not registered by the Social Welfare team for

the allocation of a flat,



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Why did he not burn the house?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> That happened two years ago. The

land had already been acquired sometime earlier. I am

waiting  patiently for the Housing Board to  resettle

these people. The land is there for the HDB to put up

a nice, small housing estate in Ah Hood Road which is

in  my  constituency. I think my patience is  running

out.  Apart  from  the  tact that,  as  a  Member  of

Parliament.  I would like to see a better environment

in  my constituency. I think the residents there  are

also getting a little impatient. They have come to me

very regularly in my meet-the-people sessions seeking

my assistance to be rehoused because of the appalling

conditions under which they live at present. Some  of

my  fellow  Members  here have complained  about  the

conditions of the one-room flats and so on.  If  they

were  to  come to my constituency and take a look  at

the slum conditiors under which my constituents live,

they would realise that their constituents are living

in a paradise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say in seriousness that two years is already

long  enough.  They  should  be  given  top  priority

because, as somebody has suggested, there might be  a

temptation for someone from among the constituents to

make a bonfire and as a result everybody will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



be  able  to  move  out.  But unfortunately  this  is

against the law.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Housing and

Development   Board   is  sympathetic   towards   the

situation at Moulmein. In fact, the houses may be put

up faster if there was an "act of God". Anyway, a few

houses in that particular area have been acquired  by

the  Government.  I can assure him  that  the  people

there would be given alternative accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the long delay is that many areas in

Singapore  are  under clearance for development,  for

example, the Changi Airport project and other project

and other projects in the Central Area. But to me  it

is   a  reasonable  delay  because  there  are  other

residents  in  other areas who have waited  for  more

than  two years. Unfortunately, that particular  area

mentioned  is just outside the Central Area, and  we

have  not  reached  the stage  of  requiring  it  for

priority  development. Let me assure the Member  that

the  HDB  will look into this matter, and if  we  can

expedite matters we will do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

reply  by  the  Minister of State.  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 4001*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Hwang Soo Jin.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resettlement is very unpleasant, and the task of

resettlement is also unpleasant. Nobody likes  to  be

resettled from where they have been staying for many,

many  years, with the exception of perhaps  the  slum

dwellers  in  Moulmein.  Few  officers  like  to   be

Resettlement  Officers  or  even  to  work   in   the

Resettlement  Department. By and  large,  the  people

with  whom these Resettlement Officers have to  deal,

are   antagonistic  and  feel  that  they  have  been

aggrieved. It is, therefore, very essential that  the

officers  working  in  this department  are  properly

orientated  and have the right attitude  to  do  this

unpleasant work. In their dealings with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



people who are affected by resettlement, they must be

tactful and polite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When resettlement of a locality is decided, the

officers of the Department will first go to the  area

to  make a survey and take a census of the residents.

The  affected  residents are  concerned  about  their

future   and   make  enquiries  from   the   officers

conducting the survey. If, at this initial stage, the

officers  explain the reasons and the plans that  the

Department  has  for resettling the residents, then.

not  only will their job be made easier, but it  will

also  reduce friction that invariably arises. In many

instances, even  the Member of  Parliament  for  the

constituency  in  which a census is being  taken  for

resettlement purposes is not aware until  a  hue  and

cry  is  made  by the residents. Officers  from  this

Department  have  been  known to  tell  the  affected

residents  that they are going to be  chased  out  in

three  months' time. When asked where they were going

to  be resettled, they were told. "Find out from  the

office"  or  "Go  and see your MP"  when  the  MP  is

completely in the dark.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to do this unpleasant task is not easy. It can

be  made  easier  if  the officers  are,  as  I  said

earlier,  properly orientated towards their work  and

the Member of Parliament is taken into confidence and

informed  of the nature of resettlement and the  need

for such resettlement before conducting a survey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also desirable that the period between taking

a  census and the resettlement is not dragged on  and

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is here that the Member for Moulmein has

made  his point. Two years after the census has  been

taken, they are still waiting to be moved out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the

debate  last year. I recall bringing to the attention

of the House the fact that MPs were not kept informed

of  imminent resettlement affecting their  particular

constituencies. This is a point which has  been  made

by  the  Member  for Telok Blangah. Whilst  the  then

Minister  did promise that all MP5 affected would  in

future  be  informed in advance, I regret  to  report

that the situation







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



has  not really improved. It is difficult for  me  to

draw  any conclusion beyond saying that words  spoken

by Hon. Ministers in this House are perhaps not taken

that   seriously  by  the  civil  servants!   Thanks,

however, to the present Senior Minister of State  who

has  crossed over from this side of the House  fairly

recently  and is perhaps, therefore, better  able  to

appreciate the plights of Backbenchers, and I hope he

will remain that way; some of my difficulties in  the

past  year have been made a little easier as a result

of  assistance  extended by him from  time  to  time.

However,  Sir, from a procedural point of view  I  do

not  think  it is such a good idea that  Minister  or

Minister of State should be unduly burdened with work

resulting   from   the  day  to  day   administrative

inadequacy  or  inefficiency. These anomalies  should

more  properly  be  resolved by introducing  suitable

procedures,   Admittedly.   Sir,   the   Resettlement

Department has done well in moving people,  otherwise

we  would not have half of Singapore staying  in  HDB

flats today. But I do wonder, judging by the way they

go  about  chasing  out people, as mentioned  by  the

Member  for  Telok  Blangah, whether  they  have  not

become insensitive to human feelings or sufferings or

perhaps  they  are taking for granted extremely  good

cooperation   we  have  from  the  people   in   this

particular regard.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Jalan Kayu is one constituency which is

fortunately   or  unfortunately  catching   up   with

progress,  which  means the presence of  resettlement

officers  during  the  last 12  months.  For  several

months  now, at my regular meet-the-people  sessions,

an   increasing  number  of  cases  of   resettlement

problems have been referred to me. In the majority of

such  cases  it is quite clear to me that  inadequate

explanations  or guidance have been  given  to  these

people,   particularly  on  the  question  of   their

eligibility   for   alternative  accommodation.   The

slightest  ambiguity or inconsistency  found  on  the

identity cards of affected family members immediately

disqualify them from alternative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



housing.  In  the  majority  of  such  cases  if  the

Department  concerned  can be  bothered  to  spend  a

little  time it should not be too difficult for  them

to  find  out  the correct answer as to  whether  the

people  are eligible or not eligible. The only advice

the Department appears to be able to give in all such

cases  is  that the families concerned  must  produce

documentary  proof, without indicating what  type  of

documents will be considered as acceptable proof.  In

desperation many people spent time and money to  take

out  statutory declarations, only to be  rejected  as

soon as they are submitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In resettlement there is such thing as cutoff

dates,  which is the date decided by the Resettlement

Department  to  determine a person's eligibility  for

alternative  housing. If he moves into  the  affected

area  prior to the cut-off date, he will be  eligible

for  alternative housing; on the other  hand,  if  he

moves  into the area after the cut-off date, he  will

not  be given alternative housing. How and when  this

date  is  fixed for a particular affected area  often

puzzles me. And not only the public, but even MPs are

not  kept  informed of the cut-off date  in  advance.

This  has resulted in a number of instances of people

unknowingly moving into an affected area  and,  after

paying tea money and incurring expenses to move  into

their new homes, only to find that they have to start

house-hunting again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The apparent insensitivities of the Department are

best  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  some  of  the

affected families were asked to move out even  during

the  Chinese  New Year period. Until a complaint  was

lodged  by me and very kindly taken up by the  Senior

Minister of State, the Department was in the habit of

summoning  affected  families  to  appear  in   court

presumably  to psychologically intimidate  them  into

moving. Sir, this sort of strong-arm tactic is, to my

mind,  quite unnecessary as by now our citizens  have

come to accept the fact that if Singapore is to go on

progressing  they must cooperate. For Jalan  Kayu.  I

can  assure  you,  Sir, out of  several  hundreds  of

affected   families  there  was  only  one   isolated

instance of an old lady who came to tell me that she



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



did  not  wish  to move but subsequently,  I  gather.

better  sense  prevailed  and  she  moved  out   like

everybody else. Sir, as pointed out by the Member for

Telok  Blangah earlier, it is a traumatic  experience

for  people who have lived in a particular place  all

their lives to wake up one morning to find that  they

have  to move out. When they are suffering the mental

anguish and making all the necessary preparations  to

move to a new and strange environment, the very least

the Department can do is to be sympathetic and not to

further  aggravate their difficulties.  From  what  I

have  seen  and heard of the work of the Resettlement

Department, I am not satisfied that they  have  taken

this into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now. Sir, to the question of exgratia

compensation for licensees of State lands, there  are

also  many inexplicable and what appear to me  to  be

unfair practices. Indeed many examples were quoted by

Hon.  Members  yesterday. For  instance,  people  are

often  asked to vacate without being told  the  exact

quantum  of  compensation.  For  those  involved   in

farming,   according  to  the  announced  policy   of

Government,  they  will  receive  compensation  at  a

higher  rate. However, the assessment appears  to  be

done  somewhat  arbitrarily. Once the Department  has

decided  that a person is not a so-called  bona  fide

farmer,  there are no means by which the  person  may

appeal.  I  did take up a few cases on behalf  of  my

constituents, but sad to say, the answer in all cases

was  in  the negative. Until yesterday when the  Hon.

Minister and Senior Minister of State enlightened the

House, everybody was in the dark as to the definition

of  a  "bona  fide farmer". Consequently. Sir,  there

have   been  no  guidelines  to  work  on  for  those

dissatisfied parties intending to appeal. Now we  are

told  a  bona fide farmer is one who keeps  not  less

than 3.000 head of poultry or 100 pigs. Sir, from the

point  of considering the eligibility for alternative

farm land, the criteria adopted may be acceptable but

I  do  not  think the same set of criteria should  be

applied to compensation. There are many small  timers

who  keep less than 3,000 head of poultry or 100 pigs

but  they  are  nevertheless  genuine  farmers  fully

dependent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



on  farming as a livelihood. There are many more  who

may  be  partially dependent but without  the  income

from  farming  to  supplement their family  earnings,

their livelihood can become precarious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel strongly, Sir, from the point of compensation

that a separate set of criteria should be worked out.

The  extent  of dependence rather than  the  size  of

operation  should  be  a  more  equitable  basis  for

awarding compensation. Is it not possible to  have  a

sliding   scale  of  compensation  so  that   persons

partially   dependent   will   nevertheless   receive

compensation  at  the enhanced rate proportionate  to

the percentage of their dependence on farming?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang, your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I am about to finish. From

the  number of examples cited by me, Sir, I  am  sure

you  will  agree  that these are  not  problems  that

cannot  be resolved by establishing proper procedures

and   guidelines  and,  above  all,  a  rather   more

sympathetic and human approach on the part  of  those

involved in resettlement work.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on this amendment. I have two  matters

to raise for the consideration of the Senior Minister

of  State.  I  have received written complaints  from

those who are affected by resettlement that they  are

not  given  alternative shop premises, and  therefore

they  are  not  able  to make a living  because  they

depend on their business for a living. Now that  they

are  asked  to  quit, without given alternative  shop

premises, how are they going to make a living?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also complaints that when they were asked

to   leave,   the  officials  from  the  Resettlement

Department  told them that they would get alternative

shop  premises  very soon. However, today, after  a

lapse  of one or two years, they are still without  a

shop  and so they are suffering unnecessary hardship.

If  there is some truth in their allegation.  I  feel

that  the  resettlement officers have been less  than

honest in their dealings with the people affected  by

resettlement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is about the widening of a road in

Sembawang area. I would like the Minister to tell  us

how many people are affected by this scheme, and what

will the Government do to help those affected by  the

road  widening project? As an MP for that area, I  am

naturally concerned with their problems. I would like

the Minister to direct his officers to solve any such

problem  in a proper way so that the people  affected

by this project can be given assistance so that their

hardship can be alleviated.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me give a brief picture

of  the  Resettlement Department so that Hon. Members

can understand why resettlement officers who go round

resettling people or taking census really do not know

themselves  what the actual programme of resettlement

is.   The   Resettlement   Department   carries   out

resettlement  of families in affected  areas  at  the

request  of  the  various  Government  Ministries  or

statutory  bodies.  The Jurong Town  Corporation  can

request  the Resettlement Department to clear certain

areas.  Similarly, the  URA,  the  HDB  itself,  the

Ministry  of Communications, etc, No reason is  given

except  that  that particular area has been  gazetted

for  acquisition as the land is required for a public

purpose.  This  means that the resettlement  officers

themselves  do  not know what kind of development  is

going  to take place in that particular area.  So  do

not  blame them if they honestly say that they really

do  not know. If any Hon. Member should feel strongly

that  they  have to know what the area will  be  used

for, then the best thing is for him to find out which

particular  Ministry or statutory body  is  acquiring

that area and inquire directly from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The staff of the Resettlement Department, as

indicated   by  the  Hon.  Member,  faces  tremendous

problems.  Nevertheless, they are told to be  patient

and  courteous  towards the public at all  times.  We

have  heard in the House that it takes both sides  to

exercise  good relationship. Some people who  receive

resettlement  notices  adopt  a  resentful  and  even

hostile attitude towards resettlement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



officers, and that is admitted. But I believe, by and

large,   working   in  such  a  stressing   situation

resettlement officers generally have performed  their

duties reasonably well. But nevertheless I can assure

all Hon. Members here that if they have complaints of

rudeness  or  are unhappy over certain activities  of

these  officers,  then do let  us  know  so  that  an

investigation can be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah queried about the need

to  conduct  a census survey, His suggestion  that  a

census survey on resettlement cases be conducted only

when  alternative accommodation is available  is  not

practical.  Census  survey of resettlement  squatters

has  to commence in advance because the magnitude  of

the problem has first to be ascertained and provision

made   for  alternative  accommodation.  Furthermore,

sufficient time is required to examine the squatters'

eligibility,  to  process the  improvement  on  their

land,  to compute the quantum of compensation payable

and to comply with all the legal formalities such  as

serving notices to quit, etc,



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has I think brought up a

number  of  points. First, let me deal directly  with

his  query on the cut-off date. The main object of  a

cut-off  date  is  obviously to prevent  unscrupulous

owrers  of buildings or structures on State  land  or

HDB  land  due  for clearance from  selling  them  to

unsuspecting  persons at perhaps  exorbitant  prices.

This  also  prevents some members of the public  from

cashing  in  for priority of HDB flats by paying  out

tea  money to owners of structures os~ these acquired

sites.  The  Board has actually issued several  press

statements informing the general public of what these

rulings  are.  The  date of Gazette  notification  is

taken  as the cut-off date for eligibility in respect

of  private land compulsorily acquired by Government.

In  respect of State or HDB land, the cut-off date is

the first day of taking of census by the Resettlement

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained just now why it is not always

possible  for the Resettlement Department  to  inform

Members   of  Parliament  in  advance.  As  I   said,

sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



resettlement officers themselves do not know the nature  of

development.  Sometimes  it  is  necessary   to   keep   it

confidential where the position of the land is uncertain. I

hope  Members  can  appreciate  the  point.  However,   the

Department  has  made  it a rule to inform  the  Member  of

Parliament  of  the respective constituency  in  which  the

relevant  site  is  located of any  impending  resettlement

action  before the field staff are sent out  to  conduct  a

census  survey. I think those rural Members  of  Parliament

can  vouch  that  they are informed and  that  we  do  send

officers to help during the period of difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last change of residential address on the identity

card  before  the cut-off date will be taken as  conclusive

evidence   of   the  displaced  person's  eligibility   for

resettlement  benefits. However, in  borderline  cases  the

Resettlement   Department  has  accepted   other   official

documents such as TOL, income tax returns, birth  or  death

certificate, vaccination or inoculation certificate,  radio

or  TV  licence, driving licence, or any other evidence  to

suggest  physical occupation of the site before the cut-off

date. However, arising from such complaints of Members, the

Resettlement Department is now drawing up a list of what we

call  "official  documents" which can be  accepted  by  the

Resettlement Department as evidence of residence. In future

this  list will be attached to the clearance notices served

on all displaced persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next query the Member mentioned is about the ex-gratia compensation payable to people affected by the

various land acquisition or development projects. The rates

were  last reviewed in 1975 and the revised rates were made

known to the general public through the mass media. At this

juncture  it  is  worthwhile to clear the  misunderstanding

over  the  definition of bona fide farmers yesterday.  This

arose from a query by the Member for Punggol when he talked

about  land  allocation and the criterion of  100  pigs  or

3.000  head  of poultry. To clear, once and for  all,  this

implication that there are no criteria and that the Primary

Production  Department arbitrarily decides who  is  a  bona

fide farmer and who is not. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



shall give Members all the criteria used so that there will

not  be  any future queries as to what is this and what  is

that, if they can put up with me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into that, let me say that the bona fide

status of a displaced farmer is determined by the staff  of

the  Resettlement Department on certain guidelines provided

by  the  PPD.  As the current resettlement policy  provides

enhanced   resettlement  benefits  for  displaced  farmers,

including   higher   rates   of   ex-gratia   payment    of

compensation, payment of a cash grant or a free  three-room

flat  in  lieu  of land allocation, all cases  have  to  be

referred  to  the  Department  of  Primary  Production  for

examination and verification. There is a panel  chaired  by

the  Director  of  Primary Production to review  all  these

cases.  In  fact, if any particular squatter or settler  is

unhappy  over  any decision taken, he can  appeal  to  this

Panel,  which  comes  directly  under  the  charge  of  the

Director  of  PPD.  If the Panel should  rule  against  the

appeal of this squatter or settler, he can take it one step

further   by   appealing  to  the  Ministry   of   National

Development,  which has the final authority over  the  PPD.

The  Panel has in the past reexamined many cases of  appeal

and  I  shall  later give Members very brief statistics  to

show  that  many  cases  were  settled  in  favour  of  the

appellant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think the term "bona fide farmer" is a

misnomer. After today's debate, it is our intention to tell

the  PPD  to  stop using the term "bona fide farmer".  This

term  "bona  fide  farmer"  has been  used  to  describe  a

situation   for   enhanced  compensation  as   resettlement

benefits.  The  present definition of a  bona  fide  farmer

means  anybody or any farmer who is engaged in any  farming

activity  to the extent of any of the following  "criteria"

(since there was implication that there were no criteria):



<br><br>Livestock farming:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pigs 25 heads, poultry 1,000 tieads.



<br><br>Vegetable farming:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of leafy vegetables, if you have an area of 1,800 sq. ft.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cultivated area of 1,800 sq. ft. of water cress

and 3,600 sq. ft. of other leafy vegetables.



<br><br>Fruit farming:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 durian trees or 40 rambutan trees, or an

equivalent number of similar type of fruit trees.



<br><br>Orchid growing:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orchids and flowers cultivated over an area of 10,000 sq. ft.



<br><br>Fish farming:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1� acres of pond fish-breeding. Aquarium fish 7,200

sq. ft. tank area. This means the surface area  of

the   fish   tank  not  the  area  of  the  farmer's

particular estate. Aquarium plants 5,000 sq. ft. of

cultivated area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of queries on borderline cases.

For instance, if a farmer has only 20 pigs, we do not

straightaway eliminate his eligibility. We  will  try

and  re-define  his case based on  a  combination  of

factors.  If  he  has only 20 pigs and  800  head  of

poultry, we might define him as a poultry farmer.  Or

if he has a combination of any of these factors, say.

10 durian trees, 10 pigs and 500 head of poultry, the

flexibility  of this Resettlement Panel may  rule  in

his  favour.  All the factors are spelt out  in  this

list here. In other words, the assessment of criteria

for  a  bona fide farmer is actually fairly generous.

These criteria have been effectively implemented from

1971/72 and it has not been made public because  this

has   all   along  been  an  internal  administrative

procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to what was discussed yesterday on the

recommendation  of  alternative land  allocation  for

resettlement cases. This is the point when  we  began

to  talk about the bona fide of farmers, and we  said

that  a  farmer must have 100 pigs or 3,000  head  of

poultry. In fact, he might be given half an  acre  of

land if he farms to this extent. So it goes down  the

line:  if  he  has  1,051 pigs  and  15,001  head  of

poultry, he will be given two acres of land. There is

a  table of figures here that gives the whole  range,

Therefore, the consideration of all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



these  cases of whether an ordinary bcna fide  farmer

belongs  to  this  category  which  is  eligible  for

enhanced compensation or to another category which is

eligible  for  land allocation, is processed  by  the

Resettlement Panel chaired by the Director of Primary

Production. I have indicated to Members that they can

appeal to this Panel and if they are still not  happy

they  can  go  straight to the Ministry  of  National

Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members some idea of how this

compensation   is  paid.  This  had  been   discussed

yesterday.  The  ex-gratia  compensation  awarded  to

these farming cases ("farming case" means farmers  as

defined by the Department). Those who find their  own

accommodation will be paid exgratia compensation  for

their  house  and other improvements at the  enhanced

rate.  "Enhanced rate" means the new rate revised  on

1st April, 1975. In addition to this compensation,  he

is   given  a  cash  grant  of  $11,800  in  lieu  of

alternative  accommodation or, if he  so  prefers,  a

three-room improved flat in a New Town is  given  for

free. For those recommended for land allocation, that

means  those  who  qualify for land  allocation,  ex-gratia  compensation will be paid for his  house  and

other  improvements but at the lesser  rate.  "Lesser

rate" means the rate before the revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an example of what I mean by "lesser

rate"  and "enhanced rate". There is a difference  of

approximately 30% to 50%, Compensation  for  a  house

and  a kitchen with concrete floor and drain, at  the

enhanced  rate  will  be $7.50 per  sq, ft.  At  the

ordinary  rate,  that means he is  entitled  to  land

allocation  but  is  still paid a  compensation,  the

compensation will be at the lower rate of  $4.50  per

sq, ft. On top of this, those squatters who were  on

the  land  when the census was taken will be entitled

to  some compensation based on the ordinary rate, and

they  will  be  given priority as far as  rental  and

purchase  of  HDB  flats  are  concerned.  In   fact,

families affected by clearance are given priority for

rehousing  in HDB flats with a rental rebate  of  $15

per  month  for  a  period of three  years.  If  they

purchase  a  HDB flat the downpayment is  reduced  to

$100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other form of alternative accommodation given

for  those  affected  will  be  shophouses.  In  this

respect  my Minister has indicated the rising  rental

formula  which means that during the first  year  the

tenant  pays 50% of what the commercial value is  and

it  goes  up  in subsequent years to the end  of  the

fifth  year, that is, on the sixth year, the  tenant

pays the full rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all this has helped to clarify the doubt as

to  whether  or  not one is or is  not  a  bona  fide

farmer.  The  best is to find out whether  one  is  a

farmer  or  not.  If  one  qualifies  under  all  the

definitions that I have given Members, then one is  a

farmer.  If  one is a farmer then one is entitled  to

choose  the type of compensation: land allocation  or

monetary compensation. But whichever one chooses,  in

addition  to  land allocation, one  gets  a  monetary

compensation based on either the revised higher  rate

or  the  ordinary lower rate. To give  some  figures,

this  Resettlement  Panel has  since  1971  made  the

following decisions.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, 18% or 49 cases of farmers were allocated

land.  142 cases or 52% of farmers were not allocated

land,  and  only  29.7% did not  qualify  as  farming

cases.  The total number of cases for 1974 is 272  to

make  it  100%.  In  1975, 21% of  the  farmers  were

allocated  land.  49.5%  of  the  farmers  were   not

allocated  land, and there were 29.6% of non-farmers.

If  you  add up, the total number of farmers in  1974

and 1975 comes within the region of almost 80%. So it

is  not  true  to  say  that the  Primary  Production

Department  uses its whims and fancies to  decide  on

cases.  There  are proper procedures  and  these  are

being   followed  and, in  fact,  there  are  proper

channels  of  assessment.  I  would  like  to  assure

Members  from the rural areas that if they want  more

information on this I could supply them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, may I be permitted to press

the point about those who are partially dependent. As

I mentioned, the scale of operation is perhaps not as

important  as the degree of dependence. A farmer  may

be rearing 10 pigs and 50



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



chickens or 500 chickens, the fact is that 60% to 70%

of the family's income is still dependent on farming.

But  under the Ministry's set of criteria,  he  would

not  get the enhanced rate, and these are the  people

who are going to suffer more when they are resettled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Minister  of State has not answered the question  why

the  farmers who are affected by clearance should  be

summoned to court. Just now the Member for Jalan Kayu

also  queried this point. This seems to be a kind  of

threat  or  a  psychological  intimidation.  Can   we

abolish such procedures?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, if some of this

information  had  been given to the rural  MPs  whose

constituencies have been affected, then it would have

saved  them a lot of trouble coming to this House  to

discuss at great length the definition of "bona  fide

farmer".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State mentioned that the enhanced

rate  of  ex gratia compensation is very generous.  I

would  like  to  ask  him whether a  farming  family,

moving into a HDB flat, would be able to maintain and

continue  to  subsist  with  the  enhanced  rate   of

compensation.  In  other words, I  believe  that  the

question of the endangerment to their livelihood  has

not been taken into account.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there has been a lot of controversy

over  this question of whether a tarmer is bona  fide

or  not  bona fide. My view is that the mistake  lies

with  the  Primary  Production  Department.  The  PPD

issues  a farming certificate to every farmer. Later,

when resettlement is carried out, the PPD will say to

those  affected farmers, "You are a bona fide farmer"

or "You are not a bona fide farmer".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider whether there

could  be  some restriction on the issue  of  such  a

farming  certificate.  If  they  are  not  bona  fide

farmers,  then the Department should not  issue  them

with  farming  certificates. Then when  they  produce

these certificates on resettlement we should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



follow  the  procedure laid down by the PPD  and  pay

them  compensation accordingly. Only in this way  can

we solve the problem. Otherwise, one department under

the  Ministry  of National Development will  issue  a

licence   to  a  person  to  carry  on  his   farming

activities  only  to be denied, on  resettlement,  by

another  department under the same  Ministry  when  a

demand for compensation is lodged, that he is  not  a

bona fide farmer. To the farmers, this appears to  be

a  deliberate  attempt by the Government  to  extract

money   from  them  by  manipulating  the  situation.

Therefore,   this   problem  should   merit   serious

attention.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng hang:</b> Sir, let me first answer the

Member  for  Bukit Panjang. A little history  of  the

licensing of farmers will help him to understand  the

situation. In the earlier days, or even today, when a

person  applies  for a farming licence  there  is  no

insistence that he must have a minimum number of pigs

or  poultry.  That means, we take it at  face  value.

When  he  comes  to tell me that he  wants  to  be  a

farmer,  I am in no position to say whether he  is  a

small-time  farmer  or a big-time  farmer.  One  only

assumes that he is engaged in farming activities.  He

may  have  a  farming licence but he does no  farming

activity at all. That is his privilege. We issue  him

with a farming licence on the presumption that he  is

going into farming. Many of them have probably folded

up, but they still call themselves farmers. So there

is  no  correlation between possession of  a  farming

licence  and  a bona fide farmer that I have  defined

just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take his suggestion that

perhaps what we should do is before issuing a licence

to  any  person we say. "To get this farming licence.

you must have a minimum number of so many pigs and so

many  head  of  poultry".  I  will  get  the  Primary

Production Department to look into this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the query from the Member for Jurong on

notices  to quit, I hope it is appreciated that  this

is  definitely  not done to threaten the  farmers.  I

have explained very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



quickly just now to the Member for Jalan Kayu that it

is a legal requirement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I think the Member for

Jurong  was  referring to the summons  to  appear  in

court.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, let me first explain why

there  is  a  need  to  issue this  notice.  We  have

initiated an arrangement whereby if a person does not

want  to go to court, he signs a warranty to say that

he  is  giving  up the piece of land. This  is  being

implemented,  and I think the Member for  Jalan  Kayu

can  vouch that this is being done. If there  is  any

difficulty in that direction, I will be very happy to

help out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the Members for Jalan Kayu and

Punggol.  I  have indicated that there is  a  set  of

criteria -. 25 pigs and 1.000 head of poultry, and so

on. I have also indicated that in borderline cases  a

combination  of  factors is used to help  define  the

position  of  a  particular farmer. But  again,  like

anything  else,  when discretions are exercised,  the

computation  must be within reason.  For  example,  a

person  may  depend  on two pigs  and  10  layers  to

supplement  his  income by selling the  eggs  to  his

neighbours,  but  the  Primary Production  Department

cannot  take that into consideration. So I am  trying

to  impress  upon Members that there  are  limits  to

exercising discretion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already given Members the other two

extremes.  If  a  person  keeps  23  pigs  and   some

chickens, we  may say that he is  a  farmer.  But  a

person  who keeps four pigs and 20 chickens, we  say

that   that  is  incidental;  it  is  not  a  farming

activity.  But we do not penalise him. We still  give

him  compensation and priority for a three-room flat.

My  Minister  has also indicated yesterday  that  two

rural  centres  will  be  set  up  in  the  midst  of

intensive  pig  farming activi:ies. If  a  person  is

deprived  of a livelihood, he can always  get  a  job

because  it  is  a fact that labour  for  farming  is

extremely hard to get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is only fair that I answer the Member

for  Sembawang  who  has queried some  activities  of

resettlement  in Sembawang. The shopkeepers  affected

by the widening of Sembawang Road will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



offered  shop  premises in Ang Mo Kio New Town,  which  are

expected to be completed by about the middle of this  year.

The  Housing  Board  will also build a shopping  centre  at

Sembawang  Road. 19th Km., for the relocation  of  some  of

these   affected  shopkeepers.  This  shopping  centre   is

expected to be ready in the second quarter of 1977 and will

comprise 40 shops and five eating houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third question is: how many shops are affected? The

answer  is: 41 shops are currently affected by the widening

of Sembawang Road, stretching from Sembawang Hill Circus to

Jalan  Sembawang  Kechil.  In the Sembawang  Road  widening

scheme, of the 333 cases affected, 37 families  have  been

offered  flats  at Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh New  Towns  and

another 23 families will be balloting for flats at  Ang  Mo

Kio at the end of this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Sembawang asked whether the

Resettlement  Department will give priority for  allocation

of HDB accommodation to squatters affected by clearance. If

at  the  time  of census the squatters were there.  I  have

indicated  just  now that they will be offered  alternative

accommodation.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, one short query in respect of

resettlement. We have gone from resettlement to farming, to

road  widening  and  so  on. Sir, I appreciate  that  there

should   be  a  cut-off  date  in  respect  of  census   of

resettlement cases. Keeping it a secret before the  cut-off

date  is  understandable so as to prevent the  movement  of

people  and so on. But what is the objection of publicising

the cut-off date after it has passed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I have indicated that Members of

Parliament are being informed of the cut-off date.  I  have

also indicated just now the cut-off dates in respect of two

situations.  There  is no reason why  M  Ps  could  not  be

informed  of  the  cut-off  date.  After  all, it  is  not

confidential.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I have a heavy resettlement

problem  in Telok Blangah and I was never informed  of  the

cut-off date.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



However, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think it is a good time to take the

Suspension now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and

took the Chair of the House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and shall take

the Chair again at 5.45 p.m.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.45 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head O - (cont.) --



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10

in respect of item lal of subhead BBA 2190.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I originally wanted to touch on the work of the

committee set up to coordinate the laying down of utilities

along the roads. But that matter has already been raised in

the  discussion on the Minister's Head of Expenditure.  All

the  same,  we  might remember that last  year  during  the

Budget  sitting  the Minister for National Development  did

mention that he was shocked to learn of the fact that about

80% of our roads would be dug up during the financial year,

that  is, the financial year that is just coming to an end.

Under   such  circumstances, obviously  the  question   of

coordination just does not seem feasible. However, we might

express the hope now that when this large-scale development

is  over, that is, the laying of utilities on such a  large

scale  is completed, the committee will once more be  in  a

position  to  coordinate road digging to  lay  down  public

utilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, there is no doubt that looking over the

Estimates for the past five or six years, we find  that  an

enormous amount of money and effort are being spent on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



maintenance  and  extension of our  road  network  in

Singapore.  In  fact, when we look  at  the  detailed

statement  of  the estimated and actual expenditures,

we  might rightfully conclude that the Roads  Section

is  getting on with the job of using funds  allocated

for  this  general purpose. At the same time,  it  is

possible that, looking at the Establishment position,

one  may  ask  whether there is such  a  shortage  of

staff,  especially  at  the technical  level,  as  to

affect  the smooth accomplishment of road maintenance

and development plans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few possible indicators that may suggest

one or two problems. First, having to travel for some

reason  along Mandai Road quite frequently, I  notice

that the roadwork there has taken a very long time to

proceed. In fact, for a spell the metal laid down  at

the road side was overgrown with grass and shrubbery.

There may be similar instances of delay in respect of

other road repair or development projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with regard to road surfaces, one notices

the   different  shades  of  mixture,   texture   and

consistency  of the mix laid on for the surfacing  or

resurfacing.  This  gives  the  impression  that  the

standards in respect of the quality of road surfacing

are  not  consistent. It is possible that supervision

is not as effective as it should be, resulting in the

contractors getting away with shoddy work  and  other

irregularities of this kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if I may just refer to a development

project  to  illustrate my point. When examining  the

Pan-Island  Express Way scheme between  Thomson  Road

and Jalan Anak Bukit, one might gather the impression

that  work  could have been concentrated  on  certain

segments  and  if these segments are completed,  then

they   could  be  used  and  the  effects   of   such

development   felt   and  enjoyed  immediately.   For

example,  the alternative routes thus provided  could

result  in  improved traffic conditions  and  greater

convenience  to the public. But instead  one  gathers

the impression of scattered work being carried out at

different points of the Thomson Road/Jalan Anak Bukit

project resulting in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



effort   being   diffused   and   the   effects   not

concentrated.   This  may  point   to   problems   of

organisation   in  respect  of  roadwork   and   road

maintenance.   I  would  appreciate  the   Minister's

response to these comments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, SIr, the Public Works

Department  does suffer from a shortage of  technical

staff. The Minister for Finance has indicated in  his

Budget Statement that there is an excessive usage  of

technical staff in certain Government departments. If

the  Member could persuade the Minister for  Finance,

we may perhaps be able to get the required staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's question about the Pan-Island Express Way, let me assure him that, as far as

the organisation of roadworks is concerned, a project

is   first   thoroughly   examined   before   it   is

implemented, and there is a purpose in tackling  each

segment  of the roadworks separately. I can give  him

that assurance. The completed stretch of the roadwork

from  Adam  Road  to  Jalan Anak Bukit  is  the  only

segment  of the Pan-Island Express Way which  is  not

open  to  traffic. This particular stretch  is  being

constructed in three phases. The stretch completed in

Phase  I is, to use the technical term, Chainage  335

metres  from  Adam  Road  to Chainage  3,350  metres.

adjacent to the Singapore Turf Club. The construction

works  under  Phases II and III are now in  progress.

These two slip roads connecting Adam Road to the Pan-Island  Express Way are under construction  and  they

are  expected  to be completed by the  end  of  April

1976. In order to open to traffic the segment of  the

road  constructed under Phase I, the only  connection

to Dunearn Road would be through Hillcrest Road which

would not be appropriate as this would give rise to a

great   deal   of  traffic  through  a   very   quiet

residential area. Phase II covers a stretch  of  road

from the Singapore Turf Club to Jalan Anak Bukit  and

the  road work is due for completion in August  1976.

The  whole  stretch  of  the Pan-Island  Express  Way

would, therefore, be open to traffic in August 1976.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked why there is so much delay in the

completion of some projects, for example, the one  in

Mandai Road. There are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



numerous  factors affecting the early completion  of  road

projects.  They could generally be summarised as  follows.

Land acquisition is one of the problems. Then there is the

problem  of  clearing the squatters,  the  laying  of  new

utility  services  and the resiting of existing  services.

Finally, as has been correctly observed, there are certain

contractors  who do give poor performance and,  therefore,

progress  has been slow. In the case of Mandai  Road,  the

slow  progress  is  due mainly to the  difficulty  in  its

construction work. To alleviate flooding, the new road has

to be constructed at a higher level than the existing one.

The new road also overlaps part of the old road. The other

factor  is the heavy traffic especially during the morning

and evening peak hours. The contracted date for completion

is supposed to be 15th April, 1976. But owing to the above

reasons  it  would  be delayed by a month.  Completion  is

expected in May 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly reply to his query with regard to the

road surfaces and the implication that work is perhaps not

up  to  standard.  Resurfacing of roads is  normally  done

every  five  or six years. Whenever there is an additional

surface laid, there are different degrees of settlement. I

do  not wish to get involved in too much technical detail.

I  would merely say that once a road is dug up for  laying

certain  services, the surface is affected  by  subsequent

settlement of the soil back-fill. That means, as the  road

is  filled, there are different degrees of settlement  and

this  gives  rise to the different colours. The settlement

may be fresh or fresh bitumen may have been mixed with the

older  soil, and so on. These factors are fairly technical

in  nature. Sometimes, owing to settlement problems  there

will  be unevenness in road surfaces. But normally, given

time  they  will  be rectified. Once the earth  below  the

surface  is allowed to settle, the PWD will resurface  the

road. That means it will keep on filling until the surface

comes up to the original level again. What I am trying  to

say  is  that this is not due to poor supervision or  poor

workmanship,  but  rather  the  nature  of  the  technical

requirement in constructing roads.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am very satisfied with the answer.

I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 8201*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs L. P. Rodrigo, Teong Eng Siong, Lee Yiok Seng, Ho Kah Leong and Ch'ng Jit Koon.)





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the loan given by the Government to the Housing and

Development Board for FY 76 is $74 million more  than  the

previous   financial  year.  I  believe  that  with   this

increased  allocation the HDB will be able to  build  more

flats  and  more  speedily this  year.  The  residents  in

Kampong  Ubi  are affected by resettlement  and  they  are

experiencing endless problems of living in an  environment

with  broken  pipes,  flooding, mosquitoes, etc.  Various

difficulties are being confronted by them as a  result  of

the  development now in progress in Kampong Ubi I hope the

Ministry  of  National  Development  would  give   serious

attention to this constituency so that flats could be made

available  to them as early as possible. When I  say  that

the  flats should be made available immediately. I do  not

mean  that  the flats should be accepted as  completed  if

they  are still unsatisfactorily done, as has been pointed

out by many Members in this House earlier. I hope priority

can  be  given  to  this matter so that  the  construction

project in Kampong Kembangan can be expedited.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as has been pointed out by the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan, there is provision under this  subhead

to  spend  a huge sum of money in the year ahead to  build

flats  for the people. I think there is a wide recognition

and  appreciation of the efforts of the HDB,  despite  the

grumblings  of the Member for Telok Blangah, and  if  this

appreciation is not voiced, I can assure the Minister that

it is there in the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to express some

fears that I have as to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



future of our people in the HDB flats in addition  to

the  pertinent  points that have been raised  by  the

Member  for  Ulu Pandan. Our people. Sir,  in  future

will have no alternative but to get slotted into  HDB

flats.  They  will have to convert these houses  into

homes, and the thought of the future with hundreds of

thousands of our people living in such flats  can  be

nightmarish if what happens eventually is a potential

tumultuous restlessness in the people living in these

flats. This will happen if these flats are not homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So apart from the defects in construction, I think

the  paramount  consideration is how  the  Board  can

assist  the people in turning these flats  into  real

homes   where  there  can  be  a  way  of  life   and

contentment.  Pressures apply to families  living  in

these    homes,   very   centrifugal    in    nature,

disintegrating  the family, pressures  upon  children

which  require  them to leave their  homes  pressures

upon parents which require them to be absent from the

home   and, in  fact,  unwittingly  the  Board   has

developed   a   situation  which   assists   in   the

disintegration of the family, Sir. The Board sets  up

good  housing  estates and, at the  same  time,  good

hawker centres. What is developing in these homes  by

way  of  disintegrating the  family  is  a  habit  of

parents  not  coming  together  in  meals.  What   is

happening is that parents are settling their lunch or

dinner problem by distributing 50 cents. 80 cents  or

a  dollar  each  to the children in the  family,  who

immediately disperse to their favourite hawker in the

hawker   centre.   There   results   immediately    a

disintegration of the family whence there could  have

been  an  opportunity for the whole  family  unit  to

cohere  in  a function of the day. This is  happening

extensively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one ponders the extent to which this can go and

the  extent of the disintegration of the family  unit

in  the  years to come unless something  is  done,  I

think  it is disturbing. One cannot require the Board

directly to be involved in trying to turn flats  into

homes  because this is basically the problem  of  the

occupants. If there is, in the thinking of the Board,

an effort that can assist this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



development  -  frankly speaking.  Sir, I  have  not

studied  as  to how to make a constructive suggestion

along  these lines - I think it is going to do  us  a

lot of good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to raise actually

concerns community centres in the housing estates.  I

raise  this point because I feel it is necessary  for

the concept or the idea to get accepted by the Board.

I   quite  understand  that  in  regard  to  building

community  centres  in  housing  estates,  the  Board

liaise very closely with the People's Association  in

this regard. I am thinking, Sir, of what may not be a

perceptible loss in our populace as our families move

into  the Housing Board flats from the terrace,  semi

detached or kampong house. Something is lost  and  it

is  this.  In  the terrace, semidetached  or  kampong

house, the  youngsters in the family  have  got  the

opportunity   to  experiment,  to   tinker,   to   do

carpentry,  to engage in mechanical pursuits,  either

as  a  hobby  or  otherwise, in the  garden,  in  the

backyard or in the space around the house. It is this

tinkering,  this experimentation, this  doing  things

which develop a creative and innovative potential  in

the  youngsters  who become innovative  and  creative

adults and workers of the future. When there is  this

loss  of  opportunity to our populace by moving  into

HDB  flats  where  these things  cannot  be  done  or

undertaken, there is loss of this potential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I think if, as a result of liaison

between the Board and the People's Association, there

can  be accepted the concept of incorporating in  the

community  centres in the housing estates  work-rooms

with  work-benches for youngsters in  the  estate  to

pursue  hobbies or to do things. I think  this  would

retrieve to some extent the kind of loss that we  are

undergoing.  It  is  the  fashion  of  the   People's

Association  to advise the Board what  facilities  to

incorporate in the community centres, usually  it  is

basketball  court or facilities for table tennis  and

meetings.  But I do not think that this  concept  has

been  accepted yet or has been discussed by the Board

in  setting up community centres. I intend  to  raise

this again when the People's Association comes up for

discussion under the Head. Ministry of Culture. But I

am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



bringing it up at this point so that the idea  or  the

concept can be recognised by the Board.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, I think it would be a good

idea  for you to make some reply now, otherwise I will

have to guillotine you off.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Thank you, Sir. Let me first take

the  suggestions  made  by the  Member  for  Serangoon

Gardens. As regards his suggestion whether the HDB has

any objection to incorporate some form of workshop  or

work  space in the community centres, the H DB has  no

objection  to this provision for whatever mec  hanical

activities  he  has  in  mind, provided  they  do  not

generate   noise  or  cause  any  other  environmental

problems  in  the  housing estates.  But,  as  he  has

correctly  pointed  out, I do  not  know  whether  the

People's  Association will agree to incorporate  these

activities in their community centres and it  will  be

up to the People's Association board to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his other general observation on the HDB

making  homes  more homely, administratively,  on  our

own,  we  are trying to provide that by giving  better

houses,  better  finishes and perhaps better  designed

housing   estates  incorporating  better  social   and

recreational  amenities.  In  fact, my  Minister  has

reminded me that we have produced this magazine called

Home  which  gives  an  indication  of  the  sort   of

activities which the HDB is attempting to provide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quickly switch over to the Hon. Member

for Kampong Kembangan. The budget provided for the HDB

for FY 76 is mainly to be used for the construction of

three-room and four-room new generation flats and five-room  improved  flats. These flats  will  have  better

finishing compared to the old ones and they will  have

glazed wall tiles, mosaic floor tiles, pedestal  squat

pans and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his query on Kampong Kembangan, I am

sorry  I  do not know what is the progress as  far  as

this   particular  project  is  concerned.   But   his

observation on some maintenance problems in regard  to

mosquito breeding, unsatisfactory environment, and  so

on  and so forth, will be brought to the attention  of

the particular Area Office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



concerned, and perhaps I would be able to let him know

of the situation at a later date.



<br><br><!-- Haji Mohd. Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, could

the  Minister  of  State give an  assurance  that  the

development of flats in Kampong Kembangan near Kampong

Ubi  could  be  expedited in view of the  difficulties

faced by my constituents?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, I am really in no position to

know  the  details. But I will be happy to supply  him

with the information tomorrow morning if he wants  to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago I was told that I had torn the SBS

to  pieces! This year I do not intend to tear the SBS

to  pieces. In fact, I wish to commend it for  having

done  something about its transport system, and I  am

sure that members of the public will agree with me in

saying that improvements have been made,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is still room for further

improvement. Some services are still irregular, buses

seem to reach the bus stops in threes or fours at the

same  time. Time-keepers should regulate the services

more efficiently. No doubt conductors and drivers are

generally   polite   and   disciplined.    That    is

commendable. But I am afraid to say there  are  still

some  black sheep existing and because of these black

sheep,  whatever  the  SBS  tries  to  implement   is

sometimes negated. Cleanliness of buses has  also  to

be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to mention the unnecessary delays

caused  by  buses which go to their terminus  or  bus

depots   for   refuelling.  Very  often, at   these

refuelling  depots  there is a long  queue  of  buses

waiting.  Sometimes it takes as long as  1  5  to  20

minutes  before a particular bus at one  end  of  the

queue  is  refuelled. Is it possible for the  SBS  to

organise  the refuelling of buses in such a way  that

not  too  much  inconvenience is caused  to  the  bus

commuters, who may be fighting against time to arrive

at their destinations?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there was speculation in the local press that

bus fares are expected to be increased from a minimum

of  20  cents to a flat rate of 30 cents and 50 cents

One  of  the primary purposes of amalgamation of  bus

companies in 1970 was to reduce cost In the  past  we

had  numerous  bus  companies The first  amalgamation

resulted  in reducing the number of bus companies  to

four, and a further amalgamation resulted in only one

single bus company, the SBS It is rather strange that

with amalgamation we saw the disappearance of the  5-cent fare and then the 10-cent fare, and it looks  as

if we would very soon see the disappearance of the 20

cent  fare.  This is rather surprising.  I  hope  the

Minister  will  see that this does  not  take  place,

because  the people are already grumbling  about  the

recent ro,3d tax increases, and now even the fare for

the  cheapest form of transport is also to be raised,

on the excuse of increased over-head cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, don't tell me that SBS is not making a profit.

But  perhaps  profit is not the motive  for  the  SBS

either expanding or putting in additional capital for

which  it has to charge higher fares. Is it  fair  to

charge higher fares if additional capital is required

for the renewal of buses? Naturally, a certain amount

of  loss is inevitable but this loss can be recovered

very  quickly by careful and proper planning  If  the

SBS  is  perfect,  we do not have to  supplement  its

service  with Scheme El buses In fact, the  Scheme  B

buses  which  were supposed to be a temporary  affair

seems  to  become  a permanent picture  on  Singapore

roads. I wonder how much longer we have to depend  on

these Scheme B buses for an efficient bus service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shuttle service was also introduced to run between

the  fringe car parks to the CBD zone. But this is  a

failure.  In fact, we see the shuttle service  taking

away part of the burden of SBS. It looks as if we are

going  back  to square one again where different  bus

companies were operating. So when is the SBS going to

become a really efficient.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



reliable and a prompt public transport company?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that recently the bus company

issued  bus guides costing 50 cents each. I am afraid

to say that this bus guide is not in the least handy.

It  cannot be put easily into the pocket. It is  full

of  advertisements and the information in it confuses

rather  than  helps the commuters.  If  any  commuter

finds  it difficult to use, then what is the  purpose

of  printing that bus guide? In fact, a very  eminent

geographer in Singapore pointed out the difficulty in

looking  for bus routes from the bus guide. How  then

is  the  common man going to find the bus  routes  in

this complicated bus guide? Is it possible to issue a

simpler bus guide that can be handy and useful to the

commuter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, "our telecommunications services are one of the

best    in    the   world."   That   is   what    the

Telecommunication Authority claims. But to the people

in  Singapore, I am afraid the opposite may be  true.

Very  often  when  one  makes an  application  for  a

telephone,  one has to wait at times for as  long  as

one  year  or even longer to get a telephone.  Surely

during the pre-planning stages of a housing estate  a

certain  number of telephone lines could  be  planned

and provided for the residents. Why is this not done?

I hope the Minister will see that more lines are made

available at all housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in our transport system there is

much  room  for improvement. We have been harping  on

the  Mass  Rapid  Transit System and money  has  been

voted  for  that particular project. Even  an  expert

from  a foreign country had been here to make a study

and  to make recommendations. Our Prime Minister  too

has  recently been to Hong Kong to see how the system

works  over there. Now what I want to know  is  this:

Are  we  going to implement it? How soon  can  it  be

implemented? What type of transportation system  will

be used?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ch'ng is not here. Dr Ong?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, after the glorious speech by

the  Member  for Anson, may I add my own comments  to

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



subhead?  First  of all, I would like  to  extend  my

congratulations to the Ministry of Communications for

the  steps  they have taken to ensure that  Singapore

has  an  improved system of public transport. It  has

taken time, but the fact that there is progress means

that  there  is hope for tomorrow. The problems  that

faced  the  Ministry have in fact taken a great  cost

and  toil to officers of the various departments  and

to  the public. But I am encouraged by the fact  that

the  bus system today is an improved version of  what

it was two years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the comments that the Member for

Anson made earlier on with regard to bus guides,  may

I  humbly  suggest to the Minister  that  instead  of

issuing  bus  guides, bus routes could very  well  be

placed  at  all  bus stops under the heading  of  the

particular  service  number so  that  it  is  readily

available for easy reference. That is, some  form  of

laminated  card boards with the bus numbers  and  the

bus  routes which. I think, is not difficult to make.

It only requires some organisation and some effort by

the   Ministry   of  Communications,   the   SBS   in

particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the topic on Mass Rapid Transit

which the Member for Anson has mentioned earlier, may

I say that there has been tremendous public attention

and interest on this subject. We realise that Phase I

is  over  and Phase II of the feasibility  study  has

just  been completed. In addition to that, the  Prime

Minister  himself had made a personal  and  important

trip to Hong Kong to study the MRT system. I would be

most  grateful if the Minister could inform us as  to

the present state of the feasibility study of the MRT

in  Singapore,  its cost and the time  that  will  be

taken, if accepted, to implement the system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to emphasise is

the  question of road discipline. Road discipline  is

something  which is two-way. One is on the  level  of

public    sophistication,   its    discipline,    its

educational status, and its social consciousness. The

other  is  the  question  to  which  officialdom  and

Government is willing to impose and to instruct.  May

I  suggest that where the public has been failing  or

unable to live up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



expectation  of good road discipline  that  there  is

place  for the ROV to impose stricter penalties  upon

bad use of roads. I know that there are many problems

involved  but at least in one respect may  I  suggest

that  the  Ministry  look into this:  when  ambulance

cars,  fire  engines  and  police  patrol  cars   are

answering  emergency calls, all other traffic  should

be  cautioned  and told to pull aside  to  facilitate

these  urgent vehicles answering emergency  calls  to

get  to the scene of the accident, fire, or crime  or

the scene of any other urgent matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter which I would like the Minister to

look  into is the Area Licensing Scheme and the entry

of vehicles in and out of the CBD during the hours of 7.30 a.m.  and  10.15 a.m. We all know that  the  Area

Licensing  Scheme  has produced  somewhat  remarkable

results  in terms of cutting down traffic within  the

CBD,  but taxis are a notable exception. It is common

knowledge  that  the introduction of the  Scheme  has

turned  out  to be of great benefit to a considerable

number of taxi drivers. They pay the $4 fee to  enter

the  CBD and during those 2- hours they embark  on  a

great  profit-making exercise. After paying  the  fee

for  entry,  they will plough in and out of  the  CBD

charging  each and every passenger the full  fee  for

which  they  have  paid for just one  trip.  To  that

extent  they are making a tremendous profit  and, in

fact, fleecing the public. This is a matter that  can

be  looked  into,  and  I would suggest  that  urgent

attention be paid to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these remarks I would like to thank the

Ministry of Communications for its constant attention

in  continuing to improve our public transport in the

last year or two.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, I would like

to  discuss  a  little  about the  Government's  road

transport policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A matter which concerned me most was the sorry

state  of  affairs  of  the  Singapore  bus  service.

However,  over  the  past year,  it  has  shown  some

improvements.   The   most   perceptible   area    of

improvement I have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



told,  and which I myself observe, is in the  conduct

of the drivers and conductors. Improvements have also

been  made  in terms of service, routine, scheduling,

road-worthiness and cleanliness of the buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you would recall, in 1974 I

proposed in essence in the first of a dozen principal

Questions  for  Oral  Answer,  for  the  Government's

involvement in this field of public transport. It was

my  belief that there were amongst the ranks  of  cur

civil  servants, officers who could take care of  our

bus  service. The 40-odd officers who have been  sent

to  look  after  the  affairs of  the  Singapore  Bus

Service Ltd proved the point I made that-where  there

is  a  will there is a way of putting our bus service

on  its  feet again. I also did propose, and I  would

still  press  on, that the Government should  have  a

financial  stake in the Singapore Bus  Se'rvice  Ltd.

even  if  it  has to be reorganized, so that  further

improvement  can be made in this public service.  The

participation   of  the  SBS  employees   should   be

considered, so that it would not be in their  vested

interest  to  see  the  SBS go down  the  drain.  The

management and the workers should weed out from their

ranks  all those who cannot make an honest living  or

who do not do an honest day's work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say that the bus is the main form of

transportation for the great majority of  the  people

now  and  by  the next decade or two the  Mass  Rapid

Transit system concurrently serving the public. It is

my  calculation that it will cost millions of dollars

to  improve  on the bus service and to construct  the

MRT.  It  is  my guess that the millions  of  dollars

which  would be raised by the increased Area  Licence

Fees,  road  taxes and additional registration  fees,

would come in handy for these two purposes, namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For the Government's intention to purchase SBS

shares, should the company go public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) For the development of the MRT system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the new taxes and fees were introduced, it

was  explained, if I am correct, that the  taxes  and

fees  were not revenueorientated. In passing,  may  I

observe that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



revenue estimate for Road Tax for 1975 is $87 million

and for 1976 it is $108 million, an increase of $20.4

million.   The   revenue  estimate   for   Additional

Registration  Fees for 1975 is $41  million  and  for

1976 it is $50 million. The revenue estimate for Area

Licence Fees for 1975 is $5.4 million and for 1976 it

is $6.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the revenue is a question mark. If

the  money  raised is used to provide  a  better  bus

service  and to construct the MRT system,  I  make  a

guess  that  Singaporeans, being calculative  people,

wduld know the economy of being a bus commuter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The service we provide to the bus commuters must

reach  a  standard  comparable to western  countries.

With  the  will, it will be possible to  attain  this

objective in a couple of years' time. At this moment,

the   SBS  is  still  not  in  a  position  to   cope

satisfactorily  with the demand for its  service.  In

view  of this, it does appear that the imposition  of

severe  measures against the use of private transport

was a little too premature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the opinion that the Area Licensing Scheme's

restricted  hours  commencing  at  7.30  am.,  as  at

present, are causing a lot of hardship to private car

owners who have to send their children to school.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  you  could imagine  how  early  these

children  would have to be awakened from their  sleep

in order that their parents could beat the restricted

hours.  I  wish  to  repeat what I said  during  last

year's debate: that the restricted hours should begin

at 8.00 am, and not 7.30 am. It is my experience that

our  roads are never congested at this hour, but only

much  later, most unfortunately when the big wigs  in

Government  profession and business go  driving  into

the Central Business District.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that the introduction of the Area

Licensing  Scheme is not to thin out road traffic  so

much as to give the appearance that the roads have to

be   cleared  for  Government  bureaucrats,  business

executives  and  successful  professionals  to  drive

smartly  into the City like emperors, maharajahs  and

sultans  of  days  long gone by. If  this  is  so,  I

envisage that the development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



costs  of roads, whilst borne by the taxpayers, would

benefit relatively fewer car owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to state, however, that most of the measures

taken  to  discourage private car ownership  and  the

entry  of  traffic  into the CBD are  necessary.  The

nation's administrative and business life should  not

be  smothered  by  traffic congestion.  In  the  same

connection,  our industrial and transport  activities

must not be slowed down. There are growing signs that

roads  leading to Jurong Town are becoming  congested

with  traffic.  Therefore, it might  be  feasible  to

curtail  the  flow of private transport  into  Jurong

Town   in  the  not  too  distant  future.  It  might

incidentally  cut  down the volume of  traffic  along

cross-town roads, like Scotts Road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I wish to state that I would

agree  that our road and transport policy must be  in

the  direction of further development and utilisation

of the public transport system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very nice to receive

congratulations from Hon. Members. My only regret  is

that  my predecessor is not here. Otherwise, he would

be most pleased at the progress that has been made, a

greater part of which was achieved during his time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly agree that there has been

tremendous improvement in the public transport system

and   this,  in  a  great  measure,  is  due  to  the

cooperation of the workers and also to the secondment

of  a  Government Team of Officials to  the  SBS.  It

would  be  appropriate here to mention  some  of  the

measures  which  the Management  Team  has  taken  to

improve  the  bus  service and also  to  improve  the

standard of discipline among the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things they did was to keep personal

files  of  employees, and they  drew  up  a  code  of

conduct  and  disciplinary  procedures.  Disciplinary

action   is  also  being  centrally  dealt  with   by

headquarters. In this way, they were able to spot the

black  sheep among the employees and remove them  for

the good of the company.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers, conductors and other persons who have been

recruited are given training prior to putting them on

the   job.  They  were  told  of  their  duties   and

responsibilities and they were also told  to  provide

service  with courtesy and with a smile.  Of  course,

some do not perform satisfactorily and, when spotted,

are sent back for refresher courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has also been a strengthening of the

Enforcement  Section. The duties of  the  Enforcement

Section  are,  first, to ensure that  bus  fares  are

properly  collected, buses run on time, and to  catch

drivers   who   speed.  Based   on   their   reports.

disciplinary action is taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the indicators to show that there has been

great improvement in the bus service and the way  the

employees discharge their duty is the decrease in the

number  of  complaints received. In fact,  complaints

have dropped by as much as 75%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the observation made by the Member

for  Anson.  He  mentioned about the  long  wait  for

refuelling of buses. I know it is very irritating for

commuters  to  have to wait in the bus  while  it  is

being refuelled. Action is being taken to ensure that

every  bus, before leaving the depot in the  morning,

is  fuelled the night before. But it is essential for

every bus to be refuelled at least once a day because

it  travels on an average of 250 miles, and  it  does

not  carry  a  tank large enough to  hold  sufficient

diesel oil for a journey of 250 miles. Anyway,  buses

are  refuelled as far as possible during the off-peak

hours.  More refuelling terminals are being  set  up,

and  in certain places two oil pumps are in use. This

problem is being looked into, and I think there  will

be a great improvement soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Member for Anson, I deplore the end of the

era  of the 5-cent and 10-cent char kway teow and mee

goreng  with  eggs, in the same way that he  deplores

the end of the 5-cent and 10-cent bus fares. One must

remember  that  there  are  factors  which  make   it

impossible  to  retain the old  rates  of  fares  and

prices. Hon. Members certainly are aware of inflation

and may recollect that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



price  of diesel oil has gone up. The SBS has to  pay

higher  wages  and also the NWC wage recommendations.

These are the factors which increase costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has mentioned about the delay in

schedules. SBS has more buses on the road because  of

better  maintenance  of the buses.  Here  again,  the

improvement  has  been due in  some  measure  to  the

secondment of an SAF team to help maintain the buses.

To  maintain  buses, we must have  spare  parts.  The

costs of spare parts have also gone up. So it is  not

true  to  say that the 5-cent and 10-cent  bus  fares

have  disappeared  because  the  bus  companies   are

amalgamated and there is a monopoly. There are  other

irresistible factors at work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems of running an efficient bus

service  is  to provide sufficient buses during  peak

hours. But what do you do with these buses during the

off-peak hours? The buses will lie idle and the  crew

also   will  be  idle  and  they  have  to  be   paid

nevertheless. So one way of solving this  problem  is

to allow the Scheme B buses and also the City Shuttle

Service  to  continue. In this way, I  think  we  are

maximising  the  use of all available buses,  because

during  part  of the peak hours in the  mornings  and

evenings  the Scheme B buses are usually quite  free.

During  the  hours  when  they  are  not  engaged  in

transporting  children  to  school,  they   help   in

transporting other commuters. In this way, they  help

to take the load off the SBS during peak hours, and I

think it is necessary that they should be allowed  to

carry on for some time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of the bus guide is a most unfortunate

one.  The  bus  guide  was put  up  as  a  commercial

proposition   by   a  private  firm  which   obtained

information  about  the  bus  schedules   and   other

relevant  information from the Singapore Bus  Service

Ltd.   As  a  commercial  venture,  of  course,  they

canvassed   for  advertisements.  Unfortunately,   in

finalising the format of the bus guide, they did  not

consult  the  SBS. As a result they produced  a  very

poor  bus  guide  and  probably  lost  money  in  the

process.  Anyway, arising from this  experience,  the

SBS will probably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



put up their own bus guide. The suggestion made by the

Member  for Kim Seng about posting information on  bus

routes  at bus stops will be taken into consideration.

I will forward the suggestion to the SBS.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kim Seng did suggest that in order to

ensure  better road discipline there should be heavier

penalties.  Heavier penalties have been imposed.  More

details  will be given by my Minister of State during,

the  debate  on  the  ROV. As  Members  know,  and  as

indicated by the Member for Kim Seng, penalties  alone

will  not  be  sufficient to  raise  the  standard  of

courtesy  among motorists. There is also the  question

of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his suggestion that ambulances, Police

cars and fire engines should have the right of way.  I

entirely agree with him. Here, again, it is a question

of   social  conscience,  and  consideration  by   the

motorists,  the cyclists, the scootenists,  and  other

road  users for each other's welfare and for  that  of

the  community.  It will come about through  education

and   not  through  sheer  enforcement  of  penalties.

Anyway, there is a saying that a journey of a thousand

miles  begins with the first step. We have  taken  the

first  step  to  warn motorists that  these  emergency

vehicles should have the right of way. I hope that  in

time  to come motorists will have enough consideration

for  their fellowmen to decide what is right and  what

is  wrong, and no matter how much they are in a hurry,

they will give way to these emergency vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to the Area Licensing Scheme, I do not agree

with  the  Member for Kim Seng when he said that  taxi

drivers benefit from the ALS. Some of the black  sheep

do  benefit,  however. He says that they charge  every

passenger  the ALS fee of $4. If they are able  to  do

this, we would have seen an increase in the number  of

taxis  applying for the ALS licences. In actual  fact,

there has been a decrease in the sale of ALS licences.

Perhaps  taxis drivers might be able to get away  with

this in the beginning. But ultimately the public would

get wiser. Anyway, we have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



device whereby the time of purchase of the ALS licence

by  taxi  drivers  is indicated  on  the  disc.  If  a

passenger is observant, he will notice this and should

not  pay for it once the taxi driver has recovered his

payment  for the licence from his previous  passenger.

He  need not pay for it. The Enforcement Officers  are

going  round to see that cheating of this nature  does

not  take  place. If a taxi driver is  found  to  have

severally  charged passengers for the ALS  entry  fee,

action will be taken against him.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kallang has suggested that the

Government should participate in the equity holding of

the  SBS.  We  are  now considering  the  question  of

workers  participating in the equity  holding  of  the

SBS.  It  is too early in the day for me to  make  any

announcement. But we are seriously considering whether

it is advisable to allow the workers to participate in

this, and ultimately Government's participation too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his suggestion that revenue from the

increase in road taxes and registration fees should go

towards  the  development of the MRT. I can  only  say

that the increase is negligible. The MRT will cost not

millions but billions of dollars. But he is correct in

saying that the purpose of the increase in the ALS fee

and  the  other  fees is not to raise revenue  but  to

discourage  people from owning cars,  thus  preventing

our  roads  from  being choked by too  heavy  traffic,

thereby hindering our economic progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested that we should revise the

commencement of the ALS from 7.30 am, to 8.00 am. This

question  has  been looked into by  the  experts.  His

reason is that this is to allow parents to send  their

children to schools in the CBD. He also says  that  in

his  experience he has not seen any traffic jam during

this  period. I say that if we were to extend the time

to  8.00 am. He will experience a traffic jam. At  the

moment  there is no congestion because the ALS  begins

at 7.30 am. There are very few schools within the CBD.

If  the parents want their children to go to school by

car, there is no reason why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



they  cannot  form  car pools. The  Methodist  Girls'

School  has  formed  car  pools  quite  successfully.

Perhaps  their children could take buses because,  as

he has said, bus services have improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that perhaps the timing of the

imposition  of  the restriction is not  quite  right.

That  is  a matter of opinion. However, in  the  same

breath  he  has  also suggested that it  is  time  we

imposed restriction on entry into Jurong. Here  again

it  is a matter of opinion. We think this is not  the

time  yet.  We are in charge of the ALS and  we  have

enforced it in the City area. If the Member  were  in

change  he  would probably enforce it in Jurong  too.

But we are studying the problem closely. I agree with

him  that  restricting  entry of  private  cars  into

Jurong  may  help to clear the congestion around  the

periphery of Jurong Town. Anyway we should wait until

the Pan-Island Express Way is completed before we  go

any further into this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be wondering why I have not touched on

the  MRT  and give some information on the  questions

which  have  been  asked. If I  may,  Sir,  with  the

indulgence  of Members, call upon my Senior  Minister

of  State,  who is very closely associated  with  the

MRT, to reply to Members' comments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to

confirm the statement made by the Member for Kim Seng

that  Phase  II  study  of  the  MRT  has  just  been

completed. The final report of the Phase II MRT Study

will  be  ready sometime this year for submission  to

the  Cabinet.  It  will then be up  to  the  Cabinet,

taking  into  account the socio-economic factors  and

other  considerations, to decide whether  or  not  to

proceed  with  the  project. If the  decision  is  to

proceed with it, which is planned to be some 45 km in

length,  of  which one-third will be underground, it

will  take  approximately 10 years to  construct.  Of

course, some sections of the system will be completed

earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the construction cost of the system, I am afraid I do not have all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



detailed figures with me. Based or the current  price

at  constant Dollar, the estimated cost of  the  full

system  is in the region of $1 .7 billion. But taking

into  account inflation and interests fees that  will

be  incurred  during  the  construction  period,  the

ultimate  cost of the full system could  well  exceed

$2.8 billion on completion of the project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just

want  to  make a point on the refuelling of buses.  I

have   had   a  number  of  experiences  with   buses

refuelling  at a place off Changi Road.  The  drivers

seem  to  want  to  get over with the  refuelling  as

quickly as possible, as I suppose, they have to  keep

to  the time schedule. Therefore, and this is a point

which the Member for Anson has brought up, there is a

tendency for them to leave the engine on while  their

vehicles  are  being  refuelled.  This  is  a  highly

dangerous  practice. I hope the Minister  will  bring

this  matter to the attention of the SBS so that such

a  practice can be stopped. This is dangerous for the

drivers, the conductors and the passengers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, action has

been taken to stop this dangerous practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Minister of State has already replied to

questions  on the MRT. I would like to  take  up  the

point mentioned by the Member for Anson regarding the

long  wait for telephones. Earlier in the day n  this

House, when the question was raised about the waiting

time  for  telephones, the reply given by the  Senior

Minister  of  State  was that we  were  making  every

attempt  to  reduce the percentage of applicants  who

have to wait for telephones. Here again, it is not  a

question  of  bad  planning.  When  we  draw   up   a

development  plan  for  the  future,  estimates   are

usually made. We are very wise men indeed if  we  can

be  perfect in our est mates. It has been shown  that

the   demand   for   telephones  has   risen   beyond

expectations.  In other words, our experts  estimated

that  there  would be a demand-increase  of  15%  per

year, but the actual demand has gone up by 20%. There

is  also the question of backlog. I think credit must

be given to the Housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>

Board  for  having  built houses  very  quickly, much

quicker  than we can install the telephones. They  are

building flats all over Singapore now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time-lag for installing telephone equipment is

five  years.  If we draw up the plans today  and  then

place  our orders, it will be five years later  before

we  can actually get the equipment. That is one of the

reasons   why   we  have  to  make  these   estimates.

Therefore, given the time-lag of five years  and  with

the  Housing Board putting up flats in less  than  two

years  in some places, there is this discrepancy.  But

whatever it is, we are doing our best to catch up with

the  backlog. In fact, the TAS have been asked whether

it  is  possible to make use of overhead lines because

it is faster to install telephones this way. They have

made use of overhead lines and that is how we catch up

with  the  demand.  But one must remember  that  lines

alone are not enough. There must also be the switching

equipment  to go with it. Anyway, for the  information

of  Members,  we  have tried to make use  of  all  the

facilities  available. For example. Telok Blangah  New

Town  is now being served by the North Exchange  sited

at the Thomson Road/Whitley Road junction. Since there

is excess capacity there, we are tapping it for use in

Telok  Blangah New Town. Nevertheless, the demand  for

telephones  in Telok Blangah is so great that  tapping

the  excess  in this Exchange which is  not  meant  to

serve  Telok Blangah is still not sufficient. It  will

be some more time before the equipment is available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Member for Telok Blangah may be pleased

to  hear  that next month we are putting into  service

10,000  pieces of switching equipment. For the Ang  Mo

Kio  New  Town, the new Exchange building is scheduled

to   be  completed  in  October  1976.  The  necessary

switching  equipment will follow immediately, and  by

October 1977 all the residents in Ang Mo Kio New  Town

will  get  their telephones. One way in which  we  can

reduce waiting time would be for intending subscribers

to  come together and share a party line. But quite  a

number of them are quite choosey. An offer of a  party

line  has  been made but quite a number of  them  have

turned it down. If they are really in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>





urgent need, they can always share a party line,  that

is, if service is available.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like

to  ask  the Minister two questions. First,  regarding

telephone  equipment ordered and bought  from  abroad.

Just  now  the Minister said that it was necessary  to

place orders for such equipment five years ahead.  Why

should  we have to wait for so long before we can  get

them? I would like the Minister to explain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is it possible for our manufacturers to

produce  telephone  equipment  here,  since  we   have

reached quite a high level of technology? If so, there

will  be  no  problem for the EDB and the Ministry  of

Science   and  Technology  to  set  up  factories   to

manufacture  our own telephone equipment for  our  own

needs.  In  this  way, we will  be  able  to  get  our

telephone facilities earlier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to

ask  the Minister two simple questions. The first  one

is:  yesterday some Members in this House alleged that

the   rural  people  are  regarded  as  second   class

citizens. I do not agree to this view. However, we can

all agree on the point, that the buses used in serving

the  rural areas are all outdated and useless. I  hope

the  Minister will be able to provide better buses  to

serve  these  areas  and  perhaps  also  provide  good

drivers to man such buses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about some comments by MPs here

that  the SBS has improved a lot in its service. Maybe

the Minister is very pleased about this remark. But  I

would  like  to  say something which  he  may  not  be

pleased to hear. In spite of the SBS service,  if  you

ask  whether  there are pirate taxis  running  on  the

roads,  I should say yes. So I hope the Minister  will

look into this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I can assure the Member for

Sembawang  that if we could manufacture the  telephone

equipment  here, we would have done so. We  could  not

get   anyone   interested  enough  to  join   in   the

manufacture  of  telephone  switching  equipment,  and

therefore the waiting time needed is still five years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the rural areas, the request is for new

buses  for  rural residents. I think there have  been

new  buses  for  rural  residents  but,  taking  into

consideration the nature of rural roads, they  become

old  buses in no time. Much as we like to, we  cannot

be changing buses every six months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member is probably right that there are

pirate taxis around. I will alert the ROV.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  just  now the Minister in answer  to  my  first

question said that buses would become old in no  time

if  used in rural areas. But I would say that in  the

rural  areas  the  roads  are  also  quite  wide  and

metalled,  not  as bad as the Minister has  imagined.

The  position is this. The rural people will have  to

walk  along bad unmetalled tracks in order  to  reach

the main road to board a bus. So, buses still run  on

good  roads.  If  you can go there, you  will  notice

this. I hope in the rural areas one can see new buses

to provide the rural folks with better services.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, most probably, the Hon.

Minister will agree with me that during the peak hour

of  about 5 o'clock, buses are seen queueing from the

CID  building  in Robinson Road right  up  to  Market

Street.   Why  does  the  SBS  not  take  statistics?

Somebody  must  go there to see how  many  buses  are

going  to  Katong,  how  many  buses  are  going   to

Serangoon,  how many buses are going to  Geylang.  If

they  do  it, then they will know how many buses  are

required  there.  This long queue of  buses  is  seen

daily. The Minister can check on it. It is no use  to

keep  20  buses lined up, while only one bus is  full

and  the  others  are empty. What is  the  system  of

working?  I  do not understand the SBS's  system.  In

this  long  queue  of  buses, there  are  SBS  buses,

private  buses  and shuttle service  buses.  What  is

this? I do not understand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, we have taken statistics. So we

have  staggered the bus stops. Now there are no  more

queues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, in view of the Hon.

Minister's  explanation, I beg leave to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P he reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 1106*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved to make some

suggestions  in  respect of the airport  services  at

Paya  Lebar  Airport. Those who arrive  from  abroad,

especially during congested periods which often occur

at  night,  find that in our Arrival lounge  lots  of

passengers  who have two or three pieces  of  luggage

find  it difficult to carry their luggages out. There

is a shortage of porters. I do not advocate that more

porters be employed. Perhaps manpower should  be  put

to better use rather than just allowed to hang around

to  carry  bags. But I do advocate, and I  have  made

this suggestion some years ago, that we provide these

arrival passengers with light hand-trolleys for their

convenience.  They need not wait. As  soon  as  their

luggage  comes down the conveyor belt, it would  make

it  very convenient for them to get their luggage out

with a trolley.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second suggestion I would like to make is

in  respect of the taxi service at the airport.  Here

again, especially at peak hours at night, with  large

planes  arriving these days, there is a  shortage  of

taxis.  Sometimes  one  has to  wait  for  35  to  40

minutes,  without exaggeration, because I myself  had

to  wait  for 40 minutes for a taxi. I am  told  that

this is the result of a restriction on the number  of

taxis  that are allowed to go into the airport  area.

Perhaps the Ministry should look into the possibility

of  increasing  the number of taxis  allowed  in  the

airport  at the moment. With more taxis, perhaps  the

waiting period could be reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the taxi service operating at the

airport  is  a  very lucrative one because  the  taxi

drivers  have other "fringe benefits" and  the  extra

charge   which  they  sometimes  impose  on  arriving

passengers from abroad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,I

fully  agree with my colleague, the Member for  Telok

Blangah However, I wish to raise a few points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Development estimates, I notice that

quite a big sum of money is going to be spent on  the

extension of the existing runway, additional  parking

aprons  and navigational aids for Paya Lebar Airport.

If  Paya  Lebar Airport is not going to be  the  main

airport  in  the  future and if Changi  is  going  to

become  our main international airport, then why  are

we  spending money for the extension of facilities at

Paya  Lebar  Airport?  Are these expenditures  really

necessary? Can we not manage with a reduced amount of

expenditure for Paya Lehar and concentrate on  Changi

Airport instead?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, soon Changi will become an international

airport.  For how long will it remain so,  I  do  not

know.  We  had  Kallang  at the  beginning;  then  we

switched  to Paya Lehar, and now we move  to  Changi,

even  before the second runway at Paya Lehar and  the

extensions  could be completed Originally,  when  the

Department  wanted to expand Paya Lebar Airport,  the

engineers tested the soil at Changi and they said, at

that  time,  they could not develop  an  `airport  at

Changi  because  the soil was not strong.  Therefore,

they  came  back to Paya Lebar Airport Now they  say.

"Move  to Changi". We have spent so many millions  of

dollars at Paya Lebar and now we are moving to Changi

A  certain  amount of foresight thinking is required.

Is  Changi  Airport really necessary? Are  we  really

going  to  expect the predicted increase in tourists?

Have  we given the allowance that many persons  think

twice  before  they  travel nowadays?  Or  is  Changi

Airport  going to he one project that will be  little

used?  Could  we  not  just manage  with  Paya  Lebar

Airport for several decades?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt certain amount of pollution is involved No

doubt  reclamation  and resettlement  of  people  are

involved.  But  these are unavoidable for  an  island

like  Singapore  that is too small. For  that  matter

Changi is no better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that S80 million is to be spent on

land reclamation and $15 million for land acquisition

for  Changi Airport Where does the Government get the

money? From tax payers The Government increase  taxes

but   is  unnecessarily  spending  $95  million   for

reclamation and land acquisition Need we  spend  this

amount  of money on a project, when actually  we  may

not receive the number of tourists that was predicted

before the oil crisis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After building Changi Airport, what is going to

happen to Paya Lebar Airport? Will it he closed  down

and demolished to make way for multi-storey buildings

like Kallang? I do not know what is happening. I hope

the Minister could enlighten the House



<br><br>7.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the Member for Telok

Blangah raised two points One is about the push-carts

at  the  Arrival  hall of the airport The  push-carts

were  introduced  by the Singapore  Airport  Terminal

Services ISATS) in 1974 It has been proved to be very

successful and many tourists arriving from  overseas,

as  the  Member has pointed out, found it to he  very

useful. Since early this year an additional 150 push-carts  have  been  put into use, and  there  are  now

altogether about 150 push-carts at the Arrival hall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the second question raised by the Member

about the airport taxi services. I would like to take

this  opportunity to inform him that the airport taxi

service  is  undergoing  a reorganisation  so  as  to

improve  its  efficiency  and  the  conduct  of  taxi

drivers. At the same time we are thinking of  further

increasing  the  fleet  of  taxis  operating  at  the

airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few questions raised by the Member for

Anson  One is about the question of the vast sums  of

money  allocated  to the development  of  Paya  Lebar

Airport after the decision has been made to move  our

international airport to Changi Sir, the air  traffic

through  Singapore  for  the  next  few  years   will

continue to increase and the Paya Lebar Airport  will

continue  to be the main civil airport for  Singapore

up  to  1 980, when it is expected to handle  over  8

million



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



passengers  a  year, or almost double the  number  of

passengers  that was handled last year. In  1972  the

consultants  made  the forecast that  the  number  of

passengers  passing through our airport  would  reach

something like 4 million in 1975, but since  the  oil

crisis  in 1973 this figure has been revised. Despite

the   oil  crisis,  however,  the  passenger  traffic

continues  to  increase  and  the  actual  figure  of

passenger  traffic passing through Singapore  Airport

last  year is not very far off the mark of  what  was

projected.  Paya  Lebar Airport,  besides  having  to

handle  all this passenger traffic up to 1980,  would

still be in use in conjunction with the Changi (Phase

I)  Airport, which will be completed sometime in 1980

or  1981 because the full Changi Airport Development,

including  the second phase, will' not  be  completed

until 1982 or 1983.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also mentioned about the $80

million  land reclamation cost at Changi. Of  course,

the  money comes from taxpayers. The actual  cost  of

the  reclamation is, in fact, about $235 million  for

the  entire reclamation project, but only $80 million

will be required for the coming financial year as the

total reclamation work would take over three years to

complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the role of the Paya

Lebar Airport after Changi Airport. I can assure  him

that Paya Lebar Airport will be put to good use, as I

have  mentioned  earlier, during the  interim  period

between  now  and  1982. It will later  be  used,  in

addition   to  military  operations,  to  cater   for

emergency or overspill of civil aircraft traffic from

Changi Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the important role that Paya Lebar

Airport will continue to play in this interim  period

between  now  and  1982, a new  direct  express  road

linking Paya Lebar and Changi Airport will be  built.

This  link-road will be completed by the end of  1979

50  that it will provide a fast and efficient flow of

passenger motor vehicles between the two airports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should also take this opportunity to explain to the Member for Anson the main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



reasons  for  moving to Changi. There are,  in  fact,

three  major reasons for the Government to decide  to

move  the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi. Firstly,

it  is a matter of timing. As I mentioned earlier, it

is projected that by 1980 we will be handling some  8

million  passenger traffic through our airport  in  a

year.  But due to the physical difficulties  at  Paya

Lebar  airport,  such as drainage,  canal  diversion,

squatter  resettlement, removal of rubbish dumps  and

refilling  of the swampy areas around our Paya  Lebar

Airport, our engineers concluded that it would  take

some  nine years to build the second runway  at  Paya

Lebar.  This would mean that, if we start work today,

the second runway at Paya Lebar would be completed by

1984  or  1985.  Obviously this is  not  good  enough

because  by that time the Airport would face  a  very

serious  congestion and we would loose the  tourists.

On  the  other hand, the present runway at the Changi

airfield  could  be  easily lengthened, widened  and

strengthened    into   a   runway   acceptable    for

international air traffic operations by the middle of

1980, while the second runway at Changi will be built

on  land reclaimed from the sea and it could be ready

by  the middle of 1982. This means two or three years

ahead of scheduled completion of the second runway at

Paya Lebar. It is therefore a question of timing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for moving to Changi is on

environmental considerations, mainly noise pollution.

If  the second runway were to be built at Paya Lebar,

the  noise generated by the aircraft taking  off  and

landing at Paya Lebar Airport would affect a  lot  of

people living in the area, whose houses are under the

flight  path. Noise pollution caused to the  proposed

Changi site will not be spread over as large a sector

of  the  population as at Paya Lebar because a  large

area of the flight path of aircraft calling at Changi

Airport will be over water and not over land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third reason for moving to Changi. I am sure

the  Member for Anson would be happy to know that the

choice  was  made on the ground that  the  number  of

people   affected  by  resettlement  would  be   less

compared to the number of people affected, if we were

to proceed with the second



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



runway  at  Paya Lebar. The figure is something  like

800 families in Changi being affected by resettlement

as  against 4.000 families in Paya Lebar. Earlier  we

have  heard  grievances expressed by the  Member  for

Changi about the kelong resettlement operations. This

shifting  of airport to Changi means more  saving  in

costs, very much less irritation and frustration  and

reduced  strain on social structure. From  all  these

considerations, therefore, Changi is  a  much  better

choice  than  Paya Lebar as a location for  our  main

international airport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the long-term future of the Changi Airport, the

Member for Anson is concerned as to why we moved  our

airport  from  Kallang to Paya Leban  and  from  Paya

Lebar to Changi and what comes next after Changi. The

Member  can be assured that Changi Airport  with  the

two runways and all the supporting facilities will be

able  to  handle  at least 30 million passengers  per

year, and this will meet the needs of Singapore up to

the  end  of this century. Provisions have been  made

for  further  extension of the Airport to  cater  for

further  increases  in traffic so  that  Changi  will

remain  our main international airport well into  the

21st century.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.

Could the Minister of State inform the House what  is

the projected number of aircraft expected to land  at

Paya Lebar by 1985, because this has got something to

do with the noise pollution aspect which he mentioned

just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Regarding the annual commercial

aircraft movement of arrivals and departures  at  our

Airport by 1985, I have not got the figures for 1985.

For 1982, the projected figure is 82,627.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Is it double the present figure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> The present number of aircraft

movement  is  59.000. This is the  expected  aircraft

movement for 1976.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the engineers at first said that the filling for Changi Airport was

not very strong. Therefore we have to go back to Paya

Lebar. But now the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



engineers say that it is very strong. When the Jumbo-jets  or  Concorde land at Changi Airport, the  earth

might sink! I am not objecting to the removal of  the

airport from Paya Lebar to Changi. I am objecting  to

the soil.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I can assure the Member

for Anson that the Jumbo-jets will not sink at Changi

airport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is

again a question of safety at the airport. I have had

occasion  to be present at the airport and I  noticed

that a certain aricraft was being serviced during  an

electrical  storm. When questioning the workers  with

regard  to  this,  I was given to understand  that  a

supervisor  urged  them to do  maintenance  work  and

servicing  it. Of course, this electrical storm  does

not occur frequently, but if it exists at the airport

it is very dangerous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was wondering if the Minister could take steps to

ensure  that  when such electrical  storms  do  occur

workers should not be asked to go out to service  the

airplanes. Or perhaps more hangars could be built  so

that  these  airplanes  could  be  brought  into  the

hangars where proper servicing could be conducted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I tend to agree with the

Member for Potong Pasir that where it is dangerous to

work  under  those conditions, perhaps the supervisor

should  exercise his discretion as to whether or  not

the  work  should  proceed. Of course,  in  cases  of

urgency where work has to be done, it is not just the

safety  of  the workers at the airport but  also  the

safety of the passengers arriving from overseas  that

has to be considered. If there are specific instances

of  incidents  which have attracted the attention  of

the  Member for Potong Pasir. I shall be happy if  he

could let me know and I shall look into the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in relation to the Minister of

State's remarks that Changi will be the main airport.

may I ask him this question? Does it imply that there

will be a continued and fairly intensive use of Paya



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



Lebar  Airport? Because my constituency lies directly

under the flight path of planes landing at Paya Leban

Airport,  I ask this question: what will be the  rate

of usage at Paya Lebar Airport?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir. Paya Lebar Airport will

continue to be intensively used. Perhaps I should say

that  the noise pollution will be much less than what

would  be expected because the noisier aircraft  will

be diverted to Changi.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I am glad that the Civil

Aviation  Department is looking into the  possibility

of  reorganising  the  taxi  service  at  Paya  Lebar

Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember making this suggestion of trolleys

sometime  in  1972  and  in  1974  50  trolleys  were

purchased. By the time I used the Arrival lounge last

year   there  were  hardly  20  serviceable  trolleys

around.  The very fact that it has been increased  by

200 this year, which is more than 200% from what were

available, that is a good sign. Perhaps every now and

then  one  ought to check whether these trolleys  are

serviceable  and  additional  trolleys,   should   be

purchased whenever necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those remarks, I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead EAA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Postal Department has now been reorganised

and  I  was  told  sometime  ago  that  it  would  be

converted  into a statutory board. May  I  know  when

this conversion will take place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the building of many new Housing Board flats

in  the  various  estates, it  is  evident  that  the

workload of the Postal Department has also increased.

I  am  told that there is a shortage of postal staff,

especially postmen. As a result, the workers have  to

work under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



stress  and  strain in order to provide an  efficient

service. I wonder what the Department is doing  about

recruiting more staff, especially postmen, to cope up

with  the increased workload. Can the Minister supply

some facts and figures on this subject?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recruitment of postwomen has in a way

lessened  the burden of postmen. The uniform  of  the

postwomen  appears to be neat, smart and  similar  to

the  postmen.  I  wonder  what  will  happen  if  the

postwomen   become  pregnant.  Did  the   authorities

consider  what  will  happen  then?  Is  the  present

uniform suited for the postwomen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that the function of delivering

PUB bills to consumers, which is normally done by the

Postal Department, may be taken over by the PUB Meter

Reading  Section.  May I seek clarification  on  this

subject?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Nelson Road Postal Centre has still

room for improvement. I have received complaints that

the  sorting frames appear to be untidy.  The  floors

are  dusty  and  dirty. The enclosure for  registered

items  is  not fully secured. Anyone can  just  climb

over  and fiddle with the registered items. The  rest

rooms  for  the staff are limited and  they  have  no

proper ventilation and oscillating fans are found  to

be dirty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the conditions at this Centre could be

improved  so that the postal staff could  work  in  a

better and meaningful environment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has

raised  a  few points. What he mentioned  earlier  is

true  -  that the National Productivity Board carried

out a study in 1971 on the structure and operation of

the  Postal Department. Following the study,  various

measures   to  reorganise  the  Department   and   to

streamline its operations were implemented.  However,

there is no proposal to convert the Department into a

statutory board in the near future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned about the staffing

strength   in   the  Postal  Department,   especially

postmen,  to  cope with the increasing workload.  The

Member   may  be  happy  to  note  that  more  staff.

especially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



postmen,  have  been  recruited,  The  establishment  has

increased  over  these years and perhaps  I  should  read

these  figures  to  him since he has asked  for  detailed

information.



<pre>

          Total            Postmen

       Establishment    Establishment



1972      1,434              526

1973      1,461              539

1974      1,461              564

1975      1,500              587

1976      1,531              614

</pre>



<br>The Postal Department reviews its manpower requirements

annually and recruitment exercises are conducted -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification. Sir, for

last year there were 743 Division IV officers and for

this year the provision is 770 Division IV officers.

Where did the Minister of State get the figure of 1,500-odd officers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I am giving him the total

establishment and the postmen establishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am only asking for the postmen

establishment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> The total number of postmen for

last  year  was 587. For the next financial  year,  there

will   be  614  postmen.  Sir,  as  I  said,  recruitment

exercises are conducted as and when necessary to fill all

the vacancies which arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the delivery of PUB bills, it is true that

the PUB has been using it staffs to deliver PUB bills  to

its consumers since July last year. Under the Post Office

Act  delivery of these items by the sender or  its  staff

employed for this purpose is permitted. However, it would

be  an offence for any person or firm to offer or perform

the  services  of collection, conveyance or  delivery  of

mails on behalf of other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the working conditions at Nelson Road Centre, I do

not  really quite agree with the Member for Anson because

I visited the place only two weeks ago. The place is kept

clean. Although the working condition is not first-class,

it is quite good. Ventilation-wise. It

is very satisfactory. It has got powerful fans located at

a  high  level. There are two restrooms provided for  the

staff and these rooms have louvred windows and there  are

also  fans  installed  to  provide  ventilation.  On  the

question of dirty fans. I will ask the Postmaster-General

to  look  into this, but during my last visit  I  thought

they were quite clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the enclosure for registered mail, it is not

true  to  say  that anyone can climb over the  fence  and

fiddle  with  the registered items. During working  hours

there  are  workmen  working within  the  enclosure  both

inside  and outside the place. So it is quite  safe.  But

during  the period when there are no staff working inside

the  enclosure, all  the registered mails  are  normally

sealed  up in bags and kept inside the covered enclosures

which  are fitted with locks. If there are other  further

improvements  that could be made. I would be  pleased  if

the Member for Anson could let me know so that I can take

the matter up again.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Postal Department is always conscious of the welfare

of  its  staff  and it has been regularly  reviewing  the

working environment of the department and other places of

work under its jurisdiction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the uniforms for postwomen, I am glad

that  the  Member  for  Anson finds the  present  uniform

suitable. As he has pointed out, the uniform is neat  and

smart. However, if a postwoman is in an advanced stage of

pregnancy,  arrangements will be made for her to  perform

lighter  indoor duties. She will naturally be allowed  to

wear her own maternity clothes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Just now I was drawing his attention

to  the  enclosures for registered mail section.  I  just

want  to  bring  to  the notice of the Minister  that  if

anything should happen to those letters, the staff should

not  be  made to suffer. That is the reason  why  I  have

brought  this matter to the attention of the Minister.  I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead FAA 1107*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs N. Govindasamy, Chin Harn Tong, Ivan Baptist and P. Govindaswamy.)





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask for some information arising out

of  my  scrutiny  of certain revenue accruing  to  the

Head,  Registrar of Vehicles, for the  composition  of

offences.  According  to  the  figures  which  I  have

garnered  for FY 76, the revenue anticipated  is  $1.1

million. For FY 75 it was $900,000. For FY 74  it  was

$830,000 and for FY 73 it was one-tenth of that,  i.e.

$80,000.  The  question is, to what extent  are  these

monies reflective of our policy of more efficient  and

greaten enforcement, and has this policy paid  out  in

the  reduction  of  accidents? If  one  looks  at  the

traffic, one has the impression that there is  a  very

slight, if at all, recognisable reduction in breaches

of traffic regulations, especially in respect of those

vehicles that I presume come under the jurisdiction of

the  Registrar of Vehicles. But I stand to be educated

by the Minister of State for Communications.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I merely

want  to  make a suggestion. When we were speaking  on

bus  services, a lot of bouquets were given to the 585

for the improvement of the bus service.

Although  the  bus  service has improved  tremendously

compared  with what it was a few years  ago,  a  large

measure  of  the contribution to this improvement  was

the  result  of the utilisation of Scheme B  buses  as

well  as  the City Shuttle Bus Service. Especially  in

the  housing estates like Telok Blangah, the  SBS  can

improve  its  services much more. But  understandably,

perhaps   at  the  moment  they  cannot  do  so   and.

therefore, the complementary transport system provided

by  the  Scheme B buses and the Shuttle Service  buses

are commendable. But unfortunately some restriction is

placed on the Scheme B buses and the City Shuttle  Bus

Service  in  respect of the period in which  they  can

operate.  I  do  appreciate that Scheme  B  buses  are

mainly  meant for transporting school children to  and

from schools. In spite of this there are other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>



periods  in  which  they can be much  more  profitably

used,  especially in housing estates where the SBS  is

not in a position to provide the sort of service which

the  residents expect. The Registry of Vehicles should

be  more flexible and allow the Scheme B buses and the

City  Shuttle Bus Service to operate even  beyond  the

time that they are allowed at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  in  order to ameliorate the traffic problem  the

ROV  has  placed more and more restrictions on private

motor cars and, as a result, public transport vehicles

will  now play an increasingly important role. On many

occasions the ROV has emphasised this fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is baffling is that although the ROV

has  emphasised  the  importance of  public  transport

vehicles, it has imposed restrictive measures on taxis

-  an  important  link in public transport  which  are

contrary  to  the  principles  mentioned  above.  With

regard  to surcharge on taxis, it was raised from  25%

in  1972 to 55% in 1974. It has now been raised  to  1

00%. What difference is there between private cars and

taxis?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of the ROV is to encourage more people to

use  public  transport.  But the  ROV  has,  in  fact,

applied  to  taxis  the  same  measures  used  against

private cars. Does it mean that taxis are not regarded

as  public transport vehicles? The ROy levies  an  ALS

fee which was originally $3 but subsequently raised to

$4  a  day  on  private cars entering CBD  during  the

morning  peak hours. Now this measure is also  applied

to  taxis. The purpose of levying such fee on  private

cars  is  to reduce the number of motor cars  entering

the  City area during such peak hours. But what is the

purpose of imposing such measure on taxis? We  do  not

quite  know. As we all know, when motorists and  their

fellow  passengers forgo the use of  their  cans  when

entering  the  CBD, they have of course to  depend  on

public   transport,  especially  taxis.  Under   these

circumstances, taxis, as a means for public transport,

should  be  actively encouraged to play  an  important

role.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> I then spoke on the problem of taxis

in Singapore which was elaborated on by many Members.

The  Minister for Finance did reply to me by assuring

me  that  the Government plans to do something  about

this  problem. However, he did not have the  time  to

elaborate,  and  it  would appear that  the  Minister

today will not have the time to eleborate too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is your point?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> I am most obliged. Sir, if the

Minister  could  at this juncture  elucidate  on  the

brief comments made by the Minister for Finance a few

days ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you

for  your  intervention. The question raised  by  the

Member  for Katong was on revenue from fines.  It  is

true  that the revenue from fines has increased. This

is   mainly  due  to  three  factors.  Firstly,  more

deterrents  and  higher composition fines  have  been

introduced.  Secondly, with the introduction  of  the

Traffic  Ticketing System since March last  year,  it

has  enabled  traffic  reports  to  be  settled  more

quickly  than  before. Thirdly, increased  efficiency

and the setting up of the Traffic Law Enforcement  by

the  Traffic  Police resulted in an increase  in  the

number of traffic offences reported. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



number  of  traffic offences reported  has  increased

from 121,648 in 1972 to 191.989 last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards road accidents, there has, in fact, been

a  decrease  in  road accidents. There were  slightly

more  than  36.000 accidents in 1972. But the  number

has  dropped to 31,506 in 1974 and 28,919 last  year.

This is also the result of the various measures taken

to  reduce road accidents, most notably the selective

enforcement policy, the points demerit system and the

enhancement  of  punishment  for  traffic  offenders.

Lastly there was the education campaign conducted  by

the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  cultivate  good

driving habits among motorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has raised the question

of  bus service in the new towns. As he will realise,

during  the transition period where people  are  just

starting to move in, it is not practical to provide a

full  public transport service in these new towns.  I

would agree with him that perhaps some Scheme B buses

or  the  City Shuttle Service buses can be introduced

into  the  new  towns.  This would  again  depend  on

whether the operators are keen to operate them.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> The hours of operation should be

extended.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Is the Member talking about

advancing the hours from 7.30 am, to before 7.30 am.?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> That is night.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> As the Member has mentioned, the

primary  function  of the school bus  service  is  to

provide transport for the school children. To advance

the  hours from 7.30 am, to before 7.30 am., no.  But

to  extend the Scheme B bus service after 9.30 am, is

a  question  of  demand  and  the  viability  of  the

service.  From what we know, the Scheme  B  operators

are  not interested in providing service after  those

hours. If they are prepared to provide the service, I

would  definitely ask the ROV to give  permission  to

provide the service after 9.30 am.
