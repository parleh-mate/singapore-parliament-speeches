<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>TOWN COUNCILS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Success in shaping social behaviour and attitude)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for National

Development since the setting up of town councils  to  manage

public  housing  estates  and  give  residents  the  kind  of

environment they prefer, (a) to what extent have  the  social

behaviour and attitude of residents been shaped by  the  town

councils;  and (b) has there been any survey done  to  assess

the  town  councils'  success in shaping such  behaviour  and

attitude.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Town Councils were formed

with   two   key   objectives:  firstly,   to   devolve   the

responsibility  for  estate  management  from  HDB  to  local

councils  and, secondly, to allow participation by  residents

in decision-making on local estate management matters.  These

objectives  have  been  met.  This is  evident  in  the  many

improvements made by Town Councils to the common property and

the  transformation  of  HDB  housing  estates  into  vibrant

communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial years, Town Councils focused on the

hardware aspect of estate management.  Their role has evolved

over   the   years  to  include  the  promotion   of   social

responsibility  and  community  bonding  amongst   residents,

through  close  collaboration with the Community  Development

Councils  and  other  grassroots organisations.   The  Annual

Island-Wide Cleanest Estate Competition and Annual Town  Days

are some examples of such collaborative efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of our surveys in the past has been on how

satisfied residents are with the maintenance of their estates

and  the  quality  of  the  services  provided  by  the  Town

Councils.   These  results have been positive  so  far.   For

example, in a survey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2279</b></font><br><br>



conducted  in  2000, 96.2% of the respondents  gave  a  "very

clean  or clean" rating to their towns, as compared  to  only

67.1%  in  1996.  Secondly, as far as enforcement actions  by

Town  Councils are concerned, 88% of the respondents  gave  a

"very  effective  or effective" rating as  compared  to  only

78.5% in the 1996 survey.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be more meaningful for Town Councils to conduct

specific  surveys to assess their own efforts  at  the  local

level in shaping social behaviour and attitude, so that  they

can   tailor  their  programmes  accordingly.   Several  Town

Councils, for example, Marine Parade, East Coast and  Bishan-Toa  Payoh,  have  in  fact taken the initiative  to  conduct

surveys on their own performance.  We would like to encourage

other Town Councils to follow their lead.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE AND SHANGHAI</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Comparison as a vibrant city)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and Industry (a) how is Singapore compared with Shanghai as a

vibrant city with a lot of "buzz" which is good for business,

and  (b)  how  do  we create and maintain  such  vibrancy  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I interpret Mrs Yu-Foo's question to

be about the competition between Singapore and Shanghai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If China continues on its path of economic growth,

Shanghai  will be one of the world's greatest cities  in  the

coming  decades.   In  many ways, it will  reclaim  its  pre-eminent position in Asia, which was its status in the 1930s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `buzz' in Shanghai is the result of the sheer

concentration  of  human  talent  there.   Even  before  Deng

Xiaoping's  reform  and opening up of  the  Chinese  economy,

Shanghai  contributed disproportionately to China's economic,

scientific, political, intellectual and cultural life.   Once

China opened up, Shanghai's natural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>



vitality   expressed  itself,  helped  by  a  very  competent

municipal leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mrs Yu-Foo worries whether Shanghai is a

competitive  threat to Singapore.  Well, in some sectors,  we

compete  as  we  do  with other cities.   But,  overall,  no.

Shanghai's  growth  and prosperity will  help  to  raise  the

entire region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hong Kong, the people there worry a lot about

Shanghai  because the two cities are geographically not  very

far  apart.   And after 1997, there is a feeling  among  Hong

Kongers that Shanghai is the eldest son on whom Beijing  will

shower the greatest favour.  For this reason, Chinese leaders

take  great pains to assure the people of Hong Kong that they

will be looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singapore, we are actually quite far away from

Shanghai.  It takes almost five hours to fly there  which  is

about  the same time it takes to fly from London to Jerusalem

or  from  Washington  to  Los Angeles.   Although  China  and

Southeast Asia compete for FDI, Singapore's relationship with

Shanghai is largely cooperative and complementary.  For  this

reason, we have been building up our presence in Shanghai and

around  Shanghai over the years.  One reason why  we  are  at

Suzhou is because of its proximity to Shanghai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we increase the `buzz' in Singapore? That really

is  the  objective of the ERC and our other efforts to remake

Singapore.  The key is our economy.  To stay competitive,  we

must keep taxes low, improve our infrastructure, simplify our

regulations, educate our people, train and retrain  ourselves

continuously,   bring   in  international   talent,   protect

property,   including  intellectual  property,  and   develop

broadband  economic  connectivity with  our  Southeast  Asian

neighbours and with the US, Europe, Japan, China,  India  and

Australia.   And that is the reason why we are now  embarking

on  so  many FTAs.  Being an independent city-state, we  will

always  be  more  cosmopolitan and outward-looking  than  any

other  city  in Asia, including Shanghai.  This  cosmopolitan

spirit  must  also  be  expressed  in  our  intellectual  and

cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>



life.   Our  promotion of the arts is an  essential  part  of

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shanghai is the economic, intellectual and cultural

centre  of China.  We must ensure that we keep our  place  as

one of the key economic, intellectual and cultural centres in

Southeast  Asia.   Provided we do  that,  Singapore  will  be

useful to Shanghai, as Shanghai is useful to Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>BOOSTER SEAT REQUIREMENT FOR ADULTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Rationale)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  (a)  what is the rationale for enforcing  a  booster

seat  requirement for adults below 1.5 metres  in  height  as

part of the seat belt rule; and (b) whether his Ministry  has

ensured that the market is able to supply the booster seats.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir,

it  is  a misconception that adults below the height  of  1.5

metres  must  use  a booster seat.  The correct  position  is

this.  Persons who are eight years or older but who are below

the  height of 1.5 metres are, in fact, exempted from  having

to  belt up.  It is unsafe for any person below 1.5 metres in

height  to wear a body restraining seat belt in a vehicle  as

the  shoulder  part of the belt would be placed  against  the

person's  neck  instead of lying over the shoulder.   In  the

event of an accident, the seat belt may strangle him or  her.

However, parents of children above eight years old and  young

teenagers  who are below 1.5 metres in height, are encouraged

to use booster seats to elevate the seating position of their

children so that the seat belts may be strapped safely across

the shoulder.  For the same reason, adults below 1.5 metre in

height are also encouraged to use booster seats so that  they

may strap up safely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, children below the age of eight years must be

properly  secured by an approved child restraint.   This  has

been  the  requirement  since 1993.  Many  parents  who  were

concerned for the safety of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>



their  children  had already purchased the child  restraints.

However,  there  were many others who started looking  around

for  a child restraint only after Police announced that  they

would tighten enforcement action against those who flout  the

rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police had anticipated the likely increase in

demand  for  child  restraints.  In May  this  year,  it  had

advised major retailers to keep sufficient stocks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police is monitoring the stock levels at major

retail  outlets.   Child restraints are  temporarily  out  of

stock  while booster seats are still available in the market.

New supplies are expected in a week's time.  In the meantime,

Traffic  Police  will  continue to advise  motorists  of  the

safety measures required for young passengers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to

confirm once again that for a child above eight years old, it

is  not compulsory for the child to use a booster seat  or  a

car seat.  Is that true?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Provided he is a short child.

If  he is below 1.5 metres in height, then he is not required

to use a booster seat or a child seat.  The position is this.

A  child  who  is  below eight years old  must  use  a  child

restraint.  A child who is above eight years old, but who  is

below  1.5  metres,  need not use a  child  restraint  nor  a

booster seat, although he is encouraged to do so.

<div align="center"><b>LINKS ISLAND SHARES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assistance to affected investors)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance (a) what avenues  of  help

are  available for investors, who are caught by the Singapore

Exchange Settlement Committee's decision on the Links  Island

shares  and  who are forced to pick up the trades  that  they

have  sold per contra before the suspension; and (b)  whether

there  is  a  fund  to help such affected  investors  and  to

prevent  the  broking firms from taking legal action  against

them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, before the Minister replies, I would  like  to

again declare my interest as regards Question No. 4.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in July last year, SGX

announced that its investigations had revealed that a  corner

situation had arisen in Links shares.  In accordance with the

SGX  Rules,  the  SGX Settlement Committee decided  that  all

outstanding market trades in Links shares done during 14-16th

August 2000 be settled by way of cash instead of delivery, at

the fair settlement price of $1.21.  This ruling also applied

to  sale transactions by contra traders who had bought  Links

shares  before 14th August 2000 and sold those shares  during

14-16th August 2000.  As a result, such contra traders had to

pick up and pay for the shares they bought because their sale

transactions, like all other market trades during the period,

had been settled in cash instead of by delivery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some brokers have indicated to SGX that they are

prepared   to  extend  credit  to  help  ease  any   cashflow

difficulties  faced by such investors.  Others  have  allowed

their  clients  to  pay for the shares by  instalments.   MAS

encourages  such flexibility on the part of the  brokers,  so

long  as  they  comply  with  regulatory  requirements.   MAS

cannot, however, require or compel all brokers to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another proposal was for SGX to use its fidelity fund to

help the affected investors.  This is not legally possible as

the  Securities Industry Act stipulates that the fund may  be

used only to compensate investors in the event of defalcation

by a broker or to pay creditors when a broker winds up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX has informed the company that it is prepared to

allow  Links  shares to resume trading provided  the  company

puts  in  place safeguards to prevent the counter from  being

cornered again.  One of the safeguards that the parties are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>



discussing is for the company to restore its free float to an

appropriate  level.  The company's free float had  fallen  to

less than 8% (below the minimum 10% required by SGX Rules) at

the time of Links' trading suspension in August 2000.  If the

company  can  meet  SGX's requirements and trading  in  Links

shares  resumes, contra traders with Links shares  will  have

the opportunity to sell their Links shares.  But there is  no

guarantee  that they will be able to sell their Links  shares

at the prices prevailing before the trading suspension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contra trader should always be prepared to fork out

the  full amount for his share purchases and not rely on  the

proceeds from subsequent sale to pay for them.  Apart from  a

corner  situation  where  the  SGX  Rules  provide  for  cash

settlement  of  outstanding market trades at fair  settlement

price,  there  are  other risks that contra investors  should

take  into  account  before engaging in contra  transactions.

For  instance, if trading in the counter should be  suspended

for  a  few  days  (either by the listed company  or  SGX  as

provided for under the SGX Rules), before the investor  could

contra  his outstanding purchases, he would have to  pay  for

the shares in full.  Or if the share price fell sharply after

the investor had bought his shares, he would have to sell off

the  shares  at  a  loss  if  he  could  not  pay  for  them.

Therefore,  it is not prudent for an investor to over-stretch

himself  by  relying on contra trades to pay  for  his  share

purchases.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, regarding contra trades,

the  trades were actually done within the three days and  the

client would have assumed that they had already been settled.

But  it  was suspended, and after one year the Stock Exchange

came  and said that the trades were actually nullified  under

the  settlement  process.   So it was  not  that  the  contra

traders  did not prepare for it.  They actually prepared  for

it  but  the  market had fallen in the one year and  whatever

savings  they had to buy the shares had already been depleted

by  the market.  My question to the Minister is that, in  the

last three days of trading, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2285</b></font><br><br>



stock  prices would actually have gone up, implying that  the

syndicates had bought more shares to corner the company.   So

if  the Stock Exchange had nullified the trading by requiring

that  it  be  settled in cash, would it  not  be  giving  the

syndicates an easy escape route?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are ways to

deal  with  a corner situation.  This is a problem which  can

arise in any stock market, and there are established ways  to

deal  with it.  There is no totally satisfactory way because,

by  definition, in a corner situation, there are  not  enough

shares  to go around.  People have committed to deliver  more

shares  than  are available because people have shorted,  and

now they cannot get hold of shares for delivery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like playing musical chairs - ten people running

around,  nine chairs to sit upon, and the music has  stopped.

Now,  you say, "I am going to sit in this chair", or "I  have

already "choped" this chair.  Therefore, let me do that,  and

let  everybody else settle on their own."  But you cannot  do

that  because you may have "choped" this, somebody  else  may

say,  "Well,  I am waiting for you to do this to settle,  and

there  is  a chance I can settle in scrip too."  So  finally,

the  most  equitable arrangement which is fair  both  to  the

people  who are long in the shares and who are short  in  the

shares is to say, "There are not enough to go around, we will

establish a fair price that the committee sets.  They  decide

what  the  amount is and, at that price, we settle in  cash."

And  later on, if the shares trade again, at that point,  you

buy  and  sell the shares for whatever they are worth.   Now,

the music has stopped, we settle in cash at a price which  is

fair to both who are long and who are short.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duration of the suspension was not something which

the  Stock Exchange wanted to do.  It was something which was

unavoidable given the complexities of the investigation  into

the  case  because,  in  this case,  many  shareholders  were

involved  and  the Stock Exchange and CAD had to  investigate

the relationship between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>



them to establish whether or not they were acting in concert,

and  whether or not a corner situation existed.  So they took

one whole year to establish this.  And finally, they declared

that  the  corner  situation existed, not because  they  were

sitting around, but because investigations were complicated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of this happening is always there. When you

enter  into a contra trade, you hope that you would not  have

to  pay in full for the shares which you have already bought,

and  that  you can sell them off and contra it.  But  between

the  buying and the contra, several days pass and things  can

happen in between which can frustrate that matching.  And  in

this  case,  something did happen.  The Stock Exchange  acted

according  to its rules which are published.  So  before  you

enter into a contra trade, everybody must know that there  is

a  risk  of the stock being suspended, and especially in  the

case of Links Island, where the prices had been going up, all

the  more,  anybody  who  goes  in  knows  that  this  is   a

speculative punt, and you are taking a risk.  So I think that

the Stock Exchange did the right thing.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> May I clarify with the

Minister?   Is it not more equitable to require  all  trades,

whether  before the suspension or during the  three  days  of

trading,  to be dealt through the normal settlement  process?

That  means,  those who have bought and sold accordingly  are

due,  whether  they sold the shares, they have  to  get  them

delivered,  or if they have bought, they have to pay,  rather

than  having a retrospective step of removing the three  days

and  say  that  all trades done during that particular  three

days be nullified.  Is it not equitable in that sense?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are on a T-plus-3 settlement. So those are trades which have not been

closed,  which  are still open.  At the point of  suspension,

these are trades which are left hanging and you have to  find

some ways to settle it.  As I explained, you cannot settle in

stock.   Therefore, some price has to be established and,  in

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2287</b></font><br><br>



case, the committee established a fair market price.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Can I clarify with the

Minister again?  Why did SGX take the three days?  Why did it

not  take  T-plus-4, the four days trade, or  the  two  days'

trade,  or  just on Wednesday itself, instead of  having  the

three days' trade?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure

whether the question is why are we averaging over three days,

or  why are we nullifying the trades over three days.  If you

ask  why  we  are nullifying over three days, the  answer  is

because those were the trades which were not closed, they had

not settled, because we are on a T-plus-3 settlement.  So any

time,  when  you  intervene, you have three  days'  worth  of

transaction  which you have to clean up.  As for  the  price,

what  is  a  fair price?  It is for the committee to  decide.

They  deliberated  and they decided that they  would  average

over three days.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, if I may clarify further

that  it is actually T-plus-3.  So it is four days of  trade,

and  not three days.  Effectively, the Stock Exchange is only

using  three days which is, if the stock is bought on Friday,

it  is  still not closed for that matter.  I think the  Stock

Exchange has not used the correct calculation, when they used

only three days.  They should have used four days instead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> That is a different issue which the

Member  is  raising.  His first question was  why  not  allow

people  who  have  stock  to settle  in  stock,  and  I  have

explained that.  Now he is asking whether we can go  on  four

days,  instead of three.  These are technical issues which  I

will leave to the Stock Exchange to settle.

<div align="center"><b>ODD LOT TRADING MARKET AND MAIN MARKET</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Merger)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance (a) if there are plans  to

merge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>



the  odd  lot  trading  market with the  main  board  in  the

Singapore Exchange; (b) if there are, when; and (c) if  there

are  none,  will  the Minister enlighten the  House  and  the

investing public the rationale for continuing to keep the odd

lot market separate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, SGX does not

currently have any plans to merge the odd lot trading  market

with the main market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, SGX sets a minimum board lot size for every

company listed on the Exchange.  The usual board lot size  is

1,000  shares, although smaller board lot sizes are  normally

allowed for counters with a share price of more than $10.  In

the  case of SingTel, board lots of 10 shares and 100  shares

have  been provided so that Singaporeans who received  shares

during SingTel's initial public offer in 1993 can trade those

shares and the resulting bonus shares easily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standardised board lots facilitate trading among

investors.  Otherwise, it would be difficult to match  buyers

and  sellers  of  odd numbers of shares.   SGX  has  received

feedback  that  abolishing minimum board lots could  increase

the  cost of trading as investors may then have to enter into

multiple transactions to effect a single sale or purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, abolishing minimum board lots could result in

listed  companies  having large numbers of shareholders  each

holding  a  small number of shares.  This could increase  the

cost  of  shareholder communication (eg, printing and sending

annual  reports  and shareholder circulars)  for  our  listed

companies significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other major exchanges, such as the New York Stock

Exchange and NASDAQ, also prescribe minimum board lots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that a large number of our listed companies trade

at  less  than $1.00 per share, the usual board lot  size  of

1,000 shares is not likely to prevent the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>



investing public from participating in the stock market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, SGX recognises that investors may

sometimes  receive odd lots, for example, as a  result  of  a

bonus  issue,  or  rights issue, by the listed  company.   To

enable investors to trade their odd lots, SGX provides an odd

lot  market.   Currently, the odd lot market lacks  liquidity

because it is difficult to find an exact match between buyers

and sellers of odd numbers of shares.  This is unlike the odd

lot  markets on New York Stock Exhange and NASDAQ where there

are  market makers and specialists who stand ready to buy  up

odd  lots  to form round lots for subsequent sale.   Further,

the  introduction of a minimum commission  of  $30  has  made

trading  of odd lots of small numbers of shares uneconomical.

SGX   is   currently   holding  discussions   with   industry

practitioners with a view to overcoming these difficulties.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEME</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of income criterion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a) whether his Ministry will review the income criterion for

application  of  the Ministry's Financial  Assistance  Scheme

(FAS) including the FAS for Independent Schools;  and (b) how

many  schools  have their own FAS with different  eligibility

criteria.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  income  criteria  for  the  Ministry  of

Education's  Financial Assistance Scheme  is  pegged  to  the

MCDS' Public Assistance Scheme.  When MCDS revises the Public

Assistance  criteria, MOE will also review the  criteria  for

its Financial Assistance Scheme for Government and Government-aided   schools.    The  Financial  Assistance   Scheme   for

Independent schools will also be included in this review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Ministry's Financial Assistance Scheme, all

schools - Government, Government-aided and Indepen-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>



dent - also administer their own financial assistance schemes

through  their  School Advisory Committees (SACs)  or  School

Management   Committees  (SMCs).   Individual   Advisory   or

Management  Committees  set their  own  eligibility  criteria

according   to  the  requirements  of  their  students.    In

addition,   our  CDCs,  CCCs,  other  community  groups   and

Voluntary  Welfare Organisations (VWOs) also have  their  own

assistance  schemes  for  school  going  children  and  their

families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No child is denied an education because of financial

difficulties.   Our  schools will help  all  those  who  need

financial assistance.  Parents should approach the principals

should they encounter any difficulties in their school fees.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Sir, when was the scheme

last reviewed?  Would the Ministry not consider that $800  is

actually  too  low particularly for families  who  have  more

children or ageing parents to support?  Definitely, we should

consider  using per capita family income instead.  And  would

the  Ministry  consider making available the  list  of  those

schools  with additional Financial Assistance Scheme for  all

the  MPs  so  that  they  can better  serve  and  help  their

residents who need this scheme?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the scheme

was  revised  in  April  last year.  When  MCDS  revises  its

criteria,  we will do accordingly.  This scheme  is  not  the

only  way  in which we are assisting pupils.  To begin  with,

schooling in Singapore is almost completely subsidised.   The

cost  recovery rates are very low.  I mentioned the range  of

schemes available through the community, and through all  the

schools.  We also have the Edusave Merit Bursary which is for

pupils  doing well and who fall below a certain income  band.

That  covers  quite a broad percentage of our  students.   If

there  is any student, or family, who still faces difficulty,

they  can  approach their MP who, I am sure,  will  be  quite

willing to see how he can be assisted.

<div align="center"><b>STATUTORY CORPORATIONS (CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>12.55 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend the Financial

Procedure  Act and various other written laws to  enable  the

Government to fund statutory boards through the injection  of

capital,  instead  of being restricted to funding  them  only

through  grants.  The injection will be made out  of  capital

contributions appropriated by Parliament.

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, statutory corporations are given direct

capital  grants, funded out of Government revenue to  finance

their  development projects.  They are not  charged  for  the

capital  provided  to  them.  As  a  result  of  this  "free"

endowment of capital, some agencies might not fully economise

on  the  use  of  capital or make effective  choices  between

capital and other financial resources.  The best way to bring

about  proper  accountability for the use of  capital  is  to

introduce  a  debt-equity financing  structure  in  statutory

corporations  as in the case of companies.   This  Bill  will

help  to  bring about such a market-based financing structure

by  making  it  possible  for all statutory  corporations  to

receive "equity" or capital injection from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides capital injection, statutory corporations should

also  be  allowed  to  more freely  take  up  debt  financing

options,  such as loans and bonds.  This funding approach  is

also in line with the recommendation by the ERP Sub-committee

on  Policies Related to Taxation, CPF System, Wages and Land,

for   the   Government  to  use  the  capital  markets   more

extensively to finance bankable projects.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital grants to statutory corporations are currently

given  in  the  form of a single upfront cash  outlay.   This

results  in lumpy Government spending.  With the new  funding

framework, payment for capital assets would be spread out  as

annual  operating  subventions over the useful  life  of  the

assets.  This is no different from the Government renting  or

leasing  the  asset.  It gives a proper matching between  the

use of the assets and the costing of services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some statutory corporations have developmental

objectives.    Capital   injections   into   such   statutory

corporations   would  be  funded  out  of  the  Developmental

Investment Fund as some returns would be expected from  them.

However,  there  are other statutory corporations  which  are

purely   regulatory  in  nature.   For  these,  the   capital

injections would be funded out of the annual budget voted  by

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now proceed to explain the specific provisions

of the Bill which are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the amendment of the Financial Procedure Act.

The   Financial  Procedure  Act  is  amended  by   inserting,

immediately  after  section 7, a new  section  7A.   The  new

section  will empower the Minister for Finance to  invest  by

way of capital injection in any statutory corporation out  of

a  capital contribution appropriated by Parliament  from  the

Consolidated   Fund.    The  Minister  for   Finance,   after

consultation   with   the   Minister   charged    with    the

responsibility for the statutory corporation concerned,  will

determine  the terms and conditions under which  the  capital

injection under the section shall be made.

<br><br><i>Consequential amendments to other written laws</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-seven Acts would be amended to allow the statutory

corporations constituted under the relevant Acts  to  receive

capital injections from the Government, in return for  shares

or other securities issued to the Minister for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last two weeks of debates, I gave my views

about  the Government's involvement in business; particularly

when  statutory  boards  get into businesses  which  in  turn

compete  with  the private sector, it creates a  very  unfair

situation  simply because, as a regulator and a  facilitator,

the  statutory boards will no doubt favour its own  companies

or companies owned by other statutory boards.  This situation

of  an unlevel playing field is further worsened by the  easy

access  to  cheap funds by statutory boards, especially  when

the  funds come from the Government's budget.  Because of  an

easier   than   market-practice  advantage,  it   is   easily

understandable  why such statutory-board-operated  businesses

or  GLCs can easily defeat companies from the private  sector

when they compete with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed changes, statutory boards will be

compelled  to make decisions along market-accepted  practices

and  will  force  them to make assessments of projects  along

commercial terms.  I believe, in the long term, it will  make

the  statutory boards much stronger and much more  efficient,

because they will no longer have a well-cushioned environment

and  will no longer have access to easy money and, therefore,

will have to sharpen their competencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one concern and two questions for the Minister.

The  first concern is that, as the statutory boards will  now

be  required to raise funds commercially in some cases, I  am

concerned that some statutory boards may take the opportunity

to increase Government charges and fees, which are already  a

cause  for  concern.  I would expect that, in the long  term,

with  commercial financing, the statutory boards will  become

much more efficient, and this should result in lower and  not

higher  costs  and,  therefore, lower charges.   I  hope  the

Minister  can  assure  the House that this  change  will  not

result   in  a  round  of  increases,  resulting  in   higher

Government fees and charges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions I have are: first of all, can the Minister

elaborate  on how the equity structure will work, perhaps  by

way  of  some examples?  Will the statutory boards  now  look

like  GLCs?   Secondly, for the debt financing  option,  will

each statutory board be required to go to commercial banks or

will  there  be a special channel for them?  In other  words,

will they be treated like any commercial entity?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill is a good start to how the Government

should  be repositioning itself, as we try to create a  level

playing field and a more entrepreneurial Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing me to join in the debate.  I  support  the

Bill and I understand the rationale mentioned by the Minister

for Finance.  However, I notice that in the Schedule, some of

the   statutory   boards,  such  as  the  universities,   the

polytechnics and the People's Association, are also  provided

for.   So, I wonder whether these statutory boards will  also

be  given  shares or capital grants, as proposed by him,  and

whether   they  will,  in  turn,  be  subject  to   financial

pressures, especially those educational institutions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I address the

concern expressed by Mr Inderjit Singh as well as Dr Wang Kai

Yuen whether, as a result of this change, fees will increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think these are two separate questions: the degree to

which  we  want to subsidise an activity and how we  want  to

fund  the  activity.  We can fund the statutory  board  by  a

grant but, if we do not subsidise the activity, the statutory

board  still has to recover the cost of providing the service

in  order  to  repay the Government, or we  can  fund  it  by

equity,  which  is an option we will now  have.   But  if  we

decide to subsidise the activity, we can subsidise it as  the

activity is provided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The universities, the polytechnics and the People's

Association (PA), which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>



mentioned  by Dr Wang Kai Yuen, are a good example where,  if

we decide to give them equity that has nothing to do with how

much we decide we want to recover from tertiary education  or

whether  the  PA  is meant to break even, because  these  are

institutions  with educational and social missions,  and  the

subsidy policy there is something which is separate and which

is   not  going  to  change  as  a  result  of  this  funding

arrangement.  It does not mean we have decided  that  we  are

going   to   put   equity  into  the  universities   or   the

polytechnics, but it gives us the flexibility to do so should

we need to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there may be occasions in some cases where, as a

result  of  going to an equity framework, we may discover  in

fact  that the statutory board has been receiving an indirect

subsidy  or  an  implicit subsidy because  it  had  not  been

costing  its services properly.  In which case, we will  have

to  ask  ourselves do we now want to make it explicit and  we

subsidise  it,  or  do  we think it  is  not  justified  and,

therefore, we will stop subsidising it over a period of time.

I  am  speaking hypothetically.  I do not have  any  specific

examples, but these are issues which we will have to  address

explicitly, and the more transparent we can be, the better it

is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, as Mr Inderjit Singh has pointed out, with an

equity  framework, it is more likely that all the costs  will

be  laid  bare,  it is more likely that the statutory  boards

will  have  an  incentive  to  operate  efficiently  like   a

commercial  company  and,  therefore,  provide  services   at

minimum cost and maximum value to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked also for some examples of how

the equity structure would work.  I can give him one example,

which is the Civil Service College which was set up as a self-financing statutory board last year, because it is  not  just

running  courses  in-house, but it is also providing  courses

externally.   Even  when  it runs  courses  in-house,  it  is

charging Ministries and statutory boards for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>



courses  which  it  provides.   So  it  is  a  self-financing

statutory board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new funding framework, the Civil Service

College can either use equity or debt to raise funds for  its

development projects.  For example, if it needs a new set  of

college buildings, the college buildings will be held on  its

books  as  its  assets  and  against  liabilities,  and   the

liabilities will be equity which has been injected  into  the

statutory  board.  It will no longer receive  capital  grants

from  the  Government because, previously, if we  gave  it  a

capital  grant, it bought the building, the building did  not

appear  in anybody's balance sheet, and we are not accounting

according to proper commercial principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Civil Service College chooses to raise funds

through  equity, then it would have to apply to the  Ministry

of  Finance  for  capital injection.  The  capital  injection

would be funded out of the Developmental Investment Fund  and

would  be  subject  to the provisions of the  DIF  Act  which

requires "the Minister or a responsible Minister to establish

and  adhere  to  investment policies and adopt standards  and

procedures that a reasonable, prudent person would apply to a

portfolio of investments to avoid undue risk of loss  and  to

obtain  a  reasonable  return."  The Civil  Service  College,

after  receiving the equity injection, would be  required  to

issue share certificates to the Government in return for this

injection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked the question as to whether

statutory boards will now have to go to commercial banks  and

will there be a special channel for them.  The answer is that

the  statutory boards that want to raise funds  through  debt

financing can do so by taking up commercial bank loans or  by

issuing  bonds, just like any corporate entity, or  they  can

approach  the Ministry of Finance for loans, but  such  loans

will  be  charged  interest  rates comparable  to  commercial

rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising debt financing from the market or borrowing from

banks is not a new option for statutory boards.  JTC, HDB and

LTA have been raising bonds regularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>



to  finance  their  operations.  In fact,  we  encourage  the

statutory   boards,  where  possible,  to   raise   financing

commercially  rather  than falling back  on  the  Government,

because then we can be quite sure that when they say it is  a

commercial  rate, that is the rate which is offered  by  some

lender, whereas, if they come back to the Government, we will

have to estimate the rate and we may get it wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Lee Hsien Loong].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend the Government

Securities  Act  (GSA)  to  allow  the  Government  to  issue

Government securities with early redemption features.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 2001, the Government set up the New Singapore

Shares  (NSS)  Fund to issue NSS to Singapore citizens.   The

intention was for the NSS Fund to invest in Special Singapore

Government  Securities.   As NSS  holders  can  withdraw  the

shares  any  time they wish before they mature  in  2007,  an

early   redemption  feature  is  required  for  the   Special

Singapore  Government Securities issued to the NSS  Fund,  so

that  they  can match the early encashment of NSS.   The  GSA

currently does not allow for the issuance of securities  with

early redemption features. All issues of Singapore Government

Securities  today carry a pre-specified interest rate  and  a

pre-specified  maturity period.  Trying to  match  the  early

redemption cash requirements of the NSS



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>



with   fixed   maturity   Singapore   Government   Securities

introduces unnecessary complications and uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall now proceed to explain the key

provisions of the Bill, which are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Clause 2: Payment of Interest

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 23 of the GSA to allow the

payment   of  a  portion  of  the  half-yearly  interest   on

Government  securities when any Government security  that  is

redeemable at any time and at the election of the  holder  is

redeemed   before  its  maturity.   The  interest   will   be

calculated on a pro-rata basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Clause 3: Redemption of Government Securities

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 24 of the GSA to provide for the

redemption  of  the new class of Government  securities.  The

amendment  provides  that  these  Government  securities  are

redeemable  at  par on their maturity date or the  redemption

date  specified by the holder in the notice of  intention  to

redeem, whichever is earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].

<div align="center"><b>POLICE FORCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before 1st October 2001, there were two principal

schemes of service in the Internal Security Department (ISD),

namely,  the Intelligence Service and Senior Police  Officers

Scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of police officers in ISD is something

which  was carried over from the Department's Police  Special

Branch since 1948.  These police officers' main duties are to

conduct  investigations  which require  police  powers.   The

existence  of different service schemes in the Department  is

not  ideal.   It gave rise, over time, to issues of  internal

relativities, as each scheme has its own terms and conditions

of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, ISD decided to combine the two schemes of

service  into  one, the Intelligence Service.   A  conversion

exercise  was carried out and serving senior police  officers

were  invited  to be emplaced on the Intelligence  scheme  of

service.  This enables the Department to attract, retain  and

develop  suitable  and  capable  officers  and  manage  their

careers.  More than 94% of the senior police officers took up

the  offer  and were converted to the Intelligence scheme  of

service with effect from 1st October last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill proposes amendments to the Police Force

Act to enable officers, who perform investigation duties,  to

continue to do so with the necessary police powers which they

had  before  the conversion into the Intelligence  scheme  of

service.  The purposes of the amendments are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to confer on designated intelligence officers the

police  powers of investigation under the Criminal  Procedure

Code  or  any other written law as the Minister may prescribe

by notification in the Gazette;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to provide immunities for these officers relating

to  acts  done  under the authority of a  warrant.   This  is

similar  to  the protection afforded to all police  officers;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to confer on senior police intelligence officers

the  powers  of an Assistant Superintendent of  Police  or  a

Superintendent  of  Police under  such  written  law  as  the

Minister may prescribe by notification in the Gazette.   This

is  to  allow  these officers to exercise certain  provisions

under the Internal Security Act. For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>



example, an officer of the rank of ASP and above can detain a

person  for  up  to  48 hours from the time  of  arrest.   An

officer of the rank of Superintendent and above can authorise

further  detention  of  up to 28 days.   Beyond  28  days  of

detention,  the  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  has  to  grant

approval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intelligence officers to be designated are

those  doing work that require police powers of investigation

and  will include former police officers who converted to the

Intelligence Service.  This enables the officers to  continue

to  carry  out  their  operational and  investigative  duties

effectively,   even  after  they  have   converted   to   the

Intelligence Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand  that  the proposed amendments  to  the  Act  will

effectively  give  absolute discretion  to  the  Minister  in

deciding which intelligence officers will be conferred powers

equivalent to those of a Police Inspector or ASP.   Also,  in

the Minister's discretion, these officers would be deemed  to

be police officers under the ISA.  These discretionary powers

include  appointment  of intelligence officers  who  are  not

former police officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, police powers are very wide. In the context of

investigations,  these  include  powers  to  arrest,   summon

witnesses  for the recording of statements, compel  banks  to

produce confidential financial statements of their customers,

walk  into  premises upon suspicion of certain  offences  and

seize properties, etc.  There are some areas of concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, will there be officers without police

training who will be conferred police powers?  If this is so,

my  question is:  why is there a need to extend these  powers

to  those  without police training and experience?  Are  they

qualified  to  exercise  such  powers,  which  have  a  great

potential  to  be  used as a repressive  tool?   Can  we  not

restrict  officers  who  can  be gazetted  to  former  police

officers who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>



have crossed over to the Intelligence Service?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, should their conferred police powers be

commensurate with the rank structure?  I am of the view  that

there should be some restrictions on the equivalent ranks  of

intelligence  officers  who can exercise  equivalent  powers.

The Criminal Procedure Code sets qualifying ranks to exercise

certain  powers,  for example, recording of  statements  from

suspects  can  only  be  done by  Sergeants  and  above,  and

compelling banks to supply confidential information can  only

be  done  by  an  Inspector,  etc.   By  allowing  a  blanket

provision  and conferring the powers of an Inspector  to  the

officers  that  the  Minister  can  designate,  are  we   not

potentially  allowing for a situation where the Minister  can

designate  officers who are very junior and inexperienced  or

ill-trained to exercise such wide powers?  This may, in fact,

undermine the integrity of Government as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is: how is the public protected from

the  abuse  of  powers by these intelligence officers?    For

police  officers,  the procedure for the public  to  complain

against abuse of authority or malpractices is clear.  One can

sue,   make  a  complaint  which  may  lead  to  disciplinary

proceedings before the Police Disciplinary Board.   If  there

is  a  grievance  against an intelligence officer  exercising

those  police  powers, what would be the  channel  of  public

recourse?   The  Act  is not amended to subject  intelligence

officers to the same disciplinary process.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a bit concerned

about   the  Minister  changing  this  Act  to  empower   the

intelligence officers just because the scheme of service  has

been  changed.  Perhaps, it would have been better to  change

the scheme of service to attract the officers as intelligence

officers without changing the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also quite concerned that, in my mind, we are

a  bit  confused  about  what are intelligence  officers  and

police officers.  To me, police officers are law



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>



enforcement  officers. They are well-trained  and  understand

the  law  very well.  Whereas, in the general public's  mind,

intelligence  officers can be considered as spies.   That  is

what the public thinks.  We are a bit concerned as to why  we

should  designate  intelligence officers and  give  them  the

powers of police officers when it can be done otherwise.  The

other point has already been brought up by Mr Low.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think the underlying concern in the

two  Members'  question  is:  why do  we  now  need  to  give

intelligence officers such police powers? The Members may not

have understood what I was just talking about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before 1st October 2001, intelligence officers were

confined  to  those civilians in the ISD.  And  we  have,  on

secondment from the police force, a certain number of  senior

police  officers  who perform investigative  and  operational

duties.   For these police officers, because they are already

police officers, they have powers of investigation like other

police  officers.  What we try to do in this exercise  is  to

provide for one scheme of service so that, while we have  two

groups  of  officers  working in the same  department,  maybe

doing the same job, they do not have the inequitable position

whereby one has a higher salary than the other, and one has a

different  rate  of progression than the other,  and  so  on.

That is good for morale because if we have only one scheme of

service, then everybody progresses, depending on performance,

instead  of  depending on their scheme of service.   We  have

situations where police officers in ISD thought that they  do

not  advance  as  fast  as  those  officers  working  in  the

Singapore  Police  Force.  We want  to  avoid  this  kind  of

situation  and  therefore provide  for  a  common  scheme  of

service in the Intelligence Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this amendment is not to grant all

intelligence officers police powers although the Minister may

designate who to grant such powers.  By "designate", it  just

means  that  so  and  so officer is given  police  powers  to

perform his operational and investigative duties.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>



Will  the  Minister so blindly appoint any person,  a  junior

person,  which  is Mr Low's concern, to be  a  senior  police

officer  performing those duties if he  is  not  trained?   I

think it will be foolish of any Minister for Home Affairs  or

any  department  head of ISD to make such  a  recommendation.

Certainly, the concern of abuse may arise if people  are  not

trained,  if they do not know their duties and if they  think

that just because they have police powers, they can arrest or

detain  and search anyone and go into anybody's house.   That

is  not the state of affairs in our Intelligence Service, nor

is it the state of affairs in our police force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members and others who may feel that way

that  not  all  intelligence officers are given such  powers.

Only  those  who  are currently performing investigation  and

operational duties, and they were former police officers  who

have  converted into the Intelligence scheme of service, will

be so designated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, we will recruit directly into the

Intelligence Service.  What happens to these new officers  in

the  Intelligence  Service  who are  not  trained  as  police

officers?  It is just like our Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB)

officers.   They are given police powers but they go  through

the  training  of  a police officer to make  sure  that  they

understand  the  Penal Code, the Evidence Act,  the  Criminal

Procedure  Code and all relevant laws that are necessary  for

them  to  perform their duties.  Similarly, for  intelligence

officers,  in  future,  if  they  are  recruited   into   the

Intelligence Service, but they do not have a police officer's

background, they will be sent for training before  they  will

be  appointed  to perform such a duty.  No Minister  will  be

foolish enough to allow anyone to abuse his powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the channel of complaint? Like all civil

servants,   they  are  subject  to  disciplinary  rules   and

proceedings.  They are subject to the Instructions Manual  of

the  civil service.  They are also subject to the laws of the

land.  If they, just because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>



they  have  police powers and they are intelligence officers,

they  beat up somebody, whether in the course of duty or not,

they can also be subject to investigations.  There are proper

channels of redress in these situations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. The

Minister  said  that there is a proper channel of  complaint.

For  the  police, it is very clear.  We know who to  complain

to.  Can he tell us, in the case of intelligence officers, as

they are not, by definition, police officers, if there is  an

abuse of powers, what is the channel of complaint?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The channel of complaint must be to

the  Director of the Internal Security Department,  like  for

police   officers,  the  channel  of  complaint  is  to   the

Commissioner  of Police.  They are the appointing  authority.

There is no difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this Bill is to provide for the

expansion  of the food safety responsibilities of  the  Agri-food  and  Veterinary Authority and for the transfer  of  the

Food Control Department of the Ministry of the Environment to

the  AVA.   Sir,  let  me  explain the rationale  behind  the

Government's   decision  to  rationalise  the   food   safety

responsibilities of AVA and ENV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ensuring the safety of food is an increasingly

important public health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>



concern  world-wide.   The  World  Health  Organisation   has

estimated   that   one  person  in  three  in  industrialised

countries  may get ill from eating unsafe food.  As Singapore

is  heavily  dependent on food imports, we are vulnerable  to

public  health risk from unsafe food from around  the  world.

Food  production  is  now  a globalised  business.   We  have

observed  incidences  of unsafe food causing  food  poisoning

outbreaks  on an international dimension.  Food made  in  one

country  can  use ingredients from other countries,  some  of

which  may  not meet our safety standards.  Members  of  this

House   may   recall  the  dioxin  incident  that   Singapore

experienced  in 1999.  AVA and ENV then had to  take  certain

imported food products off the shelves, because of the dioxin

contaminated food products from Europe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress in food biotechnology, and the use of new

additives in food production, present new challenges  to  our

food  safety system.  In view of these new technologies,  all

new  chemicals,  which can present new  health  risk  to  our

population, the Government sees a strategic need  to  further

strengthen our food safety system to minimise these risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, food safety in Singapore is under the purview

of  the  AVA  and  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment.   The

demarcation  of food safety responsibilities is generally  by

food  types.   The AVA regulates the safety of primary  food,

ie,  meat and fish, and their products, raw milk, eggs, fresh

fruits  and  vegetables.   The Ministry  of  the  Environment

currently regulates the safety of processed foods, as well as

for handling of all food at retail.  This demarcation applies

to both imported as well as locally produced food.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this current mode of demarcation of food safety,

between the AVA and the Ministry of the Environment,  is  not

always clear or intuitive.  The general public and the people

in  the  food  industry  are sometimes  confused  as  to  the

responsibilities of each agency.  In addition,  the  AVA  and

the Ministry of the Environment adopt different approaches to

food safety control for imported food.  The AVA



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>



emphasises  safe  standards at the sources  of  food  supply,

while  the  Ministry  of  the Environment  relies  mainly  on

monitoring of food products at the retail end.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to strengthen our food safety system, the

food  safety responsibilities of the AVA and the Ministry  of

the  Environment will be rationalised along the lines of  the

food  supply chain, rather than by food types.  AVA will  now

regulate  the safety of all food from production,  to  import

and wholesale, right up to just before retail.  AVA will also

set  food  safety standards, enforce them, and  oversee  food

labelling.  The Ministry of the Environment will now regulate

the  safety of all food at the retail end, by ensuring proper

food  handling, and preparation at restaurants,  supermarkets

and  other food retailers, such as shops, hawkers and  market

stalls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this rationalisation, both the AVA and the Ministry

of  the Environment will continue to work closely to increase

the  robustness and responsiveness of our food safety system,

as  it capitalises on the inherent strengths and expertise of

the  two  agencies.  AVA's expertise in pre-market  approval,

backed by its up-to-date diagnostic capabilities, will ensure

that  food  arriving at the retail end is safe and wholesome.

The  Ministry  of the Environment will focus its capabilities

in food hygiene and environmental public health at the retail

outlets.   The  synergy  attained in such  a  structure  will

ensure that food safety standards are applied consistently to

locally  produced,  as well as imported food,  and  all  food

imports will come under our food safety net.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rationalisation of food safety responsibilities

between the AVA and the Ministry of the Environment will take

effect on 1st July 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the main features

of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "primary food" has been deleted and

references  to "primary food" throughout the Bill  have  been

amended to "food", in order to reflect the enlarged scope  of

the AVA's food safety responsibilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word "food biotechnology" has also been added to the

definition  of  the  "agri-food and  veterinary  sectors"  in

clause 2 to include genetically modified food and other types

of  food  produced as a result of advancements made  in  food

biotechnology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also makes explicit the AVA's power to liaise,

or  collaborate,  with any organisation for the  purposes  of

determining standards related to the agri-food and veterinary

sector  by virtue of clause 4.  This is because the AVA  will

take   over  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment's  role   as

Singapore's  contact point for Kodex Alimentarius Commission.

This  is an international foods standards body recognised  by

the World Trade Organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the transitional

provisions  relating  to the transfer  of  the  Food  Control

Department from the Ministry of the Environment to  the  AVA.

It   covers   matters   such  as  staff,  property,   assets,

liabilities  and  contracts of the FCD.  In this  respect,  I

wish  to stress that the FCD officers who will be transferred

to  AVA  will do so under employment terms which are no  less

favourable  than  those already accorded  to  these  officers

prior  to their transfer.  This transfer will enable  AVA  to

accommodate  the enlarged scope of regulating the  safety  of

imported and locally processed food up to just before retail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an administrative note, clause 6 of the Bill amends

the   small   "f"  in  the  name  "Agri-food  and  Veterinary

Authority"  to a capital "F", to emphasise the  expansion  of

the food safety responsibilities of the AVA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are facing new challenges in food safety. The

rationalisation of food safety responsibilities will allow us

to  better  manage  these  challenges,  to  ensure  that  all

imported food comes under our food safety net, and that  food

safety  standards are applied consistently  to  both  locally

produced  as  well as imported food.  With these  amendments,

the  AVA  and the Ministry of the Environment will be  better

positioned to deal with the threat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>



of  unsafe  food,  to  further  protect  the  health  of  our

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> I just want to seek a few

clarifications.  May I ask the Minister whether his  Ministry

has  to  set  up  a  new department to look  after  this  new

arrangement, and how will his Ministry ensure that there  are

enough  resources and finances to look into this area?   Will

this also mean that from now on there will be more inspectors

going round to check on all the retail shops?  May I ask  why

MND  should not take over from the import stage right through

to the retail stage?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</b> Sir, let me handle the

questions one at a time.  The Food Control Department of  the

Ministry of the Environment is being transferred to  AVA,  so

we  are not creating a new department.  The staff, and  their

responsibilities  and expertise, are coming  across  to  join

AVA.  Of course, you may ask what about the name "FCD", which

a  lot of people are familiar with, in the same way that  the

name  "PPD",  if  you  remember the  old  Primary  Production

Department,  was  dropped when we  created  AVA.   With  this

integration of the Food Control Department into AVA, we  will

also  drop  the  reference  to  FCD.   So  the  staff,  their

expertise,  and their resources, will move across.   We  will

not  be creating a new structure for the sake of creating new

structures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as resources are concerned, let me assure the

Member  that we are not going to consume more resources  just

because  of  a  re-arrangement of  the  structure.   However,

depending on the state of play in food biotechnology, and the

threat  assessment  to  our public  health  and  safety,  the

Ministry will, if need be, have to devote more resources into

this area.  As I alluded to earlier in my speech, this is  an

area  which is evolving, and there are potential risks  -  in

some   cases,  deliberate,  as  for  instance  in  food  bio-terrorism, or in some cases, inadvertent.  So, the  need  for

vigilance and the need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>



to  be  prepared to devote the resources to this matter  will

always be there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's next question was whether there will be

more  inspectors  on the retail end.  As I said  earlier  on,

inspection at the retail establishments will be performed  by

inspectors  from  the  Ministry of the  Environment,  not  by

officers  from AVA.  The purpose of this Bill is actually  to

create a clearer demarcation of responsibilities.  I want  to

assure  the  proprietors  of these establishments  that  they

would  not get two sets of inspectors descending on them  and

checking  on  them with different standards, and levying  two

different sets of fines.  This will not occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her last question, the AVA will be responsible for

food    from   source,   production,   processing,    import,

warehousing, wholesaling and distribution, but we  will  stop

at retail.  We believe the Ministry of the Environment, which

has  got lots of experience and expertise in hygiene  and  in

monitoring post-handling of food, is better placed to monitor

things  at  the  retail end.  So that is  how  we  intend  to

demarcate the system, for now anyway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Vivian Balakrishnan].

<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second Time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the House has just passed the Agri-Food and

Veterinary Authority (Amendment) Bill, which provides for the

expansion  of the food safety responsibilities of  the  Agri-Food  and  Veterinary Authority.  It also  provides  for  the

transfer of the Food Control Department of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>



Ministry  of the Environment to the AVA.  This Sale  of  Food

(Amendment)  Bill is consequential to this transfer  of  food

safety responsibilities to the AVA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the main features

of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill transfers the administration of the Sale of

Food  Act to the AVA by virtue of clauses 3, 4 and 19.   This

transfer  enables the AVA to regulate the safety of  imported

processed  food.  Currently, the Ministry of the  Environment

regulates  all  food  establishments  in  Singapore.    These

include restaurants, supermarkets, hawkers, market stalls and

caterers.   Food  establishments may also  be  non-retail  in

nature, such as those that manufacture, process, prepare  and

pack  food for distribution.  The Ministry of the Environment

regulates  all local food establishments under  the  existing

Environmental Public Health Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new rationalisation of food safety,

responsibility  is between the AVA and the  Ministry  of  the

Environment.  The AVA will take over from the Ministry of the

Environment the regulation of those food establishments which

are  non-retail  in nature.  The Ministry of the  Environment

will  continue to regulate the safety of food at  the  retail

end,  such  as  restaurants,  supermarkets,  hawkers,  market

stalls and caterers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to allow the AVA to regulate these food

establishments that are non-retail in nature, the AVA has  to

be provided with additional powers for the regulation of food

establishments.  The Bill incorporates various provisions  of

the  current Environmental Public Health Act, as set  out  in

clauses  2, 11, 12, 17 and 18, to enable the AVA to  take  an

approach in the regulation of food establishments similar  to

that under the Environmental Public Health Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties of the existing Act were determined in

1973.  Under various clauses of the Bill, such as clauses  6,

7,  8,  9,  10,  13 and 15, read with section 37F  introduced

under  clause 17, many offences committed under the Act  will

now carry a maximum penalty of $5,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>



for  the first offence, and $10,000 and/or a jail term  of  3

months  for  subsequent  offences.  The  proposed  amendments

reflect  the  seriousness of offences  in  relation  to  food

safety and are commensurate with today's cost of living.  The

increases  in  penalties in the Bill take into  consideration

the  quantum of fines that can currently be imposed under the

Environmental Public Health Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Sale of Food Act has no provision for the

composition  of  offences.  But ENV  can  currently  compound

offences relating to food establishments committed under  the

Environmental  Public Health Act.  The  new  section  37G  of

clause  17  provides  the  AVA with  the  power  to  compound

offences  committed under the Sale of Food Act for  up  to  a

maximum  of $1,000.  This provides consistency in enforcement

power with the Environmental Public Health Act as well as for

an effective and expeditious enforcement to be carried out on

less serious offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments are consequential to the transfer

of  food  safety  responsibilities from the Ministry  of  the

Environment to the AVA.  They are necessary to allow  AVA  to

implement these new responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Vivian Balakrishnan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.50 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Objective</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government intends to establish a new statutory

board,  the  National Environment Agency (NEA) by integrating

the    Environmental   Public   Health   Division   and   the

Environmental  Policy and Management of the Ministry  of  the

Environment, and the Meteorological Service Department of the

Ministry  of  Transport.  The Bill before the House  provides

the legislative framework for the formation of NEA.

<br><br><i>Rationale for the formation of NEA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the formation of NEA is that the scope

and  responsibility of the Ministry have  expanded  over  the

years.   There are new environmental and public health issues

facing Singapore, and these have grown both in magnitude  and

complexity.   Our  challenge is to improve our  environmental

performance in the short to medium terms.  At the same  time,

it  is  to enhance our environmental sustainability over  the

long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are issues such as the limited land for solid

waste  disposal, the problem of emerging infectious  diseases

around  the  world,  problems  of  trans-boundary  pollution,

energy  conservation, and the growing list  of  international

conventions on the environment that we now have to adhere to.

All  these  have diverse policy and operational implications.

Many  of these issues have now become more pressing,  and  in

the  future they will become more important as our population

and our economy continue to grow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed restructuring will result in a leaner,

more  policy-focused Ministry.  The processes in the Ministry

will  be  more streamlined, and the Agency will  become  more

operation-focused.   The  division of responsibility  between

policy formulation and operational implementation will  allow

the  Ministry to focus on setting strategic policy directions

and addressing key policy concerns more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEA, on the other hand, can direct its effort

towards   the  effective  implementation  and  operation   of

policies, and in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>



ensuring a quality living environment for Singaporeans.  This

delineation of focus will allow ENV to better tackle existing

as well as emerging environmental challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the NEA, the Environmental Policy and

Management  Division will continue to play a  major  role  in

protecting and sustaining our environment.  It will  continue

to  implement  programmes  to  monitor,  reduce  and  prevent

environmental  pollution.   More importantly,  it  will  also

spearhead    new   initiatives   to   deliver   environmental

performance  and  enhance sustainable development.   Its  key

goals  will  be  to  minimise waste generation  and  maximise

recycling and resource conservation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Public Health Division will meanwhile

continue to maintain a high standard of public health through

comprehensive disease surveillance, and improve  measures  to

promote  food  hygiene,  vector  research  and  control,  and

environmental sanitation.  It will also continue  to  play  a

lead   role  in  enhancing  our  living  environment  through

programmes  such  as  the Hawker Centres Upgrading  Programme

(HUP) and the Clean Public Toilet Programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the NEA will also allow us to

better harness the complementary expertise in these agencies,

by  bringing  on board the Meteorological Service  Department

(MSD).   This  will  help us in areas of climate  change  and

trans-boundary haze pollution.  The technical competencies of

MSD will complement the competencies that are currently found

in the ENV departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSD is currently a key member of the local Haze Task

Force.   It  will  also  serve as ENV's delegation  to  ASEAN

meetings  on the Environment and on Haze measures.  MSD  also

provides  weather  information  to  ENV  for  public   health

warnings, such as flooding and haze.  Under the NEA, MSD will

continue  to  fulfill  its  role of providing  meteorological

information to the aviation, maritime and military sectors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new statutory board will be more focused, and

with  its  more  focused  mission and greater  administrative

autonomy  and flexibility, its performance will be  improved.

It  will  strengthen its partnership with the people, private

and public sectors (3P sectors).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can therefore expect to see greater cooperation and

collaboration between the NEA and the 3P sectors and, in this

way,  it  will  jointly  promote environmental  consciousness

among  our  people, by implementing environmental  programmes

for  the  community.  The autonomy and flexibility  that  the

Agency  will  enjoy  will allow it  to  be  more  nimble  and

innovative in discharging its duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now highlight the main features of the Bill.

Clause  5  provides for the appointment of the  Board,  which

shall  consist of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman, and five  to

12 other members.  All are to be appointed by the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 set out the functions, duties and

powers of the Agency.  They are essentially the same as those

already   undertaken  by  the  Environmental  Public   Health

Division,  the Environmental Policy and Management  Division,

and the Meteorological Service Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial provisions are in clauses 19 to 27. In

particular, clause 23 empowers the Agency to raise loans  and

issue bonds.  Clause 24 empowers it to issue shares and other

securities  to  the Minister for Finance as a consequence  of

vesting  of  the  property, rights  and  liabilities  of  the

Government in the Agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 32 to 38 provide for the transfer of properties,

assets and liabilities of the Agency.  All employees affected

will  also  be  transferred on terms no less favourable  than

those enjoyed by them immediately prior to their transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 39 to 50 cover some of the miscellaneous legal

provisions, which are necessary for the effective functioning

of  the  Agency.  In particular, clause 41 empowers  MSD  the

power, in case of emergency, to enter upon any land, with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>



reasonable  notice,  to  set up a meteorological  observation

station.  Clause 50 provides for the consequential amendments

to legislation to be administered by the Agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions are standard provisions found in

the Acts of other statutory boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, let me reiterate that the formation of

the new statutory board will give a sharper focus to our work

in  ensuring a clean and sustainable environment for all.  It

will   allow  us  to  take  advantage  of  the  complementary

expertise  in  the three departments to be brought  together.

It will also provide greater autonomy and flexibility so that

the  Agency can be more agile and innovative, and  work  even

more closely and effectively with the 3P sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of a National Environment Agency will

facilitate the achievement of the targets as set out  in  our

Green  Plan  2012.   The proposed Agency  will  provide  more

flexibility   and  efficiency  when  administering   policies

concerning  environmental  health, environmental  protection,

resource  conservation, waste minimisation, waste  recycling,

waste  collection and disposal.  This will, hopefully, reduce

administrative bureaucracy resulting in better and affordable

services to businesses and consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the setting up of the National Environment

Agency has certain benefits, I wish to highlight a number  of

concerns  of  its impact on businesses and consumers  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on autonomous agency. The proposed Agency will

be  an  autonomous  agency, and thus must  have  a  long-term

sustainable  business  model.  As a regulator  and  licensing

body, I presume it will receive a grant from the Ministry and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>



collect  licensing  fees.   May  I  ask  the  Minister   what

proportion  of  the  income will be from licensing  fee?   Is

there  any  mechanism in place to moderate  any  increase  of

licence  fees  in  the  future?  Furthermore,  what  are  the

financial  savings in transferring these departments  out  of

the Ministry into this new Agency?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern is on set-up cost. As stated in the

Bill,  there  will  be  extra financial  expenditure  by  the

Government  to  set up the Agency, but the  details  are  not

provided.   I hope that the Minister can enlighten the  House

on  the likely development and operating expenditures of  the

Agency.   If  possible, I would propose that  the  Agency  be

located  near the Ministry of National Development so  as  to

provide a one-stop service centre for the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by the Minister of State for the

Environment,  ENV will promote more recycling of construction

waste  and  sustainable development in future.  The  proposed

BCA's   registration  of  construction  firms  also  requires

environmental management accreditation, which is  ISO  14000.

This calls for a greater integration between the Ministry  of

National Development and Ministry of the Environment.  The co-location  of  services  of  these two  Ministries  will  help

businesses  to  save costs, and facilitate  the  approval  of

development projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area of concern is on the potential conflict

of  interest.  Sir, as stated in clause 12(h), the Agency has

power,  subject to the approval of the Minister, to  form  or

participate  in the formation of any company, partnership  or

joint  venture as a shareholder or partner or  in  any  other

capacity.  As a regulator and licensing body, there could  be

potential  conflict  of interest if the  Agency  were  to  be

involved  in  business ventures, especially in  environmental

related businesses.  This will impede open market competition

among service providers, thus increasing cost of services.  I

hope  the Minister can clarify on this potential conflict  of

interest and explain the rationale for allowing the Agency to

participate in business activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also stated in clause 11(1) (b) that the Agency

can  provide consultancy services on matters concerning  food

hygiene in the food retail industry, and in relation to  pest

control, environmental and other related industries.   Again,

how   can   a  regulator  provide  consultancy  services   to

businesses and, at the same time, license and regulate  their

clients' business activities?  Although the services  may  be

provided by different groups of staff in the Agency, both are

serving  the  same master.  I hope the Minister can  consider

the removal of such provision in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth area of concern is on protection from

liability.   Sir, clause 17(3) protects the  Agency  and  its

employees from any liability if the Agency provides a service

to  the public whereby information is supplied to the public.

This is an unfair clause and does not offer any protection to

the  public, who may suffer losses as a result of  errors  or

omissions made by the Agency or its employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause does not provide any redress to the public

for their losses.  It is also unhealthy to have such a clause

as  it erodes accountability of the Agency and its employees.

The protection clause will result in employees being careless

when  providing services or information to the public.  As  a

regulatory body, the Agency must be held responsible for  its

actions.   The public must also have the right to seek  legal

redress, if necessary.  Thus, I would propose to the Minister

to delete the unfair protection clause in the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that we have such an Agency set up to

provide  a  focused  attention to matters pertaining  to  our

environment.   As Singapore becomes more and more  congested,

with  increasing number of people living in the  country  and

more  vehicles congesting our roads, a focused  attention  is

necessary  to  make sure that our environment  is  free  from

unnecessary pollution, be it in the air, water or  from  food

contamination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that the services of the

meteorological  stations are now under the  purview  of  this

Agency.   Apart  from  providing meteorological  services  to

Government agencies, it has the important role of making sure

that  our shipping and aviation communities are supplied with

accurate  data on the weather.  An environmental agency  with

these powers to provide such services would be in line with a

more focused view on environmental control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest to the Minister

that  the functions already listed out in the Bill be further

expanded  to include environmental issues relating to  nature

conservation.  It should have the power to monitor  areas  of

Singapore, such as our natural forest or mangrove swamps that

are in danger of being lost in the name of progress.  Such an

example  is  in the recent issue of the wasteland at  Tanjung

Chek  Jawa  at  Pulau  Ubin, which was saved  by  the  timely

intervention of concerned members of the public.  These areas

are, in a sense, natural parks and serve as a reminder of the

wonders   of   nature.   There,  we  can  learn  the   inter-relationship  of living things with the environment  and  the

associated   flora   and   fauna,  something   which   future

generations  of Singaporeans may miss learning from,  if  all

these  indigenous ecosystems were to be wiped  out  from  our

landscape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that we already have the National Parks Act

to look into nature conservation matters.  But the Act is too

restrictive  in  that  it controls and administers  only  our

national parks and nature reserves, such as the Sungei  Buloh

Nature   Reserves  and  Labrador  Park.   I  feel  that   the

Environment Agency should be given the power to look  at  the

bigger picture as compared to the National Parks Board, which

looks  after  built-up  parks and gazetted  nature  reserves.

Every  bit  of our natural habitat, including the water  mass

that  comes with it, once transformed, may never be regained.

We need an environmental agency to look into projects such as

the  proposed  new golf course at the Kranji marshlands  that

will  destroy precious feeding grounds for herons and a  long

time habitat for more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>



than   90  species  of  birds.   If  it  were  not  for   the

intervention of the Nature Society of Singapore, the  meeting

between  the  developer of the golf course, the URA  and  the

National   Parks  Board  may  not  have  taken   place,   and

Singaporeans  would  have lost another  natural  habitat  for

birds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A master plan should be drawn up by this Agency to

preserve areas of Singapore, not from the standpoint  of  the

Urban  Redevelopment Authority and the National Parks  Board,

which  may  focus  too much on redevelopment,  but  from  the

conservationists' view under the Environment Agency.  Through

that  course,  we  will not make decisions to  transform  our

natural habitat into concrete jungles too quickly.  Even  all

our  recent reclaimed land, such as Jurong Island,  can  very

quickly  turn  into natural habitats for birds when  suitable

trees  and vegetation grow on them, and in the tropics  these

thrive  very  quickly.   Such  areas  could  come  under  the

attention of the proposed Environment Agency for conservation

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me to add another suggestion.

The  Environment Agency should be given the power under  this

Bill  to  set up mini-meteorological stations in  our  parks.

This  would  not  only  serve  to provide  localised  weather

information but would also attract residents to make  use  of

the  parks for information and educational purposes.   I  can

see  parents bringing their children there to teach  them  or

even  teach  themselves how our daily  rainfall  and  weather

temperatures  are  being  collected  and  measured,  and  the

importance of knowing these figures, and how to predict  them

under changing wind directions as well as seasonal changes in

weather patterns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such interest, when generated, may spur the growth of a

weather industry as well as its related economic benefits  to

the  nation.  In fact, I came across an advertisement showing

a  perfect  Father's  Day  gift - a  Galileo  thermometer  to

measure  the weather temperature, not very accurate,  but  it

promotes awareness



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>



of  our exposure to the elements, at a special reduced  price

of  US$18.95,  inclusive of delivery.  Outdoor sportsmen  and

women  may  also  want to carry with them  a  pocket  weather

tracker, lest they find themselves baking under the  hot  sun

or  drenched  by the rain.  Such interest would involve  more

people  to connect themselves to nature and learn to  respect

its awesome powers and gentleness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another function given to the Environment Agency, under

clause 11(1) (n), is to promote energy efficiency, the use of

clean  energy,  the  use of clean technologies,  the  use  of

efficient  pollution  technologies and  waste  recycling.   I

agree  with  these  functions fully.  However,  the  Bill  is

silent  as to whether any researches need to be done  in  the

area  of  clean energy.  We have heard much about  this,  but

what is clean solar energy, clean wind energy or some others,

and  how  do  we know that it is beneficial to  the  country?

Perhaps  a  clear  definition is needed to help  Singaporeans

identify the new age energy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the point relating to offences

committed  under this Bill, I would urge the Minister  to  be

firm  as  well  as being compassionate when deciding  on  the

quantum of fines, when the Bill is finally enacted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 46(1), compositions of offences can be

imposed  on  offenders  for up to $1,000,  and  clause  48(2)

allows  fines  of up to $10,000, or with imprisonment  for  a

term  not  exceeding 12 months or with both.   As  this  Bill

covers  acts  ranging from littering on  the  streets  up  to

pollution of our coastal waters, I hope that the severity  of

the  offences  will vary with lighter fines bearing  on  acts

such as littering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has no natural resources that we can boast of,

but  it  has abundant natural habitats that nature  provides.

These  natural landscapes, once carefully crafted  out,  will

show the world that we care for the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to compliment the Hon. Minister for his

wisdom in setting up this Agency, which will not only allow a

greater flexibility and interest in managing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>



our  environment,  but  also greater professionalism  in  the

management of its daily functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members - Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr

Andy Gan - for speaking up in support of the Bill.  I will go

through some of the issues raised by Dr Teo Ho Pin first.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Dr Teo is concerned whether the National

Environment  Agency (NEA), being an autonomous  agency,  will

adopt a business model that is revenue-driven.  I suppose  Dr

Teo  is concerned, firstly, whether this Agency would compete

with  the  industry for business and, secondly, whether  this

Agency will over-emphasise on revenue generation to keep  the

Agency going.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, I want to assure the Member that, firstly,

the NEA will be an Agency funded by the Government.  In other

words,  the NEA is not set up to be a self-funding  statutory

board,  but  rather a statutory board - to be funded  by  the

Government to offer public services.  Secondly, the  revenues

collected  by the NEA, whether it is through fees, fines  and

so  on, NEA will not get to keep the revenue for its own use.

This  is because every year, NEA will be getting a grant from

the  Government.   So whatever revenue the NEA  is  going  to

collect,  through  fees, fines and  so  on,  will  be  offset

against  the  grant from the Government.  As far  as  NEA  is

concerned, it will be operating on an annual budget based  on

its  operating  requirements.  It is not  driven  by  revenue

generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo is concerned whether NEA will compete with the

private sector for business.  Sir, here, I want to assure the

House that, again, it is not the intention of NEA.  The staff

of NEA, from time to time, will offer consultancy service for

overseas   projects.   For  example,  we   extend   technical

assistance to the Riau province in Indonesia, under a G to  G

programme.   Basically, we offer consultancy to organisations

and projects in the region for the purpose of enhancing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>



regional  collaboration.  The officers may also be  asked  to

undertake  some consultancy services - maybe in  places  like

China.   These projects are undertaken in order to,  firstly,

strengthen  our collaboration on a country-to-country  basis;

and,  secondly, to enable our staff at NEA, as part of  their

professional  development,  to keep  track  of  some  of  the

development and issues faced in the region.  But, at the  end

of  day,  I  want  to assure the House that  it  is  not  the

intention  for NEA to function as a business entity,  because

it is not set up to be a business entity. It will continue to

be   a  Government-funded  statutory  board.   And  the  main

responsibility, as my MOS has presented, is  to  ensure  that

environmental  performance in Singapore will continue  to  be

improved, and the foundation for sustainability will continue

to be enhanced.  Most of these works will be done through the

private  sector,  by the private sector.  ENV  will  set  the

policy;  and the NEA will enforce on the operational aspects;

whereas the actual implementation will be done by the private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo brought up another point regarding the protection

granted  to employees and officers of the Board.  Sir,  here,

again,  I want to emphasise that, as public sector employees,

NEA  employees, from time to time, are asked by  the  private

sector  to  provide information regarding certain aspects  of

our work.  For example, waste disposal, clean air, and so on.

Based  on good faith, from time to time, my officers do share

some technical information with the private sector.  But  how

this  technical information could be applied  to  a  specific

situation  is something that the NEA officers should  not  be

expected  to take on the responsibility.  Take, for  example,

if  someone  were to come to NEA and say that if he  were  to

purchase  a  ultra low sulphur diesel (ULSD)  vehicle,  would

that ULSD vehicle satisfy NEA's emission standard?  Based  on

technical  specifications, the NEA officers should  be  in  a

position  to advise him.  They will say, "Yes, if you  go  by

the  international standard for ULSD vehicles, you should  be

able  to  satisfy  the requirement."  But what  if  the  ULSD

vehicle turns out to be violating our emission



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>



standards   due  to  maintenance  or  operational   problems?

Firstly,   does  it  mean  that  NEA  officers  cannot   take

enforcement  action against that person?  Secondly,  does  it

mean  that once enforcement action is taken against  him,  he

can  take counter action against our officers for giving  him

wrong information?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of the day, we have to bear in mind that

the more we remove this protection of good faith from the NEA

officers,  the  more  it is likely that  the  officers  would

behave  in an even more bureaucratic manner.  As my  MOS  has

pointed out, the purpose of the NEA is to strengthen  the  3P

partnership,  meaning that we would very much  like  to  work

very  closely with the people sector, the public  sector  and

the  private  sector.  In that regard, as  we  work  together

based  on  good  faith,  it is very important  that  whatever

information  and assistance that the officers  offer  out  of

good faith to the industry and private sector, should not  be

taken against them.  At the end of the day, it is really  for

the recipients of the information to make their own technical

or  business  assessment on whether they want to  accept  the

input of the NEA officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to respond to the points raised by

Mr  Andy  Gan.   Basically, Mr Andy Gan asked whether  nature

conservation  should come under the NEA.   Broadly  speaking,

from  the  environmental  angle, there  are  three  types  of

issues.   First  is  the  green  issue  relating  to   nature

conservation,  bio-diversity, and so on.    The  second  type

will  be the brown issue, eg, pollution control, and  so  on.

And  the third type will be the blue issue, eg, marine  life,

marine diversity, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, all over the world, there is no standard

practice  on how the government should organise its  agencies

to  address  the  blue, brown and green  issues.   Take,  for

example, in the case of USA, the USEPA is basically an agency

that looks after the brown issues.  The blue and green issues

are  looked  after by some other agencies.  In  the  case  of

Germany,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>



for  example, one agency takes charge of all three  issues  - green,  brown and blue.  In the case of Singapore,  ENV,  and

now  NEA,  will continue to be responsible for  handling  the

brown issues.  In the case of NParks, it will continue to  be

responsible for the green issues.  The Marine Port  Authority

(MPA) will continue to take charge of the blue issues.   This

is  not  without  good  reasons.  Because,  in  the  case  of

Singapore, marine resources are used mainly for port traffic.

As  a  result,  it makes more sense for MPA to  regulate  the

traffic   flow   in  our  water,  and  enforce  environmental

protection measures at the same time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, here, I want to point out that any land-based

pollution, any activities on land that may lead to  pollution

in the water, will continue to come under NEA and ENV.  There

is  therefore no gap in our responsibility.  In the  case  of

NParks,  many of our green issues have to do with  land  use.

Many  of  the  examples mentioned by Mr Andy Gan  really  are

issues between balancing environmental consideration and land

use  consideration.  Up till now, I think the Government  has

found it most efficient and most effective for NParks to come

under the Ministry of National Development, because land  use

consideration and environmental management consideration  can

best be balanced within the same Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to emphasise that just because NEA is

looking  after  the  brown issues,  NParks  after  the  green

issues, and MPA after the blue issues, it does not mean  that

the  three agencies will be working in isolation.   In  fact,

the  three  agencies  work very closely together.   One  good

example is the SGP 2012.  NParks is an integral part of  this

whole  exercise.  By the time the SGP 2012 is formulated  and

implemented, ENV, NEA, NParks and MPA will collectively  take

joint  responsibility  in the overall implementation  of  SGP

2012.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Andy Gan also asked whether we can do something

to  enhance the interest of our younger generation  in  local

weather  broadcast and so on, so that in time to come,  maybe

we can even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>



nurture  a weather industry.  Sir, this is a very interesting

idea.   I will convey this to MSD.  Once it comes under  NEA,

we will see what can be done and what needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Andy Gan also asked whether NEA will set very clear

policy directions regarding the research direction for  clean

energy.   Sir, the NEA, basically, will pursue management  by

outcome.   The concern of the NEA will be to ensure that  the

ambient  air  quality  of Singapore will  remain  within  the

standard  imposed  by the World Health Organisation  and  the

USEPA.  Research is a means to the end.  In other words, NEA,

in  itself,  will  not undertake research.  Rather,  it  will

pursue  the  3P partnership.  NEA will encourage research  in

the  technical community.  NEA will promote innovation in the

industry,  and commercialisation in the marketplace  so  that

the results of research can be widespread.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other words, NEA will be looking at how upstream

R&D,  midstream  innovation, and  downstream  deployment  and

commercialisation, can be best synergised without getting too

involved directly in any of these areas of work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, Mr Andy Gan suggested that the

penalty  that  we  impose should take into consideration  the

severity  of the offences.  I fully agree with Mr  Andy  Gan.

When   we  impose  penalty,  we  will  certainly  take   into

consideration the implication and impact on the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the points brought

up by the Members.

<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These grants from NAC do not include funding provided to

the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and the Singapore Chinese

Orchestra by the Government and/or the Tote Board. The NAC

does not provide grants to these two orchestras.



<br><br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figures in this table refer to activities and not for

training as it is not meaningful to distinguish the types of

training according to ethnic categories.



<br><br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This category includes groups that practice in English and

contemporary visual artists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants applications are assessed on the following

criteria:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) artistic merit of proposal;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) impact of audience reach;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) commitment in sustaining and advancing the

arts form;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) artistic track record of the applicant; and,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) demonstration of good planning, sound budgeting and

effective use of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAC's grants are given only to non-profit Singaporean

art  groups.  They  are  not given  to  commercial  companies

presenting productions such as Miss Saigon, Cirque du  Soleil

and  The Phantom of the Opera.  Funding for English language/

contemporary    groups   is   the   highest    amongst    the

language/ethnic  categories because English Language  theatre

companies are amongst the most developed and established arts

companies  and  have  benefited from the NAC's  2-year  grant

scheme,  which aims to develop and groom local flagship  arts

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of applications and unsuccessful ones,

based on the criteria, are as follows:
