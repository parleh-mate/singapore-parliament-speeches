<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CITY COUNCIL SERVICES TO PALMER ROAD AREA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the

Prime Minister whether he will make a

Statement as to the availability of City

Council services to the residents of the

Palmer Road area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, a survey of the kampong at Palmer

Road  was  carried  out some months ago. It showed that a  good  number  of  the

dwellings  were  unauthorised sheds constructed from  packing  cases  and  other

inflammable  material or in a ruinous condition. The Fire Department  considered

it dangerous in these circumstances to allow electric lines to this kampong from

the City Council mains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to water, there are three existing standpipes in the area. A

fourth  standpipe has been approved by the Urban and Rural Services Council  but

it  cannot  yet be installed as the private landowner is strongly resisting  its

erection over his land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the aim is to offer these people decent low-cost accommodation now being

built  by the Housing Board. By the middle of next year, there should be  enough

$20 flats available to house all those now on the register; and with the housing

programme maintaining its present momentum, there is every hope that there  will

be  low-cost flats available for all by the end of next year for those  who  are

now living in sub-standard tenements and huts.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am pleased to hear the information given by the Prime Min

ister.  Perhaps he is aware that there are approximately 3,000 people living  in

this particular area. Could no temporary measures be taken to supply





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



them  with  electricity and particularly with water if necessary to acquire  the

piece of land necessary for the erection of that standpipe?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, on the first point regarding the supply of electricity, the Urban and Rural Service Council have to take the advice of the Fire

Department.  But as for the standpipe, I can assure the Member for Anson  that

we  are contemplating such action to erect the standpipe despite the landowner's

wishes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>WATER CONSUMPTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister what is the extent of the

average  daily  consumption in 1961 of water received from  the  catchment  area

occupied  by  the  Royal Singapore Golf Club, and the average  total  daily  consumption of water in Singapore in 1960-1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the average yield from the MacRitchie Catchment area

of 1,890 acres, out of which about 268 acres are occupied by the Royal Singapore

Golf Club, was 4,331 million gallons per day or 1,580 million gallons per annum

in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average daily consumption of water in Singapore was about 67 million

gallons per day for 1960-1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In the light of the figures given and the negligible quantity of

water  referable  to  the 268 acres occupied by the Royal Singapore  Golf  Club,

could  the  Prime Minister indicate whether he has any plans in  mind  for  more

appropriate utilisation of that area for the public benefit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I inform the Member for Anson that on these matters I

have to take the advice of the Water Engineer, and his advice in connection with

the  forestation  of  the  catchment area was that no further  trees  should  be

allowed to be struck down in this catchment area. It may be of interest  to  the

Member  for  Anson that I turned down a request by another club to extend  their

golf course, as that would imply more trees coming down.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  I  am  unable to take what I would consider the  hazardous  step  of

allowing any more trees in the catchment area to be struck down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3 million gallons per day is not a negligible amount of water, for which we

should  be  grateful and certainly were grateful last year at the  time  of  the

drought.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I understand from the Prime Minister that 4.3 million gallons

was  from  1,890 acres. Of that, only 268 acres are occupied by the Royal  Singa

pore  Golf Club, which is about one-seventh. So the 4.3 million gallons  is  not

attributable  to the Royal Singapore Golf Club. I would enquire from  the  Prime

Minister whether, apart from any planning for the purpose of utilisation of that

area to create a satellite town, he would consider transforming it into a public

park?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is an entirely different question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I answer it?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, if the Prime Minister wishes to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely if there is demand for using the land as a public

park, I will not have the slightest hesitation in utilising the land as a public

park.  In  fact, for the information of the Member for Anson, both golf  courses

are  open  to members of the public on all public holidays for their  use  as  a

place  for  picnicking and other uses not inconsistent with the desires  of  the

Health Department with regard to rubbish and other sanitary conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO LONDON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Discussions with British Ministers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister whether he will make a

statement  on  his  discussions with British Ministers on  his  recent  trip  to

London.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, in London, in May, I had discussions with the United

Kingdom Prime Minister, the Commonwealth and Colonial Secretaries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>

and  the  Minister of Defence on the arrangements to be made  before  merger

for  the  transfer  of  responsibility for  foreign  affairs,  defence  and

security to the Central Government of the new Federation on merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a useful exchange of views on a number of these subjects. As the

House  was not then sitting on the day of my return - 3lst May - I held a Press

conference  at which I think all relevant points were raised and  answered.

If  there  are  any specific matters on which the Member for Anson  desires

further explanation, I shall enlarge on them in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Prime Minister indicate whether there was any

discussion  as  to  the continuation of our bases for  the  utilisation  of

SEATO powers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I would refer the Member for Anson to the

statement  which  was  issued after the meeting  of  the  Federation  Prime

Minister  and  the Minister for the United Kingdom at which the  status  of

the  base was sufficiently and lucidly explained. I was only interested  in

one  particular  aspect  with regard to the base - namely,  the  question  of

redundancy.  I  had some discussions with the Minister of  Defence  on  the

possibilities of maintaining the civilian employment for some time  at  its

present  level,  and  later,  should there  be  cause  for  redundancy,  of

ensuring that there are adequate redundancy terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Perhaps one more subject, if you will permit, Mr Speaker.

Could  the Prime Minister indicate whether any attempt was made to ask  the

United  Kingdom  Government to utilise its good offices in  order  to  make

more  acceptable  the  proposed  terms of our  future  relations  with  the

Federation as contained in the Government's White Paper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, as I have explained before, the attitude of my

Government  is  that merger is a matter between the peoples and  the  Governments

of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya. It has nothing to do with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



the  United Kingdom Government other than the fact that on merger they will have

to  transfer all responsibility for foreign affairs, defence and security to the

Central  Government of the new Federation. I would consider it not only improper

but  politically  unprecedented  to ask a colonial  administration  to  try  and

intervene  in  what I consider to be a purely family matter within  the  Malayan

nation.

<div align="center"><b>RENEWAL OF NEGOTIATIONS ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CLOSER RELATIONS WITH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FEDERATION AFTER PUBLICATION OF COBBOLD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION REPORT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Prime Minister whether Government will seek to

renew  negotiations on the proposed closer relations with the  Federation  after

the Cobbold Commission Report has been published.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, until the Cobbold Commission Report is published, it

is not possible to answer this question.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Am I to understand, Mr Speaker, that the Prime Minister is

unaware of the contents of the Cobbold Commission Report?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Anson can assume that until the

Report is published, it will be inappropriate for anyone to indicate whether  he

does or does not know what is in the Report. But I would like to assure the hon.

Member  that, in my duty as the Prime Minister of Singapore, every stage in  the

development  of the creation of Malaysia, which is gathering momentum  month  by

month - almost week by week - is watched closed by my colleagues and myself in order

to  see that the interests of Singapore within this larger federation are properly safeguarded.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I was not seeking information as to the contents of

the  Cobbold Commission Report. I seem to have been misunderstood.  I  was  only

enquiring  whether,  in the light of the knowledge that  he  has,  he  would  be

seeking renewal of negotiations in respect of the White Paper proposals?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The answer has been given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I reply?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think the Member for Anson is on this occasion wilfully

slow  on  the  uptake. I have not indicated whether I know or do  not  know  the

Cobbold  Commission Report. It would be improper for me to indicate one  way  or

the  other.  All  I  have  indicated is that my colleagues  and  I,  as  persons

entrusted  with  the  interests  of Singapore, are  watching  with  considerable

interest  and painstaking care developments which are, as I have said, gathering

momentum  week  by week. I can assure the Member for Anson - as I did  assure  the

people of Singapore -  that before the Federation of Malaysia takes place, all the

necessary safeguards regarding equal rights for all of us shall be written  into

the Constitution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LIGHTING IN BUSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether he will give

details  of  the extent of lighting required to be provided for  in  buses  with

particular reference to the entrances to buses.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the law requires that adequate artificial

lighting shall be provided for the illumination of the interior of a bus at  all

times between sunset and sunrise when passengers are being carried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of lights in the interior of a bus varies according to the size of

the  bus.  A  large bus (overall length 30 ft.) has eight to ten lights,  and  a

smaller  bus (overall length 27 ft. 6 ins.) has six lights. The average  spacing

between  these  lights  is four to seven feet, suitably  distributed  along  the

ceiling.  The  arrangement of the lights is such that invariably there  are  two

lamps in close proximity to the entrance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal illumination is further augmented by the infiltration of light from

illuminated  rear number plate and destination box situated at the rear  end  of

the ceiling. The lamps in the interior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



of  the bus normally have frosted glass covers and are usually 10" long 4" wide.

Voltage is 24 and wattage 36.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some buses have one light and some have two on the steps at the entrances.

These lights are usually small (3" x 1") and recessed. Voltage is 24 and wattage

is from 3 to 5.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that some bus companies, with

an  eye to economy, are in fact ignoring these regulations and cutting sometimes

as much as half the required number of lights in their buses?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The supplementary question being?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is giving information.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is he aware that such is the case?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is giving information.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And would he take steps?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if the Member for Anson would patrol the

streets of Singapore and take down the numbers of buses which, to his knowledge,

are  inadequately illuminated and inform the Registrar of Vehicles. I  am  quite

sure action will be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Am I to understand that the Registrar of Vehicles has no one to

check on the adequacy or otherwise of compliance with these regulations that  my

assistance is sought?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, although no doubt it is the function of the Registrar

of  Vehicles to see that the regulations are implemented, it has not come to his

knowledge  that buses are inadequately illuminated. This is the first  complaint

that  I have received. This complaint comes from the Member for Anson, and if he

can  indicate  which  bus company is at fault, the Registrar  of  Vehicles  will

certainly look into the matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MALAY NAMES ON NEW</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>POSTAGE STAMPS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the

Deputy  Prime  Minister whether the Government would consider supplementing  the

Latin name with the Malay name of the design on the new postage stamps in future

reprints.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, it was decided to use the scientific names

instead of the Malay names on the postage stamps for the following reasons: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The known Malayan names are regional in character and the fishes are

known  by  different names in different parts of Malaya. For example,  the

fish which is depicted on the 25-cent stamp is known as sepat ronggeng  in

Penang and as sepat padi in Perak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Even in the same area fishes are sometimes known by more than one local

Malay  name. For example, the fish on the 6-cent stamp is known as  Sumpit

and Blibiran in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The same Malay name may sometimes be applied to different fishes. For

example,  the  fish on the 20-cent stamp and the fish on the 6-cent  stamp

are both known as Sum pit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The fish on the 4-cent stamp has no known Malay name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the Dewan Bahasa has standardised the nomenclature of flora and fauna, I

believe the safest course in order to avoid controversy is to adopt their  Latin

scientific  names,  which  are known by botanists and zoologists  all  over  the

world.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, these are Singapore stamps, not Penang nor

Trengganu. The Government has not extended that far, Sir. In the light  of  that

information, would the Deputy Prime Minister indicate whether he would  consider

utilising  the  Malay names where available of those fish which are  current  in

Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, we know

that  some  types of fish do exist in Singapore and some types do not  exist  in

Singapore.  As I have said just now, for example, the fish on the  4-cent  stamp

has  no known Malay name, and if the Member for Anson so desires, I do not  mind

calling the fish on the 4-cent stamp as Ikan Marshall!

<div align="center"><b>AIRPORT TERMINAL BUILDING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Date of Completion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister when it is expected that

the permanent Terminal Building at Singapore Airport will be completed, and what

interim provisions are being made for the comfort of transit passengers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker,

The permanent Terminal Building at the

Singapore Airport will be completed m

the early part of 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transit passengers at the Singapore Airport are being accommodated in the

Airport  Restaurant and the Reception Room. The present Terminal Building  is  a

temporary  one  built in 1955 when the Member for Anson was Chief  Minister.  No

transit  lounge  was provided for by the then Government in  this  building  and

therefore  transit  passengers have hitherto been accommodated  in  the  Airport

Restaurant.  Various proposals to put up a temporary transit  lounge  have  been

studied  by a Committee consisting of Airport officials and members representing

the  airline operators, but these proposals were considered either not  feasible

<div align="center"><b>(Further Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he has any

further  statement to make as regards the proposed Common  Market  with  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, a team of international experts is now being

assembled to undertake the study and the Government hopes to be able to announce

shortly the names of the team and the eminent international expert who will lead

it.  As  I  said  before, these arrangements are being made  by  the  Federation

Government who have kept us continuously informed of progress. Any

public statement will have to be timed with that of the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passing, I may say that the Common Market, which we all want, presupposes

merger  with  the  Federation.  If  by some unimaginable  mischance,  merger  is

thwarted  through  the machinations of the Communists and  their  stooges,  then

Singapore can say goodbye to the Common Market. The fact that this international

mission  will  soon proceed with their work shows that there is confidence,  not

only  in Singapore and the Federation, but also in the world outside that merger

will before long be an accomplished fact.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I would ask the Minister for Finance whether he has forgotten

that in 1959 in this House he  promised the people of Singapore a Common Market in the near future without  any

reference to merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the European Common Market took morel

than  15 years to be established. What the Member for Anson says just underlines

my  emphasis on the connection between Common Market and merger. In 1959,  there

was no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



prospect  of  merger, and consequently our discussions with the  Federation  got

bogged  down  fairly soon. Now that merger is on the horizon,  it  becomes  much

easier  to  discuss these matters with the Federation Government. Therefore,  if

the Member for Anson is anxious to see a Common Market between Singapore and the

Federation,  then he must spend all his energies to bring about a speedy  merger

between the two territories.

<div align="center"><b>UNCLAIMED BALANCES IN BANKS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Possible Utilisation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the

Minister  for  Finance  whether he has any information as  to  the  extent,  and

possible  utilisaticn by subrogation, of customers' balances in banks  unclaimed

for more than seven years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The present returns submitted by banks under the Banking

Ordinance,  1962, do not indicate the number of dormant customers'  accounts  or

the  amount of unclaimed balances on such accounts which have not been operative

for seven or more years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking legislation of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya does not

specifically designate what disposition should be made of unclaimed deposits  in

banks. It is generally understood that these balances remain a liability of  the

bank until they are paid. In practice, the balances are transferred by the banks

to an "Unclaimed Balances Account" and would appear together with other balances

as liabilities on the bank's balance sheet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States the Federal Reserve Act and the National Bank Act make no

provisions with regard to disposal of unclaimed bank balances. The United States

Supreme  Court  had  ruled  that a State should not dissolve  the  contracts  of

deposit even after 20 years and that national banks could not be required to pay

to the State the amounts due.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain the question of unclaimed moneys in banks has been much discussed

and  exaggerated.  A  Bill  entitled the Dormant  Bank  Balances  and  Unclaimed

Securities  Bill  was referred by the British Parliament to a  Select  Committee

which  after considering it reported in December 1919 that a much longer  period

than  six  years  should  elapse  before  a  state  of  dormancy,  having  legal

consequences involving publicity, should be recognised. The majority opinion  of

the  Select  Committee was that an account should he deemed to be  dormant  only

after  it  had not been operative for thirty years or more. The Select Committee

also suggested that boxes and parcels entrusted to banks for safe keeping should

be  subject  to legislative action for their disposal only after  70  years  had

elapsed.  As  a  result  of the recommendations of this  Select  Committee,  the

British Parliament took no action on the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India the practice is to require every banking company to submit within

thirty days after the close of each calendar year a return of accounts which had

not been operated upon for ten years or more. The return should give particulars

of the deposits standing to the credit of each account but there would appear to

be no provision for the disposal of any unclaimed assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, however, there is specific legislation under the Banking Act of

1957 to provide for the disposal of "unclaimed monies" which are defined as  all

principals,  interests, dividends, bonuses, profits and sums  of  money  legally

payable  by  a  bank in respect of which the time for recovery had  expired  and

includes  money to the credit of an account which has not been operative  either

by  deposit  or  withdrawal  for a period of not  less  than  seven  years.  The

unclaimed monies will be paid by a bank to the Commonwealth and will be held  in

a  Trust  Fund  for six years, after which it would be paid to the  Consolidated

Revenue  Fund.  If  at any time a legitimate claim is established,  such  monies

shall be paid to the bank and the bank shall thereupon pay the claimant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this account of some instance of international practice in this matter

to show that there are wide variations in policy. So far as Singapore is concern

ed,  the  banks are of the view that it is not a matter Of sufficient importance

as  to  justify  new legislation. I myself am inclined to leave it  well  alone,

especially  as experience and practice in other countries have not produced  any

unanimity in dealing with the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light of the recognised fact, how shall

we  say  it, that the banks have no right to benefit by this unearned profit  of

unclaimed  balances, would the Minister not consider advising the Government  to

introduce  legislation  analogous  to the Australian  legislation  whereby  the

Government could at least utilise the money pending a claim? The use of the word

"subrogation" in my original question was subrogation to rights and liabilities.

There  is  no question of extinguishing a customer's right whether it  is  seven

years  or  15  years. But in the meanwhile the Government can  use  this  money

without  interest.  Will the Minister consider it? This is a  Christmas  present

almost  of fairly considerable sums which the Government could utilise, some  of

it permanently and some of it temporarily without interest.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In the first instance, I do not think that the sums of

money  involved  are considerable; and, secondly, in so far as  other  countries

have considered this proposal, the majority view is not to fellow the Australian

practice.  It  could  be  that such a majority view is based  on  ether  ancient

concepts of the right of private property. As I said, I myself do not think that

we  should,  before  other  countries  have  followed  the  Australian  example,

introduce in this country a new principle which is not accepted and followed  in

the majority of countries with banking systems similar to ours.

<div align="center"><b>TAX LEGISLATION ON MARRIED WOMEN'S INCOME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will consider

introducing legislation to treat the income of married women from all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>

sources as being the income of single women for tax purposes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The recent

amendment  to  the  Income Tax Ordinance to provide for separate  assessment  in

respect  of  the  earned income of a married woman was to adjust a  longstanding

inequality and to bring about a social betterment. But to extend this  treatment

to  other sources of income would open new avenues for evading payment  of  tax.

For  one  thing,  a  way is open for the manipulation of profits  so  that  the

husband's  income can be transferred to that of his wife's so as to  reduce  the

incidence of tax and bring about a loss to the revenue. This fact was recognised

when the recent amendment was not extended to cover all kinds of professions and

businesses.  Moreover, an opportunity is created to bring wives into partnership

which would lead to the avoidance of both income tax and estate duty. It will be

appreciated  that,  in the absence of gift duty, which is a normal  compensatory

levy  in  place of the loss of income tax and estate duty, such loss of  revenue

could not be accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I do not consider the proposal of the hon. Member a good

one.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Admitting the validity of that part of the objection raised by

the Minister for Finance, Sir, would he rot recognise that, in fact, the reasons

indicated  are  not applicable where a married woman had unearned income  before

marriage?  She might have inherited property from which she was drawing  income.

Would  he  consider  in that respect that there can be no question  of  evasion,

making her unearned income prior to marriage taxable as a femme sole?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can see one immediate objection to

that,  and that would be the possible transfer of property from the man  to  his

fiancee.  I think this matter is not so simple as it looks. As I said, if  there

is  in  force a tax on gifts inter-vivos, then possibly the inducement to  avoid

income tax by distribution of property would be much less.

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK'S</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OUTSIDE AND INSIDE MALAYA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance what is the present

extent  of investment of the Post Office Savings Bank in (a) securities  outside

Malaya,  and  (b) securities inside Malaya; and to what extent  there  has  been

profit or loss in respect of securities in both classes at the market rate.





<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Singapore Post Office Savings Bank has securities

in  Malaya  and  outside Malaya valued at $37,515,318.08,  according  to  market

prices as on 31st December, 1961. Of this amount 63 per cent or

$23,542,024.96  was  invested  in securities  outside  Malaya;  3  per  cent  or

$1,184,203.12  in  securities of the Federation of Malaya and  34  per  cent  or

$12,789,090.00 in securities of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book value of the total securities as at 1st January, 1961, was

$36,903,066.48,  in comparison with the market value of $37,515,318.08  on  31st

December,  1961.  Therefore, during the year 1961 the book value  of  securities

held  by  the  Singapore Post Office Savings Bank had, in fact,  appreciated  by

$612,251.60.  The breakdown of this increase in net values of the securities  is

as follows: -



<pre>

                                                  $   c.

            Securities held outside

               Malaya had gone up

               by                             324,056.60



            Securities in the Federation

               of Malaya had depreciated

               by                              25,950.00



            Securities in Singapore

               had appreciated or

               gone up by                     314,145.00



</pre>

giving thereby a total increase therein of $612,251.60

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book value of securities fluctuated as follows in other years: -



<pre>

                                                  $   c.



            In 1958 it went up by             278,140.00



            In 1959 it went down by           240,835.00



</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960 it went up by $606,190.00. I have given the figure for 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On occasions when it was necessary to sell some securities held by the Savings

Bank  only those securities that were nearing a few months before their maturity

dates  and  those  that  had  actually matured were realised.  Consequently,  in

realising  these  securities, no capital gain or loss was incurred  as  compared

with the par value of these securities.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In the light of the figures given by the Minister, he will

appreciate that the investments in Singapore seem to show the best returns  with

twice  as  much  profit  as  those overseas. In those  circumstances,  would  he

consider investing some of that 63 per cent that we invest outside Malaya within

our shores?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker.

Sir,  if it is advantageous for us to do so, we will certainly do so. But  there

is  one factor which should be taken into account, and it is this. Over the last

eight  or  ten  years,  there has been a decrease in the total  deposit  of  the

Singapore  Post Office Savings Bank due to the fact that most new savers  prefer

to  bank  their  savings in the commercial banks which have shown  a  phenomenal

increase in recent years. The result was

that  the Post Office Savings Bank had to liquidate some of its  long-term assets

as and when they matured. This being

so,  it  is better to keep a fair amount of securities in  the

London money

market  where  large sums of money can be realised at very short  notice.

If these

sums are not available and if a large

part of the securities are held in

Singapore, it will not be easy for the

Post Office to sell them at short notice

without loss of capital. As I said, the

increases or decreases as entered in the

balance sheet of the Post Office Savings

Bank are really book values. They do not reflect the actual purchases or sales.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I want to ask the Minister just one more question. The

investment  overseas, Sir, is over $20 million. The utilisation  of  that  money

locally would assist our own industries,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



or even in Malaya it would assist Malayan industries. There is an advantage, therefore,

in investing locally.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for

Anson must realise this is Question

Time and not time to debate. If the

Member will just ask the question, he

will be permitted to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In those circumstances, the Government could not itself advance

such monies which the Post Office may require in respect of realisation which it

is  not  possible to make speedily, and provide for investment of these sums  in

Malayan securities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the need for investing more of local savings in

Singapore  must  be borne in mind. Indeed, that is the reason  why  we  in  1960

passed  through this Assembly, a Bill to amend certain provisions  of  the  Post

Office Savings Bank Ordinance which allows the whole of the deposits in the Post

Office  Savings  Bank  to  be  invested in  Singapore;  formerly,  there  was  a

limitation of 40 per cent. But considerations of liquidity, for reasons which  I

will  explain, for the time being, although there may be a need to increase more

investments  or more securities in Singapore, I do not think that we  should  go

the  whole  hog,  unless  and  until a proper money  market  is  established  in

Singapore  which  can  meet  large claims for liquidation  of  assets.  In  this

instance, for instance, even the Federation of Malaya, which has similar laws to

ours, is keeping about half of its Post Office Savings Bank assets in London.

of about 30 acres reserved and earthworks are almost complete. Construction will

begin  on  the buildings that will house the steel mill next month or  early  in

August.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister indicate whether the terms of alienation have

now been agreed upon by the Board and made known to industrialists who may seek

to establish industries in the Jurong area?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> These are at present under discussion between the Board and

my  Ministry.  There  are many details to be resolved,  but  I  think  the  most

important one is this: that we should not allow any part of Jurong to be  bought

under  some  pretence  of establishing manufacturing industries  with  the  real

purpose of speculating on almost certain increased land values in Jurong.  There

are  several ways of ensuring that this objective could be achieved. The  reason

is  that at least in the first phase in the development of Jurong, we intend  to

lease  out  these  industrial sites for fairly long  terms  and  at  the  lowest

possible  cost,  that is to say, the cost of development to the Government  plus

any  other overheads; certainly not to make any profit on it. Therefore, it  is

necessary  to secure a safeguard against private enterprise taking advantage  of

these very advantageous terms to cash in on possible profit in land speculation.

<div align="center"><b>KALLANG ESTATE HOUSING BOARD FLATS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Dissatisfaction of tenants over rentals)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the

Minister for National Development whether he is aware of any dissatisfaction, in





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



respect  of rental, by the tenants of the Housing Board flats at Kallang  Estate

and whether he would make a statement on the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that there has been some

dissatisfaction  from  new tenants who moved into the  Housing  Board  flats  at

Kallang  E-state after 16th March, 1961, when the Housing and Development  Board

introduced  rationalised rentals for this Estate. A group of 28 tenants  out  of

some  2,840 tenants in this Estate made representations that they be allowed  to

pay  the old rents of $25, $35 and $45 to $55 for one, two and three-room  units

respectively at Kallang Estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These old rentals were fixed by the previous Government and resulted in the

Housing  and  Development  Board having to meet a loss  of  approximately  $1.5

million  annually in respect of less than 3,000 units in the Kallang Estate.  It

would  seem that these rentals were fixed with undue haste in 1958, with an  eye

to  the  general elections. The Housing and Development Board, as  a  nonprofit

making statutory undertaking charged with the responsibility for the provision

of  public  housing accommodation in the State, will have to depend on  the  Government  to meet the deficit, and steps to rationalise rents have been taken  in

the public interest in order to reduce progressively the subsidy which has to be

met from public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rents of $40, $60, and $75 for one, two and three-room units are

payable  only by new tenants who moved in fully aware of what they were required

to  pay.  It  should  be pointed out that even these rents are  well  below  the

economic rents payable if the Housing and Development Board were to let them out

without  suffering  too  much of a deficit. I would  stress  that  the  existing

tenants  who moved into the Estate before 16th March, 1961, are continuing  to

pay the former rentals of $25, $35 and $45-$55 per month for one, two and three-room  units, and these tenants number some 2,620. Those new tenants who  entered

into their tenancy agreements after March 1961 to occupy the flats with full



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>

knowledge of the new revised rentals they were required to pay had moved in on a

voluntary  basis, and I do not see the necessity or justification  to  take  any

steps  to vary the rentals for which they had individually contracted to pay  to

the Housing and Development Board.

<div align="center"><b>ACCOUNTANTS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the moment there is no legislation providing for the control of the

accountancy  profession  as  in the case of lawyers,  architects  and  doctors.

Qualified members of recognised bodies practising



the State observe professional codes laid down by the distant parent bodies



which  cannot,  however, exercise control here. Again, unqualified  accountants

in practice are not bound by bye-laws and code of ethics. Any malpractices among

them are apt to bring the profession into disrepute. There is, however, a danger

of  having  "mushroom" and "splinter" societies or associations  of  accountants

being formed to admit persons of very low standards of accounting knowledge  and

skill.  In  these circumstances, the need for a local parent body of control  is

evident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1961 the opportunity was taken of the presence of the Vice-President

and  the General Registrar of the Australian Society of Accountants in Singapore

to  carry out a survey of the accountancy profession. They submitted a report in

which  they  recommended  that a statutory body to  register  and  regulate  the

conduct  of all accountants in Singapore should be established. This Bill,  Sir,

is based on the recommendations of this Report. Regard is also paid to graduates

who have already passed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the Bill provides for the establishment of the Singapore Society of

Accountants  and  its  purposes are to register accountants,  to  determine  the

qualifications of persons for admission to the Society, and to regulate the practice

of the profession. Powers to enable the Society to function are also  laid

down. This is provided in Part II of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution of the Council of the Society with its enabling powers to

carry out its functions of control are laid down in Part III. Provisions for the

registration  of the accountants are laid down in Part IV. Part V  provides  for

the  regulation of conduct of members and the establishment of the Investigation

and  Disciplinary Committee to deal with complaints from members. The powers  of

the Disciplinary Committee to levy punishment are laid down in clause 32.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



There  is  provision  for  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Disciplinary

Committee.  Part  VI consists of a list of offences and penalties  that  can  be

levied under this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the Bill are, however, explained in fuller detail in the

Explanatory Statement attached to the Bill. No one will dispute the need for the

regulation  of  professional  conduct and standards  of  important  professional

groups.  This Bill seeks to do this. At the same time, I must sound  a  word  of

warning  against  the dangers of regulation in these matters. It  often  happens

that professional associations, under the pretext of maintaining high standards,

introduce unduly restrictive measures which have the effect of creating a  tight

closed  shop.  This has undesirable effects in two ways. First, an  artificially

created scarcity value for their services compels society to pay high rates  for

them.  Second, talented people are denied adequate opportunities of  entry  into

the  profession and are hence restricted in the choice of careers open to  them.

Members  will  agree that we do not want this to develop in  the  profession  of

accountancy as a result of regulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is the first time that a Bill on the control of the accountancy profession

is being introduced and there are provisions of an important nature,  I

propose  that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee after the  Second  Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and five

Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.-[Dr Goh Keng Swee].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Ordinance

(Chapter  246)  approves the reclamation by Government of that  portion  of  the

foreshore  and sea-bed containing an area of approximately 48 acres along  Upper

East  Coast Road from the junction of Bedok Road as delineated on the plan which

is deposited at the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> later entered the Chamber.

<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir. I had forgotten that

from time to time the House can get on with the business of expedition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion is being moved because the Housing and Development Board has

estimated that it can reclaim approximately 48 acres of the foreshore  and  sea-bed  along  Upper  East  Coast Road, from the junction  of  Bedok  Road  to  the

Fisheries Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board owns over 220 acres of land in Lot 41, Mukim XXVII, immediately

opposite  the  said foreshore and sea-bed. The intention is to cut approximately

14.4 acres from the hill land and w

ith  the  land  to fill the reclaimed foreshore and sea-bed. This  reclaimed

land  would  be  for  open  spaces, parks, recreation centres,  and  residential

development, but the detailed use of the reclaimed site could be left open  for

consideration  at a later date in accordance with the Master Plan proposals  for

the area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have deposited with the Clerk of the Assembly a copy of the

Plan  which is now lying in the Library. Under section 4 of the Foreshore  Ordin

ance,  no  reclamation can be made without the sanction of this  Assembly.  This

motion seeks to require authority. The Housing and Development Board will act as

agents for the Government and on completion of its reclamation the land will  be

declared State land to be held in trust for the Board for development as I  have

enumerated above.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, my amendment is all the more pertinent in the light of the in formation we now have of an official character of the tragic nature of the in tended conduct of the Government as to the question it will be seeking to poll. I will first speak to the principle, Mr Chairman. It is a recognised principle

in  many  democratic countries that where there are matters of gravity affecting

the people, if the opportunity is available, their vote should be taken directly

in  ascertainment  of their wishes rather than through the  indirect  method  of

representative government. The referendum is, in fact, as one delegation put it,

an  auxiliary  to  amend the defect in the indirect democracy  of  parliamentary

rule, and it is not only valid where the Government may have lost the confidence

of  the country but also where the Government may propose an issue which a  vast

number  of  the citizens do not like. The value of the referendum, Sir,  in  its

direct democracy is that no one can then deny that the wishes of the people have

been expressed and that the majority will is known and those who accept the demo

cratic process must loyally abide by the majority will, thereby helping to  heal

the breach between persons honestly holding different views on major issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, in Switzerland where perhaps the issue of referendum has been best perfected, we have it that the matter must be discussed in the Assembly and the question put whether they want the constitutional change proposed and to answer yes or no. In Australia, there is a constitutional requirement that in

respect  of  any proposed constitutional change when Parliament has passed  that

provision, it must be submitted to the people, and it can only be effective  law

when it has been approved by a majority. Again you see, Sir, a Parliament coming

into the formulation of a question. In Canada and New Zealand, Sir, there are ad

hoc  laws to deal with individual aspects which are referred to a referendum and

no  general  provisions and in each case the issue and the question are  decided

and  framed by the Parliament concerned. We have had an interesting recent  case

of Jamaica, where in the Jamaica Referendum Act of 1960, the question





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



was  framed by the Jamaican Assembly for the purposes of balloting on the  basis

of a reply of yes or no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not unaware that this issue has been resisted with considerable heat

and  tortuous  argumentation by the Government. But there  are  certain  aspects

which  make  interesting reading, and I would refer you, Sir,  to  the  Official

Report No. 3, col. 83.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Before the Member does that, do I understand him now to

indicate  that his amendment, which is to leave out "considers" in line  17  and

there  to  insert "is advised by the Minister at the request of the  Legislative

Assembly", has some connection with his amendment to clause 13. In page A3, line

41, to  leave  out  "questions"  and insert "one  question  as  framed  by  the

Legislative Assembly". I do not know whether that is so because, on the face  of

it, that is not so. Clause 5 merely says

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers that it is in the public

interest  to  do so he may by order direct that any matter he submitted  to  the

electors for a referendum.'



<br><br>It  deals with the matter and not the question, and the hon. Member wishes  that

to  he done on the advice of the Minister made at the request of the Legislative

Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, I would wish to avoid confusion, and although the

two  are not unrelated, they do raise distinct aspects and, with your leave, Mr

Chairman, I would rather that they be debated separately.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Separately?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman. I was referring to the Gov

ernment's  approach  to  the Opposition's request that the  question  should  be

decided on the advice of the Minister at the request of the Legislative Assembly

that the matter should go for referendum-um, and you will notice, Sir, that  the

Minister  for  Finance  in the Officini Report of the Select  Committee  on  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 3, of the 8th of May, col. 88,  line  5,

states:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...no government in its senses is going to have a referendum on a matter which

is not of national importance. Any matter of national importance must be debated

in the Assembly. It is the natural course of events.'



<br><br>He is followed in the opening remarks by the Minister for Home Affairs in column

89:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...everybody agrees that a referendum will be held only on matters of national

importance.  As my colleague has just said, matters of national importance  will

have  to  be  brought  up and discussed in the Assembly, because  no  government

elected  by  the  people  would be foolish enough to ignore  the  views  of  the

people.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, in view of the admission by the Government of the principle involved, I find it very difficult to understand why they object to the issue being debated and formulated in this Assembly. They are conscious, and the Opposition is even more conscious, of the fact that they have the majority,

and  they  can if they so will, and no doubt they only directly by  order  that

any matter will so will, steamroller such question through as they please -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I still cannot

follow  the  Member for Anson. He has indicated that he would  prefer  that  the

debate  on  his  amendment to clause 5 be separated from the debate  which  will

arise from the amendment to clause 13. Clause 13 indicates that there should  be

one  question to be framed by the Legislative Assembly, whereas in clause 5, all

that the Member wishes is that, using the words, "the Yang di-Pertuan Negara can

only direct by order that any matter be submitted to -the electors on the advice

of  the Minister after receiving the request of the Legislative Assembly".  That

is a matter and not a question. There may be several questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is so, Sir. What is pinpointed in clause 13 is the

question  whether  it is to be one or more questions. In clause  5,  it  is  the

matter  that  is  being  referred to His Excellency the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,

through  the  Government for a referendum, and consequently the  formulation  of

that  matter is within the ambit of the Assembly. I am seeking to show that  the

Government themselves admit that the formulation should be within the  ambit  of

the Assembly, and that, in fact, whatever intent they may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



have,  of which we have now had so much notice, they are in a position  to  push

through  and  impose their will by virtue of their number.  The  value  of  this

suggestion,  Mr Chairman, that the formulation should be in the hands  of  the

Assembly,  is  that at least there is an opportunity to awaken  the  people  of

Singapore to the facts inherent in the proposed formulation, and also  from  the

constitutional aspects that the Opposition should have its share in  attempting

to  assist the Government, however deaf the Government may be to reason. I  urge

that  whether such a vast sum of money as $400,000 is to be spent in itself  is

immaterial,  and  not  the main issue. Where the issue is to  be  one  affecting

gravely the future of the people, no referendum should be held unless requested

by the Legislative Assembly in the terms indicated by this Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must regulate this debate. I have asked the

Member  whether he wishes to include his amendment to clause 13  in  this  parti

cular  debate.  He has said no. As far as I can make out, we are  now  concerned

whether or not it is the Legislative Assembly which should request the Minister

to  invite  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara by order to direct that any  matter  be

submitted  to  the electorate. The matter, to my mind, would be a broad  subject

matter,  like,  for  instance, merger, or, as we have indicated  in  the  Select

Committee, the issue appertaining to toddy shops. But when we come to the actual

question  or questions, then the debate, of course, will take the line taken  by

the  Member for Anson, that is that he desires that there should be one question

and  that  question should be framed by the Legislative Assembly.  Therefore,  I

would  suggest that we confine ourselves to whether or not it would be the  wish

of  the  Assembly that this order directing that any matter be submitted to  the

electors should be left to the Government advising the Yang diPertuan Negara, or

to the Government after a request being made by the Legislative Assembly. I hope

I have made the issues very clear on this particular amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendment of the Member for  Anson.  Of

course, it is not the issue so much as the question, because in a referendum  it

is the answer to the question that will decide the fate of the nation for genera

tions to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already in the Select Committee gone to great details as regards the

argument  why  we  should have the whole affair debated in the Assembly.  It  is

because,  as  I  pointed out, Sir, as the Bill now stands, the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara in actual fact means the Government, and that is the P.A.P. In fact  that

is the Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P., as admitted by the Ministers

in the Select Committee. Therefore, under those circumstances, it becomes a one-party affair. I do not want to elaborate on that, Sir, but surely we know that

the  referendum  is a national affair and in any matter that concerns  the  whole

nation proper airing and ventilation is abso1utely necessary so that all  the-e

people  must  know  all  the pros and cons, the good and  the  bad,  the  hidden

meanings, the connotations and the different aspects and viewpoints so  that  if

the people are presented with all these arguments, then they will better be able

to judge the issue when the question is posed to them for their answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pointed out, Sir, that discussion in the Assembly first will prevent

any  surprise  being sprung by the Government and a snap referendum  from  being

held. I will show you that, in fact, this provision has been put in because  the

Government  intended to have a snap referendum and to take unfair  advantage  of

the Opposition Parties. Let me try and give you the picture as we see it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Anson by-election, Sir, merger was the main issue of the various

Parties placed before the people. The Prime Minister on many occasions said at

rallies that a vote for the P.A.P. was a vote for the P.A.P. merger. And he said

on  many  occasions too that the P.A.P. merger plans would be placed before  the

people for their final decision.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid I have not made myself understood. I think

this  argument or this speech is working up to a debate on the second  amendment

which is in the name of the Member for Anson, the Member for Queenstown and  the

Member for Hong Lim, which seeks to add a paragraph.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Not more than one question shall be submitted to the electors in any one

referendum and such question shall contain only one issue and the electors shall

only be required to answer such question in the simple affirmative or negative',



<br><br>and  allied  to that would be the amendment to clause 13, where the  Member  for

Anson  and the Member for Queenstown seek to leave out "questions" in  page  A3,

line 41, and insert "one question as framed by the Legislative Assembly".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to indicate that in this particular clause we are not concerned

with whether there should be one question, two questions, or three questions. We

are concerned with the matter in this particular case which has been referred by

the  Member for Queenstown-of merger. So the debate should be on whether or  not

any  matter of merger should go to referendum on the advice of a Minister at the

request of the Legislative Assembly or merely on the advice of the Cabinet. That

is all the issue at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand that,

Sir. You remember in Select Committee I had given a brief outline of the referen

dum  plot of the P.A.P. and I had indicated to you, Sir, that when the Bill came

up for a fuller debate on recommittal, I would bring out the P.A.P. plot in each

of  the  important clauses in the Bill. I am, only trying to draw your attention

to one fact, namely, that the P.A.P. had intended to spring a snap referendum on

the  people. Since the intention was to spring a snap referendum, therefore, you

find now in the Bill the words "Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers. . .".  Now  I have indicated to you, Sir, that when the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

considers, he considers on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime  Minister

had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>

intended  that it should be a snap referendum and there should be no proper  dis

cussion in the Assembly. That is the meat of my contention, that it was part  of

the P.A.P. plot to have a snap referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is it then on the alleged plot of the Government to have

a  snap  referendum on the matter of merger, or is it on the matter of questions

connected with merger? I would like to understand the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, Sir, the matter and the question are ultimately

linked  up  and  on this particular issue as we all know, the  Government  have

admitted that this Bill is meant for the merger issue. However, I will skip that

part,  Sir,  since  you think it is not proper to debate  it  right  now.  Our

contention, Sir, is that if there is full and frank discussion in the  Assembly,

then it would not allow the Government to spring a surprise on the Opposition or

on the people, and everybody will be able to know exactly what is forthcoming. I

need  only, Sir, to remind the House of the indecent haste of the Government  in

the presentation of Bills in 1959, in 1960 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> You were here also.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and even in 1961. All these Bills had to be amended and

reamended time and again because they were done in great haste without any  full

discussion. In discussion we will be able to hiring out all the complexities and

hidden  meanings that may be in the matter. For example, I gave  an  example  in

Select Committee about cars. But if people are informed that the getting of  a

car  will mean the payment of a sum of $10,000 and of a few hundred dollars for

its  upkeep, then possibly a lot of people may not decide to have it. Similarly

in  talking  of  the White Paper on the P.A.P. type of merger, the  fact,  that

Singapore citizens are to be made second-class citizens must be brought out.  We

must also bring out, for example -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. I think, Mr Speaker, we have to bring

the  Committee back to the rails. There is an amendment being proposed  in  the

names  of  the Member for Queenstown and the Member for Anson, and I  think  we

will  be able to proceed with our business more expeditiously if the proposition

for the amendment is based on arguments which are relevant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have been trying to make myself clear, but I do not seem to

have  made myself clear. I think possibly the Member for Queenstown is  confused

because in Select Committee there was, in fact, a proposition by the Member  for

Anson  to alter the word "matter" to read "question" and that was when  all  the

remarks  which were made by the Member for Queenstown were very relevant.  But

now there has been no suggestion that the word "matter" should read "question",

and  I  have indicated that the word "matter", to my mind, could only  mean  one

thing. It could mean- a subject matter which might import one question, two ques

tions,  three  questions, or even four questions or more.  On  that  aspect  the

Member  for  Queenstown will, I think, have an opportunity to  put  forward  his

views  when we come to deal with the next amendment and other amendments on  the

Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes. May I draw your attention, Sir, to col. 111 of the same

Select  Committee  Official  Report? It was  only  after  we  had  debated  this

amendment  that is before you that we came to the issue of matter and  question.

That was separately debated.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member will remember that I allowed the debate to

range over that amendment as well as the amendment to clause 13. I think he will

find  that  that is so, and that is why all these statements were  allowed.  The

debate was allowed to range over all the subsequent amendments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will try and be as relevant as possible then, Sir. At the

present moment, the Government has the advantage of the Radio, Rediffusion  and

a  very  friendly  English Press that always presents the Government  point  of

view.  I can quite understand why the English Press is always willing to  help,

Sir,I  understand, for example, that the circulation of the Sunday  Mail  was

almost  stopped, because they put up headlines which the P.A.P. did not  like.

Well,  the P.A.P. can deny it if they like, but it is a fact. Again  it  shows

how dictatorial the P.A.P. is. Just because a headline is not to the liking  of

the  P.A.P.,  a paper can be called up and warned that if it does not  toe  the

P.A.P. line,  its  circulation in Singapore will be  stopped.  It  was  very

lucky,  Sir,  that  on this particular occasion, there were  frantic  telephone

calls between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hate to

interrupt any Member in this particular debate because I know the debate  is  of

national  importance.  I  am  sure  the Member  for  Queenstown  will  have  the

opportunity of putting in these little tidbits of his when we come to debate the

other  amendments which I have indicated. Let us now keep to  the  issue  as  to

whether or not when it comes to asking the people to go to a referendum  on  any

matter - not on a specific question

- the Government should advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara only at the request  of

the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is possibly

because the P.A.P. had been afraid of discussion that they did not want to  have

the  matter  discussed in the Assembly. In col. 307*, the Minister  for  Finance

said  that there was no precedent for Opposition Members to have a voice in  the

framing of questions. Now, I am not talking of framing a question, Sir. I  just

want  to bring it home to you, because earlier on he had said that there was  no

precedent  in the whole world that there should be discussion in the  Assembly

first. It was only later on when we



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Official Report of Select Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 5

dated 15th May, 1962.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



brought  out  the fact that there was discussion in the Assembly in Jamaica  and

quoted  other  instances too that he backed down and admitted that  he  made  an

error.  I  pointed  out, Sir, that although the P.A.P. claim  support  over  the

matter of the White Paper, they are afraid to let all the facts be known to  the

people.  The P.A.P. have spent large sums of money collected in taxes  from  the

people  for propaganda and for the benefit of their own pet projects like  trips

abroad, cultural teams, Malaysia Weeks, posters, banners, advertisements,  pamph

lets  on  the matter of merger. All the time they have been trying to  publicise

that merger is a very good thing. Now, we have to tell the people in the case of

these  merger proposals how unfair and unjust the P.A.P. have been to the people

of  Singapore, it is only discussion in the Assembly that will bring  all  these

things out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has already quoted to you international practice and I do

not  think  I need go into details. For example, I just mention the New  Zealand

Military   Training   Poll  Act;  in  Jamaica,  France,   Switzerland,   Canada,

Newfoundland, all over the world, Sir, wherever they hold referenda, the  matter

is  first  discussed in the Assembly and it is not just done by  the  Government

alone.  I need here only bring out the deceit and pretence of the P.A.P. in  the

whole  referendum Bill. Whenever they are cornered and whenever they cannot  put

up  any  more excuses, whenever their arguments cannot face up to the logic  and

weight  of arguments on our side, they always go back to the same old argument

that this is a general Referendum Bill. It is always their pet excuse

- this is a general Referendum Bill.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have tried to indicate to the Member for Queenstown that all

these  choice remarks could, I think, very well be passed when we  come  to  the

right  amendment. We are now on the matter of procedure actually, the matter  of

procedure  as  to  whether  or not when any matter  is  to  be  submitted  to  a

referendum, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara should make his order directing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



that  referendum on the advice of the Government alone or on the advice  of  the

Government  at the request of the Legislative Assembly. Any matter  meaning  any

matter in general. Therefore, all these comments on what the P.A.P. are going to

do  about  it, the particular question relating to merger - those remarks  do  not

arise now; or rather they would arise, but whether they are proper or not  is  a

different  thing. The Chairman has to look after those remarks as he  will  hear

only  proper  parliamentary remarks. But I think that trend will arise  when  we

deal with the next amendment where there is an issue of one question yes or no.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But I would like to draw your attention to the fact that

all  these  remarks  were passed in Select Committee while  we  were  discussing

clause 5 - the first amendment. The same amendment -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have already indicated that when we were in Select

Committee there was an amendment to change the word "matter" to "question"  and

because of that, all those remarks were relevant. I allowed the debate to  range

over  that  amendment  and the amendment to clause 13, and  that  is  why  those

remarks were allowed. But now no memher of the Opposition has chosen to move  an

amendment that the word "matter" should read "question". That being so, my  duty

is  to  channel the debate to the proper issue. The proper issue is  as  I  have

enunciated:  it  is  simply, when there is any matter  going  to  referendum - the

matter  of  merger,  the  matter of toddy-shops, or any matter,  the  matter  of

smoking  I  think was mentioned in Select Committee - whenever it is  considered

that  that  matter should go to referendum, then it is the Government  who  will

have  to  decide whether that matter should go, or is it the Government  at  the

request of the Legislative Assembly? Anyway, when it comes to the detail  as  to

what question will be asked on that particular matter, then so far as merger is

concerned, the Member for Queenstown will probably be in order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Under the circumstances, Sir, I do not wish to say

anymore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

generally  speaking, we can know from common knowledge that this  amendment

concerning whether the holding of the national referendum should be at  the

request  of  the  Assembly or whether it should be at the  request  of  the

Cabinet  does  not  make very much difference. We now  feel  there  is  the

necessity  to  bring up this amendment purely because this  Government  has

recently  acted  in  such a way that there should be this  necessity.  That

would  mean  that  if  the Opposition is faced with a Government  which  is

fairly  and  sincerely practising democracy, then there would  not  be  any

necessity  for us to bring up such an amendment. But now we  must  realise

that  we  are  in the state of experimenting with parliamentary  democracy,

and  in the course of the past two years of such experiment, we have  seen

that  the  Party in power has not done well. It has acted in  such  a  very

immature  way that we must bring up this amendment. Therefore, if  the  Government  has  not said that the Opposition can carry out canvassing  during

the  period of national referendum, and if the Government does not give  us

sufficient  time  to carry out canvassing, we will have to  bring  up  this

amendment.  Unless and until the Government indicates that sufficient  time

will  be  given to us for the purpose of canvassing, we will have to  bring

up  this  amendment.  In the course of debate on this  National  Referendum

Bill, the Government has shown that it has acted against

the principles  of democracy, and therefore we find the necessity  to  bring  up

this  amendment. This amendment, in my personal opinion, will help  us  in

the  experiment  of parliamentary democracy. If there is no evil  intention

on  the  part of the Government, then I see no reason why it should  refuse

this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  support the amendment moved by  the  Member  for  Anson.

Although  this  amendment  is  of  trifling  importance  compared  to   the

amendments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



to  clause  5  and clause 29, which are decisive and would make  all  the

difference  whether the coming merger referendum is going to be  an  honest

or  a dishonest referendum, yet I think if the Government would accept this

amendment,  it would improve the National Referendum Bill as a general  law

for future referenda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the difference between the present clause and the amendment,

if  the  Government accepts it, is that the Opposition Parties would be given  a

chance  to  ventilate their views on any matter which is of sufficient  national

importance  and  which the Government wishes to present  to  the  people  for  a

decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present clause, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is only the Government which

advises  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara to put such an issue to  the  people  in  a

referendum, and the people would be given only 14 days' notice under clause 6 to

weigh  the pros and cons of such an issue. But if the Government is prepared  to

accept the amendment, then what would happen is that such an issue, before being

put  to the people for a verdict, would first of all be submitted to this  House

for  a  thorough debate. This would be in the interest of the democratic  system

because  then  the people would be informed of all the pros and cons,  all  the

aspects of the issue as seen from all angles, and I think that would be  in  the

interest of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I say the request by the Opposition Parties is a fair

request. We do not ask for anything more - just let the Opposition have a  chance

to ventilate their views for the interest of the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if the term

"national referendum" is to be interpreted into Chinese, then it should  be  the

decision  of the people. That would mean that when a matter is approved  by  the

Assembly  or  any  governmental organisation, it should go  to  the  people  for

confirmation  or  rejection  as to whether this  decision  of  the  Assembly  or

parliamentary organisation should be adopted. That is the true



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



meaning  and definition of a national referendum. Therefore, today the amendment

of  the  Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown is very reasonable  and-rational. It is in the interest of the people and it is in compliance  with  the

meaning of a national referendum. When this National Referendum Bill was brought

up  for  Second  Reading,  the  Minister concerned  told  this  House  that  the

Government would have to spend some $400,000 to carry out a national referendum.

Now this $400,000 has to be approved by the Legislative Assembly before it could

be  spent  on the national referendum. Therefore, we can see clearly that  since

the national referendum will cost some $400,000, which is to come as a result of

the approval by this House, then a national referendum must, in the first place,

be  approved  by the Legislative Assembly before the Minister for  Home  Affairs

advises the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to bring it to the people for a decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of a national referendum is usually one of

national  importance. That being so, we in the Legislative Assembly,  which  is

the  supreme authority in this country, must have a say in the matter before  it

can  be  referred  to the people; in other words, such a matter  must  first  be

debated in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see that on item 3 of the Order Paper, the Prime

Minister has brought up a motion concerning the reclamation of Upper East  Coast

Road.  This  is  only  a matter of little importance, but  even  so,  the  Prime

Minister has to get the approval of the Assembly before the work can be  carried

out.  But,  comparatively speaking, a national referendum  matter  is  far  more

important  than this. So there is all the more reason why this matter  regarding

the  national referendum should be debated in this House before the Minister for

Home  Affairs can advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to issue an order  to  carry

out  the  national  referendum.  So, what we  are  requesting  now  is  actually

conducive to the true



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



meaning  of  the term "national referendum". It is a very legitimate request  we

are  making.  We  see no reason why the Government cannot accept this  amendment

which  is  coming  from the Opposition. We must not allow a matter  of  national

importance to be dealt with by the Government alone and in a unilateral manner.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 7 of the Bill says that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

has  the  power  to  postpone a national referendum. Since the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara can decide the holding of a national referendum and also postpone such  a

national  referendum, then I would say that the Government will spend a  lot  of

money when conditions are to their favour.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. To put the record right, I think the hon. Member has been

interpreted  as  having  said  that the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  has  power  ta

postpone  a referendum under clause 7. Well, clause 7 reads:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If at any time

after the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  has  issued the order referred to in section 5 of this Ordinance  it  is

shown  to his satisfaction that owing to any cause whatsoever no referendum  has

been  held  in  pursuance  of such order, he may at any  time  thereafter  issue

another order for the same purpose.'



<br><br>So,  it  is  not a question of postponing. It is a question of if the referendum

has not in fact been held.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I meant to say that the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, on the advice of the Cabinet, feels that if  conditions

during  this  period are unfavourable to the Government, then  the  Cabinet  can

advise  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to change the time for  the  holding  of  a

national referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out very clearly here that since this

is a mattter of a national referendum, it should be referred to the Assembly. It

should  not  be  left in the hands of the Government at a time when  things  are

favourable to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my personal opinion that if the Government wishes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



to  comply  with  the  principles of democracy,  then  the, amendment  of  the

Opposition  must be accepted by the Government unconditionally.  The  Government

has no reason to reject it.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's arguments against

the  principle of this amendment in the Select Committee were somewhat  childish

and  puerile. The Government's attitude was, in fact, such that it  amounted  to

saying, "This is my business and you shut up!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is very much the behaviour of an upstart child. The whole attitude

of  the Government seems to be governed by its belief that it can insist on  its

so-called  rights of a government and disregard the feelings of the  people.  It

appears to the P.A.P. that forms are all important - so important that they  throw

out reason and sense and forget their obligation to the people and the necessity

for fair play. The way the

P.A.P.  Government  conducts itself illustrates the extent of degeneration  that

has set in. They imagine that once they have been elected they have the right to

play  ducks and drakes with the people. I do not think it is because the  P.A.P.

Ministers are so dull as to lack a sense of logic. It is just that they want  to

ensure  that  our people are kept ignorant and confused on any  matter  put  or

referred to them in a referendum, and particularly on the merger issue. This  is

evident.  They  deliberately  close  all  doors  for  a  full,  frank  and  free

discussion.  Ignorance  and  confusion on the referendum,  particularly  on  the

matter of merger, fits very well into the P.A.P. scheme of things, because  that

is the only way they can survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on this Bill so far held in Select Committee, their argu

ments  were  directed  at  clouding and confusing the  issue.  The  Government's

attitude to the principle of this amendment in the Select Committee - they have up

to  now  kept  quiet, I do not know whether they want to put  forward  the  same

arguments - can  be  summed up to be replies that were advanced to arguments  that

the  Opposition had not put forward, instead of giving replies to arguments that

the Opposition had,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



in  fact,  put  forward.  Sir, the Government rejected!  the  principle  of  the

amendment in the Select Committee on three grounds, namely, one, that  it  would

infringe  upon the authority of the Government to refer a matter for referendum;

two,  that  it would involve the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in a public controversy,

and three, that certain gentlemen, namely, Mr F. Fernandez and company and' Mr

Ang  Kim Thye and company, had made representations to the contrary. Sir,  apart

from these three feeble reasons, the Government has not been able to put forward-any sound logical reasons for its rejection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine these reasons and ascertain their validity. To start with,

points  two  and three are uncalled for, because we have not suggested  that  we

desire  to  infringe  upon  the authority of the  Government  and  we  have  not

suggested  that we desire to bring the Yang di-Pertuan Negara into  any  public

controversy. Sir, the Barisan Sosialis is not asking the Government to assign to

the Opposition any of its functions or rights. We are not interested. We are not

anxious to drag the Head of State into a public controversy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On point one, Sir, will acceptance of this amendment infringe upon the

authority of the Government to refer any matter to a referendum? The answer is a

clear  no.  The  Government  has a majority in this House.  Although  it  is  an

uncomfortable majority of one, nevertheless it is a majority. So long as that is

the  case,  whatever is the decision of the Assembly it will, in  effect,  be  a

decision  of  the  Government with or without the Opposition's support.  In  the

present Assembly, the

P.A.P. need not doubt the support of

certain  Opposition  Parties  like U.M.N.O. How will  the  Government  lose  its

functions?  The  statement, Sir, by the Minister for Home Affairs  in  the  last

sentence  of  the  Official  Report of the Select  Committee  on  the  Singapore

National Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962, col. 89, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government consider that the right to hold a referendum on any matter and

any  time,  if  it  is  in the public interest to do so, is  a  matter  for  the

Executive and not the legislative power.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



This  is  not only irrelevant but also misleading. It shows utter  confusion

in

thought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position will be such that the Government will have the right to

decide  on  a referendum on any matter, because in this House the Government

has a majority. The decision of the final form of the actual question to  be

put  to the people will rest with the Government, because the Government has

a  majority in this House. No question can be put to the electorate  against

the  will of the Government, because the Government has a majority  in  this

House.  As  long  as the Government has a majority in this Assembly,  as  in

fact  the Government should rightly have, it means that it is the Government

that  decides on whether to hold a referendum, when to hold (he  referendum,

and on what matter to hold a referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thorough discussion on any subject for a referendum is a function of

this  Assembly. We must not confuse the issue. The Government's bluff as  to

losing  its  rights, etc., is merely meant to confuse and detract  from  the

issue.  Sir, the purpose of this amendment is clear. It is not to usurp  the

functions of the Government. It is to allow free and full discussion by  the

51  representatives  of  the  people on a  matter  to  be  referred  t)  the

electorate in a referendum so that the voters are clear about the  arguments

for and against that matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in rejecting this amendment - I do not know whether they want to

reject  it,  but from their performance in the Select Committee the  chances

are  that they would reject it - the Government would be rejecting a  call  to

allow  full  and  proper  discussion on any  question  by  all  the  elected

representatives  of  the people before the question on that  matter  can  be

actually put to the people.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 5 o'clock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-(contd.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed, "That the word proposed to be left out, be left

out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was saying, Sir, that the Government's argument against this

amendment  in the Select Committee had been on three grounds and I  was,  before

the tea break, at the end of my arguments on ground one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that the Government's reply had solely been, in my view, to confuse

the people. Point two, Sir, the Government's suggestion that if the principle of

this amendment is accepted, then the Yang di-Pertuan Negara will be involved  in

a  public controversy is even more ridiculous. I wish to quote the Minister  for

Law  who  repeatedly harped on this point in the Select Committee.  I  refer  to

column  86  of  the  same Official Report, the last line, the last  sentence  in

column 86:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If it is to be now provided that the Head of State must act on the advice of

the  Legislative  Assembly, it will follow that his acts will  be  brought  into

public controversy.'



<br><br>How  can the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be involved in a public controversy? He will

not and cannot take sides in the debates of this House. Is the Government trying

to  suggest that he may be politically biased one way or the other? Today,  Sir,

the  Government is supposed to make the laws of the country, but this  does  not

mean  that  it  can  jolly  well make whatever laws it pleases  without  first

referring  to  the  Legislative  Assembly. The  Government  is  constitutionally

required to bring the proposed laws to this Assembly for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



debate  and adoption. Only if the Assembly passes them can they be sent  to  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his sanction. On the logic of the P.A.P. Government's

argument,  this  must  mean that the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  has  already  been

involved  in a public controversy. But has this been the case? Perhaps  only  in

one  instance  and  only  one  instance,  and  for  that  the  P.A.P. is  fully

responsible.  You will remember, Sir, having agreed to and supported  the  Trade

Union  Bill  in  this  Assembly, they quietly slipped out through  the  Assembly

backdoor  and told the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to hold up the legislation.  What

cynicism  and  what hypocrisy, Sir! I cannot believe that the Hon. Minister  for

Home  Affairs,  the Hon. Minister for Finance and the Hon. Minister  for  Labour

could have offered this argument with any seriousness. They must be scraping the

bottom of the barrel in their desperate attempt to justify their case. I repeat,

Sir, today our Constitution is such that all Bills are only sent to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for assent after this Assembly passes them. The practice is  that

no  Bill  can  be  assented to by him if this Assembly does not  pass  it.  This

practice has not brought the Head of State into any public controversy, and  its

continuance need not necessarily bring him into one in the future. An  extension

of  this  practice  to  include referenda on matters of national  importance,  I

submit,  Sir,  need not necessarily bring him into any public  controversy.  The

Government's bluff once again is merely meant to mislead and confuse the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the third point, I need not say very much. In fact, the names of the

representatives   speak  for  themselves.  Sir,  they  are   well-known   P.A.P.

enthusiasts. Their representations have the Government's blessing,  so  much  so

that the only argument the Minister for Home Affairs in the Select Committee was

able to do was to quote two paragraphs. From their representations - I think it is

column  90 - he said, "I think these two passages put the Government's  case  very

clearly, and I do not think I need elaborate further on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>

matter." I would like to read these two paragraphs. I would like to quote  from

the top of the column:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you will permit me, Mr Chairman, may I quote two short passages from the

memorandum submitted by certain gentlemen? I refer to Paper No. 5, paragraph  4,

which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is no precedent in the world where a section of opposition in the As

sembly,  which  does not shoulder the responsibilities of government  is  given

the  right to decide what the Government should ask the people in a referendum.

For  the opposition to demand this concession is akin to asking for a share  in

the  administration to which it is not entitled. If the Government were to give

in  to  this demand, it might as well hand over the reins of Government to  the

opposition and allow the opposition to run the Referendum...'.



<br><br>And in paragraph 4 of Paper No. 6, I quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is the universal practice in every democratic country for the Government

in  power  to set the questions. There is logical reason for this. A referendum

is  a  method whereby the Government in power wishes to test public opinion  on

any  matter of its own choosing. It is not intended to be a vote for or against

a  particular  Government  or  Party.  Therefore  the  question  on  which  the

Government  wants  to  ascertain  public opinion  is  logically  a  matter  for

Government to decide.'"



<br><br>And  after  quoting this, Sir, all the Minister did say was, "I think these  two

passages  put  the Government's case very clearly, and- I do not  think  I  need

elaborate further on this matter."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, surely they put the Government's case quite rightly, because they are

P.A.P. representations. However, these two paragraphs quoted give  a  distorted

version  of  the  Opposition's stand. I do not know whether the  Government  had

deliberately told these representors that this was, in fact, the demand  of  the

Opposition,  but  anyway, these two paragraphs contained in  the  representation

give  a  distorted version of the stand of the Opposition. My arguments as  laid

down  in  points one and two earlier completely invalidate this distorted  claim

that the Opposition seeks to take over the functions of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, Sir, even if the Minister wished to accept the representation, he

must at least show a sense of balance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



This  representation  was  made by 8 individuals  who  represented  no  one  but

themselves.  But  mass  organisations like the group of  38  Trade  Unions,  two

Hawkers' Associations, two Associations of Rural Dwellers and 32 Associations of

Old Boys made representations to the contrary. Their sentiments are embodied  in

the amendment before the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these organisations, put together, represent well over one hundred thou

sand   members,   one  hundred  thousand  bodies  who  are  members   of   these

organisations. Well, if you add their families, their number will be  more  than

double.  In  addition  to  this, the P.M.I.P. and the Liberal  Socialists  both

supported the sentiments expressed in the amendment. Sir, if the Government want

to  accept  popular representation, surely the proper thing to do is  to  accept

these  amendments  and not to reject them and quote the words of  8  subservient

individuals to substantiate the rejection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I maintain that our request is perfectly legitimate. There are precedents

and  they  have been quoted in the Select Committee. A referendum,  particularly

the  forthcoming referendum on merger, is of national importance. It affects the

lives  of  all our people and their future and that of generations to come.  The

conduct of such a referendum cannot be left at the hands of one political Party.

They  should  not be left, above all, in the hands of a discredited Party  whose

dishonesty is evident. An Assembly decision will, in fact, meet the view of  the

majority, namely, that of the Government, yet the discussion and the debate will

be useful to all our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government accept this amendment, it is not because they have all of a

sudden  become  generous; it is because they are fully  aware  of  the  pressure

outside;  it  is because they are fully aware of the resentment -of the  people;

and  if  the Government accept this amendment, then it shall be a gain  for  the

people and not a concession given by the P.A.P. to the Opposition.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



But,  Sir, if the Government rejects this, then the question the Government  has

to  answer is whether it is prepared to allow a thorough discussion by  all  the

elected representatives of the people before they are expected to decide on  the

matter. I hope that our Ministers will not come back and tell us that this is a

Referendum Bill for merger, that the merger issue has already been discussed- in

the Assembly and that therefore there is no need to have this amendment. This is

something  which they have already said in Select Committee and  it  is  just  a

contradiction  of  their other argument advanced on the basis  that  this  is  a

general Referendum Bill. I say to them, Sir, whether this is a merger Referendum

Bill  or  a general Referendum Bill, our amendments and arguments state that  we

ask  the  Government to bring to this Assembly the matter - or  any  matter - to  be

referred  to the people in a referendum. We ask the Government to allow  the  51

elected  representatives of this House to debate that matter first so  that  the

people  will know of the arguments for and against that matter. This  should  be

done well before a referendum is held so that the people will have more time  to

consider the merits or otherwise of the issues put to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose and resumed his seat immediately afterwards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Minister for Finance always wants to stand up and put forward

whatever arguments he has and if he is going to tell us that merger has  already

been  decided,  then  I  need only quote his colleague, the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs,  who  says that this is a general Referendum Bill. My  point  is  this,

whether it is a general Referendum Bill or a merger Referendum Bill, the  matter

must be discussed in the Legislative Assembly. However, Sir, I will keenly await

the  Minister  for  Home Affairs, the Minister for Finance  and  the  most  Hon.

Minister  for  Law and their colleagues to put forward whatever  arguments  they

have.  The  Minister  for Law very categorically says that the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara will be involved in a public controversy if this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



amendment  is accepted. I would like to see the logic, Sir,I want the  Minister

for  Law to substantiate that publicly. As I said, I keenly await the arguments,

as  I  am  sure,  Sir, that since the Government have been generous  enough  to

suspend Standing Orders for this debate to go on till midnight, we can all  sit

here until midnight day in and day out, but they need not be impatient

- as  I  thought the Deputy Prime Minister was impatient - because when they  found

too  many  Barisan Sosialis speakers, they asked, "Why do you want this  discuss

this  small matter at such great length?" But we are prepared. Let them come  at

the proper time and put forward their case. If the Government are not afraid  to

give the people every possible opportunity to know the arguments for and against

an issue or a question, then they must accept the amendment. The purpose of this-amendment,  as  I have stated, is to allow a full, free and frank discussion  on

any  matter that is to be put to the people before it is actually put  to  them.

This  is because, Sir, we, unlike the P.A.P., want our people to understand  and

consider clearly any matter before they vote on it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today the practice of parliamentary democracy in

Singapore has come to a crisis; that is to say, parliamentary democracy  is  now

undergoing a very serious test in our country. Under parliamentary democracy, we

have   a   Party   in  power  and  Parties  in  the  Opposition  consisting   of

representatives of the people who have the right to air their views  on  matters

of  national  importance  so  that  the Government  can  practise  parliamentary

democracy  in  the proper manner. But, unfortunately, we can see  clearly  today

that  the  system of parliamentary democracy is now faced with  a  very  serious

test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convening of sittings in this Assembly should aim at discussing matters

pertaining  to  the political situation in the State or to the security  of  the

nation,  or  the welfare of the nation. These subjects should be the  topics  of

discussion in the Assembly. For example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>

on  the Order Paper today, we have a motion on "Reclamation of Upper East  Coast

Road",  but  here  we  have a more serious matter, a matter which  concerns  the

people of Singapore. We have this Singapore National Referendum Bill which deals

with the constitutional progress and future of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government has brought up a matter concerning the whole nation for

discussion,  a  matter concerning partly the administration of  the  Government,

then  this matter which concerns the whole interest of the people and the  whole

future of Singapore should not be overlooked by the Government. They seem to  be

trying  to leave this matter out of the hands of the Assembly. In trying  to  do

so, the practice of parliamentary democracy becomes a farce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Members of the House have been elected by the people in order

that  the views of the people can be reflected in the Assembly. Now, since  this

matter concerns the entire people of Singapore, the Government should not try to

take it out of the hands of the Assembly. They should not deny a full discussion

in the Assembly. So we want to find out why the Government are afraid to discuss

and debate this matter in the Assembly. The Government do not only try to refuse

a  discussion in the Assembly but they also try to stop the leaders in the civil

organisations  from airing their views. They even try to ask the newspapers  not

to  publish  the  opinions  of the civic organisations.  We  have  received  two

representations  from  78  civic  organisations  and  we  can  see  from   these

representations what their views are on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I asked why the Government was afraid to discuss the matter in the

Assembly.  If  they  are  sincere, and are prepared  to  practise  parliamentary

democracy  in  the  proper manner, then on a matter which  concerns  the  entire

people  of  Singapore, the Government should allow a discussion in the Assembly.

If  they are sincere, then I see no reason why the Government should act  in  an

arbitrary manner on the national referendum. If they want to veto the amendment,

then we can only come to one conclusion, and that is they want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



destroy  the system of parliamentary democracy. They should not behave in  this

manner,  otherwise it would mean that they are indulging in  a  secret  selling

out of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that the P.A.P. Government are now in the act of destroying parliamen

tary  democracy. In the present situation, they have lost faith in parliamentary

democracy.  When the Prime Minister came back from abroad, he said  at  a  Press

conference  that in Egypt there was no Opposition and, therefore, the  Party  in

power  did  not allow the Opposition parties to disrupt the cordial relationship

between  the  Government and the people. In the opinion of the  Prime  Minister,

that  system  was better and it brought about quicker progress than  what  India

could do, because in India, there are Opposition Parties whose opposition to the

Government's policies slow down Government work and thereby delay progress.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, from these talks of the Government Ministers, we can draw a conclusion,

that  is,  the parliamentary democracy in Singapore is now under a very  serious

threat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 (1) simply reads thus:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers that it is in the public

interest  to  do so he may by order direct that any matter be submitted  to  the

electors for a referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few minutes ago the Member for Upper Serangoon alleged

that  the  Government was immature and not adhering to constitutional  practice.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say if we had a more mature Opposition, this amendment

would  not  have been brought to this Assembly for debate in the first instance.

This is a procedural clause and is the practice in all democratic countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the constitution, as in all constitutions patterned on

the  British system of parliamentary democracy, the Head of State, in this  case

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, is obliged to act in accordance with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



advice  of  the Government. The Government in turn is responsible to the  Legis

lative  Assembly  for  the acts of the Head of State. It is  essential  that  in

exercising his powers under legislation the acts of the Head of State should not

be brought into public controversy. I am sure, as a lawyer, the Member for Anson

is  better informed on this aspect of the function of the Head of State  than  I

am.  He  will  also realise that this position is untenable if the provision  is

made  for  the  Head  of  State to act on the advice of the  Assembly.  However,

evidently one blunder does not make him a wiser man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment today does not alter the essence of the original

amendment of the Member for Anson. There is an old Chinese saying for this.  The

soup is changed but not the medicine. I shall leave this constitutional argument

in  more expert hands than the Member for Anson's. In any case, this is not  the

significance  of the amendment. The real purpose of the amendment  is  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen and the Member for Anson sought to  arrogate  unto

themselves the right to dictate whether there should be a referendum and, if so,

when.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has already been pointed out in Select Committee that in

no  country  in  the  world where parliamentary democracy is  practised  that  a

section of the Opposition which does not shoulder the responsibilities of govern

ment  be  given any executive power. The Government consider that the  right  to

hold a referendum on any matter and at any time, if it is in the public interest

to do so, is the function of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real point at issue today is whether matter of national importance will be

brought  before the Assembly for debate prior to a referendum being held.  This,

as  has  been  explained in the Select Committee, the Government  will  do.  All

matters  of  national importance, for which the Government consider a  national.

referendum is necessary, will be brought before the Assembly for debate, so that

there will be, in the words of the Member for Queenstown, a free, full and frank

discussion in the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were, as indeed the Government had done in the case of the proposed

merger referendum, indeed free,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



full and frank discussions in the Assembly for days on end. Mr Speaker, Sir, if

you  remember, the Member for Queens-town nearly bored all of us to  tears  with

his  seven-and-a-half-hour  speech in the Assembly  on  the  merger  issue.  And

previous to this Assembly debate, the merger issue had, in fact, been aired  for

quite  sometime  and  subsequent to the Assembly debate  there  were  even  more

discussions.  Mass  meetings were called by the Barisan Sosialis  and  house-to-house  canvassing organized, unfortunately, more with a view to scaring and  con

fusing  the  people. Be that as it may, the Barisan Sosialis and the Member  for

Anson  cannot  deny  that  merger, an issue of  national  importance,  has  been

thoroughly  ventilated  in the Assembly. And, in fact, the  Government  is  even

prepared to go further, if need be. The Government is even prepared, as has been

stated  by  the  Minister for Finance, to debate the details, and  that  is  the

questions to be put in a referendum for debate in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Referendum Bill is a very important Bill. It is important  not

only  to  the P.A.P. Government, which is nearly half dead, but it is also  very

important for all the people living on our little island. We do not care whether

or not it is important to the

P.A.P.  But we do care, because it is important for all the people of Singapore.

That  is  why we have this amendment, in order to prevent the P.A.P. from  doing

dishonest things which may cause disastrous events in Singapore. That is to say,

this  amendment  is  to guide the P.A.P. to do things in an  honest  and  proper

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the matter of the referendum to be put before the people affects the

people  of  Singapore as a whole. It does not only affect a few P.A.P. leaders,

and  therefore what the P.A.P. must first do is to seek the general approval  of

the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for this referendum the Government can ask the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to

do  what  the  Government want him to do. Therefore, the Yang  diPertuan  Negara

means the Government. Since all matters, important or not, have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



to be approved in this Assembly, there, fore, the matter of the referendum to be

submitted  to  the  people must also be approved by the Assembly.  If  not,  the

P.A.P. can close this Assembly and do things by Nazi methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all hope that this Bill will not become a Bill for the Fascists in

Singapore. Sir, the practice of parliamentary democracy in Singapore is  now  in

danger.  It is because there are a few political beggars who are now  in  power,

and  who keep on destroying the system of parliamentary democracy. Sir,  if  the

P.A.P.  Government  try  to deny it, they must honestly and  sincerely  practise

parliamentary democracy in Singapore and give the people a chance to  air  their

views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. Ministers were elected by the people in 1959, when they were

honest  to  them,  but  now  the P.A.P. leaders will betray  the  people.  They,

therefore,  dare  not face the people and give them a chance  to  express  their

opinion  and to choose what they want. I hope, from now onwards, all the  P.A.P.

leaders will behave like human beings and not like animals.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I suppose by

"P.A.P. leaders" the hon. Member means Members of this Assembly.  He  must  not

refer to them as animals. The expression must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The expression must

be withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> I withdraw, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that there

has  been  a  certain  amount  of repetition. Four speakers  have  repeated  one

another's arguments. I would just draw the attention of the House to it  at  the

moment. I do not say that the repetition has become tedious.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have reached an extraordinary position in

this  House where the P.A.P. leaders, and by that I mean Cabinet Ministers, are

quite  prepared  to appear before intelligent, understanding  people  as  either

being totally ignorant or intentionally misleading this House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has told you that by our amendment the

Barisan  Sosialis  and I have sought to arrogate the right to dictate  if  there

should  be a referendum, and if so, when. May I - I know you understand  it,  Sir,

but may I for the record: Clause 5 reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers that it is in the public

interest  to  do so he may by order direct that any matter be submitted  to  the

electors for a referendum.'



<br><br>And  what does the amendment ask? That instead of the

word "considers" it should now read:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is advised

by the Minister at the  request of the Legislative Assembly.'



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Legislative Assembly unfortunately is not the Barisan Sosialis,

plus  the Member for Anson, as you are fully aware. The Legislative Assembly  in

essence is, in fact, the majority party which is the Government. So to say  that

in  making this amendment we arrogate to ourselves the right to dictate  when  a

referendum should be held is. I suggest, Sir, intended merely for their  friends

of  P.A.P. Radio and the frightened members of the Press who give them  all  the

space  which they seem to require. It is not intended to convince you or  us  or

anybody.  This  argument  was  advanced if you  will  remember,  in  Select  Com

mittee - and was met in Select Committee - and whatever my personal views may be  of

the Minister for Home Affairs, I do not and never thought him quite so stupid as

to  be incapable of following a very simple and logical argument. That is how we

seek to arrogate to dictate if there should be a referendum and, if so, when, by

asking that the Legislative Assembly should debate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he said, Sir, that he does not mind and the Government does not mind if

these  matters are thoroughly debated in the Assembly. But that is all it seeks.

If,  in  fact, they do not mind, why this strenuous objection? That is  all,  in

essence.  What does the amendment seek? That the matter be fully debated  before

it is submitted to His



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



Excellency  for his Order. He said, "Ah His Excellency's act as  Head  of  State

should not be brought into controversy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, did you notice the commencement of this Bill:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A Bill intituled an Ordinance to provide for the holding of a national

referendum  and for matters connected therewith. Be it enacted by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  with  the  advice and consent of the  Legislative  Assembly  of

Singapore...'



<br><br>He  is  asking  in this Bill that we should advise and consent to the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  enacting  this law. It is part of his constitutional  function,

Sir.  You  know,  and we all know, but in order to meet this  specious  argument

which  was  advanced by the Minister for Law and the highly sensitive atmosphere

seemingly  associated with His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  you  will

notice,  Sir, that our amendment says that it is the Minister who should  advise

him but before the Minister advises him we should request the Minister. So, even

if it is true - and it is not, we all know - so that the people should not be misled

by  any  suggestion of encroachment upon the prerogative of His  Excellency,  we

introduced  the  amendment whereby it is now required that the  Minister  should

advise  him.  In  fact,  that is what is normally done. That  is  admitted.  The

Minister  is still advising him. But we say that the Minister should not  advise

His Excellency until we request the Minister. There goes the other argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Sir, with inflated chest, "We are going to allow the questions to be

debated  which  are  going to go into this referendum."  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  un

fortunately for the P.A.P., there is a Constitution, a Constitution  which  they

have  to work under and which in this Assembly is administered by you, and there

are the Standing Orders which permit the Opposition to bring up motions, and  it

is  thanks  to a motion from the Opposition that the questions which are  to  be

posed  by the referendum are going to be discussed - no thanks to the P.A.P!  They

never  gave  and never intended to give any opportunity to anybody  to  discuss.

They have consistently avoided any suggestion of debating the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



questions  or  telling us what the questions exactly were to  be.  So  these

gentlemen who take credit for their democratic approach in allowing -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Member

for  Anson will remember that he is addressing the Chair and if he turns his

face  away  from  the  Chair, I do not think he is in  fact  addressing  the

Chair. He must not address the Gallery.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> You will forgive me, Mr Speaker, if my eyes sometimes

stray away from you, and you can understand if my eyes sometimes stray  away

from  the  Government Benches. I say that these people who take  credit  for

allowing  a debate on the question should be exposed and that the debate  is

taking  place  no  thanks  to  them  but by  virtue  of  the  constitutional

provisions which compel them, so long as this Assembly is sitting, to  allow

this  Assembly's procedure to be followed. I have sought, Sir, to deal  with

every  argument  (and there are not very many) arrogation of  the  right  to

dictate   which  they  allege  of  the  Opposition  Members  with   complete

inaccuracy - the  allegation  that  the  amendment  would  infringe  upon  His

Excellency's  prerogative  which  is  completely  without  foundation.   The

curious  admission  which  I pointed out was made earlier,  Sir,  in  Select

Committee.  I  think I pointed out that they said, "Oh yes,  we  agree  that

issues  in  respect  of which $400,000 are spent should be  debated  in  the

Assembly."  Then what in the name of logic I do ask, Sir, is the reason  for

their  rejecting the amendment which asks no more than what they  say,  "Oh,

yes, it is perfectly logical and natural."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): r Speaker, Sir, we are now discussing clause 5 of the Singapore

National  Referendum Bill. You know that our discussion on  this  Bill  does

not mean that a national referendum is to be introduced by the P.A.P. or  by

us.  But  I  want  to point out that the P.A.P. are really selling  out  the

people  of Singapore. They are trying in every way to explain their  action.

For  instance they spoke on the citizenship and other issues. But  they  are

trying  to  sell  out the people of Singapore by means of these  trickeries.

But the people of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



are  very  discerning - they have bright eyes - and they cannot be fooled  easily.

The  people  inside and outside the House know full well that this is  a  phoney

merger which is not welcomed by all.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member

must  realise  that he cannot make a speech just for the sake of  making  it.  I

would  ask  him to try and relate his remarks to the issue before the House  and

that  is, as has been explained very clearly by the Member for Thomson  and  the

Member  for Anson and one or two other Members, whether or not it should be  the

Government who should advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to call a referendum  on

any  matter  or  whether  it should be the Government with  the  advice  of  the

Legislative Assembly. That is the issue at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I accept your direction. But I was only giving an example show

ing  you  what the consequences would be after having such a Referendum Bill  as

this. In clause 5, the Government want to provide for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

to  order the holding of a national referendum. But it is not very good  because

the  Legislative Assembly is the highest body in the State. Usually, when  there

is  pressure  on the Government, then it will decide whether or not  to  hold  a

national  referendum.  That  means the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  will  order  the

holding  of  a  national  referendum at the discretion of  the  Government.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, if you have not read about the Chinese novel, Travels to the West,

you would not understand that there is a so-called Monkey God who, according  to

the  novel, knows all sorts of tricks and magic. When this Monkey God  caused  a

lot  of  trouble in the heavenly palace - it appears from the novel that he  is  a

hero - a war ensued between the heavenly army's guards and the Monkey God. I would

say  that  if you do not have such tricks and magic such as the Monkey God  has,

you  will not win a battle. But there is another God or, rather Fairy. When this

Monkey God changed itself into other forms, this Fairy also changed into a  form

superior  to that of the Monkey God, so that he could always defeat  the  Monkey

God. Say, the Monkey God at first changed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



into  a  worm,  then  the other Fairy changed itself  into  a  fish.  After

several  changes, such as changing into a house or a temple,  and  what-not

the Monkey God in the end was unable to change itself into any form. Then -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can the Member tell

me how that bedtime story is related to the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, now I will touch on the point at issue. I was only

giving  an  example to show the actual situation. As I have  said,  perhaps

under pressure the Government will hold a national referendum just as  what

I have said, like the Monkey God changing itself into several forms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, what I mean is that the

P.A.P.     Government,  if  they want to have  a  clean  record  of  having

practised democracy and having recorded as having held an honest  and  fair

national  referendum,  should  accept  the  amendment.  In  doing  so,  the

Government should let the Assembly have a chance to debate and discuss  and

advise the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, otherwise it is not too good. What I mean is  that

if  the  P.A.P. want honestly and sincerely to hold a national  referendum,

it should accept the amendment as proposed by the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I pass a comment? Parliamentary democracy does not mean

that  every  Member of the Assembly should speak. Parties  have  their  own

Whips  to  decide how many speeches there should be and how  relevant  each

speech should be. Mr Tee

Kim Leng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today this House is discussing the

National  Referendum Bill. I believe that all Members  of  the  House  have

received  from various civic organisations and trade unions copies  of  the

memoranda.  [hey have clearly shown that if this House does  not  abide  by

the  practice of parliamentary democracy, then it would mean the  death  of

parliamentary democracy. From the debate up to now,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



we  have only heard one of the Government Members - only one. I believe they  have

received  many  criticisms and public attack. I believe they  will  one  day  be

judged by the people and will be deemed to be guilty by the people. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  why do we want to amend the present clause 5? The purpose I think you will

understand full well. Everyday you read the newspapers; the purpose is that  the

present P.A.P. Government's actions are more dictatorial and oppressive than the

colonial  government,  and they can do all sorts of improper  things.  They  can

create a lot of unnecessary provisions and a lot of improper situations. That is

why  before  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara orders  the  holding  of  a  national

referendum,  we  ask that the Assembly should be informed  of  it  and  have  it

discussed  in  the Assembly. When we say that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  orders

the  holding  of  a  national referendum, we ask that  the  Assembly  should  be

informed of it and have it discussed in the Assembly. When we say that the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara orders the holding of a national referendum, it means that  it

is  the Party in power which orders it. The Party in power, in the interests  of

itself,  may,  on  the  question of such national importance,  hold  a  national

referendum when the people are not prepared. Is this democratic? The next  point

perhaps is that the majority of the people of Singapore have already lost  their

confidence  in  the P.A.P. because they are always dishonest and  distort  their

views.  The  present Government may, by means of the propaganda machinery  which

they  control,  publicise  what they want to say to  the  people  through  Radio

Singapore  and  Rediffusion. The Party in power can use all the machinery  which

they control to tell the people distorted things. At the same time, we know that

when  a  government is in control of government machinery, it can resort to  its

powers  to  suppress  freedom of expression. It can  also  suppress  the  Press,

ordering  the  latter not to publish any news detrimental to the Government.  In

this  way, the Government can pass any law for anything formulated, and proposed

by itself, and can prevent the people from holding protest meetings. That is why

they are so suspicious of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



Government,  and  also  because the Government has  acted  in  the  way  I  have

described. The Government is also very likely to do the same thing again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know why we want to amend this clause - to ask the Assembly

to request the Minister to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to order to hold  a

national  referendum. We know that in a democracy every law should be passed  by

the Legislature. Therefore, a matter of national importance should be passed  by

the Legislative Assembly and let the Minister be requested by the Legislative As

sembly  before  he  advises the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. On matters  of  national

importance, if such matters are discussed in the Assembly, then the people  will

be better able to understand the matters and they can know better the situation.

Only  in  this  way  will  it comply with parliamentary democracy.  I  hope  the

Government will not put on the cloak of parliamentary democracy and at the  same

time destroy it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, so much heat has been generated over something so innocuous  which

need  not  even  be debated at all. It is a clear indication - in fact,  it  is  a

forecast of things to come over this Referendum Bill. Why has there been so much

irrelevant  talk  on  a clause that is nothing - that does not introduce  anything

new?  It  is  just a constitutional practice and procedure. It  is  because  the

Opposition  has  no more faith in the Government. Anything that  the  Government

wants to do is treated with doubt and suspicion - and the Opposition, particularly

the  Barisan, the excomrades of the P.A.P. want to do all they can to expose and

the  P.A.P. to  counter-expose. Nearly 3 hours of  debate  has  been  spent  on

exposures, counter-exposures and counter-accusations. It is indeed a  pity  that

this august House should be turned into a free-for-all between comrades and  ex-comrades,  and the very useful time of Members of this Assembly has been  wasted

in  listening  to  a  lot of irrelevant talk. So many of  the  Barisan  Sosialis

Members have spoken on this proposed amendment, and I really find it hard to be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>

angry  with them. All I can say is that I forgive them, for they know  not  what

they do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the Member for Anson, a person who is very well known as a

top lawyer in Singapore and who knows a lot about constitutions - for him to stand

up and give a very lengthy talk in moving his motion and had to be checked on  a

number  of  occasions on points of order, is something I find  it  difficult  to

forgive.  He  quite rightly brought out constitutional practice. "Look  at  this

law,"  he  said, "any law before it can become law, has to be on the advice  and

with  the  consent  of the Assembly." That is constitutional practice.  That  is

constitutional  procedure. So, in the same way, when  the  Government  wants  to

carry  out any kind of act under any law, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has  to  do

it.  He  does  it on the advice of the Government, never on the  advice  of  the

Legislative  Assembly. The Legislative Assembly is there to  see  that  any  law

passed,  or laws that are democratic, or laws that give unreasonable  powers  to

the Government, the Legislature, especially the Opposition, will keep a watchful

eye  on  any  acts of the Government in the administration of the  laws.  I  can

understand  why  the Barisan Sosialis are so strong on this. All their  speeches

have  been on the questions, not on whether or not a referendum has to be  held.

Now,  whether  or  not  the  referendum  has  to  be  held,  the  constitutional

arrangements with the Federation have already been dc-bated in this Assembly  on

the  motion introduced by the Member for Anson himself. It has been accepted  by

this  Assembly  that a referendum must be held to ascertain  the  views  of  the

people  as  to  whether  or not there should be closer  political  and  economic

associations with the Federation of Malaya. And on the matter of merger  itself,

this  Assembly  had 2 days of it, if I remember rightly, with  the  Member  for

Queenstown speaking for 7� hours - he is still the champion speaker, Sir. No  one

has  yet  tried  to  outdo what he has done. So, what is all  this  talk  about?

"Matters", "questions", what is all this about? The Minister, in reply to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



charges  levelled  by  Members of the Opposition, has said  just  now  that  the

questions will be debated in this Assembly.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Member for Upper Serangoon said that this amendment does not make

much difference. What he was aiming at were the questions to be posed and if the

Opposition  are assured that the questions to be posed will be fully debated  in

this  Assembly,  there should be an end to this unnecessary  debate.  The  funny

thing  is  this - the Member for Queenstown says, "If we let it go like  that,  it

will just enable the Government to have a snap referendum." A snap referendum on

what - whether  or  not  the  Barisan Sosialis should  be  banned?  What  sort  of

referendum can there be? Merger is the only referendum that is before the  House

and  before  the  public,  and  everyone knows that  there  is  going  to  be  a

referendum. How "snappier" can it be? Then we must pass this law as  quickly  as

we  can  with  all  the  proper  safeguards to see  that  the  undemocratic  and

unreasonable provisions are removed so that we will know sooner the views of the

electorate  as to whether or not the people of Singapore want closer association

with the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope with the assurance given by the Minister that the questions to be

posed in the referendum - in any referendum - will be brought before this House  for

open, frank and full debate, this should put an end to this unnecessary exchange

of words that are bringing us nowhere other than telling the people of Singapore

that  there has been this vendetta that is not only fought out in public but  is

also  fought  out in this august Chamber. Let us put an end to this  unnecessary

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am

very  surprised that there should have been such a long debate on a very  simple

constitutional point. The question is whether legally and constitutionally,  the

Head of State can be advised by a Minister who receives a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



request  from the Legislative Assembly. That is the question. Now, in  all  coun

tries  which have adopted the British parliamentary system of government, it  is

provided  in  legislation that the Head of State can do certain executive  acts,

and  when he does them, he must act on the advice of the Government. That is the

constitutional principle everywhere, and it is so in Singapore.  I  would  refer

the  Assembly to section 20 (2) of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council

which provides that the Cabinet shall have the general direction and control  of

the  government of Singapore and shall be collectively responsible therefore  to

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the Ministers who form the Cabinet are each one, separately

and  collectively, responsible for the advice which they give  to  the  Head  of

State.  They  are responsible to this Legislative Assembly for the advice  which

they  give to the Head of State. That is the constitutional principle, known  as

the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. That is the doctrine which is at the

root  of  democratic  government and we will be abdicating  our  position  as  a

Government it we knowingly agreed in this Legislative Assembly to the suggestion

that  the  Head of State should be compelled to act en the advice  of  a  single

Minister  who  receives  a request from this Legislative  Assembly.  That  is  a

nonsensical proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I would say that the Member for Thomson is a very acute

minded  person. In all these matters - even in legal problems - he has a mind  that

can see things in a far clearer and sharper light than the Member for Anson.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the way the Member for Anson performed here just now? He held up a

copy  of  the  Referendum  Bill and shouted, "Look  at  the  Singapore  National

Referendum Bill. Look at the oreamble! What does it say? Be it enacted  by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara with the advice and consent of the Legislative  Assembly

of  Singapore.'  Therefore, the Legislative Assembly can  advise  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara." But the Member for Thomson is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



person  with a more acute mind. Mr Chairman, he referred us to the Trade  Union

Bill  and  he  said, "There you are, look at what happened to  the  Trade  Union

Bill."  He then quoted me as saying in the Select Committee that the purpose  of

all  this  is  to  ensure that the Head of State is net brought  into  political

controversy. He did that to ridicule what I had said but he saw the  point,  Mr

Chairman,  Sir. He said, "There you are, here is the case of the Head  of  State

and  a  Bill.  We have enacted it, but the Government got hold  of  him  and  he

withdrew  his assent." He recognised the position. He could see the legal  point

which  the  Member for Anson could not see, that even in the matter of assenting

to  the Bill, the Head of State must, under the Constitution, take the advice of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the debate might go on for hours and hours. We are debating

with people who have a scant knowledge of constitutional law, but in accord with

democratic  practice,  we  are  quite prepared  to  sit  here  till  12  o'clock

considering  this clause. It is our duty to sit here and listen  attentively  to

each  and everyone of them, to the gems of ignorance that flow from their  lips,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it did appear just now when the Member for

Cairnhill was speaking that he was, in fact, speaking for the Government. For  a

moment,  Sir, I thought perhaps the Government had exhausted all their arguments

and  had to get someone else to put forward their case. However, Sir, the Member

for  Cairnhill is of no consequence to the political situation in Singapore, and

I am not in the least interested in him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Then why bring it up?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, up to now, the Minister for Finance has kept quiet. I thought,

from  his behaviour while I was speaking, that he was immediately going to stand

up  after  me  and  reply  to the points that I had raised,  but  unfortunately

immediately I sat down, he scooted -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>

[Interruption]

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. Somebody has said that this debate is generating

heat,   but  let  us  see  that  that  heat  does  not  produce  unparliamentary

expressions.  Any Member of this Assembly is entitled to walk  out  whenever  he

wishes, perhaps to take a rest from the Assembly debate and then to come  back.

I  do  not  think  it is right to say a Member scoots if he  walks  out  of  the

Assembly. That expression must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I withdraw it. But actually, what I meant to say was that the

Minister  for  Finance  disappeared from the  Chamber  and  what  made  me  more

sorrowful  was  that after the Minister for Finance had left  the  Chamber,  the

Minister for Labour after delivering his speech quickly Went out of the  Chamber

too.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sorry, the Minister for Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. These actions of Members are perfectly parliamentary, and

they  all  conform  to parliamentary democracy. I do not see how  that  has  any

relations to the matter that we are debating. Let us come back to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I was saying these things by the way, Mr Speaker, Sir. The Minister

for  Home  Affairs was, in fact, putting forward the same argument that  he  had

advanced  in  Select Committee. If I were to reply him once again,  I  would  be

repeating  all  the things that I had said earlier. Therefore, Sir,  I  have  no

intention of replying to his statement point by point. But I do briefly want  to

sum up the position, Sir. He said that it was a procedure clause and that it was

practised in all democratic countries. Sir, I am not a lawyer. I do not know the

finer points of law. But the Member for Anson, I believe, has quoted a number of

examples in Select Committee and I think he did quote countries like the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



United  States  and  New Zealand where the question put to  the  referendum  was

discussed and debated by the Legislature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a basic principle is at stake. What we want to ensure is that there is a

debate  in this House on any matter referred for a referendum to the people.  It

is  no  use  telling  us  that the merger issue has already  been  debated  and,

therefore,  there  is no need to accept this solution, because the  Government's

argument so far has been that this is a general Referendum Bill. Although  I  do

not  seriously  believe  them,  it may be well be  that  they  want  to  hold  a

referendum to decide whether one should smoke a pipe or want to smoke a  cigar,

as has already been debated in Select Committee. If the Government is serious in

saying that this is a general Referendum Bill, then naturally it is necessary to

have  such an amendment. Sir, in our minds, the arguments are quite simple  and

clear.  It  appears  to us that it is necessary to have this amendment  to  this

particular  clause in order to ensure that there is a debate on any matter  that

should be referred to the people in a referendum. It appears to us that if  this

amendment  is  not  accepted, then the Government is not obliged  to  refer  any

matter to this Assembly first for a debate before it is to be put to the people.

That is a fundamental point that we wish to make.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, I am fascinated by the number of self-anointed

experts  on law in this Chamber. The Prime Minster is a self-anointed expert  on

jurisprudence;  the  Minister for Health and Law is a  self-anointed  expert  on

constitutional  law.  He  says  that  it is  the  constitutional  law  that  His

Excellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara can only  act  on  the  advice  of  the

Government, not the Minister, but the Government. Well, Sir, if he is  quibbling

about  the word, I can assure him that the Opposition would be very happy if  he

were to move an amendment and substitute the word "Government" for "Minister" in

my amendment. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



would be quite content, it is not a matter of quibbling with us. The Member  for

Cairnhill, with round blue eyes, told us he could not understand what it was all

about, but he ended up by confessing that he knew what it was all about when  he

asked  us  to accept the assurance of the Government that they would  allow  the

Assembly to debate in future all matters before they go to a referendum. Is that

the way to legislate for a country - to accept the assurance of the Government?  I

am  not  saying  particularly the P.A.P. Government. I  am  merely  saying  that

governments  come  and  go, and governments are notoriously  short-lived.  Their

memories  are  short - and  that is hardly the way to run the  country,  to  accept

assurances  for  the  future  from  the Government  to  the  effect  that  those

safeguards will be complied with, as they could be so easily incorporated in the

provisions of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes I am equally

surprised  at  the  Member for Cairnhill but for different reasons,  that  there

should be this lengthy debate. The issue is a simple one. The principle has been

accepted.  You see, they give us an assurance that the matter will  be  debated,

but they will not have it in the Bill. Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It is not done.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, the Member for Home Affairs says it is- not done. I have a

vast number of precedents but I will not weary you at this juncture, though I do

not  promise  not to later on, Sir. The Referendum Act of 1960 of  Jamaica,  and

here it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Section (2) . For the purpose of the ascertainment of the opinion of the

people  of  Jamaica with respect to the continuance of Jamaica  as  a  component

territory of the Federation established under the West Indies Order-in-Council a

referendum shall be held. The referendum shall be held on a date to be fixed  by

the  Governor by proclamation, being a day not earlier than six weeks after  the

date of the Proclamation.'



<br><br>They  certified  the date or rather tbe time. They specified the question.  They

specified the way of reply, and that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



the  direction to the Governor who is in a constitutional position analogous  to

our Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I have no claim at all to be a constitutional expert,

self-anointed or otherwise, but it does seem to me that the Member for Anson was

completely  irrelevant in quoting the Jamaican Referendum Bill. That  particular

section  says the Governor shall hold the referendum in not less than six  weeks

or  what  have you, but the Governor would have to act under the advice  of  the

Cabinet  of  Jamaica, not on the advice of the Assembly. That is the  point.  He

might  use that particular section of the Jamaican Referendum Bill to  say  that

the  question to be posed in any referendum shall be debated in the Assembly.  I

would  say  that might be a relevant point to raise, but not in support  of  the

amendment  to clause 5 proposed by the hon. Member supported by the  other  hon.

Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, my interest in this clause S is not a political one, if the Member

for  Anson  will forgive me, it is a constitutional one, that is my interest  in

this  particular clause; and the constitutional aspect of clause 5  will  affect

not  only  the  P.A.P.  Government in power but perhaps  even  a  Workers'Party

government in power, or for that matter the Barisan Sosialis Party in power -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The S.P.A.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Or for that matter the S.P.A. or the Alliance. Sir, it was my

modesty.  Mr Speaker, Sir, as I understand constitutional practice in a  parlia

mentary  democracy,  it is this: the Cabinet is formed from the  majority  Party

returned to, the House; in Singapore it would be the Legislative Assembly.  Now,

that  Cabinet is formed by the leader of the Party who would be called upon  by

the  Head  of State to form the Government. He then appoints his Ministers  and

they  become the Cabinet and the Cabinet rules the country. So long as the Party

in power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>

has  the confidence of the House, it continues to rule, and the business of  the

Government is to rule. Now, in ruling the country sometimes they have to come to

the  Legislative  Assembly  to  get  its assistance.  If  it  happens  that  the

Government  wants  money,  it  must come t the Legislative  Assembly.  When  the

Government  wants  to enact new laws, it must come to the Legislative  Assembly.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  if the Government could run the country without  money  and

without  changing the laws of the country during its period of office, it  could

very  well  govern the country constitutionally without calling Parliament,  but

the difficulty in modem governments is this: governing a country is so expensive

that they must come to Parliament and therefore every year and from time to time

governments  are forced to convene the Assembly, or the House of Representatives

as  the case may be. It would still be parliamentary democracy if the Government

continues to rule without enacting new laws and without coming to Parliament for

monies. If they continue to rule the country like that, I think we all would  be

very happy and praise the Government and might even possibly vote them in again,

even though they do not call the House every month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the constitutional responsibility of the Head of State in a

parliamentary democracy, as I see it, is to accept the advice of his  Ministers.

Now,  the responsibility of giving good advice to the Head of State is  that  of

the  Ministers,  and the responsibility of the Ministers is to  the  House.  The

Negara or the Head of State as the case may be, is not responsible to the  House

for any of the acts he performs. Now, he can only perform acts on the advice  of

his  Ministers. If he does anything wrong, it is the Ministers who take the  rap

for  it,  as  they  are  responsible to the Assembly, or  the  House  of  Representatives as the case may be. The constitutional practice therefore is that the

Negara or the Head of State can only act on the advice of his Ministers, and his

Ministers are responsible to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>

House. If  he gives wrong advice, the Government is chastised. If it loses  the

confidence of the House, it resigns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not yet seen any law - and I am here

subject to correction by the Member for  Anson or any ether Member, and if they wish

to cite authorities  to  me,  I shall be very pleased to listen to it - which says that

a Head of State shall  act on  the  advice of the Ministers at the instigation of the

Assembly. I have  not yet  seen  any section in any particular Ordinance which says that.

The  Member for  Anson,  in  substantiation  of his claim, did  cite  the  preamble  to

two Ordinances wherein it is said,

"Be it enacted by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara with the  advice and consent of the

Legislative Assembly of Singapore, as follows:-". By  that  he  intended to convey

to the Assembly that the Negara acts  with  the advice  of  the Assembly.

I beg to submit, with great respect to the Member  for Anson, that that is not the

correct position. It is merely a form of words,  Mr Speaker, Sir, which is used in

Ordinances and which is necessitated by our Order in  Council. Mr Speaker, Sir, if

you will be good enough to look at Part VI  of

the  Singapore  Order  in  Council. "Powers and  procedure  of  the  Legislative

Assembly" under the marginal note "Power to make laws" it says this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to the provisions of this Order, it shall be lawful for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, with the advice and consent of the Assembly, to make laws for

the peace, order

and good government of Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will note that in the Constitution, the person who can

make  laws is the Negara and not the Assembly. It shall be lawful for the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara . . . to make laws for the peace, order and good government of

Singapore'  with  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Assembly.  That   is   the

constitutional form. But nobody in their senses contends that it is  the  Negara

who  makes the laws of Singapore, it is this Assembly that makes laws  and  when

Bills  have had their Third Reading, it goes up to the Negara, and on the advice

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



appropriate Minister, he assents to them when they become law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do suggest, with great respect to the Member for Anson, that the words in

the  preamble  to  our  Ordinances are necessitated by section  47  of  the  Constitution

to comply with the constitutional provisions of the Order in  Council.

So  when the Member for Anson quotes them as something substantiating his  point

of  view,  I  find myself unable to accept it, because I think that is  not  the

correct constitutional position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the other aspects raised by Members of the Barisan Sosialis particularly, their political objection to this clause They say, firstly, that the

Government might spring the merger issue on them unexpectedly. Mr Speaker. Sir,

we  have  debated merger and everything connected with merger ad nausea,  and  I

tell my friends in the Barisan Sosialis that the people in Singapore are fed up

to  the teeth with reading about merger, hearing about merger. They are sick  to

death  of  it. And if the Barisan think by consuming the Assembly time  for  the

last four hours, they are going to get more reading space in the papers and more

radio time, I tell them this - that when the people see the- papers reporting  any

thing  connected with the merger they turn quickly to something  else.  That  is

what  is  happening today in Singapore, because we are making much too  much  of

this.  It  is a national issue, of course, hut tiresome repetition. Mr Speaker.

Sir, does not make the issue any more important.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Barisan make is that the merger issue might be forced on

the public without the Assembly being made aware of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was the Member for Anson who moved a motion to the effect that a

referendum  on the merger should be held, and with an amendment the  motion  was

accepted.  Sir,  the two points which have been made, that the issue  of  merger

might be put without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>





debate in the House, cannot be sustained. That a referendum might not be held on

the  merger  cannot  be sustained, because these two issues  have  already  been

discussed  in the Assembly and settled. I think debate which we have had  should

not have been on clause  5 of this Bill, but it should have been on clause 13. I think  all  the

arguments  advanced become quite relevant and quite pertinent  and  sensible  if

they are advocated in relation to clause 13. But in relation to clause 5, I  say

they do not make sense.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Member

for  Farrer Park obviously hopes to become a Minister of the P.A.P., because  he

is  speaking for the P.A.P. and riot speaking for anybody else. It is not a case of  our  trying  to get more radio time. The mere fact that the  Assembly  sits

until  12  o'clock every night shows the intentions behind the P.A.P. Government

move. They cannot possibly cut out publicity on the debate, but they want also to limit the possibility of our

debate material getting in  time for the newspapers the next day. And you  know,

Sir, it is a very important issue. Everybody has eyes on the Referendum Bill and

it  is  going to be a test as to whether or not we in Singapore will be given  a

chance to say No in a peaceful and constitutional manner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. The point raised by the Member - how to say no in a referendum - what has that got to do with clause 5?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have indicated that that objection is well sustained. It is

not  relevant.  The issue has been properly posed by several speakers.  Let  us

confine  ourselves to the issue and then reserve remarks of that nature when  we

come to the next amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, arguments have been put forward by the

Government, as well as by the S.P.A. for the Government, that there  is  already

enough discussion on the matter; yet all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>

along  the  Government had been trying to maintain that this  is  a  general  Re

ferendum  Bill, until we pinned them down in Select Committee on the third  day,

and they had to admit that this Bill would be on the merger issue. Everytime we

pin them down on arguments, everytime they are cornered, everytime they have no

arguments to put forward, they say this is a general Referendum Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are trying to get across to the Government is this: do you agree to the

principle that the matter or issue should first be debated in the Assembly?  Let

me quote to you, Sir, the Minister for Finance in column 87* - he has been blaming

me for belabouring the point. He said,". . . we will concede to him straightaway

. . .  that  there should be free, full and frank discussion of any  issue  of

national  importance". And then further on he said, "the subject of a referendum

which we are going to hold very soon" - implying merger. There was already free, full and frank discussion.  Again,

in  column 88, the second paragraph, which has already been quoted by the Member

for Anson.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Official Report of Select Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 3

dated 8th May, 1962.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance again explained, "Now, no government in Its senses is going to have a referendum on a matter which is not of national importance. Any matter of national importance must be debated in the Assembly, it is the natural course of events." Let us see what he said about this. In columns 91 and 92 the

Member  for Anson asked, after all his arguments had been put forward,  and  the

Government  had  admitted the legality and the strength of  our  arguments,  he

could  not  understand why - that is in column 92, Sir, - in accepting the principle

the Government nevertheless rejected the amendment. They had already agreed  to

the principle, Sir,If the wording is not correct, let them amend the wording to

make it correct. But male sure that the principle that there should be full  discussion  in the Assembly be accepted, in column 103 at the bottom, Sir, the  Min

ister for Finance said, "If the accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



practice by any government is to give the Opposition full opportunity to  debate

in  the Assembly, then it is quite unnecessary to embody it in any law." And  he

further  added,  "I do not see any necessity at all. You might  as  well  embody

those very obvious practices which are carried out by all Governments." In other

words, he admits the principle, hut he simply does not want to write it down  in

the law. You can understand the meaning of what he is saying.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You admit it is necessary. You admit the principle of it, yet you do not want

it in the law. Why? Simply because the whole intention, as I have said, Sir, was

to  have a snap referendum. The P.A.P. wanted to got it done quickly without any

discussion in the Assembly on that particular question.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we possibly have exhausted all points unless the

Minister  for Finance wishes to extend the debate for another half an hour.  Dr

Goh.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if it is the purpose of this amendment to ensure that

full  debate takes place on any question to be posed in the referendum,  then  I

must  say  that they have tried to achieve their objective in a most  inept  and

clumsy  way. If it is their real purpose to ensure that any question put to  the

referendum should be debated first in the Assembly, this is not the  way  to  do

it. Because by asking that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the Head of State, should

act  on  the  advice  of  the Assembly, either directly on  the  advice  of  the

Assembly,  or  as the Assembly rules through a Minister, is wrong in  principle.

The Member for Farrer Park has given a most lucid, and, to me, a most convincing

account that it cannot be done in that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has given the constitutional position. May I give

an  account  of  the  political reasons behind this amendment?  Sir,  you  will

remember  that  the  debate  on merger, which was  to  be  the  subject  of  the

referendum, took place in November.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



In  fact  the  first proposal that the Government would hold  a  referendum  on

merger  occurred  in September, I think, when the Member for  Queenstown  and  I

discussed  this  matter over a radio forum. At that time the  Barisan  Sosialis.

somehow  or  other, came to the conclusion that we were going  to  have  a  snap

referendum on merger. What led them to this conclusion I do not know,  but  from

September  onwards  they turned all their guns on merger,  all  their  publicity

weapons  were  deployed to the limit. And after sometime when they  kept  on  re

peating  themselves, people found their arguments a shade not  only  ridiculous.

but  tiresome.  They  shot all their bolts by, I would say,  January,  February.

thereabouts,  and there was no merger. So the purpose of this is  to  make  sure

that  on  the  timing of the referendum precise date they would not miscalculate

again.  Sir, why should we give them this particular advantage? Is the P.A.P. a

philanthropic  organisation? Is it our purpose to assist the Barisan  Sosialis?

It is not our slightest intention to do that. Let us be quite frank about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to come back to the amendment itself. If that is what the Barisan Opposition really wants, that is, that the subject must be debated in the Assembly,

they have done it in a clumsy and constitutionally wrong way by this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, when the P.A.P. is about to be drowned, the S.P.A. has throw-n

down a life buoy in order to save

it. Mr Speaker, Sir, from the Government Ministers and the S.P.A. speakers, we

can see that the Government is not prepared to accept this amendment. What will

be  the  result of this? The result will he that the Assembly will not have  any

chance to speak on any question relating to a national referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member please reserve those remarks when we come to

that particular issue as to whether or not the question should be framed by the

Legislative Assembly? There is an amendment under clause 13. We are now on quite

a different issue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I only wish to point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>

out  to you that the Assembly will not have the power or the right to debate  on

clause 5. But the Assembly will have to shoulder the undemocratic provisions  as

embodied in clause 29.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> How can clause 29 now come into clause 5? Clause 29 is something

quite  different. Let us not get away from the issues. Let us have  a  sense  of

values.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, my standpoint is very simple. That is to say, the  Assembly

should  first  come to a decision on the National Referendum Bill and  then  the

Minister can advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to order the holding of a  nation

al  referendum. In other words, we should be given the chance and adequate  time

to  debate the question. But from the speeches made by the Government  side,  it

would  appear that this Assembly will have no right to request a debate  on  any

question  that will be put - any matter that will be put in a national referendum.

But  according to clause 29 of the Bill, we will have to shoulder  all  the  con

sequences.  Therefore, I say the Government, when talking about democracy,  does

not know how to carry it out.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have exhausted all the arguments.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> May I say a few

words  consequent on what the Minister for Finance has just said? What  he  has

sad  merely  confirms that they had the intention to have  a  snap  national  referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He cannot get away with that. It is the prerogative of the

Government to decide when to hold a referendum, when to hold a general election.

It  is  not  the  prerogative of the Barisan opposition. That is true  in  every

country.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment falls.

The next amendment which stands in the names of the Member for Anson, the Member

for  Queenstown, and the Member for Hong Lim, seeks to add a sub-clause  (3)  to

clause 5, which reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Not more than one question shall be submitted to the electors in any one

referendum and such question shall contain only one issue and the electors shall

only  be  required  to  answer  such  question  in  the  simple  affirmative  or

negative.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this amendment, of course, would open up a debate on the broad is-sue as

to  whether there should, in fact, be one question demanding an answer "yes"  or

"no".  And  that seems to me to be raised in the amendment to clause 18  by  the

Member for Queenstown. It seeks to add:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Every ballot paper shal1 be in the Form in the First Schedule to this

Ordinance.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes in the First Schedule which indicates that his desire is that there

should be one question with an answer "yes" or "no".





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the first part of the amendment which urges that there should be only

one question - that is to be raised also in the amendment proposed in clause 13.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment to clause 13 of the Member for An-son and the Member for

Queenstown  seeks in page A3, line 41, to leave out "questions" and insert  "one

question as framed by the Legislative Assembly". That introduces the issue as to

whether  that  question should be framed' by the Legislative  Assembly.  On  the

issue as to whether there should be a plain yes or no, this appears to be raised

in  the  amendment by the Member for Anson in clause 20, where he seeks, whether

there  should be one question or more than one question, that there should still

be the request to the electors to say "yes" or "no".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me to be convenient that the debate on this second amendment

should range over all those amendments I have mentioned, so that there will  be

no  repetition  and time will certainly be saved. And when we reach  the  other

amendments which I have mentioned and arguments have already been exhausted  in

respect of any of them, then, of course, the Member who desires to take  a  vote

on  his amendment could propose the amendment for; a vote be taken. I trust that

would  be acceptable, as I think it would save the time of this Assembly  if  we

can take  all  these issues together. Whether there should  be  one  question,

whether  that question should be framed by the Legislative Assembly, and whether

the question should demand an answer "yes" or "no". The principle "yes" or "no"

should also apply if, in fact, there is more than one question.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, there are, in fact, three issues, as you have pointed out

in  our amendments. I appreciate it is necessary that we should range over these

issues which are in part covered by others, but the others, for example, require

framing by the Legislative Assembly of the one question and others still require

a particular form of ballot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>

paper.  I would ask, Sir, in allowing us to range over these others, you  would

nevertheless  grant us some indulgence when it comes to the specific  amendment,

however brief it may be, to pinpoint those particular issues, Sir, and have them

clarified  instead of leaving a thing inchoate with a great deal of argument  on

all issues.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not indicated that. I have indicated that when we reach

the  other amendments which are mentioned, if it appears that the arguments have

already  been exhausted in respect of them, then it is up to the Member to  move

simpliciter if he so desires. But if the arguments have not been exhausted, and,

as the Member for Anson suggests, and if Members wish to summarise the arguments

in respect of those amendments, then I cannot stop them.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2, line 23, at end, to add-'(3) Not more than one question shall be

submitted to the electors in any one referendum and such question shall  contain

only  one  issue and the electors shall only be required to answer such question

in the simple affirmative or negative.'.



<br><br>As you have pointed out, Mr Chairman, there are, in fact, three matters in that

one single amendment. The first is not more than one question shall be submitted

in a referendum. The second is that each question should contain only one issue,

and it should not be double-headed. The third is that the people should have the

right  to say yes or no. Mr Chairman, this amendment arises out of the  unhappy

history  of  this Bill. Later I would crave your indulgence to refer to  certain

aspects of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 16th of March, 1962, on the Second Reading of this Bill, at page 29 of

the  revised  transcript [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 3; col. 280], the Prime  Minister

said,  "This  Referendum Bill has been brought in to determine the wish  of  the

majority of the people on the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification of

the two territories."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we next heard the Deputy Prime Minister, on the 17th of April.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



on  my motion for a referendum on the merger issue, at page 8 [Hansard Vol.  17,

No. 8, col. 774]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, as I have already explained, the Minister for Home Affairs last year,

during  the debate on merger, introduced the Singapore National Referendum  Bill

with  one prospect, and that was to enable the people of Singapore in their  own

interest  to  go to a referendum to state specifically how the reunification  of

Singapore and the Federation should be brought about.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, from those statements that this is a specific Referendum

Bill for the issue of merger. And then to make it quite certain an amendment was

moved  by  the  Deputy Prime Minister to my motion, and this was  the  operative

part:  "this  House  welcomes  the Government's introduction  of  the  Singapore

National  Referendum Bill in order to hold a referendum to ascertain the  wishes

of  the  people  on  the  mode  and manner of the  inevitable  reunification  of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya before arrangements are finalised . . .".  Mr  Chairman, there are, in the plainest possible terms, the Prime Minister

and the Deputy Prime Minister telling us that this is a specific Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in seeking to have the question formulated by the Assembly, the Minister

for Health and Law's reply at column 110 [Official Report of Select Committee on

Singapore  National Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]-midway-said,  "My

point  here,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is that this is a general referendum  Bill.  If

there  was before the Committee a Bill dealing with a specific referendum issue,

there is nothing to prevent the Legislative Assembly from deciding the questions

to  be put to a referendum. But in this case, this is a general Referendum  Bill

and  certain executive acts are to be done by the Head of State." At column 118,

the same Minister, Sir, said this in a general referendum Bill:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There might be various matters. One is the matter of smoking - whether the

public  should be allowed to smoke. The Member for Anson does not like  smoking.

One  day  we  might  hold a referendum on this. That is one  matter.  Merger  is

another matter. These matters involve all sorts of questions. For instance,  the

Member for Anson does not like smoking but he might



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>

agree  that  people should be allowed to continue pipe-smoking. A referendum  on

smoking  could  raise the following questions: Should smoking be prohibited,  or

should pipe-smoking or cigar-smoking be allowed?'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure you, Mr Chairman, I am not going to read all of them, but I do want

to  show  you  how important it is now to pin this down to show you  that  quite

shamelessly  and  blatantly in this Assembly they say one thing  and  in  Select

Committee they say another. There is no question of the blush of shame. There is

a  purely  an  interest in the power dynamics of the situation  which  does  not

include, Sir, respect for logic or for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I might refer to column 138, the same Minister:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Member for Anson has moved an amendment that there shall be only one ques

tion  on one issue. Mr Chairman, I have pointed out repeatedly that this  is  a

general Referendum Bill and there is a procedure in the Bill for the putting  of

questions. . . . Take the case of toddy shops. Questions could be:

"Should  toddy  shops be closed? Or should the sale of toddy to toddy  shops  be

prohibited?" There was the example of the Malay language: "When should Malay  be

the official language?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on at column 140 to give you a few more questions that could be

asked. Mr Chairman, we are in a quandary now. We are told by the Prime Minister

and  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister, by a solemn motion  passed  by  a  Government

majority  in this House, the motion saying that the purpose of the Bill  was  to

hold  a  referendum  on merger, and we have had the Minister for  Finance  whose

interest  in finance went to the somewhat colloquial expression of, 'Let's  come

down to brass tacks. This Bill is for a referendum on merger." If you would like

a  reference,  Sir,  it is on the 11th May, at column 181  [Official  Report  of

Select Committee No. 4]. We have had a gentleman, the Parliamentary Secretary to

the  Minister for Home Affairs, who on the 16th March in the revised  transcript

at page 24 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Anson is beating about the bush.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Ramming falsehoods down the throats of those who utter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



them is painful, I know; I can understand it. Now, Sir, if you look at  the

revised  transcript of 16th of March at page 24 [Hansard  Vol.  17  No.  3,

col. 273]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan

Chee  Seng)  ha  Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we  are  debating  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill. This ought to be a simple and  meaningful

Bill.  Its  purpose is to reunite Singapore with  the  Federation  of Malaya.'



<br><br>Now, Mr Speaker, in every instance - and  I shall be producing books; I am not talking off the cuff - where there

have  been specific Bills before ad hoc for specific issues for the purpose

of  referring them to the people the issue has been specified in the  Bill;

questions  have  been  specified;  and you  will  find  that  there  is  no

ambiguity. Here the right hand and the left had of the

P.A.P. not  only  do  not  agree, Sir, but  the  right  hand  sometimes

disagrees with itself, as does the left hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a vast number of references which I do not intend to deal with at

this  juncture; if provoked, I will. The purpose was to show you - and perhaps

I  might  as  well  start with it now, Sir,If we are to believe  the  Prime

Minister,  the  Deputy Prime Minister, the Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Health, and the Minister for Finance who,  of  course,  later

changed  his mind on the 11th of May, then this is a specific Bill to  deal

with the issue of merger.

Why  then are the questions not there? Should the questions be there,  Sir?

Let  us ascertain. I would ask you to look at the Jamaican Ordinance,  Sir - I

understand  you have a copy; and I have a photostat copy here, Sir - Ordinance

53  of  1960. "A law to provide for ascertainment by means of referendum  of

the opinion of the people of Jamaica

with  respect to the continued participation of Jamaica in the Federation of the

West  Indies." Sir, it provides, inter alia, that the date of the referendum

should  not be less than six weeks after the proclamation. It also  provides

the question:

"Should  Jamaica remain in the Federation of the West Indies?" And the  electors  are  required  to  answer  "yes" or "no".  By  the  way,  Sir,  it  is

interesting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



to  notice  that  subsection (3) says that a majority of the people  voting  is

required.  That  is  one.  They, on the other side, are  very  fond  of  liquor

licensing,  Sir. Let us take British Columbia. I do not know if you have  this;

if  you have not, I will table it. "British Columbia, Chapter 221, 1960, Liquor

Control Plebiscites Act."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Lieutenant Governor-in-Council may from time to time submit to a vote of

the electors the following question on a ballot in the following form.'.



<br><br>and,  Sir (if I might show you, and I will table it), the question is there  on

the ballot paper:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do you approve of the sale of beer by the glass in licensed premises without

a bar under Government control and regulation?'.



<br><br>7.59 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>Then  there  is  "Yes" with a square against it; there is  "No"  with  a  square

against that. And it says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(If you approve, mark an "X" in the square opposite the word "Yes". If you do

not approve, mark an "X" in the square opposite the word "No".)'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I might refer you to the Newfoundland Referendum Act of which they are so

proud.  It is the Act of 1948, No. 9 of 1948. There also it was a specific  one.

The  questions were formulated by the National Convention and there, where there

were three questions, they made specific arrangements as to how majority was  to

be worked out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there was in 1932, as you know, a referendum in West Australia. I

am  indebted to the Clerk of the Assembly for the Communication of the  17th  of

May  where  Members  will find this referred to, and if I  might  read  it,  Mr

Chairman,  this  is from the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly  of  Western  Aus

tralia about referendum procedure in Western Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1932, there was great agitation within the State regarding seceding from

the  Commonwealth.  The  Parliament in that year passed  an  Act  authorising  a

referendum  to he held on the question [and you will notice again  the  question

was  formulated  by  Parliament] "Are you in favour  of  the  State  of  Western

Australia withdrawing from the Federal Commonwealth established under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (Imperial)?"'

<br><br>And  bless  the Clerk of Western Australia, he even told us that the  voter  was

required to vote "Yes" or "No".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one, Mr Chairman, as you are probably aware, is that in New Zealand

there  are no general referendum provisions. But provisions do exist that  are

ad  hoc,  and  in  each piece of legislation with reference to a  referendum  in

respect of a specific issue the questions are framed by Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada there was the Dominion Plebiscite Act. This is to be found in an

annexe - annexe  2 - which we received from the Clerk of the  House.  It  was  a

memorandum  prepared by Dr Morose Olivier, Parliamentary Council of Canada.  It

tells us that in 1942 there was a Dominion Plebiscite Act wherein was formulated the following question for the decision of the people of Canada:

Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligation arising out of

any  past  commitments  restricting the methods  of  raising  men  for  military

service?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annexe 1, which is supplied by the Clerk of the Assembly, being a document

prepared  by  Mr  C.  D.  Combe  of the House of Assembly  of  Adelaide,  South

Australia,  will  inform us that there is no general law in South  Australia  to provide  for the taking of referenda. In the past, referenda had been  held  in

pursuance  of ad hoc legislation. I do ask, Mr Chairman, that it be appreciated

that  ad  hoc legislation means that in each instance the legislation directs  a

specific question for a specific issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now come to the general referendum laws. Let us take Australia,

which is close to us and a Dominion of the Commonwealth. I refer you to Volume

4  of  the  Commonwealth Acts of Australia. At page 3565  is  to  be  found  the

Referendum  Constitution  Alteration Act  1905-1936.  Now,  Section  5  of  that

Ordinance  says  that  whenever "a proposed law for the alteration  of  the  Con

stitution is to be submitted to the electors, the Governor-General may  issue  a

writ for the submission of the proposed law. There is an authority to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



the Governor-General "On the role of Parliament" that the Member for Farrer Park

is  perhaps looking for. But we will pass that. That matter is now finished. But

I want him to notice that in each case the law is first passed by Parliament and

then  put  by the Governor-General. Now, what is the form in which he  puts  it?

Sir, the form is to be found in Section 14 (A) (1) . Here it says that the ballot

papers  to be used for the purposes of the referendum may be in accordance  with

Form  C in the Schedule. The Schedule is to be found in page 3585. Mr Chairman,

if I might draw your attention to

it.  I  would be happy to table it. The question is: "Do you approve of the  pro

posed law for the alteration of the Constitution intituled? [Here is set out the

title of the proposed law.]" There is a square for 'Yes' and a square for 'No'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in fairness, Mr Chairman, I would not like to omit mentioning that there

is  also Section 14 (A) (3) , which says that if two or more referenda are  held

on the same day, it shall not be necessary for the forms of the ballot paper for

each  referendum to be on a separate piece of paper, but two or  more  forms  of

ballot  paper which may be used by any one elector may be on one piece of  paper  in accordance with Form D in the Schedule. Form D, Mr Chairman, is on  the

same  page 3585. There it has: "(1) Do you approve of the proposed law  for  the

alteration  of  the Constitution intituled [here is set out the title]"  with  a

square  for  'Yes'  and  a square for 'No'. Then, "(2) Do  you  approve  of  the

proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution intituled, [here is set  out

the title]" with another square for 'Yes' and a square for 'No'. You will notice

that  the  questions  proposed are carefully put because  the  Legislatures  are

conscious  of the capacity not merely of a Machiavellian mentality but  even  of

normal  crooks to phrase questions which are so dishonest that no  honest  reply

can be adduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have not finished. I would now refer you to Switzerland, which is per

haps  the  home of the finest form of democracy barring one matter  the  curious

blind side that - whatever our views are as regards that particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



aspect - it  should not blind us to the fact that they -have achieved the  highest

form of expression of the democratic process in any country in the world. Let me

refer  first to the blind side, and that is they will not allow women  to  vote.

They say that we vote so often, we have to vote probably every other Sunday;  if

women  vote  nobody is going to cook the Sunday joint. But that is neither  here

nor  there.  I  ask  you  to  note this Article 120 of the  Swiss  Constitution.

"Article  120 - when one section of the Federal Assembly passes  a  resolution,

that  there be a total revision of the constitution, and the other section  does

not  assent  to it; or when 50,000 Swiss citizens entitled to vote demand  total

revision,  then the question of whether there should be such revision shall,  in

the  one case as in the other, be submitted to a vote of the Swiss people by aye

or  no." You have a law which introduces the regulations under that Article  120

and it is known as the Law of 1892. In Article 11 of that law, where the Federal

Assembly  formulates the separate proposal distinct from the proposal formulated

by  popular  initiative  the following two questions  should  be  submitted  for

voting:  "Do  you accept the popular initiative proposal, or do you  accept  the

proposal formulated by the Federal Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here, thanks to the Swiss Representative in Singapore, the actual form of ballot paper in Switzerland, and I shall submit it to you. This one says: "Do you accept the initiative concerning the protection

of the consumers, or do you accept the counter proposal of the Federal Assembly?

Reply 'Yes' or 'No'. Those who reply 'Yes' to the two questions will be void."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, having traced what others do, let us come back to the main purposes of my amendment. I ask that there should be not more than one question. Let us step there for a moment, Mr Chairman. Why did I say that? Because we have been assured, Mr Chairman, however much we have reason to doubt assurances

given by this Government: nevertheless I read to you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



the  formal  assurances of the Prime Minister, the Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the

Minister for Home Affairs, and the Minister for Finance that this Bill is a Bill

for  a  referendum  in  respect of the proposed closer  relationship  with  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how many questions have been debated, connected with those proposals?

Two. Which are they? The first one is the White Paper proposals in Command 33 of

1961 which were passed by the Assembly by a majority of 33, with 18 walking out,

if you will remember.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can you remember the other question? There have been so many millions of

words  by the P.A.P. Government and their machines to confuse the issue  that  I

would  not  be  surprised if most people in Singapore have forgotten  the  other

question,  and I ask your indulgence to refer to it. I have in mind,  Mr  Chair

man,  the Hansard of the 21st of November, 1961. I would be grateful if I  could

have that for a moment. Can I borrow it, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the Hansard was handed over to Mr Marshall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are, Sir. At column 406. You remember, the Minister for Labour moved

what was called the merger motion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That, whereas it has always been the avowed objective of all nationalists of

Malaya  to achiievc the reunification of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya

and to remove the artificial division created by the British by their policy  of

"divide  and rule", this House affirms and declares that the first objective  of

all  true  patriots  of  Malaya is to achieve the  reunification  of  these  two

territories in a merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'



<br><br>The  Member  for  Qucenstown then moved to delete the  words  "in  a  merger  of

Singapore with the Federation of Melaya" and to substitute "in a genuine  merger

of  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of Malaya,  with  Singapore  entering  the

Federation as the twelfth state and with all its Citizens automatically becoming

Federal  Citizens on Merger Day'. So, that was the second aspect of merger  that

was debated - the White Paper and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



the Opposition view which was expressed in this amendment, "a genuine merger  of

Singapore  with the federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation

as  the  twelfth state and with all its Citizens automatically becoming  Federal

Citizens on Merger Day".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember, Mr Chairman, when brickbats start flying about asking for

pie  in  the sky, that these terms are terms that were offered by the Federation

to the State of Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak. That was our stand and after, as you

remember, the marathon debate, the Government with its allies on the Front bench

of the Opposition defeated that amendment. Therefore, the question of "a genuine

merger  of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering  the

Federation as the twelfth state and with all its Citizens automatically becoming

Federal Citizens on Merger Day" was rejected by this Assembly in the name of the

people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the position then is that there is but one question and one question which has been approved by this Assembly, and that question is whether the Assembly approves Command Paper 33 of 1961 which the P.A.P. call merger. If I might for a moment, Mr Chairman, entertain you with another bed-time story of

the  way  the P.A.P. work. I have discovered where they get their technique.  It

seems  a long, long time ago, Mr Chairman, there was an emperor of China called

Ch'n  Shih Wang. Some 2,200 years ago, do not take me in respect of the accuracy

of  the  date. He was a great emperor, Mr Chairman. He built the Great Wall  of

China.  He unified all the provinces of China and he left a peaceful, great  and

prosperous country to his son. His son being young and inexperienced  trusted  a

friend  of  his whom he made Prime Minister. He trusted his Prime Minister  like

the  people  of  Singapore trusted the gentleman who leads the Government  front

bench.  He  trusted  him.  They trusted him. These are  the  trusted  people  of

Singapore and this Prime Minister slowly worked himself into position until  one

day he felt strong enough to challenge the power of the emperor and so he got  a

deer  from  the  forest and brought it into the imperial palace and  before  the

imperial's presence, he said "Sire, is not that a beautiful horse?"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



The  king said. "Do not be a fool. That is not a horse. That is a deer." And the

Prime  Minister said, "Sire, ask your courtiers." It is like the P.A.P. saying.

"Ask  the Assembly. Is this not merger?" And the courtiers, who knew well  where

their  bread  was  buttered and who it was that put them in their  offices,  all

said,  "Sire,  that is a beautiful horse." Let us go back. We in  this  Assembly

have said that these proposals are merger proposals. Mr Chairman, the point is:

why  one  question?  One question because that is the only  question  which  the

Assembly  has approved. That question - that Command Paper 33 of 1951 is good  for

Singapore;  and  it  is right and proper that that question  should  go  to  the

people,  though,  as  the Member for Farrer Park has informed  you,  we  in  the

Workers'  Party  are  genuinely in doubt as to the  long  term  value  of  these

provisions  and, in fact, hear that in the long view they would be adverse  both

to  the  Federation and to ourselves. Nevertheless, we would struggle as we  are

struggling today for the right of those who want those "merger proposals" as the

PAP, calls them, "P.A.P. proposals" if we may, for simplicity. I would fight for

their  right to say "yes" to those proposals though I think that they are wrong.

And,  I  say. Sir, surely elementary decency requires that those who  themselves

would like to say "yes" should recognize the riqht of those who disagree to  say

"no".  You remember Voltaire's famous dictum "I do not agree with what  you  say

but I will fight to the death for your right to say it."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Chairman, shou1d there be another question posed? We of the Workers'

Party are not fooled by the Government's alleged generous democratic inspiration

and  motivation  in wanting to put the Opposition point of view.  If  they  have

said,  "We want to put your point of view as enunciated in the amendment to  the

motion which you formerly moved," then we would say, "Yes, put it as a question

if  you  like, but the people should be entitled to say "'We do not  want  this

either.'" You should not force the people, however"' well-meaning you  are,  any

more than to force a daughter you love to marry either A or B. That is not the

choice at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



all  because the one may be totally unacceptable as in this case and  the  other

may  be  a question for very grave misgivings. But it is not an honest approach.

as indicated, that they intend to put forward. It is not the Opposition point of

view as enunciated in column 406 of Hansard of the 21st of November, 1961, where

we  asked for a genuine and complete merger with Singapore entering as the  12th

State  and  with automatic conversion of citizenship. That is not what  hey  are

going  to put. They say that the Opposition want a Penang and Malacca type.  You

know  it  is  a  curious  thing; I have in the past heard about  this  Goebbels'

technique. I was old enough to read about it when Goebbels was alive.  He  said,

'If a lie is big enough, repeated often enough and loud enough, some people will

believe  it.'  But  I  can see it working. I can see it working  amongst  honest

people  and there are honest people who believe that Opposition Members  want  a

form  of  merger  whereby  a  major part of our people  are  deprived  of  their

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the radio forum the Prime Minister agreed that, in fact, that was not correct. On the 11th of June, Mr Jek, another P.A.P. gentleman, earning a

lucrative income by his political activities, said over Radio P.A.P. that it  is

the Communists who want a Penang and Malacca type of merger. Well, Mr Chairman,

if  it is the Communists who want a Penang and Malacca type, what have we to  do

with  this?  Are  we  running Singapore for the Communists?  Are  we  holding  a

referendum  for  the  Communists,  or are we  going  to  hold  a  referendum  in

conformity  with the recognised principle of decency and, that is,  to  put  the

issue  clearly to the people whereby they can have an opportunity to  accept  or

reject it as was alleged by the Prime Minister. Now, Mr Chairman, you say to me

that  if the people do not want this Penang/Malacca type as you say why  is  the

Government offering this as an alternative? Yes, Mr Chairman, why? On the  face

of it, it seems rather absurd, but if you know them, as I know them, if you have

followed  their twisted and tortured reasonings you will realise that they  have

come to the position now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



where they are conscious of the possibility that a straightforward referendum on

the  issue - Do you accept White Paper, Command Paper 33 or not, may well bring  a

majority of our citizens against

it.   Some  of  the  majority would be entitled to believe  that  if  this  were

rejected,  the Federation must, in its own good sense, recognise that they  have

got  to offer us better terms and offer them quickly. But in the meanwhile  what

happens  to  the P.A.P., Mr Chairman? What happens to the Prime Minister?  What

happens  to  the Front Bench? If there is a defeat for the referendum  where  do

they go? That is the end of them.

ferendum would be lost, then it would he criminal folly to hold a referendum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5-(contd.)



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on the second amendment to clause 5. Mr Marshall.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment of the adjournment, I was draw

ing your attention to the P.A.P. concept of democracy as enunciated by the Prime

Minister. It is perhaps best to quote him in his own words. I refer you, Sir, to

the revised transcript of Hansard, 16th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



March, 1962, page 32, first paragraph [Vol. 17 No. 3, col. 285]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, if there was the slightest risk of merger being frustrated and the

country plunged into disaster by the activities of the Communists manipulating a

referendum,  let  me  say that it would be criminal folly on  the  part  of  the

Government  to hold a referendum and allow the future of Malaya and Malaysia  to

be  imperilled. If that were the position, if the risk existed, then, regardless

of  what benefit the Member for Hong Lim or the Member for Anson may reap by the

Government  having  to  carry the odium of living down the  Communist  smear  of

trying to sell out a Chinese Singapore to a Malay Federation, it would still  be

the  duty  of  the  Government to go through with it to ensure that  the  peace,

security and happiness of the people, not just of Singapore but of Malaya and of

Malaysia, are not jeopardised.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, those with knowledge of the P.A.P. dictionary will tell you

that  that means that if there was the slightest danger of this Government being

overthrown, then that is the point at which democracy must end. It is  all  very

well to have democracy, but not a democracy where the P.A.P. are not the persons

in  power.  How, Sir, is the Prime Minister to achieve this business  about  "no

risk  that  the referendum should be lost"? After all, there can be no question,

but  there  are  many people who are genuinely convinced that  the  White  Paper

proposals  are inimical to our long-term future, just as there are many  people,

Sir,  who are honestly convinced that they are valuable for our future. How  are

we  to  prevent  the risk from eventuating, that those against the  White  Paper

proposals  would be more than those in favour? Quite simple, Sir - by  not  giving

them the chance to vote against the White Paper proposals. But how do you put  a

referendum  without  giving the people a chance to vote against  the  proposals?

Again,  Sir, you do that by not having the one question which was agreed  to  by

this  House,  but by having another question which was never debated,  something

that  nobody  wants-the Penang and Malacca type of merger which  the  Government

interprets  as  being  one  that  provides  for  341,000  people  losing   their

citizenship.  You put that question. Then what does it matter if there  are  two

questions  and  both are unpalatable, so long as one can answer  "No"  to  both?

Again,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>

Sir,  that is the question. They will not allow the people to say "no" to  both.

They  will not allow the people to say "yes" or "no". No - you strike out the  one

you  do  not  want.  Now,  that is fair enough to  those  who  want  the  P.A.P.

proposals.  But what about those who do not want it and who do not want  either,

as  nobody wants these curious proposals which they propound such as the  Penang

and  Malacca type of merger with 341,000 citizens losing their citizenship? "Oh,

well, they'll have to lump it."



<br><br>9.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a curious petition, Sir, which I have received today from 39 cultural

associations and which refers to Hobson's choice. I shall come to that in a  few

minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here then, we are posed with this question: that the people have got to strike

out  one  or the other. We in the Workers' Party recognising the unhappy dilemma

where   decent  citizens  cannot  accept  in  good  conscience  either   P.A.P.

proposals - and  nobody  wants the Penang and Malacca type with  341,000  citizens

losing their citizenship - and not being able to choose from either, and not being

able to strike out either but wanting to deface their ballot paper, we moved  an

amendment  that  that  should  be permissible.  This  was  seized  upon  by  the

Government, and now even a blank vote is no longer permissible, because  if  you

strike  out both or if you put a blank vote, that shall be deemed to be  a  vote

for  the  P.A.P. proposals. But that is the second instalment  of  this  tragic

story, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, what I want to draw your attention to is that in the amendment that I

seek, I bring in the experience we have of the context, and that is, the context

of  this  Bill  being allegedly a specific Bill for a referendum on  a  specific

issue - , the  merger issue -  in respect of a specific position  that  there  were

specific proposals called White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 which was passed. That is

the  only  question that can legitimately be put. And the only way to  obtain  a

decision is to give the people a choice to say "yes" or "no" to the question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a radio forum on 12th June, the Minister for Finance used some curious





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



English.  I do not suppose you have a transcript, Sir, but I can make  it  available - it is an official one. He said on page 5:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh says you must have a question with "yes" or "no" answer.

The answer is that this is a most utterly ridiculous proposition.'



<br><br>A  ridiculous  proposition. Mr Chairman, I think we  have  shown  earlier  this evening  that  in  some 12 democratic countries, including France,  Switzerland,

Australia,  Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, Jamaica, British  Columbia,  West

Australia, every  one of their specific referenda required an answer - "yes"  or

"no". Why do the Government resist so strenuously the right to the people to say

"yes" or "no"? Let us grant them two questions that they insist on. Let us grant

them  a  million  questions that they insist on to confuse  the  people.  It  is

because if you have the right to say "yes" or "no", Mr Chairman, then no matter

how  filthy the question, no matter how dishonest, disgraceful and indecent  the

alternative, you can say "no" to each of them, and you may thereby  bring  about

the  fall  of  the  P.A.P. Government, which so strenuously  seeks  to  maintain

office,  which  considers that the welfare of the country is  equated  with  the

welfare of its Front Bench.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, on this issue with regard to the two questions. I had earlier sought to show you that the. Opposition Parties had made their stand clear from the 21st of November - and even earlier - that we wanted a genuine and complete merger, with Singapore coming in as the

twelfth  State  and  with our citizens becoming citizens of  the  Federation  on

Merger Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I want to repeat that this is what has been offered by the

Federation to Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have been wondering whether these detailed arguments

are not in fact anticipating the Member for Anson's own motion where he suggests

that  there  should only be one question and that is connected  with  the  White

Paper.  Of  course, there must be some overlapping. But I would suggest  to  the

Member for Anson that a detailed debate on those lines could await the





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>

debate on his motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged for your guidance, Mr Chairman. I hope you

appreciate  that I am seeking to put forward my reasons in the  context  of  the

fact  that this is supposed to be a Bill for a specific issue in accordance with

the  motion already passed, that in that specific issue the Prime Minister  and

his  henchmen  have, to their ill fortune, indicated the nature though  not  the

wording  of  the questions. And the nature of the questions they have  indicated

are  two  questions: Do you want the P.A.P. proposals or do you want Penang  and

Malacca with loss of citizenship? So I have got to show why the one is right and

one alone is right in the context of my motion, and the other one is wrong. Sir.

But I do not wish to weary the House, and if you feel that enough has been said,

Sir, I shall stop at this juncture.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been moved as an amendment in page A2, line 23, at end,

to add -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(3) Not more than one question shall be submitted to the electors in any one

referendurn  and  such question shall contain only one issue  and  the  electors

shall  only  be  required to answer such question in the simple  affirmative  or

negative.'



<br><br>I have indicated that the debate could range over the second amendment to clause

13,  that  is to say, In page A3, line 41, to leave out "questions"  and  insert

"one  question as framed by the Legislative Assembly"; the amendment  to  clause

18.  In page A6, line 23, at end to add "Every ballot paper shall be in the Form

in  the  First Schedule to this Ordinance."; the First Schedule itself, and  the

amendment to clause 20, In page A7, line 2, after "vote", to add 'and the  voter

shall  record his vote in respect of each question by marking a cross in one  of

two squares against each question marked respectively "Yes" and "No"'.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.

there is widespread anxiety in Singapore about the coming referendum. Statements

have  been  issued.  There have been forums on the matter, memoranda  have  been

submitted and meetings of associations and political parties have been called to

discuss this Bill. Mass meetings



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



too  have  been held and everybody in Singapore is wondering what the Government

are  going to do. The Government have already given an indication that they will

pose  two  questions  to the people, and from what we have  learned,  these  two

questions will not be acceptable to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that when this Bill was sent to Select Committee,

views  were  sought from various associations. It was thought  that  if  various

associations, organisations and individuals could submit their views on the Refe

rendum  Bill to this Select Committee, these views might possibly influence  the

Select  Committee  to  change the Government stand on the Referendum  Bill.  But

while we were deliberating in Select Committee, the Prime Minister was in London

on  the 19th of May, telling the people in London that the referendum that would

be  carried out in Singapore would be on the mode and manner of merger. In other

words,  Sir,  even while we were deliberating as to whether we should  have  one

question or two questions, the P.A.P. had already made up their minds. They  had

already decided to pose two unacceptable questions to the people. Otherwise  how

could  the  Prime  Minister have said those words at London  Airport?  In  other

words,  all the memoranda that were submitted to the Select Committee could  not

influence  the P.A.P. Ministers in any way. In fact all the memoranda  submitted

to  the  Select Committee were treated just like wastepaper. It was  a  disgrace

that  the  P.A.P.  Government  should so lightly  treat  public  opinion.  Their

acceptance of Select Committee deliberations was merely an eyewash just to  give

the  impression that the P.A.P. would not mind accepting views from the  people.

But  in  actual fact, when these views were presented to the P.A.P., they  never

accepted  those  views  in spite of the weight of logic and  argument  in  these

memoranda.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is this referendum? The Prime Minister has defined it in various

ways.  He  says that it is a means whereby the views of the people could  be  as

certained.  Examples have been quoted to you, Sir, by the Member for  Anson  and

from the memoranda submitted to the Select Committee for our deliberations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



in  Select  Committee that a referendum is actually a means  whereby  the  Legis

lative Assembly seeks the views of the people on a specific issue, -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mode and manner.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - motion, resolution or Bill or law that has been passed by

the  majority in the Legislative Assembly. Just to prove to you thai the  P.A.P.

themselves have said the same thing, I will quote you the revised transcript  of

the  Official Report dated 15th March, page 12 [Vol. 17, No. 2, col.  180],  Dr

Toh Chin Chye, second paragraph of his speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We ought to clarify in our minds why a referendum is conducted. A referendum

is  conducted by the government of the day in order to settle a certain question

on which it probably feels that by itself it cannot decide.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the Assembly has got to have this referendum in order to make

sure  that  the  views expressed inside this Assembly have the  support  of  the

people  outside the Assembly. In fact, in the talk given by Mr Jek Yuen  Thong,

Political  Secretary to the Prime Minister, over the radio last night,  he  said

the  same  thing, namely that the people's views must be sought as regards  what

had taken place in the Assembly. For example -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. There has been an inaccuracy in the

last quotation. Can I ask the Member for Queenstown to quote chapter and verse?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. That is not really a point of order. The Member should

have risen on a point of elucidation. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, it is in

Chinese, Sir. I have got it here; it is from the Nan yang Slang Pau. I will read

it in Chinese so that the interpreter can give it to you in the translation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): 'It is necessary to know the more correct wishes of the people

on  certain  matters, on the question decided by the Cabinet.  This  is  a  very

important thing.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication here, Sir, that it is something put to the people in order to

make sure that they endorse the views that have been accepted by the Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In the passage read out, there was no reference whatever to

the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a matter of interpretation, Sir. [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I heard the interpretation as the decision of the

Cabinet, not the decision of the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will read a further extract in order to convince the

Minister for Finance. It follows from where I have just stopped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) : 'It seems such things usually have been discussed in the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Assembly. I hope Dr Goh will understand what those words mean.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If I might explain, Sir, it means this. If, for example,

agree with the views of the P.A.P. here. They have 26 Members and therefore they

are  in  the majority. This resolution is put to the people and the people  will

either endorse it or reject

it.  That, of course, you do by posing a simple question to the people, and they

answer  with a simple yes or no. If they answer yes, then the motion is  carried

and it shows that the people have accepted that resolution and

endorse  the  views of the Assembly. If not, then, of course, the people  reject

the  views of the Assembly, although the Assembly means the Government with the

majority. That is why the Chinese translation of this Referendum Bill is not  as

has  been put out by the Government - "Chyuen Min Tou Piau but "Chyuen  Min  Fu

Chyueh". I will -

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member

made the same point earlier today at some other place over the radio. I want  to

"referendum" in Chinese, whether it means what he says. "Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have explained -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Any dictionary to show that that is the meaning?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have no dictionary, Sir. But it is the accepted meaning

not  only in Singapore but almost all over the world, Sir. Precedents have  been

given  to  you by the Member for Anson. And I would like to refer you,  Sir,  to

L.A. 7 of 1962, page B20. This is stressed on this page here and I will read  it

out. They have suggested -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Who is "they"?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> B20.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes. It s the representation from the Rural Residents'

Association, the Country People's Association, the Singapore Hawkers' Union, the

Singapore  Itinerant Hawkers' & Stallholders' Association. They  have  suggested

this translation because the reasons are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The term Chyuen Min Tou Piau is translated from the English, 'Referendum'. It

is  a franchise for direct legislation by the people without their having to  go

through their deputies. Its actual meaning is: The putting to the vote of  Bills

or  Constitutional  Amendments passed by the legislature to  the  citizenry  for

their fresh decision. Therefore, in order that the substantive provisions of the

Bill  may strictly be in keeping with the principle of referendum, and  also  to

enable  the public to understand with facility the real purport of the Bill,  we

are  of the opinion that it is necessary to change the translation of Chyuen  Min

Tou Pian to Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh.'





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order! Order! The Minister for Finance rises on a point of

information. Does the Member give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I heard the Member for Queenstown say that his definition

of  a referendum is accepted all over the world, i.e., to say referendum is  not

"Chyuen  Min  Tou  Piau"  but  "Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh".  Is  he  saying  that  this

memorandum  from  the Hawkers' Union, the Country People's  Association  and  so

forth - this literary exercise is world famous and world renowned?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I do not think I need answer that, Sir. May I quote you

also  column 95 of the Official Report of the Select Committee on the  Singapore

National  Referendum  Bill [No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]? This  has  already  been

touched on by the Member for Anson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>

in his speech, but I might as well repeat

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr David Marshall: Forgive me, Sir. The Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act,

1906-36, section 3:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Referendum means the submission to the electors of a proposed law for the

alteration of the Constitution.'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever a proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution is to be

submitted  to the electors, then the Governor in Council may issue a  writ  for

submission.'.



<br><br>The  proposed  law is one that has already been debated by both  Houses  of  the

Australian Parliament."



<br><br>Sir,  it has been explained why the words "Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh" are very correct

and  why  there should be only one question to be posed to the people. The  only

way  for the electorate to endorse any decision already taken or adopted by  the

Legislative  Assembly is for one question to be posed to them  that  requires  a

simple  answer  of  'yes' or 'no'. The answer comes back clear and  unequivocal,

'yes' or 'no', and there is no doubt of the mind of the voter. Mr Marshall, the

Member  for  Anson,  has  quoted a number of precedents of  referenda  in  other

countries  and he has pointed out that it is a law that has also been passed  in

the  Legislative  Assembly. He has pointed cut, Sir, that the  question  too  is

framed,  as  I have a little while ago also pointed out. He also quoted  Article

120  in  the  Swiss  Constitution which sets out the procedure  where  only  one

question is put to the electorate in the referendum and the answer required is a

simple  'yes'  or  'no',  all clearly showing that the  correct  translation  of

referendum is "Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh". It specifies that if there is going to be a

referendum, then it should be a referendum on a motion or resolution, a Bill  or

law  that has been passed in the Legislative Assembly and that it must be  posed

in one question to the people for their endorsement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Paper Command No. 33 of 1961, has been passed by the Assembly.

Simple  logic therefore tells us that if the P.A.P. are honest, these  proposals

ought to be put to the people of Singapore to see whether or not they approve of

them. They can be asked simply, "Do you approve the P.A.P.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



merger  proposals as embodied in Paper Command No. 33 of 1961?" The question  is

neat  and  simple, and it comes back with an answer "yes" or "no". In this  way,

you can easily find out the views of the people on this important issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have boasted that the merger proposals have the popular support of

the  people and we feel that it is time they put it to the test. After all, the

test of the pudding is in the eating. Let them therefore put these proposals  to

the  people  and  if  the answer comes back with a 'yes', then  the  P.A.P. can

justify  their claim that their merger proposals have the support of the people.

But  if  different questions are asked, and especially if the two questions  are

unacceptable to the electorate, then they will be forced to cast uncertain votes

or blank votes. Because if they cannot accept those two questions posed to them,

then  that  is the only way they can show their disgust and protest against  the

questions  put. Not only is it unfair to the voter but it also goes against  the

stated  objective of the P.A.P. of finding out the views of the  people  on  any

issue.  We  have  twice  debated in radio forums about democratic  practice.  If

unacceptable questions are asked, one must have the right to say 'no'. But, now,

what  has happened is that with the addition of clause 29, the voter is not even

allowed  to say 'no'. He is denied the right to say 'no', because if  he  should

cast  a blank vote, he is deemed to accept the decision o, the Assembly - that  is

the decision of the P.A.P. How are the P.A.P. going to claim that the true views

of  the people will be ascertained? So to avoid all this, the only proper  thing

is: pose one question on one issue to which a simple answer of 'yes' or 'no'  is

required.  Only  then can we ascertain the views of the people on  any  specific

issue.  The Member for Anson has quoted you precedents. I wish to refer  to  the

Conscription Referendum of 1916 in Australia. The people were asked one question

and  they  were  asked to give the answer in a 'yes' or 'no'  form.  On  another

occasion in 1917, they were again



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>

asked  to  indicate their views on conscription. On this occasion, one  question

was  posed  which required only a simple answer of "yes" or "no".  The  question

posed was: "Are you in favour of the proposal of the Commonwealth Government for

reinforcing  the  Australian Forces overseas?" I do not know, Sir, whether  the

precedent which I am quoting has already been quoted, but for the record, may  I

refer  you  to  column 115 of the same Official Report, where Mr  Byrne  talked

about the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act. There it tells you, Sir,  that

it is one question which asks for a yes or a no. It says, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr David Marshall: The words of the 'New Zealand Military Training Poll Act say,

"I vote for/I vote against compulsory military training."'



<br><br>In essence, it just asks for yes or no. And then, may I also refer you to column

232 [Official Report No. 4 dated 11th May, 1962], at the bottom,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Byrne: Yes. Schedule Form of Voting-Paper.'



<br><br>It asks for yes or no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have this Jamaican Referendum Federation Law, which I need not

mention because it was covered in detail by the Member for Anson. And then there

is  the  Commonwealth  of  Australia Referendum  (Constitution  Alteration)  Act

1906-1936,  Form  C,  which is referred to in column 159 of  the  same  Official

Report. Again it says here, Sir, "yes" or "no".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer you to the Plebeian, our Party organ of 8th June, 1962. There we have

a  series of questions from West Australia, Canada, France, Jamaica - all giving

examples of how one question was set. In Canada, it says here, the question  was

on the Dominion Plebiscite Act of 1942 on which a pubic vote was taken: "Are you

in  favour  of releasing the Government from any obligation arising out  of  any

past  commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military  service?"

Then  there is a precedent in Western Australia in 1932. Here, again,  there  is

one  question: "Are you in favour of the State of Western Australia  withdrawing

from the Federal Commonwealth established under the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



Commonwealth  of Australia Constitution Act?" Then there was the question  posed

in  January 1961 for the people in France to say "yes" or "no": "Do you  approve

the  Bill submitted to the French people by the President of the Republic?"  And

then  there  was  the  Jamaica  one  which has  already  been  quoted.  Then  in

Switzerland, the referendum held on the 1st of April this year was on a proposal

to  ban  the manufacture or deployment of atomic arms on Swiss soil. The  people

were asked to answer yes or no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, let us see how the P.A.P. twisted and turned when it came to arguments

with  the Opposition in Select Committee. Let us trace the arguments from column

115.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Byrne: Sir, I am aware, that in the case of Jamaica, the question was

framed by the Legislative Assembly. That is clear from the Ordinance itself. All

along  I  have maintained that that was a specific law to deal with  a  specific

referendum question.'



<br><br>In  other words, the Minister for Health and Law admits that that is the  normal

practice  but  that  because this is a general Referendum Bill  it  is  no  more

applicable.  Yet, I can quote to you many, many instances where the P.A.P. have

said that this Bill is for merger. They have said more than 25 times in all that

this is a general Referendum. I can quote you all the columns, Sir, but I do not

think  I  should waste your time. But I will quote the instances where they  say

that this Bill is for merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In column 87 Dr Goh said that. In column 84 Mr Byrne said that, by

implication. In column 151, Dr Goh said that. In column -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Even if the

Member is quoting, he should refer to Members by their designations. Dr Goh is

the Minister for Finance. Mr Byrne is the Minister for Health and Law.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am sorry, I

forgot. In column 87, the Minister for

Finance said that. In column 84, the

Minister for Health and Law said that.

In column 151, the Minister for Finance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



said that. In column 179 [Select Committee Official Report No. 4 dated 11th May,

1962], the Minister for Home Affairs said that. In column 181, the Minister  for

Finance said categorically, "Let us come down to brass tacks. This Bill  is  for

merger." Then in column 187, the Minister for Finance again said that. Then,  of

course, there was the amendment to the referendum motion by the Member for Anson

In  April which the Member for Anson has already quoted. Then in the Second Read

ing  of  the Bill, the Minister for Home Affairs said on 14th March, at page  4,

lines  I  and  2  [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 1, col. 70], "Sir,  when  the  Bill  was

drafted,  it was intended that in a referendum on merger . . .". I need  not  go

further.  Then on the same date, on page 5, the Minister for Home Affairs  again

said at paragraph 3 [col. 73]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions 01 this Bill, the first matter to be

submitted  to the electors for a referendum will be the terms and conditions  of

merger of Singapore with the Federation.'



<br><br>And then still on the Second Reading on 16th March, page 5, paragraph 3 [Hansard

Vol.  17, No. 3, col. 247], "Dr Goh Keng Swee: At the referendum that is to  be

held after this Bill is passed . . . ". Therefore, merger by implication. But he

stated  very  categorically in page 2, second line [col. 241], "Everybody  knows

that  this  referendum  will be on merger, and merger has been  the  outstanding

political issue before the country...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then on page 20 [col. 267], on the same date, somewhere in the middle, the

Minister for Health and Law said. "Machinery is being provided by this  Bill  to

enable the referendum on merger to be held in a far and just manner." "fair  and

just" - my eye! And then on the 16th, at page 29 [col. 280], this was said by  the

Prime Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Referendum Bill has been brought in to determine the wish of the

majority of the people on the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification of

these two territories."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that even the Deputy

Prime Minister is not left out, on 17th

April, page 4, paragraph 3 [Hansard Vol.

17, No. 8, col. 769], the whole paragraph





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



more  or less refers to merger. I quote this, Sir, merely to show how the P.A.P.

have  been twisting and turning. Whenever they are cornered, whenever they think

this argument serves their purpose, they say. "This Bill is a general Referendum

Bill." But when they find it convenient, as during discussion about the time  to

be  allowed  for canvassing, they say, "Oh! you already have been talking  about

merger  for a long time," and they further categorically say, "This Bill is  for

merger."  Let us go to col. 131 [Select Committee Official Report  No.  3  dated

8th May, 1962] where Dr Goh Keng Swee says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am in sympathy with a great deal of what the Member for Queenstown said,

i.e.,  the questions must be simple; the issues must be made clear to the people

so that they can make up their minds quite clearly...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says, "But whether that should apply to all referenda which may be carried

out  in  future I am not so certain," implying again that in principle he agrees

that  everything we say is correct, but that since this may be a Referendum Bill

for  the smoking of tobacco or for drinking alcohol, therefore he cannot  agree.

We  had all the weight of authority and commonsense on our side. Sir, but  since

they  wanted to keep on twisting, there was nothing very much we could do  about

it.  They  accepted the validity of our arguments, hut all the  time  they  were

shielding  behind the phrase, "This is a general Referendum Bill." The  Minister

for Health and Law also said - and this has been quoted by the Member for Anson -

that  if  it  was a specific Bill there was nothing to prevent the  Legislative

Assembly  from deciding on the question to be put in a referendum. But  then  he

followed  up again by saying that this was a general Referendum Bill.  And  then

the Minister for Finance again in column 134:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: In view of the practice in other countries, I think it is

unduly  restrictive  in the general referendum law -  such as we  are  considering

now - to limit the questions of the type which require only a yes or no answer.'



<br><br>In other words, implying again that it is quite right we should have only one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



question  put  to the people and that that question must be a simple  one  which

demands an answer of 'yes' or `no'. But since this is a general Referendum Bill,

we  cannot  have it. Then he further said in column 148 that multiple  questions

are very complicated. Yet he insists on more than one question now.



<br><br>10.30 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the Minister for Finance why he feared posing one question to the

people,  and  his  answer was very categorical. May I refer you  to  column  323

[Select Committee Official Report No. 5 dated 15th May, 1962]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Lee Siew Choh: Because of this New Clause (A). All doubts and risk of

losing  for  the  P.A.P. have at last been solved. How, I will explain  further.

There  are  two steps in this. The referendum, of course, would not  he  on  one

question, because that would mean defeat for the P.A.P.'



<br><br>What did the Minister for Finance say? He said, "That is what you say." In other

words,  he  thinks that if the P.A.P. were to pose one question  to  the  people

there would still be the possibility that the P.A.P. might win. I hope they will

just  pose the question and settle all doubts on the issue. Then when I referred

to  his  anxiety about the P.A.P. losing, the Minister for Finance said  in  the

second paragraph of column 326:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far from our anxiety growing from month to month, on the contrary, whatever

anxiety we had at the beginning has been gradually dispelled."



<br><br>And in the next page at column 327, he further said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we are not at all worried about their so-called propaganda campaign to

convince the people that this is a sell-out merger."



<br><br>He  said that the crowds attending our rallies were dwindling in number and that

our  house-to-house campaign had been a flop. He was not worried.. Yet in  spite

of his anxiety having been gradually dispelled, he still dare not put one simple

question  to the people concerning Command Paper No. 33 of 1961. There are  very

good reasons, Sir, why we think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



that  the  P.A.P. should pose the White Paper merger proposals to the people.  A

lot  of promises have been made concerning the P.A.P. merger proposals. Promises

were  made  by the Prime Minister as early as July during the Anson by-election,

in  a rally at Tras Street. On 11th July, he said, "The decision rests with  the

people  and not with the Ministers," and on 13th July in a rally held  near  the

Traffic  Police Headquarters, he again said, "It is our business to  settle  the

conditions and then it is for the people to decide." Probably they may decide in

a different manner. Then there was this radio talk which the Prime Minister gave

on 27th July and this was quoted in a radio forum by the Member for Hong Lim.  I

have  just got this from the Library and it says here in big headlines "NO SELL-OUT-LEE TELLS THE PEOPLE".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the date of the paper?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is dated 27th July, 1961 - The Straits Times. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Detail proposals for any constitutional negotiations on a merger will be

presented  to the Singapore Legislative Assembly for adoption and  then  to  the

people for their endorsement.'



<br><br>And  following that, there were various statements issued by the Prime  Minister

on  his jaunts up and down the Federation and every time he came back from Kuala

Lumpur,  he made statements to the Press saying that the merger proposals  which

he was trying to negotiate would be put before the people for their

endorsement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> This was in July 1961, was it not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> And therefore that quotation refers to a time before the

Barisan Sosialis said they wanted cornplete merger. Is that not true?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I think is the Minister for Finance wants to argue on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>

that particular point, we can come to it later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Let us hear you now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And then on the 6th September in a letter -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On the 6th of September, the Deputy Prime Minister in a

letter  to the Opposition Parties said categorically that when the deliberations

of  the  Working  Party  were completed and agreement  reached,  they  would  be

published  and  that "the people can then accept or reject them". The  operative

words used were "the people can accept or reject them".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When was that!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> September the 6th. And then there was that famous Press

interview given by the Prime Minister over Radio Singapore to the Chinese Press.

It  was  reported in the Nanyang Siang Pau and the Sin Chew fit Poh on the  25th

September  that  the Prime Minister had promised that he would  put  the  merger

proposals  to  the  people  for their decision in a  referendum.  What  is  more

interesting  is that he explained the mechanics of the voting in the referendum.

In the Press interview, he said that all the voters need do is to put a cross in

the space indicating yes if they agree and a cross in the space indicating no if

they  do not agree. And following that on the 15th of October a letter was  sent

to  the  Opposition and a Press statement was issued. I will quote. I am reading

from  a  Singapore  Government Press Statement dated 14th October.  The  heading

says:

"The  Prime  Minister and Leader of the House reply to Opposition's call  for  a

special Assembly Session." I will read it, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The following are texts of letters written by the Prime Minister, Mr Lee

Kuan  Yew, and the Leader of the House, Dr Toh Chin Chye, to the  Chairmen  of

three  Opposition Parties who, after a meeting on October 6th. 1961, in a  joint

letter called for a special Assembly session to discuss the question of merger.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Party Chairmen to whom the letters were sent are Dr Lee Siew Choh

of  the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Ong Eng Guan of the United People's Party, and Mr

David Marshal1 of the Workers' Party.'



<br><br>I  will  now  quote  you the relevant paragraphs. I think it is  an  interesting

letter, Sir, and I might as well quote the whole letter:



<br><br>'Dear Chairman,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your letter of 6th October. I completely agree with you that

merger  is  a  matter of national importance. It is an issue which  affects  the

future  of  all  our people. Not only you as Members of the Opposition  but  the

whole  of  the people of Singapore should be fully informed of the agreement  in

principle...'



<br><br>Agreement in principle!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...that has been reached between the two Governments. I am sorry that you con

sider the three communiques and the three Press conferences that I have given so

far  as inadequate. This unfortunately is all the progress that we have made  up

to  the moment. Every step forward made should be communicated to you as Members

of the Opposition and also to the people of Singapore.'



<br><br>Now, these are the operative words, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is the intention of the Government when all the details have been worked

out to publish a paper and table it in the Legislative Assembly for debate. Then

the people can accept or reject.'



<br><br>The  people can accept or reject them. Obviously, Sir, the P.A.P. idea of accept

or  reject means to add another alternative which is unacceptable to the people.

And  this  is typical of the P.A.P. twist and turn. I am just wondering  if  the

P.A.P. have  forgotten  all this. Mind you, Sir, these are  all  solemn  words,

written  in  black  and white. And what did the Minister for Finance  say  about

solemn  words?  The  Minister  for Health and Law  said  "perfect  co-ordination

between the brain and tongue". Those are the operative words of the Minister for

Health  and  Law about words spoken by the Prime Minister, solemn  words.  Well,

make sure that they are solemn. Make sure that they mean what they say. That  is

what the Minister for Finance has been trying to tell us - that the Prime Minister

always chooses his words very well. Well, what have they got to say?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those proposals are now embodied in Cmd. Paper 31.



<br><br>10.45 p.m.

<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.

I  think all the details that the Member for Queenstown are now discussing could

be  brought  up  when we come to item 5 of the Order Paper, which  is  a  motion

standing in the name of the Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown.  All

these aspects of the White Paper can be more appropriately discussed when item 5

is  discussed. Of course, there will be some overlapping but I think the  Member

should not go into too much details.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All right, Sir, I

will then skip that for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Referendum Bill must be seen in the light of the words of the Prime

Minister,  which the Member for Anson has already quoted. The words are,  "There

should  be  no  risk  of Communists being able to frustrate merger  or  Malaysia

whatever they do in the referendum." Sir, those words mean, in actual fact, that

there  must  be  no  possibility of the P.A.P. losing in a referendum.  And  the

questions will be so posed and so framed that it is a case of heads, the  P.A.P.

win, and tails, the people lose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Barisan will lose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> According to the Minister for Finance the P.A.P. merger

proposals must be pushed through at whatever cost, and to ensure that  there  is

no  risk  of losing, the questions will be framed in such a way that the  people

will  not be able to say "no" to the P.A.P. proposals. This is the zugzwang that

the  Minister  for Finance has been talking so very much about. He  is  a  chess

player  and  he knows that if the people are put in such a position,  then  they

cannot do anything. And whatever the people may do, according to the calculation

of the Minister for Finance, they must lose.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Barisan will lose, not the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let me just mention

a few words about what this will mean to the people of Singapore. I think the

Member for Anson has already dealt with it, but it can bear repeating. What we

want to say is this: that the P.A.P. must not make a mockery of democracy. If

unacceptable questions are posed to the people, then it will only lead to open

referendum rigging, and the present Referendum Bill is merely a legal cover for

such referendum rigging. I have given examples of unacceptable questions: Do you

want the voter to choose death by electrocution or by hanging? Under those

circumstances, surely you do not expect the voter to choose anything. The voter

wants to live, but he is offered only alternatives of dying. To give another

example - he may be asked to be either a cow or a horse. Surely you do not expect

the voter to choose one of these two alternatives. Of course, now their pet

subject is the Penang type of merger. But this Penang type of merger is a

distortion of the Opposition stand. The Member for Anson has already dealt with

this adequately. But I will just repeat this. The Opposition stand on the merger

issue is that all Singapore citizens must become Federation citizens on merger,

and there must be adequate proportional representation. And let us tell the

P.A.P. this: however much they may want to distort, however much they may go on

to the radio. Redifiusion, radio talks, Press statements about the Penang type

of merger, they will not deceive the people as to what is the actual stand of

the Opposition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Marshall in the forum said that you made a mistake! How can

you deny that!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But I want to draw your attention, Sir, to one thing:

that right through this Referendum Bill is the P.A.P. plot to make it a "sure

win". And I am going to show you, stage by stage, at least up to two

unacceptable questions, the evil intentions of the P.A.P. that have been the

driving force behind this Referendum Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Are you trying to break your record of 7� hours! Wrong

file. Still wrong?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You see, Sir, it all stems from one thing - that the P.A.P.

are afraid and they know that their own merger proposals are unacceptable to the

people. The original intention of the P.A.P., from what I have already indicated

to  you, was to pose to the people one simple question requiring a simple answer

of  "yes" or "no" to their merger proposals. The few bits that I read out to you

were  clear  enough. It was intended the people were to be asked  to  accept  or

reject  them. That was that. But unfortunately for the P.A.P., as time went  on,

the  P.A.P. realised that their sellout merger was completely exposed.  See  the

way  they  had  to reveal the information on the merger proposals - by  dribs  and

drabs!  They  came out with the word "national" being equal to  "citizen".  Then

they came out with excuses that automatic citizenship was impossible. Later they

said  it was unreasonable. Still later they gave excuses about residential quali

fication, and so on and so forth. The mere fact that they had to reveal this bit

by  bit is already evidence enough that there was something which they dared not

tell the people about. There was something which the P.A.P. themselves know  the

people  will  object  to  very  much. The P.A.P. knew  that  the  people  would

definitely  condemn them for having negotiated for such proposals on  behalf  of

Singapore. But then, of course, we must realise that at that time the P.A.P. was

in  no  position to negotiate. The Prime Minister went up and down, begging  the

Tunku  on  bended knees to accept his merger proposals. You will remember,  Sir,

what  the  Tunku said in a debate in the Federation Parliament, namely that  the

Prime Minister of Singapore had gone along to beg of him to help him out of  his

troubles.  Therefore,  to help out the Prime Minister of  Singapore,  he  kindly

accepted the proposals put to him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. Is it in order for the Member for

Queenstown to distort what the Federation Prime Minister said in such a blatancy

dishonest and fraudulent manner?



<br><br><!--Mr John Mammen(Deputy Speaker)-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> If  the Member for Queenstown is quoting the text

of the Federation Prime Minister's speech, then he should produce the text.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Unfortunately I

do not have the text here. But I remember -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is no

good.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But I remember

the  Federation Prime Minister did say that the Prime Minister of Singapore told

him  a  lot of stories and consequently he accepted the merger proposals.  I  am

sure the Minister will not deny that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Mr Chairman, Sir. It is obvious that

the  Member  for Oueenstown is uttering falsehoods. Within the space  of  a  few

minutes, he  gave two completely different versions of what Tunku Abdul  Rahman

said.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I see the sore spot in the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member

for Queenstown cannot produce the document to prove the text, then it is best

for him not to proceed along that line.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will leave that

aspect  of  it  then. Let me go back to the exposure of this  P.A.P. referendum

plot.  As  the sell-out nature of the P.A.P. merger proposals was seen  through,

and  especially  after the debate in the House on the merger issue,  the  P.A.P.

came to realise that if they were to put those very proposals to the people  for

endorsement or rejection, it would be rejection and not endorsement. Instead of

a  "yes"  which  they had hoped for, it would have been a "no". Therefore,  when

this  Bill was put forward, they already had the intention of posing two or more

questions to the electorate. Those questions, of course, would have to be framed

in  such  a  way that they would be completely unacceptable to the  people.  The

P.A.P. proposals  would be one of the alternatives, and the  other  alternative

would be something worse. The people would be asked to choose between two evils,

and  it  was  expected, according to P.A.P. calculations, that the people  would

choose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>

the lesser of two evils. Under those circumstances, it was calculated that possi

bly  the P.A.P. might get away with it and the P.A.P. merger proposals would  be

carried  in the referendum. That was the plot of the P.A.P. As regards  how  the

change came later on, I will come to that when we discuss the blank vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But up to this stage we can see that the P.A.P. wanted to have a snap re

ferendum,  and that snap referendum can be seen from clauses 40,  41,  and  also

clauses  5,  6, and 13. "No canvassing allowed" with two unacceptable  questions

suddenly  pounced on the people. That was the plot. As we go  on  to  the  other

clauses, I shall come to the other parts of the plot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch a little on clause 18 because I have filed an amendment

there, but I wonder whether I should wait until clause 18 is discussed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Wait for clause 18.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In this clause 18 I merely ask for a form of ballot paper

to  be put in a Schedule. It is merely to let the voter know what to expect  and

also to let political Parties know in advance how to canvass.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. We are now discussing an amendment to

clause 5. Is it in order for the Member to discuss clause 18?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> When the Member for Anson moved his amendment to clause 5, the

debate  was  allowed to range over the second amendment to clause 13,  i.e.  "In

page A3, line 41: to leave out 'questions' and insert 'one question as framed by

the  Legislative  Assembly', and the amendment to  clause  18.  The  Member  for

Queenstown is therefore perfectly in order. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I want to bring this out only to show you the plot that is

in  the  minds of the P.A.P., because of their trying to have a snap  referendum

without  letting the people know anything until the last minute. They hope  that

by  posing two unacceptable questions, there will he confusion in the  minds  of

the people and they hope to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>

make use of this confusion. That is why even a sample  of  a  ballot

paper  is  not made known. The P.A.P. wants to make this known only at the  last

minute  so  that  the  Opposition Parties will not have the opportunity  or  the

facility to tell the people how to vote. This is all in line with the idea of  a

snap  referendum  and the fact that they have so far refused even  to  accept  a

simple  amendment like this shows to what low level the thinking of  the  P.A.P.

has sunk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want now to go into the details of this ballot paper, and I think I

will  reserve  it until we come to the clause itself. But I want to  impress  on

you,  Sir, that all these amendments that we ask for are only put in so that  we

can  have  an  honest, fair, and just referendum. If the people's wishes  should

coincide  with  the wishes of the P.A.P., then there is no need to  go  to  such

lengths  as to pose unacceptable questions, or to put in blank votes  and  other

undemocratic provisions in the Bill. The Ministers opposite have repeatedly said

that  it  should be a fair and just referendum, but so far we have  proved  that

this  Bill  is  very unfair, unjust and very undemocratic. The test  before  the

people today, Sir, is whether or not the people will be given an opportunity  to

express  their  wishes and aspirations in a peaceful and constitutional  manner;

whether or not they will be allowed to say "no" in a peaceful and constitutional

manner. If the P.A.P. insist on their Fascist behaviour, and if they insist in the

way  they  are going about it, then it will only mean the death of parliamentary

democracy.  And it will prove to the world that parliamentary democracy  can  be

destroyed by people who do not know how to make use of power when they gain it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote, Sir, from the Report of Proceedings of the Seventh Commonwealth

Parliamentary  Conference  held  in  London  in  September,  1961.  It   is   on

Constitutional and Parliamentary Practice in the Commonwealth by the  Hon.  Shri

M.  A. Ayyangar, M.P. (Speaker of the Lok Sabha, India). This is what he said on

page 158, paragraph 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...why have so many democracies tumbled? It is not only in Asia but even in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



Europe that this has happened. I will tell you one of the most important causes.

In  the  democracies and in our Parliament today there is unfortunately a  fight

for  power between one party and another, We talk of using experts in all  other

matters,  but in parliamentary institutions, each one, whether he is capable  or

not, can struggle with another man for power.'



<br><br>And these are the operative words, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Having obtained power, they are not able to maintain the parliamentary

institution and they destroy the edifice partly for selfish ends.'



<br><br>And in another paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Proper human material contributes to the success of democracy. Responsible

people must come to Parliament.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. May I know how all this fits in with the debate which we

are now having on the Referendum Bill? We are now on an amendment moved to add a

new sub-clause to clauses 5. 18, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, if they insist on carrying out their plot, then it

will mean the death of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The death of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The point I am trying to prove to you is this: that the

practice  of  democracy  does  not lie in the preachings  of  men  but  in  the

practice  of  those who hold power; those Fascists who have been so intoxicated

with  power that they will carry on and do almost anything in order to maintain

themselves in office. That is what I am trying to drive home to you,  Sir.  And

that  is  why I quote. It is the "human material", the shortcomings in  certain

men -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How true!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will just quote

another little bit, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So far the Member has made his point. But if he is going too far

into  the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Report, I am afraid I will have

to rule him out of order. Dr Lee, please proceed on the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will just add one more sentence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank God!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> However good a constitution a country may have, unless the

human  material  is good and unselfish men are in charge, the democratic  system

will  not  work.  Let us hope that the P.A.P. will help in making  parliamentary

democracy  work,  and  not just merely impose their will on  the  people  simply

because they have a one-man majority. Other governments would have resigned  and

gone back to the country and asked the people whether they wanted to accept  the

proposal  or  not. Governments have resigned on even less important issues,  but

now with an issue that concerns all of us in Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Which issue?

Which government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - the P.A.P.

insist on railroading merger.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Chairman.

I  think  the great difficulty in our discussions in this Committee is  to  come

back  to  the  point - to the amendments which are being moved  in  the  National

Referendum  Bill. The main contention of the Opposition is that the Bill  should

contain  provisions for only one question to he asked. I pointed out during  the

debate  on  the motion moved by the Member for Anson on the 17th of April,  1962

[Hansard  Vol. 17 No. 8], that the National Referendum Bill was a  general  Refe

rendum  Bill. In the motion moved by the Member for Anson on 17th of  April, he

mentioned  specifically  a  referendum  oil  merger.  I  quite  agree  that  the

referendum on the Federation/Singapore merger is a specific referendum. But this

referendum  cannot  be  conducted until the National Referendum  Bill  has  been

passed. Therefore, when the Member for Anson earlier on quoted me and said  that

I was at variance with what I had said previously, it is not quite correct.

I put to you a very simple question.

If  it  is  agreed  that  the National Referendum Bill is  a  general  Bill  for

referenda  that may be held in the future, it is pretty obvious that it  is  not

possible  to  pre-determine the nature of the question that may be asked.  There

fore, allowance must be given to the fact that the question to be formulated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



in future years will vary according to the problem that is being put before the

people.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>11.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition, in particular the Member for Anson and the Member for

Queenstown,  are  specific that a simple "yes" or "no" should  be  given  to  a

question  in a referendum. I will give you a simple example. We are  all  agreed

that  if a person is thirsty, he must drink. That is an obvious fact which  none

can  deny. If you are thirsty, you must drink. So it would be ridiculous for  us

to go along and ask Members of this House to vote "yes" or "no" to the question:

"Are  you  going to drink if you are thirsty?" For Members of this House  to  be

asked  to answer the question by a "yes" or a "no" is the height of foolishness,

if not ridicule. Having agreed that a person who is thirsty must drink, the next

obvious and logical question to ask is "What sort of drink do you want?  Do  you

want  tea  with or without milk? Do you want coffee black or white? Do you  want

your  tea  or  coffee with or without sugar? Or do you just want plain  water?"

These  are  obvious choices. Supposing I am spending drinks on Members  of  this

House  and I ask them: "What would you drink?" Mr Marshall might not like beer.

He might -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am sorry. The Member for Anson might not like beer. He

might like -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am indebted. Do I understand the Deputy Prime Minister is

going  back on what he said on 17th of April? .1 would like to, quote the  exact

words at page 8 of the revised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



transcript [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 8, col. 774]. These are the words, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, as I have already explained, the Minister for Home Affairs last

year,  during  the  debate  on merger, introduced  the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill with one prospect, and that was to enable  the  people  of

Singapore  in  their  own  interest  to  go  to  a  referendum   to   state

specifically  how the reunification of Singapore and the Federation  should

be brought about.'



<br><br>And  then, Sir, the amendment which he introduced which was passed by  this

House by a Government majority reads - (It is a little lower down):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... this House welcomes the Government's introduction of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore National Referendum Bill in order to hold a referendum to

ascertain  the  wishes  of  the  people on  the  mode  and  manner  of  the

inevitable reunification...'.



<br><br>Do these words have any meaning at all?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Of course. I am not denying the issue. The Bill that

is  for  discussion before this House is a general Bill for all  referenda.

And  this  National Referendum Bill has to be introduced in  order  that  a

referendum  for  a  merger  between Singapore and  the  Federation  can  be

carried  out.  There  has been no contradiction in my  speech.  But  may  I

continue  with  my analogy'? If I were to give Members of  this  Chamber  a

treat,  I  will  naturally ask them: "What would you like to  drink?"  Mr

Marshall  might not like beer. I do riot know what he would like to  drink.

Is it whisky, which he said in the radio

forum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Or arsenic acid!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He might like tea or coffee, black or white. The Minister for Law might like something else, maybe Coca-Cola.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do not forget the Speaker!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker

might like -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Green Spot!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> - a less inebriating drink. Nonetheless, the choice has to

be  given. But we are all agreed on one basic question, in this analogy of mine,

that it is necessary to drink if you are thirsty. And having agreed on that,  we

must  decide  what  drink we want. Now, coming back to a more specific  problem.

Members  of  this House cannot deny that the principle of merger is accepted  by

all Parties. Merger has been accepted by all Parties in Singapore because it  is

the economic solution for Singapore. Just to prove what I have said, may I quote

the  Member  for  Anson in column 557 in the debate on merger on 23rd  November,

1961, in Hansard, Volume 15, No. 7? This is what the Member for Anson said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, Sir, in case there is any suggestions as to when I and my Party began to

believe in merger, here is a dog-eared copy of the very first and the only party

platform of the Workers' Party on its formation in December of 1957, in the very

first paragraph and in the first sentence, it says.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The basis and framework of all policy must be recognition of the fact that

Singapore is geographically, ethnically, and economically part of Malaya and the

only healthy ultimate solution is integration with Malaya on an equal basis with

other states...'"



<br><br>The Member for Anson accepts that there must be merger. But it must be merger on

an  equal basis with other States, either with Penang, Malacca, Johore, Selangor

or  Perak. The Member for Queenstown, during the debate on the motion  moved  by

the  Member for Anson on the 17th of April, said this at page 24 of the  revised

transcript  dated 18th April, 1962 [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 9, col. 879].  This  is

what the Member for Queenstown said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Culture say that merger is a

P.A.P. pledge. Let me tell them right here and now:

it  is  all  poppycock and nonsense, because merger was on the platform  of  all

political Parties in Singapore.'



<br><br>The  Member for Anson accepts merger. The Member for Queenstown accepts  merger.

In  fact, the Member for Queenstown even goes to the extent of saying that  all

political Parties in Singapore want merger. The Member for Hong Limb in the same

debate, said this on page



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



36  of  the  revised transcript dated 17th April [Hansard Vol. 17, No.  8,  col.

813]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the worst comes to the worst and the people were asked what type of merger

they would prefer, then the ballot paper should put forward the two alternatives

which the two groups of Parties in this Assembly have supported.'



<br><br>Sir,  I wish the House to confirm that all Parties in this Chamber, and in  fact

according  to the Member for Queenstown, all Parties who stood for election  in

1959 had merger as their platform.

tn other words, nobody is against the principle of merger. The Workers'

Party  would  like Singapore to be merged with the Federation on an equal  basis

like any of the other States in the Federation. The Member for Hong Lim goes  to

the  extent of even accepting that it might well be that two alternatives should

be  placed on the ballot paper. So I say, Mr Chairman, that the fuss now kicked

up  by Members of the Opposition in moving this amendment that only one question

should  be  asked  in  the referendum is absolutely irrelevant.  What  they  are

seeking to do is not merely to draw a red herring, but I would even charge  them

that  they  are just trying to prevent this Bill from being passed  so  that  by

filibustering they hope to delay the day of decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, under these circumstances, I can see no grounds why the Member for Queenstown, the Member for Anson and the Member for Hong Lim have insisted that only one question should be asked in the referendum on merger, and that a simple "yes" or "no" answer is required. As I have pointed out in my analogy

previously,  if  the principle of merger is accepted, then the  people  must  be

asked  on the mode and manner of merger. Just as I said, if it is accepted  that

it  is  necessary for us to drink if we are thirsty, then it must be asked  what

drink do you want?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Take salt water!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Well, if the

Member for Queenstown likes salt water, we are surrounded by the sea



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



and he can drink as much salt water as he likes. We are not stopping him. And if

he  wants the Rochore Canal water, I cannot stop him either. I will come back to

one  basic conclusion. The number of minutes which have been spent by the Member

for  Anson and the Member for Queenstown on this amendment refutes all that they

have  said  in  the past during the debate on merger. Under these circumstances,

their amendment to this clause cannot be accepted.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, yet one more blatant contradiction to emblazon on

their  shield.  Here, Sir, we have been arguing and taking  them  seriously.  We

quoted the Prime Minister. Do I need to remind you, Sir? His words were that the

purpose - since he was not here, let me quote him in fairness, so he could get  it

accurately;  or  is  he  embarrassed and has a conscience  about  the  falsehood

perpetrated in the name -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> May I assure the Member for Ansoit that it is part of my

duty,  sometimes  pleasant, sometimes unpleasant, to read through  all  reports.

whether  I am present or not present in the Assembly, and to deal with  them  at

the  appropriate time? I would urge upon him not to inflict upon  this  Assembly

unhappy repetition of arguments worn thin.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, you do notice, Sir, and I trust that in future you

will  bear  in mind if I seem a little churlish in denying the normal courtesies

of  a  point  of  elucidation or explanation, when it was not utilised  for  the

purposes  of  elucidating anything at all but was made for  the  purposes  of  a

speech.  But let me rub it in since he seems rather embarrassed with the  thought

that it might be.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am referring to the 16th of March, page 29 [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 3,

col. 280]:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Prime Minister: This Referendum Bill has been brought in to determine the

wish  of  the  majority of the people on the mode and manner of  the  inevitable

reunification of the two territories.'



<br><br>Now,  Sir, if English words have any meaning, the meaning is that this  Bill  is

specifically  intended for and intended only for the purpose of a referendum  in

respect  of  the  P.A.P. proposals. This was reinforced  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister on the 17th of April, page 8 of the revised transcript [Hansard Vol.

17, No. 8, col. 774]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...as I have already explained, the Minister for Home Affairs last year,

during  the debate on merger, introduced the Singapore National Referendum  Bill

with  one prospect, and that was to enable the people of Singapore in their  own

interest  to  go to a referendum to state specifically how the reunification  of

Singapore and the Federation should be brought about.'



<br><br>If  English  has  any meaning, what is the meaning of "one prospect"?  Today  he

talks  about drinking - I forget which canal water; Rochore Canal water; and  salt

water.  Drinking salt water makes people mad, and it does bring about a  certain

aberration.  And  if he tells us that he has been drinking salt  water,  we  can

understand  the  change  of stand which he so blatantly  and  unblushingly  puts

forward  today.  But  I have not heard him admit that either  he  or  the  Prime

Minister  has  been drinking any salt water. Apart from that, we have  a  solemn

amendment to the motion which, by virtue of the Government majority, was  passed

by  this House. We have no reason to doubt that this was a specific Bill  for  a

specific  purpose, and that purpose was a referendum on merger. Let  me  re-read

it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...this House welcomes the Government's introduction of the Singapore

National  Referendum  Bill [what for, Sir?] in order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain  the  wishes of the people on the mode and manner  of  the  inevitable

reunification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya before arrangements  are

finalised.'



<br><br>Sir, to what depths are we to descend? What barefaced hypocrisy are we going  to

he guilty of, that in this very Chamber, these solemn words affirmed by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>

Government  majority on the following day - a majority of 23 ayes to 16  noes  and

six  abstentions  and  six  absent.  They tell  us  now  because  they  find  it

inconvenient to agree that the question should be posed. They tell us that this

is  a  general  Referendum Bill for drinking water or ginger pop. Mr  Chairman,

very well. But do they recognise - and this is a simple question - that the issue of

the  merger proposals is vital to the welfare of the people? It is so  vital  to

the welfare of the people that it merits a Bill all by itself. If they want this

as   a   general  Referendum  Bill,  would  they  introduce  a  Referendum  Bill

specifically for the merger? Is that so unfair? Could they not introduce one? It

is  a  very  short  one. We have a form in the Jamaican one.  Mr  Speaker,  you

yourself  are  conscious that I sought to introduce a motion in this  House  for

leave  to  introduce a Bill myself for the purpose of merger with the Federation

and a referendum thereon, and you ruled it out of order because you stated, Sir -

though  I do not have the letter; it is your letter and I hope, if I incorrectly

quote  you,  you  will correct me - that that was out of order because  there  was

already  a  Bill specifically for a referendum on the merger in accordance  with

this motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think the hon. Member is right when he says that

I used the word "specifically".



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am sorry, Sir. You ruled that this amendment to my motion,

which  was  finally adopted by the House, which said that this  Referendum  Bill

which  was  introduced  in  order to put a referendum  to  the  people  for  the

reunification was, in fact, a Bill, was already before the House and I could not

introduce another for the same purpose. I am glad, Sir, you agree that  that  is

correct.  So, to that extent, Sir, it is even accepted by the Speaker that  this

Bill  on the showing, not merely on the word of the Government, which the Member

for  Cairnhill  is so willing to accept whenever they are ready  to  give  their

gentle  assurances  and which they are so ready to dishonour whenever  it  suits

them, but in respect of a motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



in  the Votes and Proceedings of this House, is for the purpose of referendum on

merger. I repeat. They can take the heat off the entire operation if they want a

general  Referendum Bill. And I call their bluff by asking for in a  very  short

and  simple Bill specifically for the purpose of the referendum that we seek  in

respect of the merger proposals for the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> shook his head.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister shakes his head, and why? Have they no

time? Have they no staff?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Staff of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Or is this not a matter of importance to the people? The Deputy

Prime Minister interjects that he cannot understand -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> There are none, Sir, so blind as they who will not see. This is

a  matter  of  cold-blooded, calculated dishonesty where there  is  no  question

whatsoever of any desire to be anything, but playing power politics.  They  have

the  power  and  all  the  rest is nonsense. Mr Chairman,  it  may  not  he  in

appropriate in the context of the blatant hypocrisy now displayed to read to you

certain  passages from a document I have just received, curiously enough  emanat

ing from organisations, some of which are known and merit respect. This document

has  been  addressed, I gather, to all Members of this Assembly, and it emanates

from  39  organisations  of Singapore, headed by the  Guild  of  the  Nan, yang

University  Graduates, the Singapore University Socialist  Club,  the  Singapore

Polytechnic  Political  Society,  the Nan-yang University  Students  Union,  the

Nanyang  University Political Science Society, the Khdng Lay Musical Association

and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, may I draw your attention to just a couple of paragraphs:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We the undersigned cultural organisations in Singapore humbly present to you

this memorandum which expresses our opinions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



At  this  juncture, when democracy is severely on trial, we hope this memorandum

emanating from our deep concern for the future of the State and the interests of

our people will induce the elected representatives of the people to consider the

present problem in great fairness and to uphold justice and democracy. We are of

the  opinion that the proposed Referendum Bill, which is laid before the elected

representatives  of the people, violates the very principles of  any  democratic

constitution. The constitutions of all democratic countries in the world  define

clearly the right of the people to express -'



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of

elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let the Member

complete the sentence.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No, Sir. I will not give way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...clearly the right of the people to express their opinions freely on

political  affairs and to have the final say on any vital question.  No  act  or

Bill can violate this basic right of the people. The Referendum Bills of all the

democratic countries contain this common feature, that it is to confer upon  the

people  the  right  to  reject  any Bill or Act  passed  by  Parliament  or  the

Legislative Assembly. Those who ignore this basic right have thereby  repudiated

the very spirit of referendum.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read only one short paragraph, Sir:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are also of the opinion that the proposed Referendum Bill constitutes a

direct  threat  to  the very life of Parliamentary democracy  in  Singapore.  We

believe  that any Bill or Act should be regarded as unconstitutional or  illegal

if  it violates the traditions of the basic principles of democracy. We wish  to

point  out that the proposed Referendum Bill by its very nature would only  pave

the  way  for  a  tyrannical system which will dig the grave  for  parliamentary

democracy.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they refer there to parliamentary illegalities. The Minister

for Law, in an expansive moment of feeling of power, said the law can turn a man

into a woman. There is nothing dishonest in suggesting that the Minister for Law

is  a woman. Everybody should accept it if the law says so, and there is nothing

dishonest or improper. I say this to you, Mr Chairman, we are here being  faced

with  the position where the people on the opposite Benches have neither respect

for  decency,  nor respect for truth. In fact, they have, in one short  evening,

again  and again turned a somersault on themselves and all they can do is titter

embarrassedly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> They have said repeatedly, Mr Chairman, that this is a

Bill  for  referendum on the merger and it is on that basis that  we  argued

and  I sought to argue earlier this evening though the Deputy Prime Minister

was  not  present to show why, in the context of what had been said and  the

allegations, that this was a specific Bill and that there could be only  one

question.  He  now  throws the whole thing open and  says  that  this  is  a

general  Bill.  I  would urge a reply to a very simple question.  Will  they

introduce  a  Bill  specifically for a referendum in respect  of  the  White

Paper proposals or merger, or call it what you will? Will they?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> No. Well, I need not sit down to obtain that answer. I only

want  to  add  one  more thing, Mr Chairman. No reason is  given  for  not

putting in a Bill, and why is that? No, Sir,I fear it is more than a  ques

tion  of  physical fatigue. It is a matter of deep depression  that  I  and

fellow  human beings, most of them very decent people, Sir, should  have  a

government  that is so calculatedly dishonest, so shamelessly, unblushingly

dishonest  as this Government seeks to be. We are told, Mr Chairman,  that

the  people deserve the government they get and I would urge that at  least

in  this  one instance it is not true. Because, Mr Chairman, I  would  say

this  to you, and it is not any question here of seeking votes. But I would

say, Mr Chairman, that you

-    will  find  it  very difficult, wherever you travel in this world,  if  you

have  any contact with our people, to find any who are as gentle, as  mild,

as  reasonable, as hardworking, and as generally decent as the citizens  of

Singapore.  How they came to earn this motley group on the Front  Bench  is

beyond my understanding?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Member is always very fond of using

extravagant  phrases which are, in effect, offensive and which perhaps  can

be met



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>

by other offensive terms. I would suggest that he modulate his language and come

back to the amendment before us.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, the Deputy Prime Minister did not deal with the

amendment  before us except to say that this was a general Referendum  Bill  and

consequently you could ask more than two questions. But I trust you will notice,

and other Members of this House will notice, that he said not one word as to why

that part of the amendment which says that the question should be answered by  a

yes  or  no,  was  not  acceptable. Not one word was said by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister on that aspect. He has an opportunity, perhaps he can tell us:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Why cannot we have a Referendum Bill specifically for the merger proposals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Why cannot the questions even in a general Referendum Bill be answered by a

yes or no?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Toh perhaps would reply very briefly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I want only a few minutes. Since he has asked me a specific

question, then I think I have to answer it. The Member for Anson was not  paying

attention  when  I  drew my analogy that if we all accept  the  principle,  then

obviously  the  next  question which we must go  to  is,  how  do  we  go  about

implementing  the  principle? The example I drew upon was  that  if  a  man  is

thirsty,  it  is accepted that he must drink to quench his thirst, otherwise  he

will  just die. Therefore, having decided that he must drink, you have  to  give

him  a  choice  of  what  he wants to drink. Now, I have pointed  out  examples,

quotations  made by the Member for Anson, the Member for Queenstown, the  Member

for Hong Lim, that they are all in favour of the principle of merger. They might

not  agree with us that the White Paper is a step forward. In fact, I think they

walked out of the Chamber when the vote was hut on that occasion. The Member for

Anson has stated during the debate on merger that he accepts merger as the  only

ultimate solution and that is by way of integration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>

with Malaya on an equal basis with other States. Surely he is not withdraw

ing  that  statement. It is a basic policy of his Party. He, in fact,  says  "If

there is any suggestion as to when I and my Party began to believe in merger, we

have a copy of the very first, and the only party platform of the Workers' Party

on  its formation in December 1959," meaning, of course, that the Workers' Party

has always stood for merger.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is quite correct. Therefore. I see no reason. Mr

Speaker,  why  the Bill which is before us should not be used to initiate  a  referendum  on  merger. There is no objection to it. Mr Marshall  took  objection

because I said it was a Bill designed for referenda besides that on merger.  Now

assume  that  this is a Bill specifically designed to carry out a referendum  on

merger.  We  have  all  agreed in this House that merger is  essential.  Without

merger it will be like committing hara kiri.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It will be like committing suicide. You are afraid we will

ask  the  citizens of Singapore: "Do you want to live?" "Do you want to  commit

suicide?"  Do the Members of the Opposition sincerely believe that we are  going

to  put  forward  such an idiotic question before the people: "Do  you  want  to

live?" And ask them to answer yes or no. They all have accepted merger. And  the

reason,  they  all  understand,  is that it is vital  to  the  economic  life  of

Singapore.  If Assemblymen say they represent the people of Singapore,  then  it

must  he obviously concluded that since all political Parties have accepted  the

principle  of  merger, the people also accept the principle  of  merger.  Having

agreed  on that basis, we must therefore arrive upon the manner and the mode  in

which  this merger must be carried rut. Therefore, I see no reason whatever  why

the  Members  in  the  Opposition should insist that there  ought  only  be  one

question  put  in  the referendum for merger or that there should  be  a  simple

answer yes or no. Now, as I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



have  pointed  out, before we can execute the referendum on Federation/Singapore

merger,  this  Bill must be got through and this Bill is designed  not  only  to

carry  out  the  referendum on merger, but also other referenda which  may  take

place in the future. I see really no objection why this Bill should not be  used

to  implement  the  referendum on merger. Therefore, there would  be  no  reason

whatsoever  why  a  special  Bill must be passed  specially  to  carry  out  the

referendum for merger.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we on the Front Bench here have been sitting very quietly listening to  the

gems  of  wisdom  from the mouths of the Member for Anson  and  the  Member  for

Queenstown.  I did not think of joining in the debate so early, but  because  my

name has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Anson, I think it is time that  I

should  rise  and  say  my  piece. First of all, he said  that  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  is so ready to accept the assurance of the Government. May  I  assure

the  Member for Anson that the Member for Cairnhill is never so naive? In  fact,

if  he  will  look  at  the amendment proposed by him to clause  13,  it  is  my

intention, when that clause comes up for debate, to move an amendment to  ensure

that  the  questions  to be posed in a referendum should be  as  framed  by  the

Legislative Assembly. That will tie the Government down to voting for

it.  If the Government vote against it, then it will be clear that what they say

is  one  thing  and  what they mean is another, and that  they  cannot  keep  on

claiming  that  they  always mean what they say, and say what  they  mean.  This

debate  is  going  to be like the debate on merger where a lot of  unnecessarily

hard  words were exchanged by both sides of the House. Even the Member for Anson

has  said that the Minister for Law has said that the law can turn a man into  a

woman and, if I remember rightly, when I was in the Government with him, it  was

explained  to  me  that  under  the law, the male always  embraces  the  female.

[Laughter] So, therefore, it means that when you say "man" under the law, it can

also mean a woman.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to understand the dingdong battle that has been waged

between  the  P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P., i.e., the Banisan now,  and  the  lone

voice of the Workers' Party, the Member for Anson, one must go back to  the

time  when  there was a radio forum at which the Minister for Finance,  the

Member for Queenstown, the Member for Farrer Park, and the Member for  Hong

Lim  were  present. A question was posed to the forum as to their  view  on

whether  it  was more desirable to hold a referendum or a general  election

in  order  to ascertain the views of the electorate on merger.  The  Member

for  Queenstown  insisted  that  there should  be  general  elections.  The

Barisan  Sosialis  is ever fond of calling for general  elections  so  that

they  can  see  the  P.A.P. removed from office. But the  Banisan  Sosialis

Members forget that they were returned as P.A.P. Members, and if they  wish

to  sit on our side of the House it will be better for them to get a  fresh

mandate from the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the other Members at that radio forum said quite

rightly  that the correct way to ascertain the views of the electorate  was

by  means  of a referendum. So in a way the Government was committed  to  a

referendum.  Therefore, the Government introduced a Bill for First  Reading

some  months ago and I must say, well the Government can deny it,  that  at

that particular time, what was in their minds was that they would pose  one

question  to  the electorate. In fact, the utterances of the Front  Benches

of the Government  clearly  indicated that that was their intention. They meant  to  put

White Paper 33 to the electorate for them to pass judgment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the days went by, Sir, the P.A.P. began to have qualms because it was

then  felt  by them that if they were to pose that one simple question  for

the  verdict  of the electorate, the majority of the electorate  would  say

no.  They  would say no, not because they do not want merger,  not  because

they do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>

want  closer relationship with the Federation of Malaya; they would say no  just

to  show their disgust at the Government and their great desire that the sooner

the  P.A.P.  Government  is buried, the healthier it would  be  for  Singapore.

Therefore,  the Second Reading of the Bill was postponed for a  month  or  two.

But  then the bright lads of the P.A.P. suddenly thought of a wonderful scheme.

You  know  the  P.A.P. are  wonderful schemers. They  suddenly  thought  of  a

wonderful scheme. "Ah, ah! I think we could win this referendum if we  were  to

pose  more  than one question, so long as the question in regard to Cmd.  Paper

33  is going to be the only sensible, reasonable and advantageous question." So

they thought it would be a good thing if they were to put two questions to  the

electorate  such  as:  "Do you want the P.A.F. type merger  whereby  we  retain

autonomy  in  education and labour, or do you want the Barisan type  of  merger

whereby  340,000 non-local born citizens would lose their citizenship  rights?"

If  they  were to pose those two questions to the electorate, Sir,  surely  the

340,000  non-local-born citizens will vote for the P.A.P. because they want  to

retain  their  citizenship rights, and 340,000 non-local-born citizens  are  al

ready  in  the majority. So they said, "Ah! it is a good scheme. Go ahead  with

the Second Reading of the Referendum Bill -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of elucidation at half a minute to 12?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They keep on

insisting that these 340,000 non-local-born citizens would be deprived of  their

citizenship in the Penang type merger. That is not the Opposition stand. Do  not

help the P.A.P. to fabricate and distort this stand.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am not

supporting the questions to be proposed by the P.A.P. Government. In fact, I

was trying to show why the P.A.P. government wanted to pose two questions -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Midnight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of

<br><div align="center"><i>Wednesday, 27th June, 1962</i></div><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Hyderabad



<br><br><!--Mr Tee Kim Leng-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Tee  Kim  Leng</b>

asked the Prime Minister whether he has received  a  letter dated 26th January, 1962,

from the villagers of Kampong Hyderabad, off Hyderabad Road, whether and what action

has been taken to prevent the blockade by the Army authorities  of the only means of

access of the villagers to their  houses,  and

with what result.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I have received the letter. The letter stated that the Army

Authorities  intended to erect a fence along their boundary which would  deprive

the kampong of the use of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>

present  access  footpath running through Army land on to a War Department  road

called Hyderabad Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have been made to the Army Authorities for alternative access

and  the Army Authorities have since bulldozed and graded a road trace on  their

land  as  an  alternative access for the kampong. This new access  connects  the

kampong with Alexandra Terrace and the main Pasir Panjang Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office is also pursuing the possibility of providing an additional

pedestrian access to Alexandra Road for the kampong dwellers.
