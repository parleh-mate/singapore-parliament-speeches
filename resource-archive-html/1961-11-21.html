<div align="center"><b>MERGER (SINGAPORE/FEDERATION OF MALAYA)</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[20th November, 1961],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve the

reunification  of  Singapore with  the  Federation  of

Malaya  and to remove the artificial division  created

by  the  British by their policy of "divide and rule",

this   House  affirms  and  declares  that  the  first

objective of all true patriots of Malaya is to achieve

the reunification of these two territories in a merger

of  Singapore  with  the Federation  of  Malaya."-(The

Minister for Labour-Inche Ahmad bin Ibrahim).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  I was speaking about citizenship - the  issue

that  is  going  to be the nail in the coffin  of  the

P.A.P.  Unfortunately, although the  vernacular  Press

has  given a fair coverage - and a good coverage - of  the

issue  which is so very important to every  person  in

Singapore,  the  English  Press  has  left  it  almost

completely  out.  I hope in future such  an  important

issue like citizenship would be given decent coverage,

so  that every person in Singapore can see both  sides

of  the  question.  Only  then  can  everybody  decide

properly  the future for himself as well  as  for  the

whole of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw in the papers also, Sir, that they referred to

my mention of the U.M.N.O. Government. Of course, that

was  a  technical error. I really meant  the  Alliance

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the House adjourned yesterday, Sir, I was

quoting  the  Prime Minister on his  clarification  of

citizenship as published in the Straits Times of  26th

October, 1961. The words I quoted read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any Singapore citizen who wishes to live in the

present Federation and become a citizen of the present

Federation  can apply for citizenship of  the  present

Federation under the laws of the present Federation.'



<br><br>I  was  saying,  Sir, this innocent-looking  statement

covered  a  multitude of sins. It means, in the  first

place,  if  a Singapore citizen goes to the Federation

after  the  P.A.P.'s  phoney merger,  he  will  become

disenfranchised and will not be allowed to vote or  to

stand for election in the Federation. Secondly, he can

get  Federal citizenship rights only if he stays there

for  ten  years  in  order to  satisfy  the  necessary

residential qualification, pass a Malay language test,

and must be considered by the Federation Government to

be  of good character. You know what this means,  Sir.

It  means that if you do not agree with the Federation

Government politics, you can go and whistle  for  your

citizenship.  In  short, he will be treated  like  any

alien, although he has a so-called Federal nationality

that  is  supposed to make him equal  to  the  Federal

citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the present moment, so I am

informed,  a Singapore citizen born in Singapore,  and

thereby also a British subject, has the right to  vote

and  stand  for  election if he  goes  to  the  United

Kingdom - the colonial master's country. But - and this is

the irony of it - after the P.A.P.'s phoney merger, even

those who are born here will not have those rights  in

the   Federation - our   so-called   partner.   It    is

humiliating,  Sir,  that under this  phoney  merger  a

Singapore citizen when he goes to the Federation  will

receive  less equality and trust than what he receives

today  in  the  country  of his colonial  master.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the word "phoney" is  indeed  a  gross

understatement in describing this so-called merger  of

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also, Sir, another humiliating fact about

the P.A.P.'s phoney merger; that is, under this phoney

merger,  all  those  persons  who  will  be  born   in

Singapore after the date of this phoney merger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



will  not  become Federal citizens by right of  birth.

This  is something which the P.A.P. has concealed from

our  people  and I challenge the P.A.P. to deny  this.

Perhaps  the Prime Minister would care to clarify  the

earlier   clarification  in  order  to   clarify   his

conscience   for   this  shameful,  disreputable   and

unpardonable betrayal of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, Sir, discuss the differences between the

term  "citizen"  and  "national".  "Citizenship"   and

"nationality" are two distinct concepts. "Citizenship"

expresses the rights of an individual within a  State,

and "nationality" his rights outside the State.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Lawyer baharu!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> When the Prime Minister says that

everyone is going to get something more, he means that

every   Singapore  citizen  is  to  become  a  Federal

national. But what are the rights and privileges of  a

national? The Prime Minister has not been able to give

anything more than the right to a Federal passport. In

fact,  there is really nothing more. I am  not  saying

that the right to a passport is not good, but that  is

what every Singapore citizen today already has. To the

citizen of Singapore, what difference is there whether

or   not  he  possesses  the  same  passport  as   the

Federation  citizen? How many of  our  people  in  the

first  place  can  afford to go  abroad  and  so  need

passports?  Our  workers,  farmers  and  hawkers  earn

hardly  enough  to  keep body and soul  together,  let

alone  have money to go abroad. It would be  different

with the Ministers. I think the Prime Minister must be

getting  quite tired of Cameron Highlands. The Federal

passport  does  not benefit the vast majority  of  our

people  one  wee  bit. It is what  the  Chinese  would

describe as something good to look at but not so  good

to eat.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> How can you eat a passport?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Or is it the intention of the

P.A.P.  Government to deny passports even to Singapore

citizens  in  future? Is it the intention to  restrict

still  further the freedom of travel? The P.A.P. also

says  that  being a Federal national  would  make  the

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



citizen equal to the Federation citizen before the law

and  the courts. But, Sir, this is again something  we

already  possess.  So where is the additional  "more"?

Where  is  the  additional gain? If this  is  a  truly

democratic society, it makes no difference  whether  a

person is a citizen or a non-citizen, a national or  a

non-national,  in  a court of law. One  would  Imagine

that  all persons would be equal before the law  in  a

democratic society, and not just nationals. So what is

so  wonderful about being a national? The  only  other

distinction - and this is the latest development - is that

a  national  may be called up for military service  in

future.  The Prime Minister said that he did not  want

to  confuse  people  with the new phrase  called  "new

Federal  citizen".  This is sheer  sophistry.  If  the

Prime  Minister  did not want to cause  confusion,  he

should  not  have brought in the new word  "national".

The  fact  that after becoming a Federal national  the

Singapore  citizen still has to apply for registration

to  become a Federal citizen is proof enough that what

the people of Singapore are getting is even worse than

second-class   citizenship.  In   fact,   the   P.A.P.

arrangement will mean three types of citizens  as  far

as  Singapore  is concerned. I shall enlarge  on  this

later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This talk of citizen and national reminds me of an

article  I  read  sometime ago, which  rather  vividly

brings out the deception and sleight of hand which  is

being practised by the Prime Minister. The story  says

the Prime Minister takes out a 20-cent piece and a 50-cent  piece.  He  holds up the two coins  showing  the

front  face,  or obverse side, to the people.  And  he

says,  "See the head of Queen Elizabeth II on the  two

coins.  They  are the same. The words on  both  pieces

read  'Queen Elizabeth II' and therefore they are  the

same,  and  equal."  That is what the  Prime  Minister

says.  But  the  Prime Minister  also  has  been  very

cunning.  He has hidden the reverse side of the  coins

which, if read carefully, will tell us that the  coins

are  of  different  denominations. One  is  a  20-cent

piece,  the  other a 50-cent piece. They are  not  the

same,  and  they are not equal. So, Sir, you  can  see

what a smart alec our Prime Minister is.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese proverb which describes this very

accurately  and  picturesquely.  The  Prime  Minister,

according to the proverb, wants to pass fish eyes  for

pearls. Does he hope thus to make everybody satisfied,

everybody happy? Let me quote, Sir, the Straits  Times

of  25th  August. He was talking to the  Deputy  Prime

Minister of the Federation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"We want to make Malaya happy and Singapore happy".

And Mr Lee echoed him, "Everybody happy".'



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Except Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Who is "everybody"? Dare he go to

the country and prove that?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown must

know  that I have already said in this Assembly  many,

many  times that I do not wish to hear voices  raised.

He must remember that. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I apologise, Sir. I shall try and

control  my emotions especially when I conic to  those

parts  which  tell everybody of the base treachery  of

the people sitting opposite.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps if the hon. Member for

Queenstown remembers that he is addressing the  Chair,

he  will  not try and intimidate the Chair by  raising

his  voice. Remember that he is addressing the  Chair,

and not Members opposite.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I shall bear that in mind, Sir. I

would  ask  the  Prime Minister and the  not-so-expert

Minister for Finance to read the Federal Constitution,

Part  II,  pertaining to fundamental liberties.  These

are   the  rights  of  all  persons  resident  in  the

Federation.  They apply equally to citizens  and  non-citizens.  Most of these rights apply  even  to  enemy

aliens. In fact, Article 8 of the Federal Constitution

states - I will quote, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'8 (1).-All persons are equal before the law and

entitled to the equal protection of the law.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Point of order, Mr

Speaker,  Sir. The very next subsection makes  a  very

vital distinction. I would ask him to read it to  this

House - there is a vast distinction where only  citizens

are protected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will read that second

subsection as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(2).-Except as expressly authorised by this

Constitution,  there  shall be no  discrimination  [no

discrimination] against citizens on the ground only of

religion, race, descent or place of birth in  any  law

or  in  the  appointment to any office  or  employment

under  a public authority or in the administration  of

any  law  relating  to  the  acquisition,  holding  or

disposition   of  property  or  the  establishing   or

carrying   on  of  any  trade,  business,  profession,

vocation or employment.'



<br><br>For  me, Sir, the relevant portion, to a not-so-legal-minded  doctor, is the first one. And you  will  note,

Sir,  it  does  not say all citizens but all  persons,

i.e. whether  they are citizens or  non-citizens.  So

what does this equality before the courts mean to  the

ordinary  man in the street? It means that  before  he

can  become  recognised as an equal under  the  P.A.P.

merger,  he  must  first be arrested  and  brought  to

court. Sir, we -



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

What is all this about? I do not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Only people like the Minister for

Health  and Law who expect to be arrested sometime  or

other -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> By whom?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - will find the the need for

such  protection. The rest of us, who are  all  peace-loving  and  law-abiding citizens and who  will  never

have  the misfortune to be brought to a court of  law,

do  not want such equality. We want equality, not just

inside  the court but outside the court as well.  That

is  what we mean by "equality". The concept of Federal

national   could   have  very   little   meaning   and

significance within the Federation. What really counts

in the Federation is citizenship, and there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



would  at least be two types of citizenship under  the

P.A.P.'s  type  of  merger,  i.e. a  Federal  and   a

Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore citizen, under such an arrangement as

we  are  told, will only be able to vote in Singapore.

The  Federal citizen, on the other hand, will vote  in

the  Federation.  In other words, a Singapore  citizen

who goes to the Federation after this so-called merger

will  automatically become disenfranchised. What  sort

of  a merger is this when a citizen of one part in one

identity  is treated like an alien when he steps  into

the  other part in the same identity? What sort  of  a

unification  of  our  people is this,  when  Singapore

citizens will possess separate citizenship rights  and

will not be able to share a common political life  and

destiny with the citizens in the Federation? Under the

P.A.P.'s   so-called  merger,  without   this   common

political  life  and destiny with the  people  of  the

Federation, the people of Singapore will not  be  able

to  give  expression to and obtain redress  for  their

grievances   and   aspirations  through   the   normal

democratic channels.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the Member

for Queenstown does realise that he has been repeating

that  sentiment  time and time again.  I  know  it  is

difficult  perhaps when dealing with three motions  at

the  same time, but he must so reorientate his  speech

that  there should not be any repetition as far as  it

can be helped. We have a Standing Order which is aimed

at  trying to cut the debate short. I had better  read

that Standing Order for the benefit of all Members:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'54. The Speaker or the Chairman, after having drawn

attention to the conduct of a Member, who persists  in

irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of  his  own

arguments or of the arguments used by other Members in

debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech.'



<br><br>But  I will not say that the repetition up to now  has

reached  the stage of being tedious. Anyway,  I  think

that  Standing Order should be borne in  mind  by  all

Members of the Assembly when they make their speeches.

Dr Lee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is unavoidable that there

must  be some repetition in places, because facts have

to  be  brought  out at every stage to  prove  certain

points;  and  if they are not brought out again,  then

the  whole relevance and the whole emphasis  is  lost.

You   will  appreciate  my  difficulty,  Sir,  and   I

understand your impatience too about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying, Sir, that while the people in the

Federation  can  interfere with  the  affairs  of  the

people    of   Singapore,   through   the   Federation

Government, the people of Singapore will not have  the

full  democratic  right to inform  and  influence  the

people  of  the Federation. The only contact  we  will

have  with the people in the Federation under  such  a

treacherous arrangement will be through the few  token

representatives  from  Singapore  in  the   Federation

legislature.  Under this phoney merger  with  separate

citizenship,  the  people of Singapore  will  be  kept

politically   isolated  from   the   people   of   the

Federation. We in Singapore will be treated as  though

we  are  suffering from some infectious  disease  that

requires  us  to  be permanently segregated  from  the

people  of the Federation, because we will not possess

Federation  citizenship under this phoney merger.  All

Singaporeans  who  do  not see eye  to  eye  with  the

Federation  Government  can be conveniently  prevented

from  crossing the Causeway. Already, Sir, we have  an

outstanding example almost staring us in the face. The

Federation  Government  has debarred  permanently  one

Inche   Said   Zahari,  prominent  Malay  citizen   of

Singapore  and  a former editor of the Utusan  Melayu,

from  entering  the  Federation.  The  Prime  Minister

touched  on Said Zahari's case only a couple  of  days

ago. Inche Said Zahari, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot allow the Member for

Queenstown to go into the details of that case. It has

nothing  to  do  with this particular problem  we  are

discussing.  He  can just mention  it  in  passing  as

illustrative of an allegation he has made.  But  I  do

not think he should go into details.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am not going into details, Sir.

I just want to bring out the point, Sir, that although

Inche Said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



Zahari  is  a  son  of the soil, but just  because  he

happens   to  hold  different  political  views - views

different from those held by the politicians  who  are

in  power in the Federation - he has, therefore,  been

debarred from entering the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must not make

statements like that unless he can substantiate  them.

If  he  can do so, then, of course, he is entitled  to

make  that  statement. If he cannot  substantiate  it,

then  he  might  find  himself  guilty  of  abuse   of

privilege.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway. Sir, that proves the

point,  that  people from Singapore can  be  prevented

from   going   into   the  Federation.   Under   these

circumstances,  how can anyone say  that  there  is  a

bringing-together   of  the   peoples   of   the   two

territories? What sort of merger then is this?  It  is

like   telling   the  people,  say,   of   Mountbatten

constituency or Farrer Park constituency that they are

not fit to share a common citizenship with the rest of

the  people  of  Singapore;  that  they  must  have  a

separate citizenship; that they can vote and stand for

election  only in their own constituencies; that  they

cannot  come  out  and  campaign  outside  their   own

constituencies; and that if they wish to vote  outside

their  own constituencies they must re-apply all  over

again for the citizenship right possessed by the  rest

of  the people of Singapore. I am sure the Member  for

Farrer  Park and the Member for Mount-batten will  not

relish  things  like  this. How would  the  people  of

Mountbatten feel if they were to be treated like this?

But this is precisely how the people of Singapore will

be  treated  if the P.A.P.'s phoney merger  is  pushed

through. They will be treated as second-rate citizens.

First  segregated, then devitalised and throttled.  In

fact, the Prime Minister's merger amounts to this. All

the people of Malaya, including Singapore, will belong

to  one club, the Federal National Club. This club  is

only a show-case to the outside world, a pretence that

the  people of Malaya and Singapore are united as one.

But,  within  this club is another more important  and

privileged club, the Federal Citizens Club, in which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



all  the citizens of the present eleven States of  the

Federation  will be Members, but from which  Singapore

citizens  will  be  completely excluded.  We  will  be

treated like social outcastes, not fit and not allowed

to  mix  freely as equals with our Federation brothers

across  the Causeway. This exclusive snobbish club  is

reminiscent  of the exclusive Tanglin Club  which  the

Prime Minister was so fond of ridiculing in his former

anti-colonial  days. The Tunku is  prepared  to  throw

open the doors of this exclusive Federal Citizens Club

also  to the citizens of the three Borneo territories.

But  he  is  not  prepared to open its  doors  to  the

citizens  of  Singapore. On 26th  October,  1961,  the

Tunku  said in the Federal Parliament debate on merger -

I  quote  here,  Sir, from the Straits Times  of  17th

October:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All the states in Malaysia would enjoy equal rights

and  equal status. But because of the special position

of  Singapore as a City state, to my mind, it would be

best if Singapore came in on a partnership basis.'



<br><br>And when elaborating on what he meant by Malaysia, the  Tunku said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What I have in mind is to call such an association

or  Federation of states the Federation  of  Malaysia,

that  is,  all  the Federation of Malaya  states,  the

Borneo  territories and Singapore, in which the states

of Borneo territories and the states of the Federation

of  Malaya join in together as Federation of  Malaysia

and Singapore is joined in partnership -'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It is a point of order, Sir. Could the

Member finish the sentence? It is important, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> "in partnership" - I will just

follow from there, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... on a footing something like that which exists

between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.'



<br><br>Sir,  from  all indications so far, we can  say  that

this  partnership  is  going  to  be  a  very  unequal

partnership.  The Federation of Malaya wants  to  take

the  Borneo  territories as the 12th, 13th,  and  14th

States of the Federation. But Singapore will not  form

the  extra  15th  or 12th if you like,  State  of  the

Federation. Singapore will only go in as a partner,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



In  other words, the Borneo territories will truly  be

integrated with the Federation of Malaya to  form  the

Federation  of Malaysia. But Singapore  will  be  kept

away. Why?



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b> Too

many Communists.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why have we to be segregated

instead?  Has the Member for Geylang Serai  small-pox,

or  have all the people of Singapore smallpox? Are  we

going   in  as  an  equal  constituent  unit  of   the

Federation? No. Are we having a merger of the peoples?

No.  And are we, under the so-called socialists on the

other  side, Sir, expediting the progress of socialism

in  Malaya? Again, no. Yet, all along, the P.A.P. has

been    saying   that   the   present   constitutional

arrangement is merger. In fact, the Federation may  be

likened  to a man getting ready to take on a first,  a

second  and  a third wife. These three wives  are  the

three  States  in  the  Borneo  territories.  All  the

children,   that  is,  the  citizens,  are  legitimate

children with equal rights to the family estate and to

the   use   of  family  property,  namely,  Federation

citizenship. But Singapore is going to be taken in not

as  a fourth wife but only as a mistress, and all  the

children  of this mistress are going to be treated  as

illegitimate  children with no rights  to  the  family

estate  or  to  the  use of family property,  that  is

Federation citizenship. Poor Singapore citizens!  They

are   all   going   to  be  treated   like   bastards,

illegitimate  children  with  no  Federal  citizenship

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Acting Prime Minister in his letter to the Opposition Leaders on 6-9-61 says - I will quote, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the letter from the Deputy Prime Minister to me as Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis. The relevant words are here, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The only difference between Singapore and any one

of  the  other States in the Federation is that  there

will  be  more powers reserved to the Singapore  State

Government.'



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is correct.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Is this true, Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is correct. These are the

heads of agreement.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No. Is Singapore, just like

Johore  or  Selangor, really a part of the Federation?

No. Can a person from Singapore stand for election  in

Kuala Lumpur for example, just like a person from Ipoh

or  Seremban? No. Is there complete freedom of  travel

between  Singapore and the Federation just as  amongst

other States in the Federation? Again no. Then why did

the Acting Prime Minister deliberately mislead us? Why

the  deliberate misrepresentation? Why  this  game  of

bluff? Dr Toh says -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, Sir. He has just quoted me

from  a letter and the relevant portion has been  read

out.  Now,  he  has  used  that  little  paragraph  to

misconstrue what I said in there, and that I  intended

to  mislead him. I think there is provision under  the

Standing  Orders  that no imputation  should  be  made

against a Member.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot see any imputation up to this

stage.  But  if the point is that other parts  of  the

letter would throw a little more light on the subject,

then I think the Member for Queenstown should read the

whole  letter. Perhaps he should read the whole letter

and  we will see whether there will be any more  light

shed on the topic.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If you would like me to read the

whole letter. I could. Sir, but I do not think -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please do.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Here is the letter from the

Acting Prime Minister, Singapore, dated 6th September,

1961, addressed  to  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,  Chairman,

Barisan Sosialis. Singapore.

<pre>

'Dear Dr Lee,



 I  have  received replies to my letter  of  the  26th

August  from  leaders  of the four  political  Parties

represented  in  the Legislative Assembly.  I  enclose

herewith copies of their replies for your reference. I

must  point out that my letter of the 26th August  was

prompted by

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



the  statements made in the Press by Opposition  Party

leaders,  some  asking for an All-Party conference  in

order  that their views may he heard. If an  All-Party

conference is to he of value to assist and  guide  the

Government  in its deliberations on the constitutional

arrangements  for merger, there must be  unanimity  on

the  main  points. It is clear from the  replies  that

there  is  no agreement on the main points  among  the

political Parties in the Opposition, although all  are

forced  by  circumstances and the pressure  of  public

opinion to pay lip service to the principle of merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had raised two points upon which I sought explicit

clarification  of the stand of cacti political  Party.

Do  you  agree  that  in the merger  arrangements  (1)

Defence, External Affairs and Security come under  the

control  of  the Central Government? (Point considered

basic  by the Federation). (2) Singapore should  retain

autonomy  on  Education and Labour? (Point  considered

essential by the Singapore Government). In none of the

replies  is there any answer to these two points.  All

Parties have chosen to evade these two points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective stands of the four political Parties

in the Assembly are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Barisan Sosialis stand for complete merger as a

12th State on the basis of Penang and Malacca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its second preference is for confederation between

Singapore  and  the Federation and the  three  Borneo

territories  in  which Defence and  External  Affairs

excluding  Security  go  to the  Central  Government.

Security is to remain a subject for local autonomy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Alliance of S.P.A., U.M.N.O., M.C.A.. M.I.C

gives  no  answer, but raises a query as  to  whether

the   arrangements   amount  to   a   merger   or   a

confederation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) United People's Party stand for complete merger

as a State of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Workers' Party wholeheartedly believes in

merger    with    the   Federation   and    considers

confederation a very valuable concept.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must point out that complete merger means that

both point (1) External Affairs and Security and point

(2) Education and labour will all be under the control

of the Central Government. Since most Opposition Party

leaders  in  the Assembly propose complete  merger  as

their   first   objective,  if  I  get  a  categorical

assurance from Opposition Political Parties that  they

will  ask their followers to support complete  merger,

the  Government  is prepared to put  forward  complete

merger   as  an  alternative  basis  for  negotiations

between Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. believes that it represents the wishes of

the  majority of people in Singapore in insisting that

Education  and Labour should he under local  autonomy.

However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



we  are prepared to follow the will of the people,  if

it  is  the  majority wish that Education  and  Labour

should also be under Central Government control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I point out that 42 out of the 51 Assemblymen

today  were  elected in 1959 on a  P.A.P. ticket.  Of

these  42,  16 have broken away - 13 now in the  Barisan

Sosialis  and three in the United People's Party.  All

P.A.P. candidates  who  contested  the  1959  general

elections signed a pledge in April 1959 in which  they

categorically pledged to support the policy of  merger

between the Federation and Singapore as set out in the

Central Executive Committee statement published in the 1958

Fourth Anniversary Souvenir number."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with quotations. Do I read all this also, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the point that the Leader of

the  House was making is that the quotation taken  out

of  context  might  not  indicate  what  is  its  real

meaning.  Perhaps  if the hon. Member - I  do  not  know

whether this is another lengthy -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a very lengthy quotation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps if the hon. Member will come to

the relevant passage from where his quotation came.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The only relevant part was the

part  I  quoted,  Sir.  Well, this  is  more  or  less

relevant. I will read this part - a small part will do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In order to clarify the position, may I briefly

explain   [this   is  Dr  Toh's  letter]   that   the

arrangements between Singapore and the Federation  are

those  of a merger as a State of the Federation.  They

do  not constitute a confederation. A confederation is

an  association of independent States and no  citizens

of a constituent State vote for representatives direct

to the central confederation government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our arrangements amount to merger because the people

of  Singapore  will  be voting representatives  direct

into  the  Federal  Parliament.  The  only  difference

[these  are  the words I used, Sir] between  Singapore

and  any one of the other States in the Federation  is

that  there  will  be  more  powers  reserved  to  the

Singapore State Government.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is good enough already, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is quite correct, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Correct? I do not have to read

some more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard all that, Sir, when We all know the

present  state  is entirely different  from  what  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister has been  trying  to  make  us

believe, can we ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether

he thinks he can fool the people all the time?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I do not want to fool anybody.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Under those circumstances, Sir,

are  we  not  justified in calling  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister - I would like to use the word, Sir, but -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do not use it!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - a liar. That is the word, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown must not be deliberately unparliamentary and then hope that the Speaker will just ask him to withdraw that word and not take any further action. I will not allow any deliberate use of any unparliamentary word. That is a deliberate use of an unparliamentary word and an attempt has been made to disguise it. I will not countenance any such attempt in future.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I apologise, Sir, and I withdraw

that word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Federation Government can

justly  boast  of a proud record in its fight  against

the apartheid policy in South Africa.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And the Tunku has stood out

prominently  in  this noble endeavour to  restore  the

dignity  and  self-respect of the black man  in  South

Africa.  We  earnestly hope that the Tunku  above  all

others  will  not impose on Singapore a constitutional

setup  that  smacks  heavily  of  apartheid.  We  have

already  warned  that the P.A.P.'s so-called  "merger"

proposals, if bulldozed through, will provide  fertile

grounds  for communal politicians to thrive  upon.  It

may lead to a disastrous disruption of the harmony and

unity  of  our people. We have repeatedly appealed  to

all those who sincerely believe in harmony amongst our

people  to carefully ponder over this. Let all  decent

people realise the extremely dangerous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



situation  that desperate politicians  in  the

P.A.P. are bringing upon our people in their  attempt

to salvage their own political future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go on to discuss representation in the

Federal  Parliament,  let  me  touch  briefly  on  the

relationship between Northern Ireland and the U.K.  As

I  have just quoted a little while back, there is this

proposal that Singapore should join the Federation  in

more  or less the same partnership as Northern Ireland

did  with Great Britain. Sir, a brief review of  Irish

history  is  essential  in our  understanding  of  the

problem.  Let us hope we may learn a lesson  from  the

history  of  Ireland.  Let the history  of  the  Irish

struggle   first   for  home  rule   and   later   for

independence  be a lesson to the rulers of  one  State

who  try  to impose their will upon another. For  this

was  exactly what happened between England and Ireland

in  1801 when Ireland was incorporated into the Union

of  Great Britain and Ireland. The arguments given  by

British  apologetics  in favour  of  this  union  were

significantly economic. Ireland, they said,  would  be

ensured  the  happiness, prosperity and welfare  which

prevailed in England. What more could she desire  when

she  was  united  to  one  of  the  most  progressive,

prosperous  and  enlightened countries  in  the  whole

world?  But the manner in which this was achieved  was

characteristically undemocratic. The vote  was  bought

by open bribery of those who had the right to vote. In

Singapore, we are seeing the same thing happening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Open bribery.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P. is receiving, in

return  for the betrayal of the people, the protection

of the Federation Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later historians revealed that the real objective

behind  the  union  in  1801 was England's  desire  to

protect   her  flank  from  the  threat  of  invasion.

Nevertheless, it was easy enough for the Englishman to

be  taken  in by this myth, and it was not  until  one

century later that the Irish finally forced a truce on

England and freed themselves from this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



yoke. The Irish national struggle was long, bitter and

costly. Throughout the 19th century, the Irish leaders

confined  themselves to manoeuvres within the  English

Parliament hoping to achieve their objectives  of  the

repeal  of the union by this way. These Irish  Members

of  Parliament first allied themselves with the  Whigs

and then with the Liberals in the House of Commons who

in  the last analysis proved weak and unreliable.  But

what  was  worse  was that this policy only  increased

English  political  activities  in  Ireland,  and  the

English  policies  cost  Ireland  dear.  It  made  the

partition  between  Ulster, that is  Northern  Ireland

today,  and  the Irish Free State possible.  When  the

Irish  at last realised the incapacity of the  English

Parliament to solve the Irish question, they began  to

organise themselves for a final showdown with England.

The name of their new organisation - I do not know how

it  is  pronounced - Sinn Fein  was  significant.  It

means,  I am told, "We ourselves" [Interruption].  The

spelling  of Sinn Fein is S-i-n-n F-e-i-n.  They  were

determined to achieve independence through  their  own

efforts.  During  the  First  World  War,  the   Irish

Parliamentary Group accepted the postponement of  home

rule  as  inevitable. The Sinn Fein Group  seized  the

opportunity when England was at war to stage a rising.

Though their rising failed and there were mass arrests

and executions of the Sinn Fein leaders by the British

Government,  it  only  helped  to  bring   them   more

supporters.   In  the  1918  General   Election   held

immediately  after  the  war,  Sinn  Fein   scored   a

resounding victory. Thereupon they proclaimed  to  the

world   independence   for  Ireland.   England   tried

suppression  by  force, and guerilla  war  in  Ireland

broke out.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest that the Member

for  Queenstown  come  down  to  what  we  are  really

interested    in - that   is,   the   constitutional

arrangements  between  Northern  Ireland   and   Great

Britain?  All this historical reference might  perhaps

encourage that same thing in Singapore - I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



know.  Let us try not to encourage that sort of thing

in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am not going to touch on the

constitutional  arrangements, Sir. I  merely  want  to

bring  up  one point, that the history of  this  Irish

struggle   should  provide  a  very  good  lesson   to

Singapore and the bankrupt politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What lesson?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They should learn from history

and  not  repeat the same mistakes and  blunders  that

have  taken place in other parts of the world.  If  we

want to take anything as an example, we must bring  up

the best and not follow the worst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between the social and political

conditions in Singapore and the Federation  remind  us

strongly  of  the position of Ireland with  regard  to

England. If the Government in the Federation have  the

same  motive for merger as England had for the  union,

if   they  think  they  could  coerce  the  people  of

Singapore  into  subjugation, it  is  well  that  they

should learn the lesson from Irish history. Let no one

attempt  to impose a situation in Singapore that  will

lead to the permanent division of our peoples.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Is there any more?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> About 15 pages more!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Now, Sir, let me come to discuss

representation.  I  have here a copy  of  the  Straits

Times  of Monday, 20th November, and I quote just  one

paragraph, Sir. This is a Press interview given by the

Prime Minister:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In a complete merger, Mr Lee said, 284,000 out of

the  624,000  Singapore citizens  would  automatically

qualify  for citizenship under the present citizenship

laws  of  the  Federation.  And  they  would  send  14

representatives to the Central Parliament.'



<br><br>Let  us  just do a bit of arithmetic, Sir,If  284,000

possible  citizens  can give us 14 representatives  in

this P.A.P.-type of phoney merger, then, in a complete

merger   in  the  position  where  every  citizen   of

Singapore becomes a citizen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Federation,  when 624,000 Singapore  citizens

become  624,000 Federation citizens, simple arithmetic

will  give  us  30  seats in the  Federal  Parliament.

Therefore it is not 14.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, let us now examine how the P.A.P.

hopes  to  hoodwink  the  people  of  Singapore   into

accepting less -



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> On a

point of order, Sir. Surely the Member for Queenstown,

in  making  reference to 240,000 citizens of Singapore

who would automatically become Federation citizens, is

speaking  of  the  Penang type of  merger.  He  should

therefore disclose the full facts and not try  to  say

that   the   624,000  Singapore  citizens  who   would

automatically become Federation citizens - according  to

the Barisan Sosialis pattern - would produce 30 seats.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the point of order is once

again  that the quotation from the paper is not quoted

completely. Is that the point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Queenstown then

please read the whole quotation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, it is one full page of it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Speaker would

like  to be caught again as he was with the letter.  I

think  the  Minister is entitled to the whole  passage

from  which  the quotation has come. The  hon.  Member

should read the passage or a paragraph from which  the

quotation has come.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The whole paragraph, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of the Straits Times handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In fairness to the House, not only

should  that paragraph be read but also the  following

two paragraphs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The two paragraphs read as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Johore , with 291,000 citizens, was entitled to 14

seats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the remaining 340,000 present Singapore

citizens,  who were not horn in Singapore, would  have

to  apply for citizenship under the present system  in

the Federation (which calls for eight years' residence

out of 12 years plus knowledge of Malay and so on).'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member complete that

paragraph?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is actually a new paragraph,

Sir, but I will read on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Statistically worked out, the proportion of those

in   the   Federation  who  had  obtained  citizenship

although  not  born there would come up to  one-third,

Mr Lee added.'



<br><br>Now, can I proceed, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the point really is, if

a  quotation is to be made from a newspaper or from  a

book,  then  hon.  Members must be  careful  that  the

quotation  is not taken out of context and so  bear  a

meaning  which it would not bear if the whole  of  the

context  is read. I do not say that that has  happened

up to now, but it is only a precaution. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I have always taken that

precaution also, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine how the P.A.P. hopes to hoodwink

the  people  of  Singapore into  accepting  less  than

proportionate    representation   in    the    Federal

Parliament.  First,  I wish to  point  out  that  with

complete  merger, when all 624,000 Singapore  citizens

will  become  624,000 Federal citizens  and  therefore

become   entitled   to  the  right  of   proportionate

representation  in  the Federal Parliament,  Singapore

will  have  about one-quarter to one-third  the  total

number  of  representatives  in  the  present  Federal

Parliament.  That is, Singapore will have  between  25

and   30 - I  worked  it  out  to  30  a  little   while

ago - representatives in a Federal Parliament of 100. If

we  work  on  the present number of 104,  it  will  be

slightly  more. Under the P.A.P.'s type of merger, we

will  be  getting only 15, that is, at least  10  less

than  what  we  are entitled to. Let us  see  how  the

P.A.P. tries to justify this sell-out of our people's

democratic rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first P.A.P. justification is the myth that

large  numbers of Singapore citizens do not  have  the

necessary residential qualifications for Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



citizenship.  I will quote the Straits Times  of  27th

October, Sir, (this is one full paragraph):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The number of representatives Singapore citizens

can vote for into the new Federation Parliament cannot

exceed the number which Singapore would he entitled to

if  there  were  complete merger  like  Penang  as  in

Proposal "A".'



<br><br>That  is the complete paragraph. In the same issue  of

the  Straits  Times, the Prime Minister also  repeated

the  bluff  that in complete merger only - if  I  quote

from  this  newspaper,  then the  figure  is  slightly

wrong; it was 323,000 and now they have changed it  to

284,000; that is quite typical of the P.A.P. They give

different  figures at different times just to  confuse

the people. I will quote the relevant new figures.  In

only -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is quoting

from  a  paper, he must quote from the paper,  whether

the figures are right or wrong, and then say how those

figures are wrong in his estimation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'... 323,000 Singapore citizens born in Singapore

could automatically qualify in this way if we ask  for

complete merger like Penang.'



<br><br>The  323,000 today would become 284,000. Those 327,000

(now  the figure has become 340,000) who were not born

here  will have to apply for Federal citizenship. And,

of  course, the Prime Minister tried to put  a  fright

into  them by saying that only about 100,000 of  these

327,000  (as  the figure then quoted)  would  probably

qualify.  The figure today would be, Sir,  110,000  of

the 340,000. These figures are very confusing, Sir, so

let  us  leave the figures out for a little while.  In

other  words, what the Prime Minister wanted  to  say,

but  did not say in so many words, was that the number

of   representatives  Singapore  will  vote   to   the

Federation Parliament, if they can really vote,  under

the  phoney  merger,  would not be  based  op  624,000

Singapore  citizens  but  will  he  based  on  340,000

Singapore  citizens born here, plus  110,000  whom  he

assumed  would  have the necessary qualifications  for

Federal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



citizenship, making a total of about 400,000.  To  put

it  in  another way. Under the P.A.P.'s phoney merger,

although all 624,000 Singapore citizens will become so-called Federal nationals, and who are all supposed  to

have  equal  rights with the Federation citizens,  the

number  of representatives we will have in the Federal

Parliament  will  not be calculated on  the  basis  of

these  624,000 nationals, but on the basis of  400,000

Singapore  citizens who are considered  by  the  Prime

Minister   to  be  fit  to  become  Federal  citizens.

Calculated  on this basis, Singapore would  only  have

about two-thirds of the representation it should  have

got.  And  that is why the Prime Minister  said  in  a

Press interview on the 19th that Singapore should  get

about 19 seats - two-thirds of 30. I know, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  all  this sounds very complicated, but  this  is

exactly  the  situation posed by the  P.A.P.'s  phoney

merger. Utter confusion - all deliberately built up  by

skilful  and cunning misrepresentation on the part  of

the  P.A.P., to bamboozle and befuddle the people into

accepting  their sell-out. So much so that unless  you

read  carefully in between the lines of the statements

made  by this smart alec - you will be completely  taken

in  by  them. Even the Straits Times of 20th November,

1961 says 284,000 will get automatic citizenship. This

is  a very clever and double-twisting way of argument.

On the one hand, they cook up a myth that only 400,000

out  of Singapore's 624,000 citizens would get Federal

citizenship on complete merger. By this they  hope  to

frighten  and  dissuade our people  from  demanding  a

complete  merger. On the other hand, they  apply  this

same myth to their phoney merger to justify their non-proportionate  representation. This is a  very  clever

double use of a myth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I really regret that such evident

ingenuity, that such evident, mental acrobatics of the

P.A.P. could not have been put to better use for  the

service of our people. But this is not the end of  the

story.  The  P.A.P. has yet another justification  for

cutting  down  Singapore's meagre representation  even

further.  Let  me  quote the Prime Minister  again  as

reported in the Straits Times of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



27th  October, 1961 (I will quote one full  paragraph,

Sir):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The fact, that unlike the other States in the new

Federation,   Singapore  will  keep   a   considerable

proportion  of  her revenue for the discharge  of  her

responsibilities  in  education,  labour  and  several

other  subjects  of  local  autonomy,  must  also   be

considered    in   deciding   on   the    number    of

representatives for the new Federation Parliament.'



<br><br>In  other  words,  the  P.A.P. is  using  the  phoney

autonomy  over labour and education as another  excuse

to   cut   down   even  further  our  already   meagre

representation in the Federal Parliament. And we  say,

"phoney autonomy", because autonomy over any matter is

completely  meaningless when internal security  is  in

the hands of a government completely unsympathetic  to

our  policies on these matters. As I have pointed  out

elsewhere, the P.A.P. are trying to make believe  that

because  they are preserving autonomy over labour  and

education,   we   must  therefore   have   less   than

proportionate    representation   in    the    Federal

Parliament.  In  fact, we know it  is  the  other  way

round.  The fact is that the Federation Government  is

prepared  to  take  in Singapore  today  only  if  our

political  influence is kept to the minimum  possible.

That  is,  only  if  we are politically  isolated  and

without  proportionate representation, it is  to  make

this   lack   of  proportionate  representation   look

acceptable  to  us that the Federation  Government  is

giving  us as sops this apparent autonomy over  labour

and  education. The Federation is only  interested  in

the control of our internal security. From the tone of

the recent debate on merger in the Federal Parliament,

it is clear to all that the Federation Government just

cannot  he  bothered with the internal  administrative

problem  of  Singapore  other than  that  of  internal

security.  So the P.A.P. has to try to cover  up  this

humiliating  situation with all sorts of  evil  tricks

and  subterfuges. But from the issue of representation

in  the Federal Parliament, we discover how the  Prime

Minister  has  tried to give the people  of  Singapore

three  types of citizenship rights, thereby  creating,

in  fact  but not in name, three classes of  citizens.

First,   the   first-class  citizen  with  first-class

citizenship  rights  is the Federal  citizen.  He  has

voting rights in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation  and he can stand as a  candidate  for

election in any part of the Federation. Of course,  he

can  elect  representatives to the Federal Parliament.

To  this group of first-class citizens belong all  the

existing Federal citizens in the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the second-class citizen with second-class

citizenship  rights is the Singapore citizen  who  was

born  in  Singapore. He has voting rights in Singapore

only. He can also stand as a candidate for election in

any part of Singapore. Theoretically, he is considered

to  have  the  qualifications to be  registered  as  a

Federal  citizen.  And because of  this  he  would  be

entitled   to  have  representation  in  the   Federal

Parliament.   This  group  of  second-class   citizens

numbers  284,000. That is slightly less than half  the

present number of citizens of Singapore. That  is  how

the Prime Minister worked out the 14 representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the third-class. The third class of

citizens  with third-class citizenship rights  is  the

Singapore citizen who was not born in Singapore. He is

the  Singapore citizen who was born in the Federation,

India, China, the United Kingdom and the Colonies.  He

has  voting rights confined to Singapore only. He  can

stand  as  a  candidate for election in  any  part  of

Singapore.  But - and  this is  very  important,  Sir - he

would not be considered to have the qualifications  to

be  registered  as a Federal citizen. And  because  of

this,  he  would not be entitled to representation  in

the  Federal  Parliament. This group  of  third-class,

citizens numbers 340,000 - more than half' the number of

citizens  in Singapore. I wonder if the Prime Minister

can see what he is doing. Is he so blind that he: does

not see that this will lead to a lot of unhappiness?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. has said: Merger means merger of peoples.

I  would like to ask the Prime Minister if this is the

merger  of  the  peoples. How  does  division  of  the

peoples  into  different  classes  of  citizens,  with

different  classes  of  citizenship  rights,  lead  to

national   unity?   Will  not  this  segregation   and

isolation  of the people of Singapore from the  people

of the Federation lead instead to a further widening



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



of  the differences that exist? How can we say in  the

P.A.P. brand of Tipu orang merger that Singapore  will

form an integrated part of the new Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister said that "our arrangements amount to merger because the people of Singapore will be voting representatives direct into the Federal Parliament." I would like to ask him once more. Does he think he can fool the people all the time? Sir, this is not merger. I think you also

will  probably agree with us that it is only a phoney

and a sell-out. It is not -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I had better make it

quite  clear  that the Speaker should  not  be  drawn

into this controversy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I would not like to involve the

Chair,  Sir.  But anybody in his senses  listening  to

this  will have to agree with us that it is  a  phoney

and a sell-out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not a thing a socialist

will  want. It is not the deed of a man who  professes

to  go towards the goal of an egalitarian society.  It

is  not a deed of a true Malayan patriot. No, Sir. It

is  a  deed of a traitor to the people. It is  a  pity

that  the Prime Minister is not here. I would like  to

urge  him  once more - turn back while there  is  still

time. Let him turn back before the curse of all'  true

Malayans, the  curse  of  their  children  and  their

children's children, be on him.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He is not worried!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, knowing that this humbug

merger  will  not get the support of the  people,  the

Prime  Minister has taken great pains to explain  that

the  various sectional interests are looked after. But

all  these sectional interests which are listed in the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech are things we already

enjoy at present. The Chinese parents and the Chinese-educated,  the  workers, the businessmen,  contractors

and bus companies, merchants, a whole lot of them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What about the English-educated?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All are enjoying whatever rights

they  now have. They do not have to have merger before

they  can  have these rights. Neither will  they  lose

these  rights  if  there is no merger.  If  the  Prime

Minister wants to tell the people that he is concerned

about  their  welfare, then merely safeguarding  their

interests  will  not  be  enough,  because  under  any

circumstances their interests must be safeguarded  and

preserved.  But  the  Prime  Minister  should   exert

himself  a  little  more and ask - how  are  all  these

interests  and rights promoted, expanded and  advanced

with  merger?  Since  he  has  forgotten  this  highly

important  aspect, let us try and help him  with  some

questions.  Such as, what can the civil  service  gain

with  merger? That is what we would like to know.  For

example, can the civil servants get more opportunities

for  promotion in a wider service under the same terms

now existing or on improved and better terms? Will the

terms  and  conditions  of  service  be  improved  and

bettered? Will promotion be accelerated? Sir, the past

derogatory  attitude of the P.A.P. leadership  towards

the  civil service is well known. In 1959, during  the

first session, soon after the arbitrary imposition  of

pay cuts, the Prime Minister said this - volume 11, No.

6, column 368:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I say to the Civil Service and their present rather

inept leaders who have begun what they believe to be a

revolutionary movement against the Government, that lf

nothing  else more catastrophic happens to  them  than

the  loss  of  allowances in the top brackets  of  the

Civil  Service, and the fact that they  have  to  face

fiercer  competition  from  the  non-English  educated

members  of the service, then they should go  down  on

their bended knees and thank the Gods that their souls

have been spared.'



<br><br>Now, hoping to pacify the civil servants and hoping to

buy  their  votes, the discredited leadership  of  the

P.A.P. restored the pay cuts.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I just want to avoid the danger

of  our  entering into a debate on the restoration  of

the   pay   cuts  on  this  particular   motion.   The

restoration of pay cuts, I take it, will be debated at

length during the Committee of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



Supply or on some other occasion. But let us not enter

into  a debate on the restoration of pay cuts on these

motions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I only want to mention that the

P.A.P. makes  this  restoration  of   pay   cuts   a

condition.  They link it up with their phoney  merger

proposals, Sir, because they say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'with merger now in prospect it is possible to relax

many of the stringent measures adopted.'



<br><br>I think this is sheer hypocrisy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown has

been  straying  on the border line for  some  time  on

unparliamentary  words. But I have  always  disallowed

the  word "hypocrisy" if used in relation to a  Member

of  this Assembly. Therefore, I think the hon.  Member

should withdraw the word.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw that word, Sir. Very

dishonest behaviour, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown is

still forgetting himself. I do not think he should, in

this  context  anyway, use the words  "very  dishonest

behaviour".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A very bad excuse, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All I want is a withdrawal of

unparliamentary  words, and I do not  think  I  should

allow even a substitution at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw, Sir. I would ask

them:  Why do they not just speak the truth and  shame

the  devil, because what has this restoration  of  pay

cuts to do with merger anyway? Surely they do not hope

that they may fool the civil servants all the time? At

the  present moment, what I would like to ask is this:

Who  is going down on bended knees and who is thanking

the Gods that their souls have been spared?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also says that the businessmen, contractors and bus companies want a merger under conditions in which priority for tenders and licences

will be as before. Of course -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That appears to be a quotation from the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. If that is so, then I

do not think the Member for Queenstown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



is  entitled to say that the Prime Minister says that.

It is the policy speech of the Government as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech   which   was  delivered  on  behalf   of   the

Government, Sir. Does the Government then suppose that

these  sectional  interests  will  expect  less?  That

should  be the minimum demand. But they will  ask  the

Government,  and  the Prime Minister  specially,  what

additional  benefits will they get with  merger?  Will

they  get the same opportunities for business  in  the

Federation as in Singapore? Will the bus companies  be

allowed  to  operate  freely  on  new  routes  in  the

Federation?   And  if  allowed,  will  Singapore   bus

companies  be  treated equally as others and  provided

with  equal  facilities? So you see,  Sir,  by  merely

saying that certain rights will be safeguarded is  not

of  much  use,  because  these rights  are  rights  we

already  have.  What we want are  more  rights, more

facilities,  and equality with merger. Otherwise,  how

can merger be of benefit to the people of Singapore? I

think the Prime Minister will have to try another line

if  he  wants  to fish for support for  his  so-called

merger proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has also once said that no one is

going to lose his citizenship; no one is going to lose

any  of  the rights he has got. 'To that again I  say:

"of  course."  Is there anything he can boast  of  and

crow  about?  For  the  greater majority,  the  P.A.P.

proposal is the end of the road for more rights.  They

will  forever  remain third-class  citizens.  But  the

Prime   Minister  added,  "Everyone  will  be  getting

something  more." How nice. But let us ask  him  what

this  "something more" is. I have publicly posed  many

questions to the P.A.P. before on citizenship as  well

as  on  other issues, but have not received any  reply

from them so far. I wish to pose these questions again

in  this  Assembly and let us hope they will have  the

guts  to answer them this time. Let them answer  these

questions in clear-cut categorical terms and not in  a

flood of meaningless verbal diarrhoea.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Will Singapore citizens be able to apply for jobs

direct  into  the Federation Government services  like

other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



citizens  from  the  Federation, or  will  they   be

discriminated  against  just  because  they  are   not

Federal citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Will the products of Singapore schools and

universities  be  treated on the same  footing  as

their Federation counterparts when they apply  for jobs in the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Will Singapore citizens be able to move

freely  or  enter  or leave the Federation  freely without any restriction?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Will Singapore citizens have full freedom of

speech and expression in the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Will students from Singapore schools and

universities, particularly Nanyang University, have the right to travel freely in the Federation, inter-mingle with the Federation students, and participate

in the student movements in the Federation, without

discrimination if they are not Federal citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Will the workers of Singapore be able to

apply  for  jobs  in the Federation  on  an  equal

footing with Federal citizens?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Will the workers of Singapore be allowed to

join the trade unions in the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Will the workers of Singapore and the

Federation  be  allowed to form pan Malayan  trade

unions  so  that  they can unite  and  strengthen

their  organisation in their struggle  to  improve

their livelihood?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Will the businessmen in Singapore have equal

rights    and    opportunities    as    Federation

businessmen  if they choose to do their  business

in the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Will their lack of Federation citizenship be

a discriminating factor if they apply for business

licences, etc.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Government answer all these questions. Let

the  truth be out. Let us not try to cover up all  the

ugly  facts.  Let  there be no more  bluff.  Let  the

people know all there is to know. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



have  the  right to know the truth. In spite  of  all

their  unprincipled propaganda over  Radio  Singapore,

using  civil  servants as mouthpieces, let  the  Prime

Minister tell the people how this special type of sell-out merger is good for Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. The Member for Queenstown

has  just  now alleged that civil servants  have  been

improperly used, or are themselves improperly  engaged

in  political  activities. Is  it  in  order  to  make

implications against members of the civil service  who

are not here to defend themselves?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As far as the point of order is

concerned, all I think this Assembly is concerned with

is  to see that any Member does not say anything which

is,  in  fact,  untrue  or which  in  fact  cannot  be

substantiated.  And  if  the allegation  made  by  the

Member for Queenstown is correct, then, of course,  he

is  entitled to say what he did say, and the  Minister

for  Finance, when his opportunity arrives, can defend

the  civil  servant, as it is his duty to  do  so,  of

course, as Minister in charge of Establishment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It seems the Minister for Finance

has -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already ruled.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I bow to your decision, Sir. Let

us now examine the P.A.P.'s so-called merger proposals

in  yet  another way. Let us examine them in terms  of

the   desirable  objectives  which  merger  with   the

Federation  is  to  achieve. The desirable  objectives

fall into three major groups, which may be represented

by the following three slogans:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Economic prosperity through merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. National unity through merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Independence through merger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us first take Economic Prosperity through

Merger. Merger by itself has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



little or nothing to contribute, to the prosperity  of

Singapore.  Merger does not by itself mean that  there

will be bigger markets for Singapore manufactures, nor

does  it mean that the customs barrier at Johore Bahru

would  be  taken off on Merger Day. After merger,  the

position  of  Singapore would be similar  to  that  of

Penang - politically  a  part  of  the  Federation,  but

economically  outside the Federation's  tariff  walls.

Therefore,  at  best,  merger  would  make  a   common

commodity  market  possible. But  this  is  largely  a

theoretical  possibility. A  common  commodity  market

which  opens the Federation market to Singapore  would

have  in  some  cases  to be at  the  expense  of  the

economic  development  of  the  Federation.  Even  the

Minister for Finance of Singapore once believed, as  I

am  told,  that  if Singapore is to achieve  a  common

commodity  market with the Federation, Singapore  must

be  in a position to twist the Federation's arm. I  am

sure  the  Minister could confirm  this.  It  is  this

capacity,  Sir,  to twist the Federation's  arm,  that

would   be  lost  when  there  is  a  merger   without

proportionate   representation.   With   proportionate

representation, Singapore would be in  a  position  of

strength comparatively in the Federal Parliament,  and

whosoever  forms  the Government would  have  to  make

reasonable   concessions  to   safeguard   Singapore's

interests.  It  is an established fact that  political

representation  is the key to economic  progress.  Our

fight, Sir, against colonialism was not purely to have

local men driving State-owned air-conditioned cars, or

for  the beauty of a new State Flag. It stems from  an

age-old  maxim -  no  taxation without  representation.

That  is,  economic  interests cannot  be  safeguarded

without political rights. Anybody who has made a study

of  Government expenditure should know that Government

in spending money tends to conciliate pressure groups.

We  have  only just had a demonstration of it  by  the

P.A.P.  When  they  thought that the  English-educated

were  of  no consequence, as I have already  a  little

while  quoted,  they cut their salaries  without  even

attempting to go through the motions of negotiation.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> .Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Then when they lost the Chinese-educated and the working class support, they gave back

all' the salaries. Everyone knows that the restoration

of  the  pay  cuts  was  not  because  of  the  merger

arrangements, as the P.A.P. would like us to  believe.

It  was  purely  and simply a blatant attempt  by  the

P.A.P. to  buy  the votes of the civil  service.  The

whole quotation -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Here again, I must point out

that  there is repetition. Almost the same  words  are

being  used,  and I would suggest to  the  Member  for

Queenstown that he should try and avoid that  sort  of

repetition.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is only in passing, Sir,I am

not labouring on it at all. I just want to mention the

fact  that this whole operation has a moral,  that  we

can  only  disregard at our peril. If  we  do  not negotiate and get proportionate representation in  the

Federation Parliament, and if we do not negotiate  and

get   reasonable  and  legitimate  rights  to   common

citizenship,  then  economic prosperity  would  be  as

hollow a promise as all other P.A.P. promises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been a concerted effort to present

merger  as  the key to Singapore's economic  problems,

but  the solutions to economic problems do not  depend

on  markets  alone. Markets are important,  and  these

would  depend on political concessions that  could  be

got  from the Federation by a common commodity  market

arrangement which the Minister for Finance says is not

immediately    possible.   Economic    solutions    to

Singapore's problem would also depend, Sir - even if  we

had the common commodity market - on the economic policy

of  the  Government and the expenditure  of  money  in

pursuance  of  this policy. This, Sir, I  have  learnt

from  people who should know. The economic  prosperity

of   Singapore   is   thus  dependent   on   political

considerations, and we have no right to  pretend  that

merger  per se is the solution. Merger by itself  will

not  solve the unemployment problem also in Singapore.

In  the  first place, unemployment problems  are  also

present in the Federation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



The  increasing  poverty  resulting  from   the

exploitation in the kampongs has driven more and  more

peasants  into the town, thus swelling the  number  in

unemployment. A large number of the unemployed in  the

Federation  have been coming to Singapore looking  for

jobs. In spite of all the propaganda of the flight  of

capital  from  Singapore to the  Federation,  the  net

inflow  of people from the Federation to Singapore  in

1959 was about 8,000. In fact, the merger proposals of

the P.A.P. would weaken Singapore's economic position.

It  would  place the livelihood of our people  at  the

will  and pleasure of Federation politicians over whom

the  people  of Singapore will not have an appropriate

influence.  It is therefore a matter which merits  the

most  thoughtful consideration of all the people.  The

business community especially would do well to realise

that   the   demand   for   citizenship   rights   and

proportionate  representation  is  not   a   bid   for

political power or an attempt to build Singapore as  a

base  for the Communists. It is indeed, Sir, a  matter

of  safeguarding  the  livelihood  of  the  people  of

Singapore. The politicians who gaily talk about merger

which  is  a surrender of legitimate political  rights

are  the  ones who are jeopardising the livelihood  of

the   people.  Their  narrow,  selfish  interests   of

retaining  political power, the vindictive  desire  to

fix  their political opponents, have blinded  them  to

the  consequences  of their acts. They  have  Economic

Ph.Ds, and  highly paid experts,  and  yet  in  their

singleminded   desire  to  destroy   their   political

opponents,  they would destroy the livelihood  of  the

people.  It is the cynical nihilism of these  arrogant

men  who would destroy the people of Singapore if they

cannot  lord over them. They are arrogant and  cynical

enough to believe that they can persuade the people of

Singapore,  by the use of all the means of  propaganda

at  their  disposal',  to  agree  to  this  scheme  of

destruction. As I have said, Sir, they even use  civil

servants  on  this. They, in their cynical  arrogance,

think  that the people can be beguiled into  accepting

their  destruction by branding all opposition to their

mad scheme as Communist-inspired.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a large mass of literature on the

problems  of  Federal  economic  and  fiscal   policy;

literature on the needs for constitutional checks  and

balances  in order to prevent the destruction  of  the

legitimate  interests of component States;  literature

on  the  necessity  of political  safeguards  and  the

paramount significance of proportional representation.

Is this all Communist-inspired? Or has the desperation

of  arrogant men faced with political oblivion gone so

far  as  to  blind themselves completely?  We  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis have said over and over  again  that

the   problems  of  merger  are  matters  of  national

importance  and  merit united  action  if  we  are  to

achieve what is best in the interests of the people of

Singapore  and the Federation. We have said  over  and

over  again, "Do not betray the people's interests  by

making  it  a  party  issue.  Let  us  safeguard   the

interests   of  the  people  by  thrashing   out   our

differences. But the interests of the people must come

first."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this phoney merger is not - I repeat not - intended

to  solve the economic problems of Singapore,  and  we

know  this  from the Tunku himself. Let me  quote  him

from  the  Straits Times of 18th November. This  is  a

report of his interview in London:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He [that is, the Tunku] considered that merger of

Singapore   and   Federation   would   benefit    both

territories  to a small extent economically,  but  far

more  important was the benefit it would bring to  the

whole area politically.'



<br><br>Earlier,   the  Tunku  explained  what  he  meant   by

"political  benefits", and it is in  the  same  report

here. I will quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'By merging with Singapore, the Federation would

take  on  more  than it wanted, but he felt  this  was

necessary  if it was not to have a Communist  or  pro-Communist  government  in power  in  its  neighbouring

territory.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the primary motive of this phoney merger is not

to  benefit us economically but to fight Communism. In

other words, Sir, the purpose of this phoney merger is

not  a positive one but simply a negative one - that  of

anti-Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. stated in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech  at  column 12 of Hansard dated  31st  October,

1961:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With merger now in prospect, the assumptions on

which the original economic policies of the Government

were  based  must be reviewed. As part  of  a  greater

entity,  Singapore can stand up better to its economic

difficulties than by tackling them in isolation. Hence

it   was  possible  to  relax  many  of  the  measures

adopted.'



<br><br>Sir,  the  P.A.P. is trying to deceive the  people  of

Singapore  that after the P.A.P. type  of  merger  the

coffers  of  Singapore will be filled with money  from

the Federation and that our revenue will be increased.

Nothing can be further from the truth. In fact,  after

this   phoney   merger,   at  least   one-quarter   of

Singapore's present revenue will go to the Federation.

That we have learnt from the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me proceed with the second objective:

national  unity through merger. The P.A.P.'s  proposal

claims  to  give different educational rights  to  the

Chinese  living in Singapore from those  available  to

those  living across the Causeway. We are  to  have  a

system  of education that would isolate the people  of

Singapore  from  those  in  the  Federation,  and   in

addition  to the existing cleavage among the different

communities,  we  are to create new cleavages  through

different educational rights. The effect of this would

be  that unless we ban the entry of young Chinese from

the  Federation or deny them the right of entry to our

schools,  there would be wholesale movement  of  youth

from  the Federation to Singapore to study and to take

examinations  that  would  be  held  in  the   Chinese

language.  What  is  to happen to these  youths  after

taking   the   examinations   in   Singapore?    Their

certificates  would have no value in  the  Federation,

and they would have to stick in Singapore in order to

get  jobs. The number of unemployed in Singapore  will

thereby  increase  and not decrease under  the  P.A.P.

type of merger. Singapore with its dispossessed youths

from  the  Federation  would  become  the  centre   of

agitation  for  Chinese  educational  rights  in   the

Federation.  In  the  Federation  the  special  rights

available   in  Singapore  would  become   cause   and

justification for agitation. Sooner or later all  this

agitation  would be labelled Communist, like  all  the

strikes not involving the P.A.P.-sponsored unions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



so  far, and the dragon teeth of unrest and repression

sown by the P.A.P. would produce widespread grievances

and dissension. Surely this is not the way to national

unity. It is a path leading not to national unity  but

to national disunity and civil war.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is a path on which other

sidepaths  arising  from  discontent  over  restricted

political  rights  and  limited  representation  would

converge.  It  is  a  path  that  every  man,  however

desperate, must avoid. It is a path that the desperate

men  of the P.A.P. must, if they have any decency left

in  them,  not  create. If they do,  generation  after

generation  of  their survivors shall curse  them  for

their  part in the holocaust that was brought  on  the

people of the country. The present arrangement  is  no

solution  to  the  problems of Chinese  education.  If

there  is to be one, it would have to be hammered  out

in  the  Federal  Parliament. And the  solution  which

would  contribute  to political harmony  and  national

unity  must apply to the whole of Malaya. In hammering

out  the solution, Singapore must have its say, a  say

that  can  only  be assured if there is  proportionate

representation  in  the  Federal  Parliament.  As  the

proposal  now  stands,  it is not  a  contribution  to

national   unity,  but  a  contribution  to   national

disunity and disaster.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Let us also examine whether this

different educational policy is a good one. If we, for

a  moment,  disregard national interests and  consider

this  only in terms of the interests of the people  in

Singapore.  I have already indicated the dangers  that

would  be  posed  to  the employment  market  and  the

educational system if youths from the Federation  came

to  Singapore and acquired qualifications that have no

meaning  outside  Singapore.  In  addition  to   this,

Chinese  schools  would become  centres  of  agitation

against  the  educational system in the  rest  of  the

Federation, and they would be harassed as  centres  of

Communist and pro-Communist activity. The causes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



and  the legitimate grievances would be forgotten  and

only  the  effects would remain. How would this  bring

happiness  to  the people? If the people of  Singapore

truly   have   autonomy  over  education,   then   the

educational policy must he based on the aspiration  of

the   people.  We,  in  Singapore,  are  predominantly

socialist in outlook. If the people's aspirations were

met,  the products of the schools and universities  in

Singapore would be more progressive in their political

outlook  than  what the present Federation  Government

would  allow. Do you think that the internal  security

boys  under  the  control  of the  present  Federation

Government would remain idle over this? From what  has

been  said by those in authority in the Federation  in

the  recent Parliament debate, the likelihood is  that

the  products  of Singapore's schools and universities

will be crowding the gaols in Changi and Batu Gajah if

the P.A.P.'s sell-out is pushed through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The autonomy in education then, which is being

offered as a great achievement of the intelligence and

realism  of  the  P.A.P. leaders,  would  be  crushed

between agitation and internal security, in the  final

analysis,  autonomy in Chinese education would  vanish

almost as soon as it was given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements of the Prime Minister, too, have been

very  contradictory in his advocating  local  autonomy

for  education. The Prime Minister has said that local

autonomy might go on for 30 to 50 years, in one of his

Press  interviews. By this, he means that there  would

not  he  complete unification of our country  and  our

people  for 30 to 50 years. Again, the Prime  Minister

has also advocated nation-building through unification

of  the  education  policy. And the merger  proposals,

according  to the P.A.P., will lead to unification  of

our people. How does the Prime Minister reconcile this

avowed  policy  of  nation-building  towards  national

unification  on  the one hand, and the maintenance  of

separate education policies in the Federation  and  in

Singapore for as long as 30 to 50 years on the  other?

What  sort of a double talk is this? Even here I see - I

am reading from the text of a speech by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



the  Deputy  Speaker at the opening  of  the  Labrador

Primary School, Pasir Panjang, on 28th October - that he

said,  "With  merger the children in  the  schools  in

Singapore will be the children of Malaya. We have  one

destination   ahead  of  us."  Where   is   the   "one

destination"?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> End of P.A.P.!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Nil. It is clear, therefore, that

all  this talk of autonomy on education and labour  in

the  face  of  the  avowed policy  of  nation-building

towards  the  national unification not  only  deceives

other  people  but the P.A.P. themselves  as  well.  I

wonder  if the Back-benchers know this line of  double

talk  of  the Prime Minister. Such too, Sir, would  be

the fate of autonomy in labour.

<div align="center"><b>(White Paper)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I was saying, Sir, that all this

talk  of autonomy in education and labour in the  face

of   the  avowed  policy  of  nation-building  towards

national unification, not only deceives other  people,

but the P.A.P. themselves as well. Such, too, would be

the fate of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



autonomy in labour. I am not going in detail on  that.

I  will  leave it to my colleagues. The only guarantee

for  safeguarding the workers' rights is the existence

of  a  strong,  independent trade union movement.  The

workers  have  also seen their effective  trade  union

leaders   being  imprisoned  without  trial  both   in

Singapore  and in the Federation, all in the  name  of

security  risks.  The workers are by  now  politically

matured.  They  know  that  the  control  of  internal

security  by  a  Government that is  unsympathetic  to

labour  would make a mockery of any so-called autonomy

in  labour. The workers in Singapore cannot be bluffed

by   the   P.A.P.  Government  any  more.  The  P.A.P.

Government   is  dangling  these  empty  promises   of

autonomy over labour and education like carrots before

the  mule. But the people of Singapore are not  mules.

It   is  an  insult  to  the  people  for  the  P.A.P.

Government to think that they can be so easily  duped.

We   have   been   asked  to  see  the   question   of

representation and these apparent concessions  in  the

wrong order. The P.A.P. line is that, as a consequence

of   the   need   for   autonomy  in   education   and

labour - something  that they want us  to  believe  they

have wrested from the Federation Government with great

difficulty -  they  have conceded,  as  a  just  price,

limited political representation. Surely this  is  not

the  truth.  In fact, it is the other way round.  From

the recent Federal Parliament debate on merger, it  is

quite  evident that the Federation Government is  only

interested  in  obtaining  control  of  the   internal

security of Singapore and keeping our political rights

at  the  minimum. The truth is that in order  to  make

limited political representation acceptable, they have

offered  as  sops apparent autonomy in  education  and

labour - apparent  autonomy, because  internal  security

would  make  mincemeat of it before you can  say  Jack

Robinson. In fact, the Tunku has already said that all

provisions will have to be transitional and temporary.

I  will  quote,  Sir, from the Straits Times,  Friday,

17th November. The Tunku said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All provisions will have to be transitional and

temporary until a workable constitution can be  agreed

upon  and  enshrined  in a main  constitution  of  the

Federation.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



We   see,   therefore,  that  the  P.A.P.'s  so-called

autonomy  on education and labour is a false  autonomy

and  is  not  based  on  facts. Regarding  Singapore's

autonomy  on education in relation to its  clash  with

the  Rahman-Talib Report, the Prime  Minister  of  the

Federation already said - and I quote, Sir; this is  the

Straits  Times  of 19th October; he was talking  about

the clash of the Rahman-Talib Report with the autonomy

on education in Singapore. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But if it was found later that changes should be

made then steps would be taken to do so.'



<br><br>Sir,  I  have no doubt that the Federation  would.  So

where  is the autonomy? Can the Prime Minister, if  he

is here - or let his colleagues tell him - answer that?

I have already shown that local autonomy on education,

in its final analysis, would not lead to the relief of

the  economic problems and unemployment in  Singapore.

All   economists   know  that  only  full   industrial

development  and expansion can possibly do  that.  But

full   industrial   expansion  and   development   for

Singapore  would  mean expansion  and  development  in

competition  and  possibly even in conflict  with  the

industrial   expansion   and   development   of    the

Federation. This clash of economic policies  will  not

be allowed by the Federation. The Minister for Finance

of the Federation, Mr Tan Siew Sin, has said as much.

I  will  quote,  Sir, from the Straits Times  of  17th

October. Mr Tan Siew Sin said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Central Government must have enough powers in

reserve so that if any state Government should  pursue

a policy affecting the economic stability of the whole

country he can cope with such policies effectively.'



<br><br>So, how can Singapore have free industrial development

to  provide more opportunities of employment  for  the

thousands and thousands of our present unemployed  and

for those coming out from our schools and universities

year  after  year? No, Sir. The economy  of  Singapore

will  be hamstrung at every turn. It is even possible,

Sir,  for  example, since they want to have  pineapple

canning  factories in the Federation,  such  factories

will  be  limited in scope or not even be  allowed  to

operate  in Singapore. How good will this autonomy  be

when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



the  livelihood  of all the people can  be  interfered

with by the powers that be outside Singapore? How will

the interests of the people be looked after?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objective that we seek to achieve through

merger is independence. What does independence mean to

the people? If it means anything at all, it means the

increase  of  political freedom for the  people.  The

struggle  for independence is not a struggle  to  stop

white  men  driving  in Humber-Daimlers,  Pullmans  or

Rolls-Royce,  and  have local  men  driving  in  air-conditioned   Daimlers.  Nor  is  the   struggle   for

independence  satisfied by the skill  with  which  new

flags are designed or by a new national anthem. Behind

all  this,  there  must  be an increase  in  political

freedom,  and  the use of that political  freedom  for

improving  the livelihood of the people.  Independence

cannot mean the restriction of political freedom.  The

overthrow  of  foreign rule in whatever  form  it  may

exist  is  only  a means to achieve greater  political

freedom  for  the  community and the individuals  that

form that community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has mistaken the means for the end.

'They  think  that the transfer of political  hegemony

from  the  British to the Federation  is  independence

even  if  it  would mean a decrease in  the  political

rights  of  the people of Singapore. If we enjoy  more

political  rights as a colony of the British  and  the

P.A.P.'s proposals would lead to less political rights

as  a  "partner"  of the Federation, then  it  is  not

independence through merger. Partnership becomes  only

an euphemism, a word more acceptable than "colony".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present Singapore enjoys very real autonomy in

all internal matters and has equal say with Britain on

matters  of  internal security. It is  true  that  the

British   can   take   away  our  rights   under   the

Constitution,   but  they  can   only   do   that   by

establishing a military government. As long as the peo

ple    support    the   Government,    whatever    the

constitutional   limitations,   the   power   of   the

Government  is  very real. We have  seen  that  being

practised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the P.A.P. proposals this hegemony would be

transferred from the British to the Federation  Government,  and in addition the Federation Government would

be  able  to  interfere in Singapore, as  the  British

would   never   be  able  to  without   revoking   the

Constitution. There is no need to go into details, but

what  is  inescapable is that the Singapore Government

would  not  be allowed to do anything that  displeases

the  Federation Government. Singapore  under  such  an

arrangement would be like a fly stuck in glue. It will

become an un-sexed part of the Federation. The Federal

representation is to be such that Singapore's part  in

the  Legislature is to be kept at the minimum and  her

participation  in  the  Federation  Government  almost

impossible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. plan for independence through merger is

such that we would give up whatever rights we have and

accept  a  political  status  designed  to  keep   our

influence   in  national  politics  at   the   minimum

possible.  This is not the same thing, Sir, as  taking

our  chances  with  the rest -of  the  people  of  the

country. If the majority can be convinced that  things

should  be  run in a different way, then  they  should

have  the  constitutional right to form  a  government

that  will  carry out their desires. Is that  not  the

democracy  the Prime Minister expounded  to  us  night

after  night over Radio Singapore sometime back?  But

it   is   not   democracy  when,   by   constitutional

gerrymandering and verbal soothing syrup,  the  people

of  Singapore  are  to be cast-rated  or  caponised  -

sorry.

devirilised    politically.   This    political    de-virilisation cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be

called a step towards independence. There is only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



one  word,  Sir, to describe this, and that is  "sell-out".  Yes,  sell-out. The Prime  Minister  says  that

because  we  are going to have the so-called  autonomy

over  'this or that, the people of Singapore  will  be

free  after  the  phoney  merger.  But,  Sir,  let  us

remember  that  internal security,  the  key  to  -our

freedom,  will  be in the hands of a  Government  over

which we shall not have the appropriate influence.  It

is  just  like saying that the arms and legs are  free

when  there is a noose around your neck. A noose  held

by  the  Federation. And who is going  to  apply  this

noose round the necks of the people of Singapore?  Who

indeed  is  the hangman of the people  of  Singapore?

There  is  only  one answer, Sir. The hangman  is  the

Prime Minister of Singapore. The hangman of Singapore?

The Prime Minister of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me summarise. The P.A.P. had at first said

that  automatic Federal citizenship was impossible.  I

have  already shown that automatic Federal citizenship

is  possible.  This has also been  confirmed  by  the

Tunku  himself. The Prime Minister also said that  the

demand   for   automatic   Federal   citizenship   and

proportionate representation was unreasonable. That is

still  his line. I have shown that it is not only  not

unreasonable but also completely reasonable, fair  and

just.  Then  the  Prime  Minister  used  the  lack  of

residential qualification and the Malay language  test

as  arguments to justify his not wanting to fight  for

the  democratic rights of equality and justice for the

people  of  Singapore.  I have similarly  shown  those

arguments  to be false and untenable. Then the  P.A.P.

line  is  that  through  merger  Singapore  will   get

economic  prosperity, national unity and independence.

I  have  also shown the hollowness of their arguments.

Then  the P.A.P. tries to appease sectional interests.

I  have  similarly  shown  that  the  P.A.P. has  not

advanced the various sectional interests one wee  bit.

in  fact,  all the P.A.P. actions have been  one  long

shameful  record of treacherous betrayal of the  basic

interests  of  the  people  of  Singapore.  The  Prime

Minister knows only too well that ultimately he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



will  be unmasked and be exposed. Hence, the diversion

with  the  Communist bogey. He hopes thus to use  this

diversion to distract the attention of the people from

the  treacherous sell-out carried out under -the  name

of  merger. Of course, the P.A.P. leaders do also hope

that  they  will  be able to cling on to  power.  When

discredited politicians want to transmute a  personal

party  crisis into a national one, then we are  indeed

at  the  crossroads. But the Government is in  such  a

mess  that  it has got the main highway and  the  side

path  all  mixed up, so engrossed are they in  their

hid  for  survival and in the play of party  politics.

The main highway is the highway of genuine unification

of  our  country and our people. There will be  peace,

prosperity,  freedom, equality, democracy and  justice

for  all  peoples  irrespective of race,  religion  or

creed.  There will be no exploitation of man  by  man.

Has  the P.A.P. stepped on to this main highway?  They

call  themselves a socialist party. What is  socialist

about   it   today?  Where  are  all  their  socialist

principles? The other path, Sir, is a side  path  that

leads  to  a  dead end. Yes, that is where the  P.A.P.

Government wants to lead us. They want to lead us to a

dead  end  where there is no true unification  of  our

country and our people. No democracy, no equality,  no

freedom and no justice, and where repressive action is

exercised for the benefit of a privileged few. That is

the  road  of an unequal partnership. That is  a  road

that  leads  not to independence nor to constitutional

advance  for the people of Singapore. On the contrary,

it  is  a road that leads to enslavement of the people

of  Singapore in another form. Instead of London  that

controls,  it  will  now be Kuala Lumpur.  Colonialism

goes  out  through the front door and  is  re-admitted

through the back door.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Where is the back? We have no back

door.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will ask the P.A.P. leaders - as

the  local  saying goes - to go back home,  rest  their

heads  high on their pillows and ponder over it.  Turn

back  before  it  is too late. Get back  to  land,  as

another  saying  goes, instead of  going  further  and

further into the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



deep,  deep sea. Turn back for the sake of the people.

Let  the  P.A.P. leaders undo the mistakes  they  have

made  before they go down in the annals of history  as

the traitors of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now wind up.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> He winds up with six pages!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is utterly dishonest to call

the P.A.P. deal a merger. The plain and simple fact is

that by the P.A.P. proposals the Federation Government

would  be  free  to interfere in all  spheres  of  our

lives,  even  though  we are supposed  to  have  local

autonomy over labour and education. On the other hand,

we  shall not have the proportionate influence in  the

Federal  legislature. We have stated in  no  uncertain

terms  that  even though we desire a  merger  to  come

about,  this  does  not mean that we  agree  with  the

policies  of the present Government of the Federation.

On  the contrary, we have stated our differences  with

the Right-wing Government of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why have the P.A.P. Government deliberately

used the word "merger" when it is obvious that what is

being proposed is far from anything that can be called

merger,  when  it  is  something that  is  simply  and

plainly  a  sell-out?  it  is fraudulent  practice  to

confuse  the  people by the repeated use of  the  word

"merger".  It is like trying to sell a faked commodity

for the real one. It is bound to be found out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now look at the propaganda line of the

Government.  The Prime Minister and his  troubled  men

have  run up against numerous problems. They know that

run one in Singapore is against merger. They know that

we  in  the  Barisan Sosialis are in  favour  of  full

unification of the two territories. Why then have they

put out this falsehood that we are against merger? The

answer,  Sir, can clearly be seen in their anxiety  to

force  their proposals on the people. When  we  expose

their  proposals and prove the whole scheme  to  be  a

sell-out,  they hope to silence us by saying  that  we

are against merger. And hoping to bulldoze the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



into   accepting   those  thoroughly   dishonest

proposals, they also have the Communist alarm  raised.

The  people  of  Singapore are not frightened  by  the

Communist bogey. In fact, too many people are sick  to

the  bone  of the absurdities that have come from  the

Prime  Minister  about the Communist menace.  Everyone

who  is a serious threat to the Prime Minister becomes

a Communist, a pro-Communist, a Communist sympathiser,

and  so on. We do not wish to waste our time listening

to the Prime Minister's own nightmares. In fact, if he

had  a good night's rest every time, things would have

been  much better for all of us, particularly those

who  have  not  been completely bored by listening  to

Radio Singapore. But I wish to say that all this talk

about  Communism is, in the main, directed to  London.

Washington and Kuala Lumpur. By raising a scare  about

Communism,  the  Prime Minister hopes  that  he  would

force  various  foreign interests to bring  the  right

pressure  in  the right places to assist  him  in  his

plans for a sell-out. The Tunku has revealed the  true

character of the Prime Minister by admitting that  he'

had been persuaded to accept merger after listening to

the  frightening  stories of  our  tale-bearing  Prime

Minister.  For  one thing, I give the  Prime  Minister

credit  for  having taken the Tunku for a  jolly  good

ride.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands):</b> Do you think he is so foolish?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis

made  a  policy statement on 28th August outlining  in

unequivocal  terms  our  stand on  the  constitutional

future. Let me quote parts of that statement. This  is

our stand on merger:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us once again reiterate that we are fully in

support of unity between the Federation and Singapore.

We  believe  that separation is a result  of  colonial

domination.  We  are  unreservedly  dedicated  to  the

building  of a Malayan nation and resolutely  opposed

to  Chauvinism. We shall struggle for the unity of the

peasants, workers and intellectuals of all races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support Malay as the national language and arc

convinced that the Malayan nation will develop a great

new cultural life common to all its people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way ahead for real unification for our country

and our people is in one of two directions:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an immediate, full and complete merger with

Singapore   joining   the   Federation   as    a

constituent State;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) as an autonomous unit within the Confederation

with   the  Borneo  territories  coming  in  when

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first direction, we are fully aware of the

difficulties that face us in our struggle for  Malayan

unity.  As  a result of colonial rule, the differences

of  race  and religion have been emphasised  and  much

work  will  be  needed to repair the  damage  done  by

colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we declare that if the representatives of

the  people of the Federation are agreeable to do  the

same, we will pledge ourselves to wholeheartedly exert

our influence to win the people of Singapore to accept

full  and  complete merger forthwith,  that  is,  with

Singapore  as the twelfth State of the Federation  and

Singapore  citizens  automatically  becoming   Malayan

citizens  with  proportional  representation  in   the

Federal  Parliament  like any of  the  present  eleven

States constituting the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that this is a vital question that can

only  be  decided by the people of Singapore  and  the

Federation.  In Singapore, we believe  that  the  only

genuine way of allowing the people to decide is  by  a

general  election during which we will be prepared  to

persuade  our people to give us a mandate for  a  full

and   complete  merger.  Let  the  Government  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya tell us if it  is  prepared  to

persuade  the people of the Federation to  accept  the

people  of  Singapore in a full and  complete  merger

before 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fully realise that many of the policies of the

present  Right-wing Government in the  Federation  are

unacceptable to us. The present Federation  Government

is  in  close alliance with a foreign country. It  has

bound  the  country  to  the so-called  British/Malaya

Mutual Defence Treaty and turned our motherland into a

military  base  for  the  British  armed  forces.  Its

foreign  policy  has alienated our  country  from  the

mainstream of Afro-Asia, particularly Indonesia, Ghana

and India. Its internal policies are -'.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether

this  is an extract from a document, or is it part  of

the  speech?  It  is so difficult now  to  follow  the

Member  for Queenstown. I understood he was  going  to

read extracts from a policy statement of his Party. If

all  these  words  during the last  five  minutes  are

extracts,  then I think I have missed the  meaning  of

the word "extracts". Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is an extract, Sir. Our policy

statement was a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



long  one and I am only reading a very short  part  of

it. I have only a few lines more to go, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Its internal policies are repressive. Organisations

and other civil liberties are curbed and its education

policy is misguided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we are willing to accept these

disabilities and join up with the Socialist forces  in

the   Federation  to  build  a  great  alliance   with

peasants,  workers  and intellectuals,  to  defeat  by

constitutional  means the reactionary  forces  at  the

general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Socialist comrades in the Federation have long

been   waging   a  determined  struggle  against   the

reactionary policies of the Federation Government.  We

will  strengthen this struggle by joining  hands  with

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to accept merger under these

conditions  provided  it  occurs  immediately  and  is

followed by a Pan-Malayan general election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are confident that the people of the present two

territories  will  effect by  constitutional  means  a

change   in  whatever  reactionary  policies  of   the

Government.'



<br><br>That, Sir, is the whole extract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unlike others, we in the Barisan Sosialis mean

what  we say. Our stand on the unification of the  two

territories by complete merger has been taken  not  on

account  of  technical reasons as our  opponents  have

insinuated. They are, of course, entitled  to  believe

what  they want to believe and live in their own fear-ridden  world.  On  this question  of  merger,  may  I

finally quote from the speech of our Secretary-General

made  at  the  inaugural mass  meeting  of  the  Party

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Straits Times, Monday, 18th September:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Lim said that recently critics had described

the  party  as "anti-merger" and as being prepared  to

accept merger only as an alternative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can anyone who likes only half-boiled potatoes

accuse  those who like boiled potatoes of being people

who do not like potatoes?" Mr Lim asked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are serious and genuine in our stand for full

and complete merger. If the Federation Government says

tomorrow that it will accept us as an integral part of

the Federation, we will only be too glad to support it

whole-heartedly..."'.



<br><br>We know now, Sir, that the Tunku does not want merger.

He  wants  our country but not our people. He  is  not

interested



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



in  the unity of our people. He is only interested  in

getting  the  powers  to control the  destiny  of  our

people.  And  it is our duty. Sir, to  warn  that  the

desire to acquire more territory on one side, and  the

desire  to  sell out on the other, is  only  going  to

aggravate  the present differences among  our  people.

The  Irish  history should provide  a  good  objective

lesson. Merger cannot be achieved by politicians  with

a  communal  outlook  or even by those  who  outwardly

profess  to  be non-communal but willingly  pander  to

communal  views.  We in the Barisan Sosialis  maintain

that  there  is no conflict of interests  between  the

vast  majority  of the Chinese in Singapore  and,  for

that  matter,  in  Malaya,  and  the  Malays  in   the

Federation,  for the majority of both communities  are

poor.  The  Malay  rakyat and the Malay  workers  have

nothing  to  fear from the workers in  Singapore.  The

Chinese and the Indians in Singapore have demonstrated

their  loyalty  to  this country  both  in  the  anti-Japanese  war and in the anti-colonial struggle.  They

owe their undivided loyalty to this country which they

have  now come to regard as their own. It is true that

a  few  have ties with China and with India,  just  as

some Malays have ties with Indonesia. But all ties  in

the  last  decade have grown thin and weak, while  new

ones  to  this  land  are  being  forged  and  further

strengthened. But what is of more importance  is  that

the  vast  majority of the Chinese  in  Singapore  are

poor. They are men who work and toil for a living.  In

Singapore the Chinese workers work together with Malay

and Indian workers. They struggle together against the

exploiting  class of whatever race and  for  a  better

livelihood.  They  man the picket  lines  shoulder  to

shoulder. The recent strike by the Public Daily  Rated

Employees  is  an  example of  there  being  no  basic

conflict between the Malay workers, the Indian workers

and  the  Chinese workers. To approach merger  from  a

communal  angle will not only lead us on the  road  to

failure but also to chaos. For this approach brings in

its train serious repercussions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



to  communal harmony. This attitude of mind in  itself

precludes    any   solution   to   the   problem    of

reunification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, on behalf of the Bansan Sosialis,

crystallise   our   approach  to  the   Constitutional

question.  Under the terms of our last  constitutional

agreement,  we  are  obliged to return  to  London  to

reexamine  the position in the light of our experience

as to what and how our Constitution has succeeded. But

in  the  meantime the questions of merger and Malaysia

have  been  raised, it is evident that what is  called

merger-is  not  merger.  It  is  sheer  domination  of

Singapore  by  the  Federation.  We  must,  therefore,

reject  these  proposals. But if it  is  possible  for

Singapore to join in a confederation of Malaysia as an

autonomous unit, then we shall welcome this advance as

a  step towards complete merger. And if none of  these

ways  are  open to us, then we should in the discharge

of our constitutional obligations go to London in 1963

when the demand should be -

<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Independence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - for full and complete

internal self-government. In these circumstances it is

our  responsibility to bring about a  greater  measure

of  freedom  for  the  people of  Singapore  and  the

movement  should  be  for the  minimum  demand - let  us

emphasise - for the minimum demand for full and complete

internal self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said at the beginning that

we do not believe that the P.A.P. Government is at all

sincere  when  it calls for merger. I have  said  that

they  are abusing the word "merger" for their  selfish

aims. They are using the word "merger" when they  mean

something else. Even the Tunku yesterday told us  that

the  P.A.P.'s scheme is not merger. Let me  quote  him

[Straits Times] 17th

November:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"It would be more correct to say it is a form of

very close association," he said.'



<br><br>Sir, let the P.A.P. Government prove its sincerity  in

its  call for merger by voting for our amendment.  Let

them not try to give excuses for not wanting a genuine

merger.  Let  them not just say, as the  Deputy  Prime

Minister has said, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



they  are  prepared to accept a genuine merger  as  an

alternative and do nothing about it. We have stated in

no  uncertain terms that we are prepared  to  convince

our  people in a general election to accept a  genuine

merger.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If the P.A.P. is sincere in its

desire  for unity, let them join us in our efforts  to

convince  the  people. Let them not stand  by  at  the

ringside and merely wish us good luck. We implore them

for  the  sake  of  our people not to  maintain  their

opportunistic stand. If the P.A.P. votes against  this

amendment, then they stand exposed as opportunists, as

double  dealers,  as men who are not sincere  in  what

they say. They will be exposed as anti-merger, as anti-genuine  reunification of our  people.  They  will  be

exposed  as  power-mad people obsessed only  with  the

aims of keeping themselves in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know why the P.A.P. is bringing about this

phoney  merger. It is because the P.A.P. leaders  hope

to  use  this phoney merger as a means to crush  their

political opponents. But let them remember this  that

in  their attempts to crush their political opponents,

they  are  also  bringing degradation,  disunity,  and

disaster to our people as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are confident that the socialist movement

will  not  be  crushed  by  this  P.A.P. scheme.   The

socialist  forces in Malaya have survived far  greater

dangers   than  this.  History  has  shown   that   no

politician can maintain his power for long  merely  by

constitutional manipulation and political  repression.

History  has  shown that what really  matters  is  the

support  of  the  people. We in the Barisan  Sosialis,

Sir,  are  confident of the support of the people.  We

have repeatedly challenged the Government to a general

election  on  this merger issue, and it is significant

that they give all sorts of excuses just to avoid  our

challenge.  Let me, Sir, urge the P.A.P. leaders  once

again  not to place their own political survival above

the  interests  of the people. The  future  of  a  few

politicians does not really matter. Let us not  forget

that we have entered politics in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



order  to help the people and not ourselves. Let  them

search  their  conscience. Let  them  be  honest  with

themselves. Are they doing this really for the good of

the  people or for themselves? Let them remember  that

no  matter what they do, the people shall one day pass

judgment  on  them. As the Prime Minister himself  has

once  said.  "The verdict of the people is a  terrible

thing." Yes, Sir, the verdict of the people can  be  a

terrible thing. But, Sir, it will be terrible only  to

those who refuse to remain faithful to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Has the hon. Member copies of his

amendment which may be distributed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the amendment handed in to the Clerk and

distributed to Members.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, whereas it has always been the avowed

objective of all nationalists of Malaya to achieve the

reunification  of  Singapore with  the  Federation  of

Malaya  and to remove the artificial division  created

by  the  British by their policy of "divide and rule",

this   House  affirms  and  declares  that  the  first

objective of all true patriots of Malaya is to achieve

the reunification of these two territories in a merger

of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya."



<br><br>Since  which an amendment has been moved to leave  out

from  "a"  in the second last line to the end  and  to

insert -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"genuine merger of Singapore with the Federation of

Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation as  the

twelfth  state and with all its Citizens automatically

becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out,  be  left out." The debate may, and of  necessity

will, range over the other part of the amendment which

seeks to insert the words.

The  debate  now, of course, will be confined  to  the

amendment. Dr Goh.



<br><br>6.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the marathon

performance of the Member for Queenstown to  which  we

have  just been subjected was frankly a disappointment

to  me. This was his first major speech in this  House

as a leader



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



of  his  Party. One was entitled to expect a searching

analysis  of  political trends  with  a  profound  and

comprehensive  review of the merger proposals  agreed

to  with  the two Governments. One hoped to hear  from

the Member for Queenstown some solid justification for

the  Barisan  Sosialis  plan  for  so-called  complete

merger. One also hoped to hear how he proposes to  get

automatic   conversion  of  Singapore  citizens   into

Federal  citizens now that the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation  had already declared that the  Federation

Government was not prepared to agree to this. None  of

The  things that we had expected came from the  Member

for  Queenstown. Instead, Sir, we were treated to  a

dreary  repetition of the old slogans trotted  out  by

the  Barisan Sosialis propaganda machine. In  fairness

to  the  Member  for Queenstown, I will concede  that,

yesterday  at  any  rate,  what  might  have  been  a

completely  weary, boring and dispirited  address  was

relieved  by  a  few joyous moments of  hilarity.  For

these small mercies, we are duly grateful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the Barisan Sosialis propaganda line,

the Member for Queenstown keeps on repeating a number

of  set  themes. The P.A.P. merger plan is a sell-out;

it  is  phoney  merger;  Singapore  citizens  will  be

reduced to second-class status. As in previous Barisan

Sosialis propaganda statements, not the slightest  bit

of relevant evidence has been produced in support. Who

has  been sold out? In what way is the merger phoney?

How  are  Singapore citizens relegated to second-class

status after merger compared to the Federation? All we

got  from  the  Member  for Queenstown  was  a  dreary

repetition of these assertions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt by constantly asserting a statement, he

hopes  to  induce some people to believe  that  it  is

true.  Sellers of headache cures and toothpastes  also

use  this  technique. But on such a serious matter  as

our  people's future, we want evidence in  support  of

any  assertion  or allegation. It is  not  sufficient,

Sir, to keep on repeating, like a worn-out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



gramophone record, that there has been a sell-out,

a phoney merger, and that we will be reduced to second-class citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the subject of citizenship.

The  Barisan Sosialis say that Singapore citizens will

be  reduced to second-class citizens. But they do  not

explain  how  this  is so. The Member  for  Queenstown

stressed  the importance of citizenship. No  one  will

dispute   it.  He  said,  "Citizenship  is  intimately

connected with every facet of our everyday life - in the

way   we   live,  work,  eat,  travel,  learn,  study,

associate  and  so forth." This may be  a  bit  of  an

exaggeration,  but  I will let it pass.  What  is  his

criterion  for  evaluating the worth  of  citizenship?

Obviously  if you say one class of citizens is  first-class  and another second-class, you must have certain

standards  of judgment. What are they? The test  which

the  Member  himself  applies is  that  the  Singapore

citizen  should - and I quote him, "have the opportunity

of  sharing  a common political life and destiny  with

his  brothers  across the Causeway". To  do  this,  we

should  have the right to vote and stand for  election

to  the  same Parliament, for only then can we decide,

and  I  quote  him, "the extent of your  freedom,  the

Government  you want, the laws which you want  and  do

not  want, the type of working conditions you wish  to

have,  the type of education which your children would

have, the type of health facilities we would like, and

so on and so forth."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us apply his own standards to Singapore

citizenship after merger. Will the Singapore  citizens

have  the  opportunity of sharing a  common  political

life   and  destiny  with  his  brothers  across   the

Causeway? The answer is surely yes. He will  vote  for

representatives into the same Federal  Parliament.  He

can  stand for election to the Federal Parliament and,

if  successful,  share with his  brothers  across  the

Causeway authority in the supreme law-making authority

in  the  country. Not one Singapore citizen  would  be

deprived of this right.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Member for Queenstown and the Barisan

Sosialis  object to, and find deficient in the  merger

arrangement, is that the right to vote and  the  right

to stand for election to the Federal Parliament can be

exercised  by  Singapore citizens only  in  Singapore.

Contrarywise,   the  present  Federal   citizens   can

exercise such rights in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way can we be regarded as second-class? Both

groups   are  treated  alike,  and  receive  identical

treatment on a wide range of affairs of the State.  In

practice, the vast majority of citizens exercise their

electoral  rights  at  the place  in  which  they  are

permanently  resident. The ordinary Singapore  citizen

is  not  going to be highly excited nor does  he  lose

anything,  because he cannot, for instance, stand  for

election in Trengganu. If a Singapore candidate is  of

any worth he would have built a reputation for himself

in  this island and would have more chances of winning

an election here, not in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the Barisan Sosialis making a song and dance

about this comparatively trivial issue? The answer  is

not  that  there  has been any breach  of  fundamental

human right or any betrayal of Singapore citizens. The

reason  why they want to be able to stand for election

in  the  Federation is best explained in  one  of  the

early public statements that their leaders made on the

subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was published in the Straits Times of 30th August and indeed has been quoted by the Member for

Queenstown.  But to refresh the memory  and  to  make

sure  that  Members  of  the  House  know  what  I  am

referring  to, perhaps I may be permitted  to  re-read

the statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made it clear that they would accept merger

only if there were general elections immediately after

merger in the Federation and Singapore. They stated in

practically so many words that their real objective in

merger  was the eventual overthrow of what they termed

the   Right-wing   feudalistic   Government   in   the

Federation  of Malaya by strengthening the  determined

struggle that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



now being waged against it by socialist forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the term "socialist forces" is an elastic one.

It can cover "democratic socialist"; it can also cover

the   Malayan   Communist  Party.   The   Member   for

Queenstown,   in   reference  to   socialist   forces,

qualified   it   with   the  adjective   "progressive"

socialist  forces.  Sir,  we  who  are  familiar  with

Marxist  literature are quite clear in our  own  minds

what is the significance of this word.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the general statement of the Barisan Sosialis

was  set  out  in aggressive and indeed  in  truculent

terms.  The tone of the statement was not  that  of  a

group of people who want to reach real agreement  with

the  Federation  Government to effect  merger.  Rather

they displayed the mood of a group of angry young  men

setting  out to tell the Tunku just where he got  off.

May I quote -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There seems to be some interference

from  earphones which have not been turned off. I  do

not   know  whether  Members  can  trace  them.  Will

Members just turn off any earphone that has not  been

turned  off?  I am sorry about the interruption,  Dr

Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> May I quote some extracts, Sir?

Indeed  the  Member for Queenstown has obliged  me  by

reading  out the more truculent bit of the  statement

without   perhaps   realising  its  implication.   The

statement said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We fully realise that many of the policies of the

present  Right-wing Government in the  Federation  are

unacceptable to us. The present Federation  Government

in  close alliance with foreign capital has bound  the

country to the so-called British/Malaya mutual defence

treaty, turned the motherland into a military base for

British armed forces ...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Vice-Chairman of the Barisan

Sosialis.  Mr  Sidney Woodhull, when talking  to  the

Naval  Base  Workers  Union,  advocated  a  policy  of

continuation  of  the  British  Defence  Services   in

Singapore. To continue, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Federation's foreign policy has alienated our

country  from  the main stream of Asia.  Its  internal

policies  are repressive particularly to trade  unions

and  intellectuals  [these are  the  terms  which  the

Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



Queenstown  did not read out]. Freedom of  expression,

organisation and other civil liberties are curbed  and

its education policy is misguided.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, they stated that they were prepared to

accept  merger  under  these  conditions  provided  it

occurs  immediately  and  is followed  by  pan-Malayan

general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one is going to take statements of this sort

as  a  genuine and sincere attempt to solve  the  very

difficult  problem  that exists in  relations  between

Singapore  (with its preponderant Chinese  population)

and  the  Federation of Malaya, where political  power

rests  mainly with the Malays. This kind of  approach,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I suggest, is intended  to  incite

trouble and not seek concord and agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may go back to the subject of citizenship.

I  refer  briefly  to  the radio  forum  of  the  21st

September in which both the Member for Queenstown  and

I  took  part.  He  said that I was either  trying  to

deceive him or else I got my facts wrong. Sir, neither

of this is true. The forum was recorded on the evening

of  Tuesday, 19th September, and on the previous  day,

18th  September, the Barisan Sosialis' view on  merger

was splashed as headlines in the Straits Times. May  I

read  an extract of Mr Lim Ching Siong's view on what

he  meant  by  a  full and complete  merger  with  the

Federation?   He  said  that  "this  was   a   genuine

reunification of our country and our peoples  and  the

entry  of Singapore into the Federation as one of  its

constituent states like Malacca or Penang with all its

citizens  automatically  becoming  citizens   of   the

Federation."   I  pointed  out  in   the   forum   the

inconsistencies of this so-called true merger plan. If

they wanted Singapore to be treated in the same way as

Penang  and  Malacca, then obviously  the  citizenship

laws   applicable  to  those  States  must  apply   to

Singapore.  In  this  event,  only  persons  born   in

Singapore  would  acquire automatic  citizenship.  The

others would be disenfranchised and have to get on  to

the  electoral list, if they wanted to, by the process

of registration. This is what I said.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis then realised that they had

perpetrated  a  howler. Henceforth from  that  moment,

there  was  no  more  reference either  to  Penang  or

Malacca. The reason is simple, Sir. They wanted to  be

treated  even more favourably than Penang or  Malacca.

They invoked Article 22 of the Federal Constitution to

say  that this is a perfectly possible proposition.  I

expect  if  we use the word "possible" in  its  widest

sense, they are right. But dealing in a real world and

with  practical  people,  its  possibility  is  purely

academic. The Tunku has put it quite nicely.  He  said

he  could  agree, if he would, but he would  not.  And

there the matter ends, unless the Barisan Sosialis can

say  just  how the Tunku and the Federation Government

can be persuaded to change their minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our discussions with the Federation Government,

it  was made clear to us that Penang and Malacca  were

treated with special consideration. Further, they were

part  of  the  Federation at the time of  merger,  and

indeed  since  1948. Residence in  Penang  or  Malacca

would  count  as residence in the Federation,  because

these  territories  had been part of  the  Federation.

Residence  in  Singapore in the past,  say,  12  years

might  well  not  be considered as  residence  in  the

Federation,  for the simple reason that  Singapore  is

not yet part of the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to go into the complexities of

the  law. But what the Barisan Sosialis must establish

and prove is that Singapore citizens have been reduced

to  a  second-class status. What are they losing after

merger?  The  Member  for Queenstown  considered  this

answer  and  agreed  that no Singapore  citizen  loses

anything.  Every  citizen gains  something.  The  most

obvious and immediate gain is that he has the right to

vote for the Central Parliament, the right to stand as

a  candidate  to this Parliament. How can  this  be  a

phoney merger if Singapore citizens have the right  to

vote  for and stand in the Federation Parliament, and,

at   the  same  time,  we  retain  all  the  essential

powers - reserve powers - which are necessary to keep  our

entrepot economy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



going,  to  ensure  that  our  education  system   and

policies are acceptable to parents and students?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in his preliminary remarks, the Member for

Queenstown  gave  a highly distorted  account  of  the

recent  political events in Singapore. May  I  refresh

the  memories  of  Members of this House  by  a  brief

summary? He said that there had been a serious decline

in  the  original  massive  majority  of  the  P.A.P.

Government  in this House. As a result  of  this,  the

P.A.P. raised  the bogey of Communism to  divert  the

attention  of  the people from their dire predicament.

This  technique,  he claimed, is  a  familiar  one  to

dictatorial regimes clutching desperately at any straw

for  its  survival. Thus the P.A.P. clutched  at  the

straw of merger, and immediately made the proposal  to

the   Tunku.  The  Tunku  became  convinced  of  their

argument that a take-over by pro-Communist elements in

Singapore  was imminent and therefore his intervention

was  necessary  in  the interests  of  the  Federation

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, and this is the point I must rebut, he

said  that  the  P.A.P. went  through  the  intricate

exercise  of  manipulating the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation  of  Malaya  solely  with  the  object  of

getting  the  Federation Government  to  do  what  the

Member  called  the  dirty  work  for  them.  He   was

referring  to the incarceration of political opponents

of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, this summary sets out fairly the

thesis  of the Member for Queenstown. His account,  of

course, was punctuated by frequent personal attacks on

the  person  of the Prime Minister. Sir, he repeatedly

warned the House that we are desperate men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that this

seemingly  damning and devastating indictment  of  the

Government was met not by machine-gun fire expected of

dictators  in  desperation,  but  with  outbursts   of

merriment  in  which  the Member  himself  on  several

occasions took part. Indeed, on one occasion,  he  was

so  seized with laughter that you had to come  to  his

rescue.  Sir, if we were men of desperation, I suggest

we  would not meet calumnies of this kind with  gentle

laughter. We would have been, in fact,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



we  were - [Interruption] Sir, misbehaviour? If I  may

be permitted to continue, Mr Speaker, Sir? If we were

a  dictatorial  regime, a bunch  of  toughs  that  the

Member for Queenstown made us out to be, we might have

seen  the  sinister figure of the Minister  for  Home

Affairs  departing from this Chamber  to  the  nearest

telephone  to  summon  his strong-arm  squad  to  deal

expeditiously with the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> On a point of order, Sir.

I  wonder  whether it is in order for the Minister  to

read his speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must confess I have not noticed that

the  Minister has, in fact, been reading, but  he  has

been referring to his notes a great deal, perhaps just

as much as the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> At least he

has the credit of writing it himself.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the truth is that we are not

desperate  men,  because we have  no  reason  to  feel

desperate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Nee Soon):</b> All mad people say

that!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Queenstown, and I

think  the Member for Nee Soon too, seem to  be  under

the  illusion that our fortunes are irretrievably lost

while  the red star of the Barisan Sosialis  rises  in

the ascendancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what reasons have induced such a

state of euphoria in the hon. Member's mind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Hold a mass rally and you will

find out!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Indeed, Sir, they held a series

of  mass  rallies and they had to abandon them because

two  or three hundred people turned up. They tried  to

blame us for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I were the Member for Queenstown, far from

experiencing  a  state of euphoria, I would  view  the

future with the gravest forebodings, for I see in it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



nothing  to  justify any elation on his  part.  May  I

explain  myself? The Member for Queenstown is a  chess

player, as I have said that before, and I will  use  a

sample  chess  analogy to explain to him  the  trouble

that he and his colleagues are in.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir.

We  are  discussing the trouble in which this  country

might  be. Can we refrain from discussing the  Barisan

Sosialis' trouble and stick to the motion?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have not, at the moment, spotted

anything which is irrelevant to the amendment. I think

the Minister is probably leading up to the point which

was made by the Barisan Sosialis Member in support  of

the amendment. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I would have thought that

the relevance is both immediate and clear, because  it

was the Member for Queenstown who brought up all these

points  and  came to the conclusion that  it  is  the

wicked Government which cooked up merger in a hurry in

order  to  fix them. I am just trying to explain  that

that is not the position, and that what trouble we are

in now is as a result, of their own stupidities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may continue, Sir, to pursue my chess analogy.

There  is  in  the game of chess a position  known  as

zugzwang [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must confess that that word is

completely  strange  to me, and I ask  the  Minister's

assurance that it is parliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is not only parliamentary

but  immediately relevant, because a  player,  as  the

Member  for  Queenstown knows, who is in  a  state  of

zugzwang finds that whatever moves he makes results in

immediate  calamity. Sir, to reduce an  opponent  into

this rather dreadful state, a chess player does not go

charging  recklessly across the chessboard  as  if  he

were  a  rugger forward - another accomplishment  of

the  Member  for  Queenstown. A chess player  makes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



a number   of  fine  moves  whereby  his  pieces  occupy

dominant squares on the board while his opponent  gets

progressively  more  and more constricted.  I  suggest

that  the  Member  for Queenstown and  his  colleagues

should  review  their  position in  a  more  realistic

manner.  They  should plant their feet firmly  on  the

ground  and  ask themselves where they get from  here.

They will suddenly discover that they are in zugzwang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when they staged their treacherous defection

from  the  Party, they were confident  that  with  the

support  of  the  Communists  they  could  bring   the

Government   down,   force  a  general   election   in

Singapore, and take over the government. It  is  clear

that  this plan of theirs, which they blithely  called

the  October  Revolution, has grossly  misfired.  When

October  came to a close and they were asked  what  of

their October Revolution, they replied - and they  were

correct  historically - that the October  Revolution  in

Russia  took place in November. Sir, we still  have  a

few  more days left of November, but I am afraid  that

the sands of time are running out very fast.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You sound nervous.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Who said that? Sir, the Member

for Thomson should reserve any anxiety he may feel for

his own person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is in office and it is not

within  their power to throw it out of office.  Merger

is  around  the  corner,  as an inevitable  historical

process.  What  could  they  expect  after  merger?  I

suggest to them - that is, the non-Communists  in  the

Barisan Sosialis, and nobody is suggesting that  every

member  of that Party is a Communist - that they  should

review  their relations with the Communists  and  stop

pretending, as the Member for Queenstown is now doing,

that  Communism  is  merely a bogey  invented  by  the

P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody knows that when the P.A.P. was formed

in  1954,  it was heavily infiltrated right  from  the

beginning by the Communists and their sympathisers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Dissidents, not Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The years 1954-55 was one phase

in  Singapore.  It  was a phase of  the  anti-colonial

struggle.  We have explained many times  in  the  past

that   in  this  phase  the  common  enemy  were   the

colonialists and that all those who hated them had  to

gang  up  to  fight them. For the P.A.P., this  was  a

difficult period, because in the minds of many  people

we  had  been completely identified with the Communist

cause.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now on the amendment and

I  am  just wondering how what the Minister is  saying

ties up with the amendment. I just have not got it  at

the  moment.  Perhaps  the  Minister  would  like   to

explain.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> My line of argument, briefly, is

this.  The  Barisan  Sosialis, in  all  its  political

propaganda  line,  has been saying  that  merger,  the

agreement that we have come to with the Tunku, was  as

a  result  of certain fears that we instilled  in  his

mind  about Communism, that the Communist fear is only

a  bogey,  that  it is not a threat to Singapore,  and

that  we  have  raised  this bogey  for  our  personal

interest in order that the Tunku can come and suppress

our   political  opponents.  My  point  is  that   the

existence  of Communists is a reality and, more  than

any  other  people, we can testify to their  existence

and to the reality of the Communist threat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was just wondering whether that line

of  argument would not be better advanced when we deal

with  the substantive motion. We are now dealing  with

the  amendment which suggests that "this House affirms

and  declares  that the first objective  of  all  true

patriots of Malaya is to achieve the reunification  of

these two territories in a genuine merger of Singapore

with the Federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering

the  Federation as the twelfth state and with all  its

Citizens  automatically becoming Federal Citizens  on

Merger Day."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just wondering whether the debate could not be

confined  to  the question of Singapore  entering  the

Federation as the twelfth state with all its  Citizens

automatically becoming Federal Citizens on Merger Day.

Dr Goh. [Interruption].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I think it is only fair that

since   the  Member  for  Queenstown  has   made   his

allegation -  not once but repeatedly - at least  today  I

should have the opportunity to rebut his arguments.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the procedure is not known to

the Minister. If the Minister just confines himself to

the  amendment,  then  when we do  come  back  to  the

substantive motion he will have another opportunity of

speaking. [Interruption]. The Prime Minister  may,  if

he likes to, speak on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> If I may explain it? My

colleague, the Minister for Finance, is suffering from

a  heavy cold, and for that reason he did not hear the

Member  for  Queenstown. I think  he  is  having  some

difficulty  hearing  you  also,  Mr  Speaker.  I  was

explaining to him the point you have made. I think the

point the Minister for Finance wishes to make is this.

The  amendment  moved by the Member for Queenstown  is

that  Singapore should go in as the twelfth  State  of

the Federation, with automatic conversion of Singapore

citizens  to  Federation citizens. The point  that  my

colleague, the Minister for Finance, wishes to make is

that  the Federation Government is fully aware of whom

it  is taking in as the twelfth State, and who are the

persons  who  are clamouring for automatic conversion,

and  they  include Communists. That is the point  that

requires to be made.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Now I see the point. The Minister then

is indicating to the House that it is not possible for

Singapore to enter the Federation as the twelfth State

with  all its citizens automatically becoming  Federal

citizens  because  of the Communist threat.  Yes,  Dr

Goh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 340,000 Communists!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, as I was saying, the period

1954-55 was one phase in Singapore. It was a phase  of

the straight anti-colonial struggle. We have explained

that in this phase the common enemy we faced were  the

colonialists, and all those who hated them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



had to gang up to fight them. For the P.A.P., this

was  a  most difficult period. It was not possible

on  our  part  to break away from the  Communists,

because  this  would seriously  weaken  the  anti-colonial  struggle. When we went along with  them,

we  ran  certain risks - the risk of suppression  by

force  and  political detention.  Those  risks  we

took, for there was no other way out. At the  same

time, we attempted to minimise the risk by drawing

quite  clearly the line between the pro-Communists

and  the  non-Communists. As  early  as  1955,  we

pointed  out  that in Malaya, then under  colonial

rule,  there was a three-cornered fight  going  on

between  the  British, Malayan nationals  and  the

Communists.  We made it quite clear at  that  time

that  we  did not want a Communist Malaya.  May  I

quote  from  an  article  in  the  P.A.P.'s  First

Souvenir  Number  dated  November  1955,  by   the

Secretary-General:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. was formed with the object of

rallying   the  forces  which  are  striving   for

independence. It is the vehicle for all those  who

seek to build a free and democratic Malaya. We  do

not  want a colonial Malaya because we do not want

to  build Malaya whose resources are developed for

the  benefit of the British people. We do not want

a  Communist Malaya because we do not want  a  one

party  State. We believe that the best way for  us

is  an  independent, democratic and  non-Communist

Malaya.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the P.A.P. was in the Opposition, the

task  before us was a straight one - to wrest  power

from  the British with the aid and support of  all

those  who  were prepared to fight them, including

the Communists. While the objective was clear, the

method of operation needed to be carefully mapped.

Having  the  Communists  with  you  in  the  anti-colonial  struggle,  or  indeed  in  any  form  of

struggle,  you  have to take certain  precautions.

First, to ensure that they do not swallow you  up.

Second,  in  the event they stray away  from  your

policy of constitutional struggle -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I do

apologise for interrupting the hon. Member, but it

seems  to me, Sir, that this history of the P.A.P.

has nothing to do with the motion. I do ask you to

consider it, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood the Minister to say

that  he  is leading up to the point that  amongst

those  citizens  who are claiming  to  be  Federal

citizens  automatically on Merger Day,  there  are

the  Communists  who  have  been  building  up  in

Singapore.  If  I am right, then, of  course,  the

Minister is in order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is one

of  our  difficulties. If the position  were  such

that  there were no Communists around  us,  that

the whole thing was a myth and a bogey, then a lot

of  the  difficulties which we have  to  encounter

would not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to explain the nature of these

difficulties, I must pursue this little narrative.



We  have  to take precautions to ensure  that  the

Communists do not swallow us up. Secondly, in  the

event  that  they stray away from your  policy  of

constitutional  struggle and launch  into  a  wild

adventure   on   their  own,   you   should   take

precautions  that  in the event  of  action  being

taken  against  them, those who  decide  how  such

action is to be taken understand that there  is  a

difference  between the Communists  and  the  non-Communists. Sir, in our experience, we have  found

the greatest difficulty in carrying out operations

of this kind, which are both complex and risky. We

can  reduce the risks but cannot totally eliminate

them.  One of the ways in which the risks  can  be

reduced is to make as clear as is possible -



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point

of order. I would like to seek your advice whether

we  could go back to the quotation of the Minister

just  now.  He  made a quotation  from  the  Prime

Minister's   speech   in  the  First   Anniversary

Souvenir  copy of the P.A.P., and he  only  quoted

one part of it. Is it in order for me, Sir, to ask

him to quote the other part?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Of course, it would have been in

order if the hon. Member had got up in time. He is

a bit late, Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> As I have said, the risks

involved   in   making  common  cause   with   the

Communists can be reduced if we can make  clear - as

clear as is possible in the circumstances - the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



dividing  line  between the Communists and  ourselves.

And this must be done not only in words. It should  be

done by overt action from which a reasonable and well-informed man can draw his inferences. As you can  well

imagine,   Sir,  this  whole  business  involves   the

practice  of the art of brinkmanship to a high  degree

of  skill.  For without this very necessary safeguard,

and  indeed some element of sheer good luck, it  could

well  have  been the fate of the P.A.P. to  have  been

swallowed  up long ago by the Communists, or  to  have

been  suppressed,  banned, and its leaders,  including

the  non-Communists, incarcerated long ago. So we took

the precaution and we survived. Now being Ministers of

State  we  have been able to check that the margin  of

escape had been much narrower and more hazardous  than

we ourselves had imagined at the times the events took

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect the policy of the P.A.P. then

differed  directly from the line the Barisan  Sosialis

is  taking.  When  the Prime Minister  was  then  the'

Member for Tanjong Pagar in the Opposition, he had  on

several   occasions  to  speak  on  the  subject   of

Communists and their relations with the Party, on  the

future  of  Singapore and Malaya in the three-cornered

struggle between the British, the nationalists and the

Communists.  And a great deal of what he said  in  the

past  is  relevant to the issues that we are  debating

today. Because it is the existence of Communists, many

of  whom have taken citizenship in Singapore, that  we

find   reluctance  on  the  part  of  the   Federation

Government  in  matters of citizenship  proposals.  We

have  never  gone  as far as the Barisan  Sosialis  in

denying, as they now deny, the existence of Communists

or  dismissing them as bogeys. We accepted  that  they

were  a  real force to be reckoned with, but that  the

question of identifying a man as a Communist  was  not

an  easy one. In one of his speeches, the then  Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar said - and here I am  only  speaking

From recollection -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hansard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He said that no Communist would

ever admit -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir. So far

I  do  not see any reference to the amendment  in  his

speech.  I  do not find any relevance to the amendment

to the motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I have just heard the Member

say something about those Communists who have obtained

Singapore citizenship. Am I right?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I cannot see how that is irrelevant.

Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, our trouble and indeed the

trouble  of  any  government,  is  to  say  who  is  a

Communist and who is not. That is the question between

the  man and God. Between God and him, however,  there

lies  the Special Branch whose business it is to  find

out  what is going on. The Special Branch consists  of

professional officers who are experienced in  tracking

Communist subversion in all its multifarious forms. In

security  matters, it is usually the Minister  of  the

Interior  of  the Government who decides  what  to  do

after  he  has been furnished with appraisals  by  his

professional  officers. The position in  Singapore  is

somewhat  different, because the supreme authority  in

these matters is the Internal Security Council and not

my  colleague,  the Minister for Home  Affairs.  After

merger,  it  would be the Minister of the Interior  of

the  Government of the Federation who decide on  these

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am going to say about the risks of

playing  with  the Communists and the difficulties  of

identifying  them is not what the Federation  Minister

of  the  Interior told me. He is a personal friend  of

mine  and, indeed, a former contemporary of the Member

for  Queenstown iii the College of Medicine. I do  not

discuss  security  matters with the  Minister  of  the

Interior,  and, of course, it would be quite  improper

for me to try and ascertain what his opinions are.  My

views  on the hazards of the course of action  decided

upon by the Barisan Sosialis and the general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



problem  of working with the Communists are  based  on

the personal experience of myself and other colleagues

of  mine in the People's Action Party before we formed

the  Government. For the Barisan Sosialis are  now  in

the same position that we were in in the old days, and

much  of  the considerations that we took into account

apply  with equal force now, and with the prospect  of

merger perhaps with even greater force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the Minister of the Interior a moment

ago.  He  did  make a remark to me  which  may  be  of

interest to the Member for Queenstown. The last time I

played  a  round of golf with him in Kuala Lumpur,  he

enquired after the Member for Queenstown. He asked  me

whether  the man was in his right mind. I hastened  to

the  defence of the Member and said that Singapore can

be  an  excitable place at times and  people  do  tend

somewhat to lose their sense of proportion. I  do  not

know  whether the Minister of the Interior had in mind

any  special  activity on the part of the  Member  for

Queenstown, or whether he was merely making  a  casual

reference to a previous occasion when all three of  us

met. That occasion is worth recollecting. It was at  a

cocktail party on National Day -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are all these details really relevant to

the  motion we are discussing? I cannot see  how  they

are relevant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, in matters of application of

citizenship  wh  re,  for  instance,  the  Member  for

Queenstown  is  not  horn  in  Singapore  but  in  the

Federation,  where there is a case for believing  that

he  is  playing an important role in a Communist-front

organisation,  I  suggest that relations  between  the

Member for Queenstown and the Minister of the Interior

of  the Federation are of some significance. The whole

attitude, if you will allow me, of this narrative  has

a  moral. It shows that the approach of the Member for

Queenstown in this matter is just "out of this world".

He does not understand what is going on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is a pity that the Minister

is  associating  this very interesting narrative  with

the Member for Queenstown, because it seems to me that

he  is now touching on perhaps the personal conduct of

the  Member for Queenstown. If he wishes to do so,  he

has  to file a substantive motion. If the Minister had

started  this narrative and spoken of a character  not

associated  with  the  Member  for  Queenstown,   then

perhaps he would have been in order to illustrate  his

point. But I have already indicated that I do not wish

to have any personalities in this debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, may I be of

assistance?  I  think  my  colleague  is  finding   it

difficult to follow you because he is having  a  heavy

cold.  It  happens to be true, and he is  supposed  to

consult a doctor. The point is quite simple, Sir.  The

persons  who  hope  to  smuggle  themselves  into  the

Federal  citizenship  clause by  automatic  conversion

include,  among others, those not born  in  Singapore,

like  the  Member for Queenstown. The point  that  my

colleague was wanting to make is this. That  not  only

is  the  Federation  Government anxious  to  see  that

Communists  do not get Federation citizenship  in  the

process  of  reapplication for registration - I  do  not

think  I  am giving away any secret when I  say  this;

their   policy  is  quite  clear-cut - but  that   no

Communist gets his registration through; and the point

my  colleague wants to make is, so will neo-Communists

or those who assist the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think that is appreciated by everybody.

But my point is that the Minister was talking about  a

cocktail   party,  which  is,  of  course,  completely

irrelevant. If he just sticks to the moral to be drawn

from  these matters, then that is all right; he is  in

order.  But  when he talks about cocktail parties  and

little  social gatherings like that, he is going  into

details which takes him away from the motion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I suggest that relations

between the Minister of the Interior of the Federation

Government  and  the leader of the largest  Opposition

party is a matter of some relevance to this matter. If

they get on well together,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



then  there  is  implicit  trust  between  them.  Then

certain  attitudes of mind would form in the minds  of

the Ministers in the Federation. But if, on the other

hand,  attitudes are different, then we  could  expect

the  same  difficulties to arise  over  this  problem.

However,  Sir,  if you think that I should  skip  over

these matters, I will do so.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have never suggested that the

Minister  should skip over the matters, if by  matters

he  means the matters which have been touched upon  by

the  Prime Minister. They are very important  matters.

What  I  am  trying  to stop is  the  bringing  in  of

personalities. That must stop.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the point is this. Perhaps I

have  not made myself clear. The relationship  between

the  Minister  of the Interior and the leader  of  the

largest Opposition party is a matter of some relevance

in  what  is  going  on between the  two  Governments,

because the Member for Queenstown is believed by  many

people,  including  people  in  high  office  in   the

Federation,   to  be  lea-ding  Communist   open-front

organisation,  and  he  is one  of  the  persons  born

outside Singapore who would automatically qualify  for

citizenship under the proposals of the amended motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is looking at the

Speaker  in  such  a way that he is  inviting  perhaps

further  comment. I think a statement of  that  nature

introduces the personal conduct of Members. Under  our

Standing  Orders, the personal conduct of  Members  of

the  Assembly shall not be referred to except  upon  a

substantive  motion  moved for that  purpose.  I  have

indicated  that  if  the  Minister  had  mentioned  an

abstract  case,  not  pin-pointing  a  Member  of  the

Assembly, then he would have been in order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, it is not personal conduct

in   the  sense  that  there  is  anything  derogatory

attached   to  it.  I  just  wanted  to  relate   some

conversation between the Minister of the Interior and

the  Member  for  Queenstown to  show  that  relations

between them are not what they should be and could  be

a cause of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



difficulty in the future. I will not press the point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will return to my principal theme, which is that

the  Member for Queenstown charged us - and this  is  a

most serious allegation which he made several times in

the  course  of  his  address - as wanting  to  egg  the

Federation Government on or connive with them to bring

about   merger   in  order  to  swipe  our   political

opponents. Sir, that is a very serious charge.  We  of

the P.A.P. have done and will do no such thing. Events

must  take their inevitable course, for the  folly  of

our   adversaries   will   bring   about   their   own

retribution. For these reasons, perhaps we may discuss

these  matters  in order to save as many  of  them  as

possible from future agony by pointing out the dangers

lurking  ahead  and how they may be avoided.  In  the

event  the Barisan Sosialis fail or prove unsuccessful

in  avoiding these dangers, then may I say  that  they

could  hardly  blame us, for now we  are  making - I  am

making  a  special  effort to  save  them  from  these

dangers.   Sir,  one  way  of  getting   round   these

difficulties   is,   as   I   said   before,    adroit

brinkmanship. In this regard, Sir, we may ask how  the

Member   for  Queenstown  has  measured  up   in   his

performance  of brinkmanship. Judging by  the  address

that  we have just heard, I would venture to say  that

he  has  not even learnt the elements of the game.  He

has  been as adroit as a blind elephant. Nor  are  his

colleagues any better. Far from attempting to draw the

line  between  himself and the Communists,  they  have

gone  out of their way to blur the line. In fact, they

have  decided, for practical purposes, to provide  the

Communists  with 100 per cent cover.  As  an  example,

they  have  derided the recent broadcast of the  Prime

Minister on Communist activities as smear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's broadcast was a factual account

of  Communist activities in Singapore as he knew them.

Persons  were  identified. If what the Prime  Minister

had said was not true, then these persons have a legal

redress  in a court of law at which the Prime Minister

will have to substantiate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



truth  of  his statements, failing which the aggrieved

party stands to gain considerable sums of money in the

way of damages for defamation of character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is widely known. Yet the Member for

Queenstown and other Barisan Sosialis leaders  dismiss

this account as a smear. The Member for Queenstown has

repeatedly said that this is merely raising the  bogey

of  Communism. If the communists are mere bogeys, then

it  means, in effect, that they are non-existent. Does

the Member for Queenstown seriously suggest that there

are  no  Communists in Singapore? The Communists  have

been  able  to  mount  a  military  campaign  of  some

dimension in the Federation of Malaya, which has taken

a  large armed force some ten years to suppress.  They

have  mounted  strikes  and  riots  in  Singapore   at

periodical intervals since 1946. Where have  they  all

gone  to?  Have they, like the Arabs, folded up  their

tents and disappeared into the night?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the P.A.P. who have been working with these

people say that they are right in our midst. Does  the

Member for Queenstown really believe that this is  not

the  case?  The Member for Queenstown,  in  trying  to

explain  why such rapid progress had been made  toward

merger,  said that the P.A.P. has led the  Tunku  into

the  belief that without merger there would be a take-over of the State by the pro-Communist groups; and the

Tunku, formerly indifferent or even hostile to merger,

has  now  accepted it as necessary and in the interest

of  the Federation to frustrate the aspiration of  the

Communists.  The  Tunku  has  himself  expressed  this

belief  in  public not once but on several  occasions,

both in Malaya and abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was the Tunku brought to this state of mind? The

Member  for  Queens-town places the whole  credit  for

this  on  the Prime Minister. May I suggest  that  his

explanation is altogether too naive? It is at the same

time  unduly  complimentary to the Prime  Minister  as

well  as  unduly  derogatory of the Tunku.  The  Tunku

possesses a shrewdness of judgment of which the Member

for Queenstown is completely unaware.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real fact of the matter is that it is the

Communists who have succeeded in convincing the  Tunku

that   early  merger  is  to  the  interests  of  both

Singapore and the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall what happened during the Anson by-election. The Member for Queenstown himself here has

made  reference to some incidents. But he  can  hardly

expect us to accept his interpretation of events  that

took  place. The Tunku made certain general  proposals

about  Greater Malaysia which the P.A.P. supported  in

principle,  if Greater Malaysia would lead  to  merger

between   Singapore   and   the   Federation.   Almost

immediately, Mr Lim Ching Siong, on the  other  hand,

came out with a counter proposal for complete internal

self-government as the next constitutional advance for

Singapore  - in  addition  to complete  internal  self-government, that steps should be taken to abolish  the

Internal  Security  Council.  Sir,  before  long,  the

Communists  suddenly  got the idea  that  the  Greater

Malaysia  Plan  had  been  completely  worked  out  in

detail,  had  been  agreed to and signed  by  all  the

Governments  concerned. It would be  curious  to  know

what  had  led them to this belief, but the fact  that

they  so believed is beyond doubt. We the P.A.P. felt

the full repercussions of their activities whilst they

came to this conclusion. Our Parliamentary Secretaries

who  were flirting with pro-Communist groups  at  that

time  pressed Ministers for a full, frank and complete

revelation of the Greater Malaysia Plan. They were  so

certain  that we had agreed to it that they would  not

accept  any denial on our part whatsoever.  They  were

certain  that  some secret document was locked  up  in

somebody's  safe  containing all the  details  of  the

super merger, whose sole intention, according to these

groups,  was to have the Communists fixed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when they came to this belief which turned out in the end

to  be completely without foundation, as they realised

it  themselves  today,  there was  a  general  rampage

throughout   Singapore - the  unions,  party   branches,

associations  and elsewhere. In so doing they  clearly

revealed their intentions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



their  fears  and  apprehensions, and disclosed  their

hand. If nothing else was needed to convince the Tunku

that  merger  was  necessary, then  the  extraordinary

conduct  of the pro-Communist groups and their  allies

during  and after the Anson by-election just  provided

that  final  conclusive  bit  of  evidence  that   was

necessary to convince the Tunku.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Merger is now before us. The Communists and

their  front men want to frustrate it. They  have  two

ways  of  doing  so, each of which will prove  equally

unprofitable   and  unavailing.  For  merger   is   an

inevitable historical process and cannot be checked by

manoeuvres of groups or frustrated by the ambitions of

a few. These groups, however, if they choose, can play

it  the constitutional way, abiding by the Queensberry

rules.  If  they  so  choose to  do,  we  too  in  the

Government will abide by Queensberry rules. But if, as

the  Prime  Minister  has said, they  go  for  Siamese

boxing,  then  they need not have any  doubt  that  an

adequate  reply will be forthcoming. The choice  rests

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Sir, I conclude my address with

this  advice  to those non-Communists in  the  Barisan

Sosialis - to study the art of brinkmanship, or  better

still, to hop it while the going is good.



<br><br>7.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had not

thought  of participating in the debate so early,  but

as  there  is  a  possibility that the trend  of  this

debate  may  create misunderstanding in the  minds  of

people in the Federation with whom we all long  to  be

friends,  I  feel that I must speak at this particular

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis said

yesterday  that a new star was born. Sir,I know  very

little  about  stars and "starology", or whatever  you

call  it. As far as I know, stars are not born at all.

They  just rise in the firmament, In fact, stars  have

no  parentage. So stars are not born. But if they  say

that  a  star is born, then perhaps they mean  a  film

star; and the performance of the leader of the Barisan

Sosialis yesterday and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



today  for  about 7�  hours does not, in our  view,

qualify him for an Oscar, because it is repetitive and

in certain parts highly indiscreet -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Gone with the wind!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But I do not blame them for all

the  mistakes they have made, and I will explain  why,

Sir.  The  Minister for Labour, in moving  the  motion

which is of such an important character, has found  it

necessary, in spite of the claim that the P.A.P. has a

Ministry  of Culture, to dare the Barisan Sosialis  to

declare  their stand, and they try to cast  doubts  in

the  minds of Members of the Assembly that the Barisan

Sosialis are people who say one thing and mean another

thing -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It has now become quite apparent

that  hon.  Members will not be able to  draw  a  line

between the main substantive motion and the amendment.

I  appreciate the difficulty because the subjects  are

intertwined.  There is, of course, another  procedural

method  of overcoming that, and that is that the  vote

on  the  amendment could be taken at the  end  of  the

complete debate, so that if hon. Members then wish  to

speak on the main motion and on the amendment together

they  can do so. The only difference is that they  can

make  only  one speech. The only person who can  reply

will   be  the  Minister  who,  in  fact,  moved   the

substantive  motion.  That is  the  procedural  device

which perhaps Members should think about, if that is a

better  way of dealing with the subject, then  I  will

rule  that  that  should be done. But  if  we  are  to

continue on the line that we are to debate only on the

amendment,  then I am afraid Members will get  out  of

order,  as  the Minister for Finance has  and  as  the

Member  for  Cairnhill is about to do.  I  would  like

views on that procedural device.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Could I ask for some clarification,

Sir?  Yesterday, if you remember, you said  you  would

permit us to debate on what are now items 1 and 3  and

the amendment to item 4. If we accept your suggestion,

Sir, would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



those  speaking on the present amendment have to cover

the entire field of items 1, 3 and 4, or could we just

cover item 1 with its amendment, and when the question

is  proposed we may be allowed to deal with item 3 and

the amendment to item 4?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. The suggestion I make is that the

ruling I made yesterday should stand, except paragraph

3 -  "Debate  will then be confined to this amendment."

That  is all. If it is convenient for Members to  deal

with  the  whole aspect of merger, including  now  the

aspect  which is indicated in the amendment which  has

been  proposed to item 1, then I am prepared  to  make

the  ruling  that  that should  be  so.  But  I  might

indicate  that  that would mean that Members  who  now

speak  would only be given one speech, and at the  end

of all speeches, the Minister for Labour will have the

right to reply and votes can he taken not only on item

1,  but  also on this present amendment, and again  on

item  3  and the amendment as shown in item 4.  It  is

only a matter of convenience.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak

on  the amendment and reserve my right to speak on the

main motion at a later stage.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is all right as far as I am

concerned,  but  if  the  Member  for  Cairnhill  goes

outside the amendment, then he will be pulled up. That

is all there is to it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With due respect, Sir, I did not.

What  I was doing was to try to find a reason for  the

blistering  attack  which the leader  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  had levelled against the P.A.P. on a  motion

that  is of such an important character that we should

all  of  us sink our differences, and think and debate

together whether or not it is in the best interests of

the  people  of  Singapore to  have  merger  with  the

Federation of Malaya. Instead of which, the debate has

turned  into a fight between the ex-P.A.P.,  which  is

now the Barisan Sosialis, and the P.A.P. that remains.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All that the Member for Cairnhill has

said  is  completely irrelevant to the amendment.  The

amendment  merely  suggests  to  the  House  that   it

"affirms and declares that the first objective of  all

true   patriots   of   Malaya  is   to   achieve   the

reunification of these two territories  in  a  genuine

merger  of  Singapore with the Federation  of  Malaya,

with  Singapore entering the Federation as the twelfth

state and with all its citizens automatically becoming

Federal Citizens on Merger Day."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members assure me that the debate can be confined

to  the  amendment, then, of course, we will stick  to

the first ruling.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I rise to oppose the amendment.

But  I want it to be understood clearly in this House,

Sir, that far be it from me and my Party to  come  to

the defence of the P.A.P. that is fast disintegrating,

we  oppose the amendment not because we want to defend

the P.A.P., but we oppose it because we think that the

amendment proposed by the Barisan Sosialis -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>CASE OF SARDARA SINGH,</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FORMER ACTING SERGEANT, SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

only  take  five minutes. I know the  House  will  be

happy to hear that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I acted in a professional capacity

for  a  man  called  Sardara Singh,  a  former  Acting

Sergeant of the Singapore Police Force. The matter  is

ended.  He  has  left Singapore.  I  have  no  further

pecuniary or professional interest in the matter,  nor

any personal interest apart from certain facts which I

have  gleaned  which,  to my mind,  raise  very  grave

public issues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, you have indicated that it might

possibly  be  deemed improper  for  me  to  bring

forward  a  matter in which I have professionally

acted in spite of the fact that I have no further

pecuniary interest. In the circumstances, I quite

naturally  am anxious to have even that important

principle clarified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Sir, I would welcome a

reference  of  this matter to  the  Committee  of

Privileges, and until such time as the  Committee

of  Privileges  decides the  issue,  the  subject

matter  of  my  motion will stay in  abeyance.  I

would like to invite, if I may, Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Leader of the House, who normally does these

matters,  to move that this subject be  committed

to the Committee of Privileges.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I confirm that

we  have discussed this matter brought up by  the

Member  for Anson and I raise it as a  matter  of

privilege.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have satisfied myself that it is

a  matter prima facie affecting the privileges of

the  House, and I therefore refer the  matter  to

the Committee of Privileges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>
