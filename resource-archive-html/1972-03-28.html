"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure

for  the financial year 1st April, 1972, to  31st

March, 1973, have been considered and approved by

the  House  as  Cmd. Paper No. 3 of  1972.  Under

section 85 of the Constitution of Mr Lee Kuan Yew

(Tanjong Pagar), Prime Minister - on 28th  March,

1972. Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang), Minister

of  State  for  Finance from 29th  March  to  4th

April, 1972.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



Singapore,   heads  of  expenditure  other   than

statutory   expenditure  to  be  met   from   the

Consolidated Fund have to be included in  a  Bill

to  be  known as the Supply Bill. The purpose  of

such a Bill is to provide for the issue from  the

Consolidated Fund of the sums necessary  to  meet

the  expenditure and the appropriation  of  these

sums for the purposes specified therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supply Bill before Members is to give

legislative approval for the issue of funds  from

the  Consolidated  Fund  to  meet  the  sums   of

expenditure  for  the financial year  1st  April,

1972, to 31st



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



March,  1973.  In the Schedule to  the  Bill  are

shown  the various heads of expenditure  and  the

sums  that  may  be incurred in respect  of  each

head.  These have been approved by the  House  in

the  Estimates  of Expenditure for the  financial

year  1st  April, 1972, to 31st March, 1973,  and

appear in pages 49 and 50 of Cmd. Paper No. 3  of

1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Supply Bill is approved, I will be

empowered    to   issue   warrants    authorising

expenditure up to the amount under each  head  as

shown  in  the  Bill  to be  paid  out  from  the

Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1960s witnessed a fundamental shift in

our economy, away from entrepot trade and related

servicing activities to manufacturing. To attract

foreign investment and to accelerate the pace  of

industrialisation,  the Employment  Act  and  the

Industrial  Relations Act of 1968  were  enacted.

Rapid   industrialisation  and  economic   growth

ensued  accompanied by a drastic fall in man-days

lost  through unnecessary work stoppages. Whereas

in  1967  a  total of 41,322 man-days  were  lost

through  industrial strife, in  1968  a  loss  of

11,447 man-days was recorded. In 1969, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>







figure  fell  to  8,512 and,  in  1970,  it  fell

further to 2,514.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the incidence of industrial

accidents  exhibited  an  opposite  trend.  Fatal

accidents rose annually from 68 in 1967 to 159 in

1970,  while  permanent  disablement  cases  rose

persistently  from 598 to 886  between  1967  and

1970. Over the same period, man-days lost through

industrial accidents rose appreciably from 99,539

in 1967 to 302,800 in 1970, an increase of around

300  per  cent.  In our essentially materialistic

society, some employers still think of industrial

accidents only in terms of dollars and  cents.  I

would  remind  these  employers  that  there  are

economic  costs  to  industrial  accidents  which

would  include  loss  of output  of  the  victim,

monetary compensation, cost of damaged equipment,

bottle-necks    in   production   and    training

expenditure  dissipated  through  accidents.  The

most  painful  aspect  of  industrial  accidents,

however,  is  the  human suffering,  anguish  and

misery  caused  by loss of life and  health.  The

loss  of  a  father, a husband, a loved  one  can

never  be compensated. To think otherwise  is  to

brutalise our conscience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of industrial safety and health has

to  be tackled on many fronts. On the legislative

front,  the  existing Factories  Act  enacted  14

years   ago,   when   there   was   hardly    any

manufacturing  industry of note, is  increasingly

adequate  for  our present changed circumstances.

This  Bill seeks to revise and improve  upon  the

Factories Act. Some relevant provisions  of  more

advanced  industrialised countries,  notably  the

United  Kingdom, the United States and Australia,

have been adopted with Xuitab1e modifications  to

fit  our  local  environment. Both the  Singapore

Employers'  Federation and  the  National  Trades

Union  Congress were consulted, and some of their

suggestions have been incorporated in  the  Bill.

Altogether, there are 42 amendments and additions

to  the Factories Act. Consequently, it is neater

to  present  a new Bill rather than amending  the

present  one.  As there are extensive  amendments

and  in  view  of  the Bill's importance,  it  is

proposed to





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



commit   the   Bill  to  a  Select  Committee   of

Parliament so that views of all interested parties

can be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact with

amendments the Factories Act (Cap. 123 of the 1970

Revised Edition) with a view to (a) improving  the

health   and  safety  measures  anti  the  welfare

facilities  of persons employed in factories;  and

(b)  ensuring a more stringent observance  of  the

safety  provisions  so as to reduce  the  rate  of

industrial accidents. The main provisions of  this

Bill are detailed in the Explanatory Statement  to

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, however, to draw attention to some

of  the  more important changes. Clause 94 of  the

Bill  empowers the Minister to appoint an Advisory

Council for Industrial Heath and Safety. Hitherto,

there  was  no  institutional arrangement  through

which advice could be sought on matters pertaining

to  industrial  health  and safety.  The  proposed

Advisory  Council  will have representatives  from

management,  trade unions and professional  bodies

and   will,   therefore,  be  in  a  position   to

collectively  advise  the  Minister   on   matters

affecting  safety,  health  and  welfare



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important innovation introduced by the Bill is the

appointment of safety officers. Clause 64  of  the

Bill  requires certain factories to appoint safety

officers  solely  for  the purpose  of  exercising

general  safety supervision and for promoting  the

safe conduct of work. With the rapid growth of the

number  of  factories in Singapore,  it  would  be

physically impossible for the Factory Inspectorate

to  make regular and periodic inspections  on  all

these  factories. It would therefore be  necessary

to   insist  that  management  police  their   own

factories  and  ensure  that  they  are  safe.  In

addition,  factories employing 50 or more  persons

will  be  required to set up safety committees  to

promote  health,  safety  and  welfare  in   their

establishments.   The   rationale   behind    this

requirement, which is set out in clause 65 of  the

Bill,  is  that both management and  labour  which

will be represented on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



safety   committee  can  jointly  contribute   and

participate in the promotion of industrial safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the Government's anti-pollution

programme,  the  occupier of  a  factory  will  be

required   to  take  special  preventive  measures

against the emission of harmful substances in  the

atmosphere.  He  will  also be  asked  to  provide

appropriate  protection for employees  engaged  in

hazardous processes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 59 of the Bill will require the occupier

to  substitute,  wherever possible,  less  harmful

substances, processes or techniques for their more

harmful  counterparts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also pays greater attention to workers engaged in occupations

involving special risks to health. Under clause 62

of  the Bill, the Minister can make regulations to

require  medical  supervision and  examination  of

persons  employed in work involving special  risks

which  are set out in the Seventh Schedule of  the

Bill.  It has been established that nearly 65  per

cent  of  the  accidents have been caused  by  the

negligence or refusal on the part of the worker to

use  safety  appliances provided and  observe  the

measures  stipulated. Clause 73 of the Bill  makes

it   mandatory   for  employed  persons   to   use

appliances   provided  and  the  safety   measures

instituted.   In  order,  therefore,   that   this

provision  is  strictly observed, it is  necessary

that the culprits are brought to book quickly  and

dealt  with  effectively. Clause 81 of  the  Bill,

therefore,  provides  that any  authorised  police

officer  or  Inspector  of  Factories  may  arrest

without  any warrant any employed person  who  has

contravened clause 73 of the Bill and produce  him

before  a  Magistrate's Court. Alternatively,  the

police officer or Inspector can straightaway issue

a  notice requiring the offender to attend at  the

Magistrate Court to answer the charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill provides for an increase in the

quantum  of fines or term of imprisonment  imposed

for  all  infringements of the Bill. For instance,

under  the  old  Factories Act,  the  penalty  for

operating an unregistered factory was a  fine  not

exceeding $1.000 or a term



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



of  imprisonment not exceeding three months. Under

this  Bill, both the fine and term of imprisonment

have  been  increased  to $5,000  and  six  months

respectively. Similarly, under the Factories  Act,

the   penalty   for  an  employed   person   found

infringing the provisions of the Act is a fine not

exceeding  $500  or  a  term of  imprisonment  not

exceeding   three  months.  This  Bill   has   now

increased  the fine payable to a sum not exceeding

$2,000.  Such  stiffening  of  the  penalties  for

infringements  of  the law is  clearly  needed  if

employers and workers are to be made to understand

and  appreciate that Government means business  in

its  efforts to reduce the high rate of industrial

accidents occurring today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise in support of the Bill, in principle.

The  recent disaster at Jurong, resulting  in  the

death  of  five workers and injuring a  number  of

other workers, clearly underlines the need for the

Factories  Bill which is now before the House.  It

is pointed out in the Explanatory Statement to the

Bill   that   changes   made   to   the   existing

legislation,  which  are now incorporated  in  the

present Bill, are for the purpose of (a) improving

the  health  and safety measures and  the  welfare

facilities in the interest of persons employed  in

factories;  and  (h)  ensuring  a  more  stringent

observance  of  the  safety provisions  so  as  to

reduce the rate of industrial accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I should like to inform the House

that  the  NTUC had been given the opportunity  to

make  representations to the  Ministry  of  Labour

regarding the proposed amendments to the  existing

Factories Act, which are incorporated in the  Bill

before   the  House,  even  though  most  of   its

representations had been rejected by the Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be readily apparent to Members of this

House  that  certain provisions of  the  Bill  are

highly technical and beyond the competence of  any

layman to comment upon without the benefit of  any

professional advice or guidance. As I  have  said,

the Bill deals with topics on which it may not  be

possible  for  any layman to make any intelligible

comment   on   them  without  the   necessary   or

specialised  knowledge and experience  or  without

the  help  of  a  person with such  knowledge  and

experience.  Even  though  the  NTUC   have   been

handicapped   to   a   certain   extent   by   not

understanding   the  full  implications   of   the

proposed Act, they have made a determined  attempt

to  suggest  certain measures which, although  not

incorporated in this Bill, may nevertheless confer

additional   protection   on   the   workers.   I,

therefore, welcome the decision of the Minister to

commit the Bill to a Select Committee. I would not

go beyond that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Sir, I rise in

support of this excellent Bill before this  House.

Students  of economic history are well aware  that

industrial  revolutions in the advanced  countries

in  Britain, Europe, and elsewhere have  all  been

achieved on the basis of the exploitation of cheap

labour  with  little or no consideration  for  the

human factor - the worker, his work and his living

environment.  As  a late corner in  the  field  of

industrialisation, we can, and rightly too,  learn

from the mistakes of others. Had Karl Marx been an

observer in Singapore today, instead of in Britain

in  the 19th century, he would not have found  the

material  to write his Das Kapital, and  we  might

not  see  the Communist regimes that  we  do  find

around  us  today. A free enterprise  capitalistic

system can work in economic terms, but it can work

in  humane  terms  only if there is  a  government

which  is  socialistic in outlook and which  cares

for   the   distribution  of   income,   for   the

environment in which the people have to live,  and

for the health, safety and welfare of the workers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have such a government. I

hope  the  people of Singapore fully realise  this

fact,  and  continue to support such a government.

Because  in our context, with the leeway  that  we

are  giving  to free enterprise to an  essentially

capitalistic economy, a government which does  not

have a socialistic outlook will mean a society  in

which  there  is a lot of injustice and  a  highly

skewed income distribution, a society with all the

elements  of  instability and  all  the  seeds  of

revolution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  have only one small point to raise which I hope

will  be  taken into consideration by  the  Select

Committee. This concerns the question of  training

given   to  inexperienced  workers.  In  a  recent

statement  to the House, the Minister  for  Labour

did  say that one of the major causes of accidents

is  the  lack of proper training given to workers.

But I am rather surprised to see that clause 28 of

the   Bill,  which  is  the  particular  provision

dealing with training of inexperienced workers, is

not  made  more  explicit so as to  enable  easier

enforcement.   It  merely  says  that   sufficient

training  should be given. To what degree  is  the

training "sufficient"? I think it is going to give

rise  to  lots of arguments. I should have thought

that  it  would  be  easier to  impose  a  minimum

training  period or, if that is not  possible,  to

make  a  provision whereby the Minister  would  be

able  to  prescribe from time to  time  rules  and

regulations  in  this regard. A  useful  guideline

could  be that more hazardous processes should  be

subjected to a certain minimum period of training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

(Chapter  73  of  the Revised Edition),  that  the

Government be authorised to accept deposits up  to

a  sum riot exceeding $75 million in amount. As at

January 1972, the total amount of Treasury Deposit

Receipts issued was $38.05 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed that Treasury Deposit Receipts be

issued  to Statutory Authorities to replace  their

Treasury  Bills  and  be  made  available  to  the

banking  sector.  There is  a  sufficiently  large

quantity of surplus funds which are available  for

investment, and money placed on deposit is on  the

increase.   It   is   essential   that   Statutory

Authorities    as   well   as   other    financial

institutions be provided with a secure medium-term

investment outlet for such funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet the anticipated demand for

Treasury Deposit Receipts, it is now desirable  to

raise  the limit from $75 million to $500  million

on  the total sum of money which the Treasury  may

accept  on  deposits. The authority of  Parliament

is,  therefore, requested to enable the Government

to accept deposits to an amount not exceeding $500

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.









<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with

subsection  (1)  of  section  3  of  the  Treasury

Deposit Receipts Act (Chapter 73 of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



Revised  Edition), resolves that the  Treasury  be

authorised  to accept on behalf of the Government,

in  the  manner  specified in the said  subsection

(1),  a  total  sum of money on  deposit  and  not

repaid  that does not exceed five hundred  million

dollars at any one time.
