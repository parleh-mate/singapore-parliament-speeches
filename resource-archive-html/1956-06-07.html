please you, Sir, I should like to take this last

opportunity I have to express the deep appreciation

such a statement in the House, Sir, but the work was

of considerable complexity and it was magnificently

done, and I

and place. I would like to place on the record how

much we appreciate the manner and the speed with

which they have done their work.

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE IN LONDON</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned consideration of

Amendment to Question [6th June, 1956],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly approves the stand of its

delegation at the Constitutional Conference in

London." - (The Chief Minister).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Amendment was, to leave out all the words

from "Assembly", and to insert:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"is of the opinion that the offer of Her Majesty's

Government   should  have  been   accepted   by   the

delegation at the Constitutional Conference in London

as  an  interim measure, in view of the  considerable

constitutional advancement contained therein  and  in

view  of  the  urgent need to restore  a  feeling  of

confidence  and stability to the country and  to  the

people." - (Mr Lim Choon Mong).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  I recounted the main points on  which  the

delegation agreed before we went to London and I  was

coming to the time when the delegation agreed to give

the  responsibility of external defence  and  foreign

affairs, except for trade and commerce, to the United

Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Powers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, arising out of that

question,  the  delegation from  Singapore  suggested

that  there should be a Defence and Security  Council

which should consist of seven members. They would  be

one  representative  of  the  United  Kingdom,  three

representatives  of  the  Armed  Forces,  the   Chief

Minister  of Singapore, and two other representatives

of the Government of Singapore. However, for purposes

of  bargaining, the numbers were made equal, that is,

three from the Government of Singapore and three from

the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the above, the delegation agreed to

allow  the  United  Kingdom  to  have  the  power  of

suspending the constitution should internal  security

deteriorate  to  such  an extent  as  to  affect  the

efficacy of external defence or should the Government

of  Singapore  act  ultra vires the  constitution  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now compare this with what was agreed between

the  United  Kingdom Government and Singapore  before

the talks broke down. We have read in the papers that

the  United  Kingdom  agreed to  allow  Singapore  to

double its elected Members - from the present 25 to 50.

They  further agreed to withdraw from the Legislative

Assembly  all Nominated Members as well  as  Official

Ministers. On the question of citizenship, the United

Kingdom considered the request from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>



Singapore   most  sympathetically  and  offered   the

creation of the State of Singapore with citizens  who

would  enjoy rights similar to that of fully self-governing members of the Commonwealth. Malayanisation

of the civil service, in accordance with the Majority

Report,   was  accepted  in  principle  and   details

concerning  this  were  left in  the  hands  of  sub-committees which never met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points which were not fully agreed upon were

the  composition of the Defence and Security  Council

and  the  powers  of  legislation  by  Her  Majesty's

Government regarding external defence. Here you  will

see  that  the bargaining point which the  delegation

had  in  mind  was  turned  into  a  firm  stand.   A

suggestion by the Chief Minister that the Chairman of

this  Council  should  be  appointed  by  the  United

Nations  Organisation  was  not  acceptable  to   Her

Majesty's Government. Another suggestion made by  the

PAP  that  the Chairman should be appointed  by  the

Government   of   India  was  not  adopted   by   the

delegation.  A  further suggestion was  made  by  the

Labour Front that the Chairman should be appointed by

the  Government  of the Federation of Malaya.  Having

regard  to the fact that the two previous suggestions

did  not  meet  with success on the ground  that  the

intervention of a third party in a problem  involving

joint  control by the two governments  could  not  be

pushed  through,  we took the view  that  this  third

suggestion  would  only be turned  down  and  thereby

cause  further  deadlock in the talks.  We  therefore

suggested  that,  as  the  problem  was  one   facing

Singapore and Britain, it would be easier to  find  a

solution acceptable to both parties if they could, by

agreement, nominate a person acceptable to  both.  We

were  proved right when the talks broke down on  this

point.  In  passing,  I must mention  the  fact  that

although our suggestion was turned down, we stood  by

the  whole  delegation  as a  solid  front  when  the

question  was discussed with the Secretary  of  State

for  the Colonies. We did not prejudice the case  put

up by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>



Chief  Minister  even  though we  had  expressed  our

feelings  at delegation meetings that the chances  of

reaching  agreement with the United Kingdom  on  this

point would be slim. Our attitude has been twisted by

the  P.A.P. into an anti-Federation stand  and  later

into  an anti-Malay stand. This malicious fabrication

on  the  part  of  the P.A.P. has been  done  without

regard to the evil consequences which can ensue  from

communal ill-feelings. The public should know how the

P.A.P.,  in  order  to  obtain  political  gain,  was

prepared  to sacrifice the harmony of the people  and

the  interests  of  the  country.  Sowing  seeds   of

communal  ill-feelings is a tactic of the Communists,

and I call upon the people to open their eyes and  be

warned against these poison mongers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the talks have failed, we can realise the

setback  on the constitutional progress of Singapore.

It  will  not  be possible for us to have  the  great

constitutional advance which would have been ours  by

next   year.  The  Rendel  Constitution,  which   was

fiercely  criticised, is still in  force.  The  Chief

Minister put it in London after the talks failed that

only  lepers  would  want to stand  for  election.  I

wonder  what  he  will think of the  present  Members

sitting in this House. The offer that was made by the

United  Kingdom was described as a Christmas  pudding

with  arsenic sauce. If that were the case, then  the

present constitution would be an arsenic cake. It  is

therefore  very interesting to find that  the  Labour

Front  has decided to eat this arsenic cake, although

a few days ago a Christmas pudding with arsenic sauce

was totally unacceptable!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at it from all angles, I feel that the

breakdown  of the talks was not at all  done  with  a

sense of realism. In fact, if we compare what we  set

out  to get with what was actually agreed between the

delegation and the United Kingdom, we will find  that

we obtained practically all that we had asked for. In

fact, even the P.A.P. leader, who stated publicly  that

he  had gone to London to fight for only 75 per  cent

Merdeka,  was  ready to accept it.  On  the  question

whether Britain should have the power to suspend  the

constitution  partially as well as totally,  he  even

tried to persuade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>



the Chief Minister that if he was willing to give the

power  of total suspension to Britain, then logically

and  legally  Britain could use part  of  the  powers

given  her.  However, we were told  of  a  mysterious

cable,  and then the stand of the P.A.P. became  that

of  a  full  loaf  or  none at all.  This  change  of

attitude on the part of the P.A.P. leader closed  all

avenues  of  retreat to the Chief Minister  from  the

stand taken by him. This, in fact, was the true cause

of  the failure. Viewing the events in retrospect,  I

firmly  believe  that the Chief Minister  would  have

agreed to the proposals by the United Kingdom if only

he had thought things over before acting. The frantic

bid  by the Chief Minister to reopen the talks on his

own  personal  responsibility was ample  evidence  of

this. Singapore spent a large sum of money - in fact, $

180,000 - on    this   abortive   trip.   Stooges    of

international Communism will, I am sure, welcome  the

failure  so that they can still put up the appearance

of  fighting colonialism. We, the Liberal-Socialists,

are  of the opinion that we should have accepted  the

United    Kingdom   proposals   and   then   continue

negotiating  to  further  limit  the  powers  of  Her

Majesty's  Government on the question of  legislation

with  regard to external defence. It would have  been

easier  for us to come back with 90 per cent Merdeka,

work  it,  and after some time, go back and  ask  for

just  one or two more concessions to attain  the  100

per  cent  independence. By that time, we would  have

raised  our  own forces for our own defence  and  the

problem of external defence would then be more easily

solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider the policy of the P.A.P., as the Hon.

Mr Francis Thomas once said, that of a young man  in

a  great hurry. He wants to drive a car at 100  miles

per   hour  through  the  streets  of  Tanjong  Pagar

regardless  of  the  number of  people  he  may  have

killed.   No  doubt  such  a  speed  will   be   most

spectacular and will hit the headlines - but  who  will

be the sufferers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Liberal-Socialists are concerned, we

adhere  to  our  stand.  We view  the  problem  in  a

practical  manner. What we promised we  have  carried

out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>



We   declared  that  we  would  fight  for  a  common

citizenship  for  Singapore. We  did  it.  We  stated

publicly  that we wanted to safeguard the freedom  of

the  individual  and the freedom  of  the  Press.  We

wanted to be sure that when Merdeka comes, the safety

of the people individually, whether they are young or

old,  whether they are of one race or another, should

be  safeguarded.  We voiced that for  the  people  of

Singapore.  All  Parties declared at  the  conference

that  they  were  aware  of the  danger  of  internal

subversion;  yet  some were prepared,  and,  in  fact,

preferred to gamble on it. We fully realise, however,

that   Singapore   is  a  commercial   centre   whose

prosperity  depends  upon  trade,  which   can   only

flourish  under  stable conditions  and  feelings  of

security.  Whereas the other Parties  voted  for  the

breakdown  of  the talks, the Liberal-Socialists  and

the M.C.A. did not favour it -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Abstained!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We were right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Abstained!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The talks should never have

been   broken   off.  The  subsequent  correspondence

between the Chief Minister and the Secretary of State

embodied in the White Paper, which is the subject  of

the  next motion, seeking to reopen the talks, proved

our  point.  In  fact, these letters written  by  the

Chief Minister provide all the justification that  is

needed for my amendment to the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in rising

to  second the amendment, I speak as one who was,  of

course,  not a member of the delegation but was  able

to follow events perhaps from a more objective angle,

or  at least from a Singapore angle. First of all, it

is  as  well to recall some of the things which  were

said and done immediately prior to the opening of the

London  talks.  For example, may I remind  the  House

what the Hon. the Chief Secretary reported to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>



hon.  Members  in  connection with the  Kallang  mass

rally, as memories are sometimes short:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At about 6.40 p.m. the chanting became more excited

and  a  number of youths were seen working  up  their

companions, lobbing pieces of wood, poles and banners

at the police who remained steady at their posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The police had been apprehensive of disorder because

of  slighting  references  made  to  the  police   at

several  P.A.P. meetings and because of the  campaign

in  the  Press by a large group of so-called  Chinese

cultural   associations  and  students   during   the

previous two weeks protesting against police refusals

to  issue  licences for the performance of songs  and

dances of Communist meaning. These organisations held

a  further  protest  meeting at  the  Badminton  Hall

immediately  prior to the mass rally.  After  it,  at

about  4  p.m., some 4,000 to 5,000 youths from  that

meeting marched in an orderly and disciplined  manner

to  the  rally. They carried a large banner depicting

the  Communist  dove of peace. When they  encountered

police officers on duty, there was organised shouting

of  Merdeka.  Their attitude was one of contempt  for

the police..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine days later the Hon. the Chief Minister, in a

broadcast before leaving for London, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Britain wants Singapore as a prosperous free port

serving  the  commerce  of the  world.  This  is  the

destiny we seek. Britain wants to keep Singapore free

from  the deadly clutches of Communism. We know  that

Communism in this mercantile island means death."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four days later, on, I think, the 16th of April, my

hon. Friend's first act in London was to address "the

blunt truth", as he called it, to Malayan students in

a  supposedly hush-hush talk. He stated, or so it  is

reported, that 1959 was the date for the take-over in

Singapore  by a camouflaged Communist party,  and  he

had warned the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan

Yew) that the latter was inviting Communists into the

P.A.P.  On the following day he admitted in  a  Press

release:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The main theme of my address was the dangerous

attitude  of  a group in Singapore that  is  not  big

enough  to overcome their bitterness against colonial

rule  and talks of throwing the White man out of  the

colony."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 22nd of April, on the very eve of the talks,

the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  took  his  turn  in

addressing the students, stating:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our first task is to get rid of the white man."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>



He  was quoted as explaining that "the chance of  one

of  his English-educated audience becoming the future

prime minister of Malaya was 'extremely slender'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of the Members of this House were away

in  London,  but I can tell them now that the  effect

which  these statements by the P.A.P. leader  and  by

the  Chief Minister had on the people of this island,

already  deeply shaken by the Kallang  rally  fiasco,

was  one  of considerable concern, coupled  with  the

growing  conviction that the maintenance of full  and

firm  internal security transcended almost all  other

considerations. Could there, therefore, be the  least

surprise, either in London or in Singapore, that  the

Secretary  of  State should state that Her  Majesty's

Government  would undertake to see that this  country

did  not  become an outpost of Communism and was  not

this  the  logical reply to the Chief Minister's  own

fears?  If this were not so, why should the  citizens

of  this country not have risen up in their wrath  on

the  breakdown of the talks? What has happened to the

Hon. the  Chief Minister's 167,000 signatories,  who

are  supposed  to  have wanted his brand  of  all-or-nothing  Merdeka  and  who, by  their  silence,  have

revealed  that  they do not desire  anything  of  the

sort?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You are wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar

complained   yesterday  that  British   opinion   had

hardened on the arrival of the delegation in  London.

The  extremism of his own Party no doubt  contributed

to  this  hardening just as it had contributed  to  a

similar  hardening  of opinion in Singapore,  namely,

towards  the view that the internal security of  this

country must be properly safeguarded. Should it  not,

therefore, have become clearer, as the days went  by,

that if Her Majesty's Government's offer on all other

major  issues  was acceptable, we should  accept  the

whole,  and  was not that, in fact, the view  of  the

hon.  Member himself for at least the first  half  of

the  talks?  The  Hon. the Chief Minister  complained

yesterday  that  the final differences  in  viewpoint

between the Colonial Office and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>



delegation were so small that the former should  have

given  in  to  his  demands, but is  it  not  equally

arguable that he should have made concessions when so

much  had  already been gained? Is it not nearer  the

truth that the Chief Minister over-reached himself in

the  terms  he  tried  to wrest  from  Her  Majesty's

Government,  and  is  this  not  borne  out  by   his

subsequent actions after the breakdown of the  talks?

The  truth is that almost everybody knows, including,

I  sometimes  think,  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister

himself,  that  the British offer in its  final  form

should have been accepted as an interim measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nanyang Siang Pau of the 15th of May, I think it

was,  pointed  out  that "members of  the  delegation

should have room for mutual toleration and concession

and  never allow a deadlock, as success could not  be

achieved  all  at  once; and  further,  that  if  the

delegates  returned  with powers  of  internal  self-government,   other  difficult  problems   could   be

reserved for decision later and there was no need  to

force  the  issue now." That was the true feeling  of

Singapore.  Those  were  the  views  of  the  village

leaders,  both Chinese and Malay, in the rural  areas

of  my constituency whom I visited when the breakdown

occurred.  Indeed,  many to whom I  spoke  went  even

further.  They  said that if the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar really wished to throw out the white man, there

would  be  no  Service  establishments  and  no   big

commercial houses, and consequently no jobs  for  the

considerable  number  of workers  employed  by  these

establishments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 15th of April, a week before this expression

of  extremism, the view of the hon. Member  had  been

more  moderate  when  he  said  on  the  eve  of  his

departure  for London that the object of the  Merdeka

Mission  was not to secure full independence  but  75

per   cent   self-government  with   complete   self-government after five years. On the 15th  of  May,  a

month  later, the P.A.P. was to reject the very large

measure of self-government offered and to threaten to

bring   Singapore  to  an  economic   and   political

standstill, thus showing cynicism and an  utter  lack

of principle.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fully-elected Legislative Assembly; with our

own  Home  Minister and Finance Minister having  full

control  of  the  police  and  the  revenues  of  the

country;  with the details of Malayanisation  settled

and  their  implementation well on the  way;  with  a

Singapore  citizenship established and  an  electoral

roll  fully representative of the people; can it  not

be  seen that the complete self-government after five

years which the P.A.P. claimed they wanted would,  in

fact,  have been inevitable and very much more  of  a

reality  in even less time? Indeed, the Secretary  of

State promised a review of the working of the Defence

and Security Council after two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, the greatest disservice which the Hon.

the  Chief Minister, as leader of the delegation, has

done  to  this country is not merely to have rejected

this considerable constitutional advance but also  to

have  kept the one and a quarter million citizens  of

this island in continued doubt and anxiety as to  the

next  turn  of  events. For far  too  long  have  all

sections  of the community been saying to  themselves

and  to  each  other, "What is going to happen?"  The

feeling  of uncertainty, of insecurity and of malaise

has  haunted  Singapore for far longer  than  we  can

possibly  afford. This country is not merely standing

still,  it is sliding backwards. The Chief Minister's

policy, most unfortunately, has seen to it that  this

position  of  uncertainty is  to  continue  for  some

months to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister told the Malayan

students in London:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore's economy is so delicately balanced that

we  survive  only  by  virtue of  the  activities  of

capital."



<br><br>His  all-or-nothing  policy has  considerably  shaken

that  balance.  His action in accusing  the  Colonial

Secretary of Fascism one day and writing to  him  the

next  and pleading for the reopening of the talks  in

those  words - "permit me to express my admiration  for

your  very  real  abilities" - was  hardly  a  balanced

action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not only be honest, Sir, with ourselves in

this  House  but with the people of this  country  as

well, and let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>



us  match our own common sense with the sturdy common

sense  of  the majority of Singapore's citizens.  And

what our joint common sense tells us is this: that 90

per  cent internal self-government plus 100 per  cent

security  with  which  to maintain  it  is  a  better

proposition  today than 100 per cent  internal  self-government plus only 50 per cent security with  which

to  maintain it. If the Member for Bukit  Timah  (Mr

Lim  Ching Siong) cares to call me a colonial  stooge

for  stating that proposition, then all I can say  is

that  the bulk of Singapore's population are  stooges

along  with  me, if they were given the chance,  free

from   the  fear  of  the  sinister  propaganda   and

intimidation which the P.A.P. indulges in, to express

their true feelings and convictions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister knows very well that

the  Liberal-Socialist delegates urged him up to  the

last  moment to accept what had been offered and then

to go back later for more. He cannot, in any honesty,

blame them for his own lack of vision, nor indeed has

he  done  so.  The people of Singapore are  sick  and

tired  of  crises and this amendment  reflects  their

real   feelings  regarding  the  totally  unnecessary

failure  of  a  mission. That is  the  truth  of  the

matter, and the tragedy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be

left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  obliged  to  the Hon. the Chief  Minister  for

allowing  me  to  speak first on this amendment.  For

personal reasons, I will not be able to stay in  this

House beyond 11 o'clock and I was afraid I would have

to  leave this Assembly without having answered  some

of  the charges made against me by the leader of  the

majority  Opposition Party, the Member for  Serangoon

(Mr Lim Choon Mong), and the Member for Tanglin (Mr

Ede).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the People's Action Party, when we left

Singapore, issued an official statement - 75  per  cent

Merdeka. Unlike the Liberal-Socialist Party, when  we

issue an official statement, we mean what we say.  We

prepared the ground for an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>



agreement  with the Colonial Office on the  basis  of

complete  internal self-government in order  that  we

could never be accused either by our supporters or by

our  enemies  of  cheating. We fought strenuously  in

London  to achieve this. Whatever differences  I  had

with  the Chief Minister were because I tried to keep

the basis of discussion on the heads of agreement  we

had   agreed  upon  before  we  left  Singapore.  Our

interpretation  of the agreement we  had  arrived  at

before we left Singapore was complete internal  self-government. We wanted self-government. We  gave  away

external  affairs and external defence, and  we  were

left with internal self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon said he urged upon the

Chief  Minister the illogicality of the stand of  the

delegation  and  of the P.A.P. in refusing  to  offer

partial  suspension of the constitution when we  had,

in   fact,  offered  the  whole.  That,  Sir,  is   a

completely malicious misrepresentation of the  facts.

He knew exactly what our stand was. We went to London

on  this  basis.  We did not give away  anything.  We

wanted  to  ask  only  for  complete  internal  self-government  because  we  could  not  have  got  more,

because other members of the delegation, the Liberal-Socialists, would not have agreed. Having  asked  for

internal  self-government, it  was  idle  to  discuss

whether or not Her Majesty's Government had the right

to  suspend  the  constitution.  There  is  only  one

sovereign power in any territory, and as long  as  we

are not independent, that sovereign power is Britain.

When  we  are independent like Ceylon, then  the  old

imperial power is out. When the Ceylonese decided  to

oust  the  British bases, there was  no  question  of

suspending  the  constitution  because  to   re-enter

Ceylon  was an act of aggression. But until  we  have

attained independence, Britain is the sovereign power

and we have to accept that position. I agree that  if

Britain  has  the power to suspend the whole  of  the

constitution, then, a fortiori, she has the power  to

suspend  part  of it. But that is entirely  different

from  saying that I agree to the British  having  the

power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>



to  suspend any part of the constitution. There is  a

fundamental difference in political approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for three weeks in London I argued and I

argued  for a settlement. No one in this House  knows

better  how absolutely vital it was for us to have  a

settlement  if it was possible, but I  found  in  the

last  week  that it was not possible.  I  found  that

Britain had decided that she was not going to give us

complete  internal self-government, that Britain  was

going  to  sit  in  with the learner-driver.  Britain

wanted  an  Austin  car with dual  controls.  Britain

wanted  to  be next to the driver. What  we  said  to

Britain  was, "If you want me to agree  to  have  you

sitting  in with me, I want one set of controls.  The

day you take over, I will ostentatiously get out from

the  driving seat and you can be in supreme  control.

But I refuse to be your stooge, to be your pawn, like

the Liberal-Socialists would have been."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Of course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, of all the stupid things

that people do, I think this is the stupidest of them

all.  They did not have the courage in London to say,

"I oppose this breakdown. I propose to go on with the

talks." Instead they abstained. Abstained from  what?

Abstained because they neither had the will  nor  the

guts to make up their minds what to do -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Except the Member -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - except the Member for Changi

(Mr  Lim Cher Kheng). [Interruption.] And now, three

weeks  after the breakdown, the Member for  Serangoon

said  that  we  should  have  accepted  the  Colonial

Office's  offer. Sir, I can understand the  Hon.  Mr

Sutherland  and  I  can  understand  the  Member  for

Tanglin  (Mr  Ede). They cannot help themselves.  We

are all prisoners of our own past, of our upbringing;

our  mental  attitudes are values that we learned  as

little  children. But I find it sad to see the Member

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>



Serangoon - and I think, of the Liberal-Socialists,  he

is   the  man  who  most  believes  in  what  he   is

saying - come  forward  in  this  Assembly  to  be   an

advocate  for  the  Colonial  Office.  There  is  the

perfect stooge -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. We have really been

approaching unparliamentary language, but if the word

"stooge"  is  used  in direct reference  to  an  hon.

Member, then, of course, it is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, forgive me for

the  slip,  but  I  could  not  restrain  my  natural

reaction at seeing one of my own people behaving in a

manner   completely  unbefitting  a   self-respecting

individual.  Nehru said that when  a  colonial  power

succeeds in making a man think he is a slave, and  he

thinks like a slave, then the threat of power  is  no

longer necessary, and the supreme achievement  of  an

imperial power in subjugation is achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the Hon. Mr Sutherland and the

Member  for  Tanglin,  but I  find  it  difficult  to

understand the Member for Serangoon. In fact,  a  lot

of  Malayan  students  found  it  very  difficult  to

understand him. He went to one meeting and said,  "We

are  Liberal-Socialists. Because we believe that  the

world should be a little bit freer, therefore we  are

Liberals.  Because we believe that  employers  should

give a little bit more to their workers, therefore we

are  Socialists.  Therefore  we  call  ourselves  the

Liberal-Socialists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they appeared before the Malayan students in

London  one  Sunday  and they never  appeared  again,

although they were invited, because they accused  the

students of hooliganism. The students there  are  all

idealistic;  they asked the Liberal-Socialist  leader

whether he was prepared to fight and die for freedom,

whether  be  was prepared to go to jail if necessary.

He  replied, "Do not be silly. All these  things  are

unnecessary.  Why  should we go  to  jail  for  these

things? The British are bound to give us these things

and  all  that we have got to do is to wait  for  the

hand-over."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know what to make of these people.

They   say   that  this  is  their  Party  statement.

Therefore I assume



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>



that  it  has  received  careful  deliberation  as  a

statement of policy. It says the P.A.P. is afraid  of

Merdeka  and the P.A.P. have done their very best  to

achieve   their  aim  of  not  getting   Merdeka   by

frightening  the British. Sir, there is  a  touch  of

hallucination about this whole thing which  sometimes

troubles  me in my sleep. I propose now to read  from

the   "Suara  Merdeka",  the  organ  of  the  Malayan

students  in  Britain. I think they  must  have  been

troubled in their sleep too. They quote Torch,  organ

of  the Liberal-Socialist Party, which contained  the

following  account of an inaugural  meeting  for  the

formation  of a Youth Group at a seaside bungalow  at

Siglap:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was a fine gathering, healthy young people

having a pleasant and enjoyable day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sport, games and dancing preceded and followed the

meeting   to   elect   office-bearers.   Unlike   the

regimented gatherings of the young section  of  other

political Parties, the members spent their time  more

on  play  than  on  business. The organisers  of  the

gathering are to be congratulated for taking an  easy

attitude towards politics."



<br><br>That  is  from their Party organ. I quote the comment

of the Malayan students in Great Britain: "Those whom

the  gods wish to destroy, they first make mad."  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  any  man  who  subscribes   to   this

amendment  of  the Liberal-Socialists must  be  going

mad.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Serangoon and leader of the Liberal-Socialists in

this  House, whom I respect as a man who always  does

seek  to  be honest and yet is torn between  his  own

personal  integrity  and his  loyalty  to  his  Party

caucus,   has   drawn  attention  to  some   of   the

ingredients  of  the constitution which  the  British

offered. He and the Member for Tiong Bahru have  made

some  play  on the question of citizenship.  I  think

they are conscious of how we of the Labour Front have

struggled,  with  sincerity,  with  ardour  and  with

tirelessness to get it. I do not think  we  need  say

it - it  must be plain - that the question of citizenship

to us is one of vital importance to Singapore, and  I

need  hardly  say that we have the people's  sympathy

with  our  domiciled  Chinese  particularly  who  are

deprived of the right of citizenship. But, Sir, I  am

one who respects these Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>



and  I  am  certain that they would not ask that  the

welfare  of Singapore should be sacrificed  in  order

that  they  should have citizenship. I am  sure  that

they  themselves would not want, not a  90  per  cent

Merdeka,  but  a "busok" Merdeka in order  that  they

should be citizens of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are good ingredients in what the British

offered.  May  I refer to paragraph 67 of  our  White

Paper  in which we openly said so. With some sarcasm,

Sir,  my  description  of the constitution  has  been

referred  to - the description that it is  a  Christmas

cake  with arsenic sauce. A Christmas cake  has  fine

ingredients,  just as there were good ingredients  in

what  we  were offered, but the whole was a poisonous

package.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 67 of the White Paper says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the resumption of the meeting the Chief Minister

indicated   with  deep  regret  that  the   otherwise

acceptable Constitutional framework proposed  by  Her

Majesty's Government was rendered unacceptable due to

the    insistence   of   the   over-riding   Imperial

Legislative Powers and a majority vote on the Defence

and Security Council."



<br><br>So it is drawing a red herring, Sir, to refer to some

of the ingredients in this offer which were good. The

question   really  is:  Were  they   not   completely

nullified  when it was the intention of Her Majesty's

Government  to retain complete imperial  powers  over

Singapore which would remain a colony? The Member for

Serangoon said we got almost everything we had  asked

for.  May  I  remind him that we asked  for  Dominion

status?  We asked for complete political freedom.  At

no  time did we agree, either here or anywhere  else,

that  Singapore  should remain a colony,  subject  to

these day-to-day over-riding imperial powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remarkable thing about this amendment of the

Member for Serangoon, Sir, the unhappy thing - I cannot

speak  with anger; I speak in real sorrow - is  that  I

see  a  man of integrity act in this fashion,  but  I

would   ask  this  gentleman,  who  today  moves   an

amendment  requesting  this  House  to  approve   the

acceptance of the British proposals, how he acted  in

London.  Does he remember, I think it was about  3.30

p.m.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>



on  15th May at the adjournment just before the final

break, I said, "Is there anybody present in favour of

the  British  proposals?" Not one  hand  was  raised.

"Those against?" Nine hands were raised. And I  said,

"You,  you, and you?" "Abstain", came the answers.  I

do  not know what "abstain" means. To me it is an act

of  cowardice for a representative of the  people  in

any matter that is before the House or with which  he

is entrusted. There are circumstances, Sir, where one

must  abstain - I  mean  in  special  circumstances - for

example,  in the next motion, if there is  to  be  an

amendment  to  censure  me, quite  naturally  I  must

abstain  from voting because it affects  my  personal

interests;  but to abstain on a matter of such  vital

importance to the welfare of the country  - !  In  any

case, Sir, they abstained - three of them. They had the

right  to - these gentlemen who abstained and who today

ask  you  to  believe  that  they  acted  wrongly  in

abstaining,  that they should have accepted  it.  How

did  these  gentlemen react when  two  days  later  I

sought to reopen the talks on a far more advantageous

basis for Singapore? Did they support me?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I will tell you later.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> But the point is that I was

informed by the Member for Serangoon, "Sorry. We  are

not  interested  in  reopening the  negotiations.  My

Party in Singapore is finalising arrangements to take

over the government."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> To me personally, at the B.B.C.

So, Sir, these people who were not prepared to accept

the  British  proposals on the  15th  of  May,  these

Members  who were not prepared to support my  efforts

to  reopen the negotiations on the night of the  16th

and the morning of the 17th of May - as the hon. Member

said,  we  shall  be  coming  to  that  in  the  next

motion - these very people said we should have accepted

it. Why the change? I can only say this, Sir. This is

an  effort to understand - that the Liberal-Socialists

sent their more honest representatives to London;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>



but   now   that   these   representatives   consider

themselves  subject to the party caucus and  have  to

take  party directions, they find themselves  in  the

humiliating  and  unhappy  position  of   moving   an

amendment that censures their own conduct. If the day

ever  comes  when  this Assembly is  ruled  by  party

caucus, decisions  outside  this   Assembly,   then

democracy  walks right out of the door, Sir.  When  a

man  of  personal integrity has to give way to  party

directions, democracy ceases to be a reality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that for myself I can only deeply regret

that  hon. Members of this House and men whom  I  had

the  pleasure of working with in London - because, let

me repeat, that from the Liberal-Socialists in London

I received patient support, even though at times they

were  at variance with my views; I learned to  admire

them,  members who were with me in the delegation - and

it is with genuine sorrow that I see them stand up in

discussion  to  destroy  that  integrity  before  the

public  and to destroy, to, some extent, the  dignity

of  Members of this House by moving an amendment that

censures their own conduct in London.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to oppose

the  amendment to the motion moved by  the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister, so audaciously brought by the Member

for  Serangoon - the so-called leader of  the  Liberal-Socialist  Party delegation in London. I  would  like

to  remind  him  and his colleague  the  Member  for

Tanglin,  who  seconded the amendment,  that  it  was

their  Party  alone  who  in  this  House,  when  the

question of self-government was first discussed, were

the ones who asked for immediate independence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The lion roars!.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The lion has roared and is still trying

to  roar.  I will read now from our Hansard  of  what

happened on that occasion (Official Report,  Vol.  1,

No.  8,  dated  25th July, 1955). This  is  what  the

Member for Paya Lebar said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us therefore play the game, (if they can) and

ask  for a full transfer of power so that we, and  we

alone,  shall be responsible for our own affairs  and

destiny and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>



British  Government need no longer be answerable  for

us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the principles which I have

stated, I therefore move an amendment which will  not

only  be  in line with the first and second parts  of

this motion, but also remove all future occasions for

dissatisfaction. I therefore move that the motion  be

amended by adding the following . . .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And that in the opinion of this House the time has

arrived for a transfer of power from the Government

of  the  United Kingdom to the people of Singapore,

and   that   a   new  constitution  providing   for

independence should be granted immediately.'"



<br><br>I hope the Member for Serangoon and his colleague the

Member  for  Tanglin appreciate the  significance  of

that.  We are, of course, quite accustomed,  both  in

this  House  and outside it, to witness the  farcical

gymnastic   somersaults   which   the   now   defunct

Progressive  Party (absorbed by the Lion  Party)  and

the  newly-born Liberal-Socialist Party have made and

continue  to  make. It is, of course,  understandable

for  the Member for Tanglin to second this amendment.

I can also understand what he represents in more ways

than one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the delegation left for London, the Member

for  Tanglin,  on  behalf of the  Liberal-Socialists,

changed  the  whole original attitude of  his  Party,

which  had  asked  for  immediate  independence,   by

seeking   certain  reservations  for  Her   Majesty's

Government  and  safeguards on the internal  security

problem,  but  the All-Party Delegation started  from

Singapore  unanimous  in the  call  for  Merdeka.  In

London,  before  the conference was  opened,  it  was

agreed  by all delegates that, if any differences  of

opinion  arose  in the course of discussions,  a  15-minute  adjournment be asked for, so  that  we  could

iron  out  any differences amongst ourselves  in  the

committee rooms that were supplied to us, so  as  not

to  disclose  any discord. Furthermore, the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  agreed  that  on  the  question  of

internal security they would voice their opinion only

when the question arose. But in spite of this, at the

opening speeches of the conference, the leader of the

Liberal-Socialists  made  a most  puerile  statement,

which  he no doubt had already prepared in Singapore,

proclaiming  his Party's platform on the question  of

internal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>



security. The Hon. the Chief Minister kindly referred

to  the speech as ill-timed or ill-chosen, but my own

view  is  that  not  only was it ill-timed  and  ill-chosen, but it immediately signified to Her Majesty's

Government,  before any matters could  be  discussed,

that  there  was discord amongst the members  of  the

delegation,  and  without  wishing  to   breach   any

confidence,  my view was upheld by a  member  of  the

Liberal-Socialist Party - and that was not  the  Member

for  Changi. If the Member for Tanjong Pagar is right

in  his  opinion that the people of Britain  and  Her

Majesty's Government had before our arrival  hardened

against  the  request for Merdeka, did  this  opening

speech of the leader of the Liberal-Socialists, which

clearly  intimated to Her Majesty's  Government  that

his  Party  was ready to accept any crumbs that  fell

from  the  Colonial Office table,  not  lend  further

fortification to the British attitude?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Quote what I said.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The Liberal-Socialists, I suppose by

this  opening speech, hoped to gain favour  with  Her

Majesty's  Government and to be looked  upon  as  the

blue-eyed baby. The Colonial Secretary, who is a most

astute  man  (as  we all know), subsequently  invited

members  of  all Parties separately and  individually

either  to lunch or some other entertainment,  where,

no  doubt, he was able to assess the different  views

of  the  Parties.  It was a common sight  to  see  at

social   functions,  to  which  all  delegates   were

invited,  members  of  the  Liberal-Socialist   Party

buttonholing the bigwigs of the Colonial  Office,  or

any  of  the members who sat on the opposite side  of

the table at the conference -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Ask the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> - and on occasions I overheard their

conversations which were always entirely  related  to

"What  our Party platform is and what we can  do  for

Singapore." It is therefore understandable  that  the

Member for Changi became so disgusted with party



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>



politics - and I have no doubt he meant his  own  party

politics - that  he  has  now  openly  declared  to  be

independent. The vicious remarks made by  the  Member

for Tiong Bahru attacking the Hon. the Chief Minister

were  unjustified  and unkind.  In  fairness  to  the

P.A.P., so were his attacks against them. I can  only

advise  this hon. Member to remove the mote from  his

eye  and  the mote from his colleagues before  making

any uncharitable attacks. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I had originally no intention to speak.

The  White Paper was prepared by this Government  and

has  the unanimous approval of all Ministers. But the

uncalled-for criticisms made by the Member for  Tiong

Bahru,  when  no  one else before  him  had  attacked

anyone  at all - in point of fact, the Chief Minister's

remarks  of the Liberal-Socialists were most kind - and

this audacious attempt to negative the Hon. the Chief

Minister's  motion  makes it  incumbent  upon  me  to

speak.  I  therefore  oppose  this  amendment   which

strikes me as another political stunt of the Liberal-Socialists  to  find  favour  with  some  people   in

Singapore  and the Colonial Office, and  I  think  no

decent-minded  member  of  the  All-Party  Delegation

could support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the meetings of

that  institution in Bukit Timah Road, commonly known

as the race course, the sittings of this Assembly are

not  void  of their moments of upset. Also  like  the

"dark horses" of whose performance one is never  sure

until  it is all over, so it is with certain  Members

of  this  House - only  here they are  called  by  more

dignified names.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my friend and colleague the Minister for

Health has just now quoted from Hansard - he has stolen

a  march  on  me - showing that it was these  so-called

champions of the people who were shocked at the  idea

of  having  self-government in  four  years  and  who

wanted  immediate independence. It was the leader  of

these   champions,  Sir,  who  today  stood  up   and

advocated that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>



should have accepted - accepted what? - accepted complete

independence?  No, Sir. Accepted even clean  internal

self-government? No, Sir. He advocated that we should

have  accepted  something that no hon.  Member  could

have accepted.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> - to hell.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Will the hon. Member

please repeat what he has just said?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> " - to hell."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Did I hear the hon. Member say, "Go to

hell"?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I said "Road to hell".



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I beg the hon. Member's pardon.

[Interruption.] Order, order. Mr J. M. Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for Serangoon, leader of the Socialists, who are also

Liberals at the same time, is censuring us today  for

not  having  accepted an unworkable  compromise;  for

having  principles and sticking by them; and for  not

fooling  the people of Singapore with something  that

is  but  a shadow and has no substance. Yesterday  he

told us that it did not matter if we did not have the

trimmings so long as we had the substance,  that  "it

does  not matter if we do not have the tomatoes,  the

lettuce  and  the  salad  so  long  as  we  have  the

chicken."  Sir,  there  are times  when  the  chicken

without  the trimmings is unpalatable, and there  are

times  when  such a substance - if he thinks  it  is  a

substance - would  make the body politic  sick.  It  is

better not to have it without the trimmings.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, like Ministers' posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> But, Sir, I still say that he

was  mistaken. It is not the substance that  we  were

getting  but  rather the trimmings. The  hon.  Member

with  his  tongue  in his cheek talks  of  stability.

"Restore the feeling of confidence and stability," he

says.  Does he not realise that that is exactly  what

we wanted; that is exactly why we refused to accept -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Ha, ha!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I think hon. Members on

the   Opposition  side  are  entitled  to  reasonable

interruptions. I have allowed interruptions  on  both

sides of the House, but when they become unseemly,  I

must intervene. Mr J. M. Jumabhoy.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, if we had accepted the

Colonial  Office's proposals, it would  have  led  to

greater  instability. Agitators would have been  able

to  use  the  excuse of, "the sword  that  is  always

hanging over our heads" to arouse passions, to commit

murder  and  arson  and to arouse racial  antagonism.

That is what we wanted to prevent and that is why  we

refused  to accept a dishonourable compromise.  Would

we  have  got  this stability? I say  we  would  not,

unless  we  had  a  proper  constitution  where   our

principles would not have been sacrificed, and  where

the  people  of Singapore could have understood  that

they  had got "something clean" - in the words  of  the

Chief Minister. It is like a healthy person having  a

thorn in his foot. That thorn acts as an irritant and

the  mere  presence of that source of  irritation  is

enough to put him in an unstable frame of mind. It is

better  to  be  sick, as we are today under  colonial

rule, and fight on for independence rather than  have

a thorn in the flesh and feel irritable all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday we heard a series of speakers on the

post-mortem of the Merdeka talks and the reasons  why

they  failed.  "The British were in no mood  to  give

away  further  concessions to the colony;  there  was

dissension   among  the  delegates  themselves;   the

Colonial Office was adamant." I ask, Sir, why was the

Colonial Office adamant? Because they knew that there

was  one  weak  link in the chain of the  delegation,

They  knew that that one weak link was ready to  come

to  any  compromise, whether honourable or not.  They

knew  that that one weak link did not have  the  same

desire for independence as the others had.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Refer to the Chief Minister's

remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Knowing all this, Sir, do you

not  think  that  it is likely that  a  people,  well

seasoned in politics like the British are, would  not

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>



taken  advantage  at once of that weakness  of  ours?

Sir, that is one more major reason why the delegation

failed to obtain success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin stated that he was able

to  follow  from  here events with a  more  objective

angle, rather a Singapore angle. It is likely that he

followed the events as presented to the public by the

British   Press,  which  everybody   knows   is   not

unbiased - to be very mild about it. Sir, he also asked

what had happened to those 167,000 Merdeka signatures

of   the  Chief  Minister - mind  you,  of  the  Chief

Minister;  they  had no share in it.  Why  were  they

silent when we did not get Merdeka? Sir, that is  the

trouble.  These gentlemen on the opposite benches - the

Liberal-Socialists - are not in touch with the  masses.

They  do  not realise the amount of effort  that  has

gone  into  keeping the lid on, to  prevent  it  from

blowing  up. They do not know what has been going  on

behind the scenes, because they are not in touch with

the  masses. If they had known, if they had  been  in

contact  with  the masses, they would  have  realised

that  it  is very dangerous to touch on this subject.

If  this  is taken as a challenge, what is  going  to

happen tomorrow? Then they will be held to blame.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in closing, I would like to say that yesterday

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar, in one  of  his  most

balanced  speeches - so it appeared to  me - pointed  out

that  the  right path now lay towards a united,  non-Communist  national  movement.  That,  Sir,  is   the

reaction of many right-minded people today after  the

failure of the talks; and the failure of the talks is

already  acting  as  an  incentive  towards  such   a

movement,  driving  to the side party  squabbles  and

party politics, except perhaps for a few un-national-minded people. With such a strong and united national

movement, Merdeka cannot be refused and I hope,  Sir,

that  the day will not be far off when, in the  words

of the Member for Changi, we will be able to sink all

party  differences  and unite in a national  movement

for  independence - and I do not expect certain Members

in this House will take part in it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Liberal-Socialist Party has a certain political immaturity.

To  put  it  rather more simply, they  are  sometimes

rather silly. You can rely on them always not only to

do  the wrong thing, but if it is possible, to do  it

in the wrong way and at the wrong time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent some time last night thinking over this

amendment  which they have moved and  trying  to  see

what  public  advantage or what party advantage  they

could  hope to reap from it. I find it quite in  vain

to  attempt  to  understand either their  motives  or

their objectives. The only conclusion that I can come

to  for  the  moving of this amendment is that  their

traditional  political  un-wisdom  has   once   again

dominated   their   political  common   sense.   This

amendment is politically unwise for Singapore. It  is

even  politically  unwise for  the  Liberal-Socialist

Party,  and  I  am afraid they must have  noted  with

considerable  dismay this morning  that  the  Straits

Times  devoted  a  very lengthy  leading  article  to

saying how politically unwise they had been in moving

it. I really feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it would be

a great pity if we spent very much longer in debating

this  amendment. I have been looking at  my  Standing

Orders.  I  do not think that we, at least,  wish  to

abuse  the  rules  of the Assembly  or  infringe  the

rights   of   the   minority,  but  from   a   purely

humanitarian   motive  of  pity  for   the   Liberal-Socialists,  I suggest that we might consider  moving

that  the  question  be  now  put  and  we  get  this

amendment out of the way. If they like, they may move

it themselves.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the amendment proposed by the Liberal-Socialist

Party  does  not take me by surprise. In a  statement

last  week  I  said that the Liberal-Socialists  were

collaborators of colonialism. Some friends then  told

me that I was being unfair to the Liberal-Socialists.

The  amendment  proposed  by  the  Liberal-Socialists

proves that I was not mistaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The refusal of the British Government to agree to

the minimum demands of the people of Singapore caused

the breakdown of the talks. At this time it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>



is  more  than  ever necessary that  all  Parties  in

Singapore should close their ranks and unitedly press

for  the  minimum workers' demands of the  people  of

Singapore. This unity of all anti-colonial forces  is

the  only  way in which the political aspirations  of

the  people can be advanced. But it is just  at  this

time  that the Liberal-Socialist Party choose to echo

the line of the Hon. Mr Sutherland -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Point of

order, Sir. The word "lie" - is that parliamentary,

Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> Line, Sir. L-i-n-e.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. What is your point of

order, Mr Sutherland?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I understood the hon. Member to

say, "echo the lie".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> "Line".



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Oh, I beg your pardon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> He is a member of the Colonial

Office!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> I accept that!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> - and this line was against

the  delegation of Singapore because Mr  Sutherland

refused to allow Mr Lennox-Boyd -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. The hon. Member must

remember  to  address his remarks  to  the  Chair.  I

cannot hear what he is saying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> Mr Sutherland refused to be

party  to  the censure of what he calls his country's

Colonial  Office. This can be forgiven. He is,  after

all, an hon. Member of the opposite camp. But now the

Liberal-Socialists also refuse to  be  party  to  the

censure  of  the  Colonial Office for  rejecting  the

minimum  demands of the people of Singapore. They  go

further.  They are prepared to censure the delegation

of  the people of Singapore. This is something  which

cannot  be forgiven by the people of Singapore.  This

Party  proves once again that a change of  name  does

not mean a change of quality. The old



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>



Progressive  Party,  composed of  the  "yes"  men  of

colonialism,  and  the  not so  old  Democrat  Party,

composed  of  reactionary local capitalist  elements,

together  thought that they could fool the public  if

they  called  themselves by a new  name - the  Liberal-Socialists. The donkey tried to pretend that it was a

horse.  But this amendment proves once again and  for

all  time  that  this  Party is neither  Liberal  nor

Socialist.  If  they are honest with  themselves  and

with  the people, they will call themselves by  their

correct  name - the  Colonial Collaborators  Party.  To

accept -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Not the Communist Party.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> To accept the British

Government's offer would have been a betrayal of  the

people  of  Singapore. It would have meant acceptance

of  the  British Government's right to  interfere  in

almost  every  aspect of public life. It  would  have

meant  recognising British policemen as the  backseat

drivers  of  Singapore.  The Liberal-Socialists  have

lost  confidence  in  the people  of  Singapore.  The

outstanding characteristic of this Party is its  fear

of the people of Singapore. They can only be happy if

there  are British policemen to protect them  against

their  own  people. We say that if  we  are  fit  for

independence,  we  are  also  fit  to  be   our   own

policemen. We say this because we have confidence  in

our  own people and are not afraid of them. Only  the

spineless members of the Liberal-Socialist Party  are

afraid  of  their  own  people  and  require  foreign

policemen  to  protect  them. I  therefore  ask  this

Assembly  to  throw out this amendment, just  as  the

people  of Singapore will one day throw the  Liberal-Socialists out of this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

thought  the best to speak on the subject would  have

been  the  delegates who attended the  constitutional

conference and I had originally no desire to speak at

all, but I now feel that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>



debate  has become rather unhealthy once it  gets  to

personal affairs or party politics. I ask the Members

who  are sitting in this House what constitution they

are  working, and why they are still clinging to  it?

Who were the originators of this constitution? It was

the Progressive Party, but I was then not a member of

the Party, and credit must be given to those who have

been instrumental in your being in this Assembly  and

getting  more  elected representatives  here.  It  is

therefore very ungrateful of those, even though  they

may  possibly have advanced politically, to speak  in

such terms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am speaking on the amendment, I will

also  deal with the delegation because it was an All-Party  Delegation that went to London.  Why  an  All-Party Delegation? Was it an All-Party Government? No.

The reason why the Liberal-Socialists consented to go

to  London  was because they wanted to  help  in  the

talks  for  independence. The Labour Front  Coalition

knew  that  they did not have an elected majority  on

their  side. If they went to London alone, they would

not  be  received. In the interests  of  the  people,

therefore, the Liberal-Socialists consented to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy of the Liberal-Socialists is to

attain, if possible, immediate independence,  and  if

it  is not possible, then step by step. What is wrong

with  that?  I ask you, Sir, which country  has  been

able  to obtain independence after a struggle of four

or  five or even ten years? Name me one country. Here

we have the P.A.P. quoting Mr Nehru and India.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What about the Federation?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Please stop interrupting!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, I am in charge here.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I do not want to be

disturbed.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If an hon. Member is

interrupted, his remedy is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>



appeal  to the Chair and not shout across the Chamber

in an ungentlemanly manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Personally, Sir, I have not

disturbed  anyone. You might have noticed that,  Sir,

and  I feel that I should be given the same right not

to be disturbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, India had to carry her fight for independence

for  80 to 90 years. Here we have a Member who always

quotes  Mr Nehru. I think he has studied  Mr  Nehru

and India in theory but not in practical politics  at

all.  India,  Ceylon  and even  Burma  have  attained

independence after a lot of suffering. The people  of

this  country have not suffered, and I hope they will

not.   Things  have  changed.  The  people  of  India

accepted   constitutional  advancement   by   interim

stages.  Not only that, but they consented to  divide

the  country  into two parts - India and Pakistan.  We

also have an example in Palestine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the delegation went as an All Parry Delegation

to  London,  we  heard  of quarrels  and  dissensions

within  the  delegation. But the Chief Minister  said

that  they presented a united front at the conference

table.  I  am  very happy to hear that.  But  when  a

certain  stage was reached in the negotiations  where

neither  side  would give way at all, it  was  wise - I

would  say,  very wise - on our part, remembering  that

Singapore is only 226 square miles in area and having

a  population of just over a million people, to  have

taken the maximum offer from the Colonial Office  and

to work for more later. What was wrong with it, I ask

you,  Sir?  We have accepted the Rendel Constitution.

Those  Members who oppose it are still sitting  tight

in  their places. They do not want to leave.  But  in

other  countries,  Sir,  if any  political  party  or

members of any political party do not agree with  the

constitution,  they immediately resign  and  ask  for

fresh   elections.   They   will   not   work    that

constitution.  But here I see those Members  who  say

they do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>



want  the constitution but are still sticking to  it.

What  for? Are they sincere themselves? If they were,

they  would  have  resigned,  especially  after   the

Merdeka talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my argument is that our movement for

independence is only in its infancy. It is a  postwar

period  movement.  In 1948 we had  only  six  elected

representatives. After that, we had nine. Now we have

25.  Had  not the London talks broken down, we  would

have  got  50 seats - all elected. Then we  could  have

asked  for fresh elections, ascertained the  majority

opinion on Merdeka, and go back to London and ask for

more concessions. I think it would have been sensible

of  the delegation to accept the maximum offer of the

Colonial  Office.  It  would have  meant  a  definite

constitutional   advancement  in  our  constitutional

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.A.P. - if we trace the history of this Assembly,

what  have  they  done?  It  is  supposed  to  be  an

extremist  Party. Before going to London, they  said,

"We want to accept 75 per cent Merdeka." Why? If they

wanted  freedom, then why be satisfied  with  75  per

cent Merdeka? If the Colonial Office's offer had been

accepted, then we would have got citizenship  rights.

Some  people would have got voting rights  and  would

have a hand in electing people to this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a distinction was made out between the

colonial  power  and  the British  people.  I  cannot

understand the distinction at all. It is the  British

people who elect their representatives to Parliament.

The  Government is formed by the majority party. Then

the  Cabinet,  or  the various departments,  run  the

government.  What  is  the opinion  of  the  Colonial

Office is the opinion of the British Cabinet, and  is

the  opinion  of  the  British people.  It  is  quite

inseparable.  Do not forget that the  British  people

elect   their   representatives  to  Parliament   and

Parliament is their voice. There is no distinction at

all. It is no use saying that once we have elected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>



them,  we  do  not believe in them. It is impossible.

Sir,  as  I  have  said,  no  country  had  immediate

independence and I feel that the maximum offer of the

Colonial  Office  should have been  accepted  and  we

would then have been better off, in the interests  of

the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

today  I rise to speak as an independent nationalist.

I  am  speaking on the amendment which is  associated

with the Party to which I once belonged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the House knows that I was the Member

who, during the last day of the London talks, moved a

15-minute adjournment to allow the delegation to have

a  private  discussion.  During  that  adjournment  I

proposed  that  we  should accept the  British  offer

under protest. I pointed out to the delegates at this

meeting  that we must admit that there was already  a

significant  advancement in our constitution  if  the

British  offer  was  accepted,  especially   as   the

Colonial  Office  had  recognised  the  principle  of

Malayanisation and agreed to hand over control of the

police  force  to  us. I said the  delegation  should

realise  the  fact that the British offer  would  not

completely satisfy the actual wants of the people  of

Singapore  and  that we must go  back  and  tell  the

people the truth - that we could not get what we wanted

and what we bad promised during our Merdeka Week.  At

the  same  time, we would ask all Parties to  sign  a

joint  undertaking that no political Party  in  power

would  allow  Her  Majesty's  Government  over-riding

powers to intervene in any minor issue, since it  was

declared by the Secretary of State, the Rt. Hon.  Mr

Lennox-Boyd,   that  the  British   Government   were

concerned  only  with external affairs  and  external

defence.  We knew very well that the Colonial  Office

were  trying  all  the time to take over  control  of

internal security in the name of external defence and

external  affairs. I said I hoped  that  all  Parties

would  agree to sign a joint undertaking and let  the

Colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>



Office know that they had unanimously agreed that the

British Government should not intervene in any  minor

issue of internal administration. I even went to  the

extent  of  urging the delegation to  cable  back  to

Singapore   to  cancel  the  arrangements   which   I

understood  were  under way to  welcome  the  Merdeka

Mission  back from London; that we should protest  to

the  British  Colonial Office for dishonouring  their

promise  made  last December to the  Hon. the  Chief

Minister that they would allow us to enjoy a  certain

status  that  is  more than internal self-government,

something that is nearer to Dominion status. I  think

we can get this information from the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the first day of the conference meetings, we

already could feel that the Colonial Office were  not

sincere  in keeping their promise. The Rt.  Hon.  Mr

Lennox-Boyd, in his opening speech at the conference,

stated  that  the  British Government  did  not  want

Singapore to become an outpost of Peking, or  even  a

colony  of Peking. That was not true, because through

my  personal  connections  with  several  Members  of

Parliament  and  some Government departments,  I  was

privately  told that Mr Lennox-Boyd  knew  that  the

Chinese  Government  in Peking had  no  intention  of

coming   into  South-East  Asia,  which,  of  course,

includes  Malaya and Singapore. I think  Mr  Lennox-Boyd  purposely  emphasised that possibility  in  his

speech. I think the Hon. the Chief Minister can still

remember how I felt. I thought that since we conceded

control   over  external  affairs  to  Her  Majesty's

Government, what then would be the position when  the

question  arose  of  Singapore's admission  into  the

United Nations Organisation? I was so innocent! I was

so   optimistic,  because  I  was  even  thinking  of

Singapore's   admission  into  the   United   Nations

Organisation! But after Mr Lennox Boyd's speech, all

my  hopes  were  dashed to the ground;  I  became  so

pessimistic. I think the local Press reported it. But

I must admit that we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>



had  achieved  something  up  to  that  stage.  So  I

proposed that 15-minute adjournment in order to  urge

upon   the  delegation  to  be  a  little  bit   more

realistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not agree with the Chief Minister when he

said  that  it  would not be good to eat  a  poisoned

cake.  The  Labour Front's platform is  to  work  the

Rendel   Constitution   for   four   years - the   then

Progressive Party, ten years - and yet, after a year's

working,    we    could   ask   for   a   significant

constitutional advance. Therefore, why should we  not

devote   time  to  trying  out  the  new  Lennox-Boyd

constitution? We could come back from London and tell

the   people   that  we  could  not   get   what   we

wanted - immediate independence - but we could tell  them

that  the  British Government had promised to  review

the  position  after two years' working  of  the  new

constitution.  We could then educate our  people  and

reorganise our nationalist movement for independence.

Maybe in one year, maybe in six months, we could  get

Dominion status. That was what I told the delegation,

but  my  proposal did not have a seconder,  not  even

from my colleagues! [Interruption.] No, I am speaking

now as -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The hon. Member must

remember  that he is addressing the Chair, and  there

cannot be any asides with Members on the right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> I am sorry, Sir. Then we came

to the voting. The voting was most harmful to me. Now

many  people  call me a lost political trustee.  "Lim

Cher Kheng is bribed by David Marshall for $100,000!"

So  my proposal was turned down, first, because I did

not  even have a seconder, and, secondly, I  did  not

have  any chance for a fair voting because the leader

of the delegation, the Chief Minister, said the talks

must  break down. We all knew the procedure at  these

delegation meetings. If all Parties agreed, then  the

leader  of the delegation could go back and tell  Mr

Lennox Boyd, "All the delegates agree. This is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>



our  stand."  But if a certain delegate abstained  or

spoke  against the matter under discussion, I do  not

think  the Chief Minister could go back and tell  Mr

Lennox-Boyd  that the delegates had agreed.  Although

there  would  be  a  majority decision,  the  British

Government and the whole world would know that  there

were  certain  members  in  the  delegation  who  had

disagreed with the leader of the Merdeka Mission.  At

the  delegation meetings I never regarded  the  Chief

Minister  as  the  leader  of  the  Labour  Front.  I

regarded   him  as  the  leader  of  the  people   of

Singapore. I can let Mr Marshall down, but I  cannot

let the people of Singapore down. For the dignity  of

the  people of Singapore, I said, "David, I  am  with

you!"  And  even today I maintain that I  was  right.

Therefore   I  find  that  I  have  no  grounds   for

supporting this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, this is indeed a

frightening amendment, frightening in the sense  that

it  implies  that  the country and  the  people  have

suffered  the  loss of a good deal of confidence  and

stability,  and because it further implies  that  the

people  should be aware of the true state of affairs.

Sir,  the  people of Singapore, as  far  as  I  know,

understood  fully the contents of the recommendations

made  by the delegation at the London conference  and

the  reasons  for its failure, and I cannot  see  any

reason  why  anybody should go and frighten  them  by

saying, "Look, you have lost a lot of confidence.  We

have  no  stability in this country and we should  do

something about it." Therefore, I feel, Sir, that the

keynote  of  this amendment is absolute fear  in  the

mind of the mover, and if anybody supports it, he  is

also afraid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Sir, if I want to fight for freedom from

slavery  and  to  achieve political  emancipation,  I

should have to fight to get rid of fear. I should  be

free  from fear; and that is the main thing  to  tell

the people - that if we are going to fight for freedom,

we must rid our minds of fear.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think that the Liberal-Socialist Party is

misleading the people by frightening them. They  feel

that if freedom comes to us politically, capital will

fly  away; individual liberty will fly away and there

will  be  nothing left for the people. This stand  is

absolutely untrue and if this propaganda of fear goes

on  in  the  minds of the people, the Party  will  be

doing a great disservice to the future generation.  I

feel  that the people should be taught that the first

thing  to  achieve is freedom from fear, and  by  the

guidance  of the political Parties - guidance  in  the

right  direction - we shall be in a position to educate

the people to achieve freedom, a freedom which we all

would like to have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, Sir, the reason for failure of the

talks   in  London  was  on  a  fundamentally   basic

issue - the  issue whether Singapore is to  be  granted

complete  internal self-government,  or  whether  the

internal   administration   should   be    a    mixed

administration  of the United Kingdom Government  and

that of Singapore. As far as I am concerned, Sir, the

delegation as a whole had shown to the people and the

Government  of Britain that the people  of  Singapore

were  not  prepared to accept a mixed internal  self-government.  The  people of Singapore  want  a  self-government  through  which they can  attain  complete

freedom  from political rule, and to me this  is  the

right  step  for them to take in order to  achieve  a

feeling of confidence and stability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the United Kingdom Government

have  one  point  in  their mind.  The  international

problem confronting Britain is so top-heavy that they

could  not  even accede to a discussion  on  internal

problems. But the urge of the people of Singapore and

the will of the people of Singapore, demonstrated  to

the  United Kingdom through a resolution approved  by

the  Assembly, were reasons that prompted the  United

Kingdom  to  open this discussion. It  has  now  been

established  beyond  all  doubt  that  the  Singapore

delegation had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>



been exceptionally smart in winning for the people of

Singapore a just solution. It may be incomplete,  but

I feel that we should not take that too seriously. We

have  made  a  beginning and if we  are  sincere  and

honest  with  the  people of Singapore,  not  in  the

distant  future but in the near future,  we  will  be

able  to  attain the freedom that we are  anxious  to

get.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment will mislead the people. It

will  confuse them to such an extent that  they  will

not be able to know what this Assembly want, and what

the Government want. On those grounds, I feel that it

is completely irrelevant to the whole question of our

fight for freedom, and I oppose the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the big arm of

the  Liberal-Socialists represented here were members

of  the now defunct Progressive Party. May they  rest

in peace! During the seven years that the Progressive

Party held sway in the Legislative Council before the

coming  into  force of the Rendel Constitution,  they

were  wont  to  bask in the glory of  their  colonial

masters,  so much so that the verdict of  the  public

during   the  last  general  election  was  clear - the

Progressive Party could be trusted no more. Hence the

defeat  of  all their stalwarts. I thought  they  had

learnt  their  mistakes when  they  merged  with  the

Democratic  Party and gave birth to that strange  and

incomprehensible product - the Liberal-Socialist Party.

The  public, however, Sir, has not been taken  in  by

this change of front, which is nothing but a sham  to

hoodwink  the electorate. By their antics, they  have

disclosed  their  true  colours.  I  find   it   very

difficult  to  understand their  political  ideology,

because they are neither Liberals nor Socialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Serangoon was speaking

yesterday, I stood up on a point of clarification. He

said,  with  his, chest out and in a loud voice,  "We've

got citizenship." I stood up and asked him



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>



whom  he  meant by "we", and I was glad to hear  then

that he meant the whole delegation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We were asking what our demands

were.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Why should I seek clarification -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please address your remarks to

the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Why should I seek clarification

on this point, Sir? Because when we were in London in

the  midst  of  our Merdeka talks, news was  received

from Singapore that the Liberal-Socialists fought and

won  citizenship rights for the people  of  Singapore

and  this,  Sir, is what was meant by the Member  for

Changi - no  longer  a Liberal-Socialist - when  he  said

that  the All-Party Delegation in London were playing

party politics. Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister,  in

moving  his substantive motion yesterday, endeavoured

to  give  the Liberal-Socialists a political lift  in

the   estimation  of  the  public,   and   even   the

representatives of the P.A.P. - who are most violent in

their  criticism  of the Liberal-Socialists - in  their

speeches yesterday had no ill-feelings towards  them.

Why  were these friendly overtures made to the Member

for  Serangoon  who, I believe now,  must  have  been

mesmerised by the leader of the P.A.P. who said  that

the  man  must be getting mad? Why did we make  these

friendly overtures to the Liberal-Socialists, Sir? It

is  because we believe, and believe rightly, that  we

now  must have a common, united, non-Communist  front

if  the next delegation going to London to resume the

fight  for  freedom were to succeed. We believe  that

success could only be attained if we could speak from

a  position  of  strength.  If,  Sir,  they  had  any

political acumen, they would have cashed in on  these

friendly overtures and thereby draw strength from  us

for  the battle that is to come. But what do we  see?

We see the ridiculous spectacle of a political Party,

which  claims to fight for the inalienable rights  of

the  people of Singapore, crumbling just because  the

Colonial Office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>



had  applied  the whip, and now they are prepared  to

debase  the  dignity of the people  of  Singapore  by

saying  that the delegation should have accepted  the

offer   of   Her   Majesty's  Government.   Did   the

representatives  of  the  Liberal-Socialists  express

such  an  opinion in London? They did not.  When  the

fateful  question was put to them whether or not  the

delegation  should accept the offer of Her  Majesty's

Government, they abstained from voting, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Point of order. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I was at the meeting -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the hon. Member's point of

order? Is it a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon. Member indicate his

point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Contrary to what the Minister for

Labour  and  Welfare  (Mr Lim Yew  Hock)  said,  the

actual  question  the  Chief  Minister  put  to   the

delegation  during  the  15-minute  adjournment  was,

"Anyone  in  favour of the breakdown of  the  talks?"

That was the question asked, and I made an appeal,  1

told the Chief Minister of the consequences -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member come to

his point of order and not make a speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, the statement that the

Minister  for  Labour and Welfare has  made  to  this

House is all wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have said on many

occasions  and  I  say  it  again  that  the  English

language is indeed a difficult language! I said  they

abstained.   They  really  abstained,  whatever   the

question   was.  "Do  you  agree  with  our   stand?"

"Abstain."  If  they  wished to  accept  the  British

offer,  they could have said, "We are against."  But,

no, they abstained, because at that time they did not

have the courage of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>



their  convictions, or maybe at that time  they  were

not  yet so repentant as they are now since they came

back  to Singapore. Three of them abstained, but  the

fourth  representative - the Member for  Changi - was  so

fed up to the teeth with them that he openly declared

yesterday, "I do not want party politics any more.  I

declare  myself  an independent." And he  dissociated

himself  from membership of a Party that  is  neither

Liberal nor Socialist. In London, Sir, they said  one

thing and now in Singapore they say another, and  yet

the   Member  for  Tanglin  talked  of  cynicism  and

political  dishonesty! Can he please tell me  how  he

would describe the behaviour of his own Party members

when  in  London they said they abstained  and  today

here they say the delegation should have accepted?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Absolutely correct!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> All right, all right! Therefore I

would say, if I may, to the people of Singapore,  "Oh

people  of  Singapore, punish them not for what  they

do, because they know not what they do!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now examine the cause of this

amendment, which is yet another change of  front.  In

London,  when there was an indication of  a  possible

breakdown  in  the  talks,  we  received  news   from

Singapore that the Liberal-Socialists were so brazen-faced  as  to  announce that they  were  willing  and

prepared to take over the government!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> My god!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> The news, Sir, did not cause us

any  consternation. In fact, it  gave  us  a  lot  of

amusement -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And disgust.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> And now, Sir, we are again being

amused by their moving their amendment. Yesterday

the  Chief Minister declared that at the end of  this

sitting he would resign. "Ah, ha! Now is the time  to

make  another bid." And up jumped the leader  of  the

Liberal-Socialists  who  said  that  we  should  have

accepted the offer of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>



Her Majesty's Government. Why, oh why in the name  of

political integrity did they not say such a thing  in

London?  Why did they abstain and now say  that  they

want it? Sir, I really give up!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out,"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Division, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Clear the lobbies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment accordingly negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to speak in support of the motion before

the House,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the stand of its

delegation   at  the  Constitutional  Conference   in

London.



<br><br>The  alternative is to approve the stand taken by the

British  Government at the talks and this  stand  was

the insistence by the British Government that it wanted  control  over internal security, that  it  wanted

over-riding powers to legislate over the heads of the

elected  representatives of the people  and  that  it

wanted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>



the  right  to  interfere in almost every  aspect  of

public  life in the name of safeguarding its external

defence   interests.  This  stand  of   the   British

Government  went right against their own  professions

with  regard  to  the  future  of  Singapore.  It  is

difficult  for  me  to  see,  Sir,  how  any  genuine

representative of the people of Singapore can fail to

condemn  the  stand  taken by the British  Government

during  the talks; and what about the stand taken  by

the  Singapore  delegation?  Foreign  observers  were

surprised by the modesty of Singapore's claims.  What

our   delegation  asked  for  did   not   amount   to

independence.  They  only asked  for  complete  self-government  and  conceded to  Britain  the  right  to

control  external defence and foreign  affairs.  Even

these   modest  ambitions  were  frustrated  by   the

attitude  of  the  British  Government;  perhaps  our

modesty   was   our  main  enemy.  The  response   of

colonialism to modesty had been arrogant. It has been

so   in  other  colonial  territories.  However,  the

attitude  of the British Government has achieved  one

thing. It has brought about a growing realisation  on

the part of the people of Singapore that the unity of

all   anti-colonial  forces  is  essential.  It   has

strengthened  the  people in their  determination  to

bring colonialism to an early end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The English language Press and interested elements

have been trying to put the blame for the failure  of

the  talks on our Chief Minister. I say to this, Sir,

"It  is  utter rubbish." The Hon. the Chief  Minister

has  proved  loyal  to the mandate of  the  All-Party

Delegation right to the end. It is, of course, in the

interest of the Colonial Office and its henchmen that

they  should pretend to be innocent in trying to  put

the blame on others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that this Assembly by voting for the

motion  before  the House will give the  lie  to  the

cheap and dishonest propaganda carried on against the

Hon. the Chief Minister by the English Press. It is a

tribute  to  the patience and reasonableness  of  the

people  of  Singapore  who took  the  breakdown  with

calmness. The attitude of the British Government has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>



aroused  more contempt for Britain than anger against

her; contempt, because she is so slow in learning the

lessons of history; contempt, because at a time  when

colonialism  is  on  its last  legs  everywhere,  she

thinks  she  can  maintain  her  law - a  fortress   of

colonialism    in    the    resurgence    of    Asian

nationalism - and  contempt for those  who  only  learn

their lessons too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In reply, Sir. I would like to

deal, Sir, with a few points that have arisen in this

debate  and  I  shall start with Mr  Sutherland.  He

referred  yesterday, Sir, to the threat of  Communism

as  being  one  of  the reasons why  we  should  have

conceded   this  day-to-day  foreign   control   over

internal  security. Now, Sir, I would ask  him  this:

does  he  really believe that colonialism  can  fight

Communism,  that colonialism can keep  out  Communism

and  that  imperial bayonets and bullets do keep  out

Communism?  For  more  than a  decade  in  this  very

territory, Sir - which is a colonial territory - and  our

sister  territory  across the  Straits,  which  is  a

colonial  territory, we have seen Communism  flourish

and thumb its nose at the bayonets and the bullets of

imperialism.  It feeds on colonialism. The  existence

of  colonialism  makes it possible for  Communism  to

thrive. It is because we ourselves feel very strongly

about  the  Communist threat that we have refused  to

make ourselves partners to this fraud upon the people

in  the  continuation of colonial rule; that we  have

sought a position of stability, of political freedom;

that  we have got to be masters in our own house and,

as  masters  in  our own house, meet  the  threat  of

destruction  from  within. Sir, I have  spoken  these

words before and they may well fall on deaf ears;  if

he  would  permit me to quote, and I  trust  he  will

listen with respect to some words of the President of

the United States of America delivered on the 25th of

May, 1956 - only 13 days ago - I shall trouble the House,

Sir, with a few paragraphs which are interesting  and

worthwhile:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Today a militant aggressive Communist doctrine is

dominant  over much of the world's surface  and  over

hundreds of millions of the world's people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the postwar period, we have seen it indulged in a

particular  cynical type of colonialism  (he  is  not

referring  to the Colonial Office) expressed  in  the

Communist subjugation of once free and proud  nations

in Europe and Asia. Simultaneously, in the free areas

of the world, 600 million people in more than a score

of new countries have achieved independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communism denies a spiritual premise on which

education has been based. According to that  doctrine

there is no God, there is no soul in man; there is no

reward   beyond  the  satisfaction  of  daily  needs.

Consequently,  for  the  human  being,  Communism  is

cruel,    intolerant,   atheistic.   This   doctrine,

committed  to  conquest  by  lure,  intimidation  and

force,  seeks  to destroy the political concepts  and

institutions  that  we hold to be  dearer  than  life

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Communism poses a threat from which even this

mighty nation is not wholly immune. Yet Communism  in

its  deepest sense is a gigantic failure. Even in the

countries  that dominate, hundreds of millions  there

still  cling  to  their religious faiths,  still  are

moved  by  aspirations for justice and  for  freedom,

still  dream of the day when they can walk fearlessly

in the fullness of human freedom."



<br><br>Just  as we in Singapore subject to the authoritarian

rule  of the Colonial Office dream of walking in  the

fullness of freedom. Two more paragraphs, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The destiny of man is freedom and justice under his

Creator.  Any  ideology  that denies  this  universal

faith  will ultimately perish or be recast.  This  is

the  first  great  truth that must underlie  all  our

thinking, all our striving in this struggling world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second truth is that the fundamental principles of

human  liberty  and  free government  are  powerful

forces  of  human energy, loyalty and dedication  and

guides  to  enduring success. They are mightier  than

armaments and armies."



<br><br>That is what we sought for the people, Sir. We sought

to  give  an opportunity for the powerful sources  of

human  energy, loyalty and dedication to guide us  to

success  over  this  threat. We  tried  to  make  the

British people realise this truth, that freedom is  a

greater  force  against Communism than armaments  and

armies.  The threat is there and I say you  will  not

meet  it by the perpetuation of colonialism. You will

only  strengthen it and it may well destroy the  very

interests which Mr Sutherland and I seek to  protect

because, Sir, though



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>



they will not see it, the long-term interests of this

Colony are at one with the long-term interests of the

United Kingdom. In the final analysis, we are on  the

same  side  of  the table but, for the present,  they

would be blind. That is my answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Sutherland - I trust who did not seek to be

unfair - has   made  selective  quotations   from   the

vernacular  Press to prove that the vernacular  Press

was against Merdeka and for acceptance of the British

offer.  I  have read the Chung Shing Jit Pao  of  the

19th  of  May  and  I lay it on the  table  for  hon.

Members  to  judge  whether the  excerpts  which  Mr

Sutherland read were, in fact, fair to that paper and

as  for  the Tamil Murasu, Sir, it is hopping mad.  I

have got this morning's paper and you will permit  me

to read it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Sutherland alleged that the Tamil Murasu also

had  written stating that the time was not  ripe  and

suitable for full internal self-government. What  the

Tamil Murasu had stated in its editorial on the  18th

of  May  is  that  it  is  the  British  Government's

argument  that  the conditions of Singapore  are  not

suitable for complete self-government. The experience

of  the people to take over the responsibility of the

administration  is  very,  very  little - that  is  the

British Government's view."



<br><br>I continue:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Moreover, there are Communist activities here. They

are  not  the  views  of  the  Tamil  Murasu  as  Mr

Sutherland  alleged. In fact, the  Tamil  Murasu  has

been  backing with all its force at its  command  the

demands  of the Merdeka Mission for complete internal

self-government for Singapore."



<br><br>In one paragraph, it has stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far as the Merdeka talks are concerned, the

people  of  Singapore could not find fault  with  the

Chief  Minister.  Right  to  the  end,  he  acted  in

accordance   with  the  unanimous  opinion   of   the

delegation.  It had to be accepted that  nobody  else

could  have  discussed Singapore's demand  for  self-government  as efficiently as he did.  It  is  indeed

curious that the British Government is ready to grant

independence  to the Federation, which  at  the  same

time brings out the permanent bugbear as a reason for

denying independence to Singapore. It is clear,  from

these  passages, what the Tamil Murasu, the organ  of

the Malayan Tamils, stands for."



<br><br>It  seems  to me that there is an apology due  and  I

would  like  to  add  this  since  the  question   of

vernacular  papers has come up: one of my first  acts

on returning from England was to call in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>



Chinese  editors  and, at a separate conference,  the

Malay  editors, to thank them for their honest  stand

in  respect  of  the  aspirations  of  the  Singapore

people,  to  thank them for the genuine support  they

gave and for their clear understanding of the issues.

Let  us  be  clear, Sir, as to where  we  stand.  The

Chinese  Press, the Tamil Press and the  Malay  Press

are  domiciled. They understand the feelings  of  the

Malayans. They do not represent the transient's view.

They  do not have loyalties which blind them to  the

truth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech, Sir, apart from some inaccuracies

and  opinions  with  which I do not  hold - it  was  an

eminently  able  one - there was an unhappy  discordant

note struck by Mr Sutherland. He said in ending  up,

"I  will not censure my Colonial Office." What is the

distinction, Sir, between the attitude of a  man  who

will not censure his own Government department, right

or  wrong,  and  the  attitude of  a  man  under  the

Communists or under the Fascists? None of them do. It

is  democracy that gives us the right to speak openly

and  to criticise where there is wrong and I am  more

than  a  little ashamed of an Englishman who has  not

the courage to criticise his own Colonial Office when

it  is  wrong. I should have thought that  they  have

more courage than that, Sir, and are capable of being

loyal and yet critical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) who, I

am  sure,  would not seek to be unfair, has suggested

that  I  was seeking to cover up the disunity in  the

delegation  and there is an implication  that  I  was

seeking to do this for some ulterior motive.  Let  me

repeat once more, Sir, and I say this in honesty  and

sincerity.     Disunity    there     was - considerable

disunity - but  this  was behind  the  scenes  and  all

Parties  should  be congratulated on  the  manner  in

which they succeeded ultimately in a miraculous unity

in  facing  the  Colonial Office  at  the  conference

table.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi said that all Parties

indulged  in  party  politics.  I  am  sure  he   was

bedevilled and bewildered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>



at some of his colleagues in his own Party but let us

be  fair to those on the Government Benches. He  must

appreciate  that we suffered humiliation  quietly  at

the  hands of the arrogant Secretary of the  People's

Action  Party  and we took it because  we  strove  to

maintain  unity. He must remember the  time  when  he

said  to  me,  "Do not be so soft. Throw  the  P.A.P.

out";  and he must recognise today that we were right

in  being  patient and that strong measures  at  that

time  would  have broken up any unity and would  have

brought  the  odium  of breakdown  on  the  Singapore

delegation  and  not  where  it  truly  rests - on  the

Colonial Office. Sir, the Labour Front did not at any

time  nor  did any individual member indulge  in  any

party politics. Let us be fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) said,

"If we cannot have this poisoned cake, what about the

Rendel  Constitution? Is it not much worse than  this

poisoned cake?" I could not agree more, Sir. This  is

worse than a poisoned cake. It is gilded muck. But we

did  not  put  our  hand to this Rendel  Constitution

voluntarily.  The  people of Singapore  did  not  put

their signatures and accept it for years to come.  We

are  free to fight it and we will fight it.  What  we

would have done in London though had we accepted this

constitution  was  voluntarily in  the  name  of  the

people of Singapore to put our hand to it and to  tie

them hand and foot for years to the constitution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No, two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Even two years.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I thank the hon. Member

for an attempted correction. There would have been  a

right  to  review  after two years but  no  right  to

compel  rectification.  We would  merely  retain  the

status  quo when no agreement was reached.  We  would

still go back to the original constitution. So it was

tying  this  country hand and foot to  an  agreement,

which, I repeat, is worthy only of contempt.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) - and I think the

Member  for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) - has put  the

argument more clearly when he said, "Why not  proceed

step by step? Why not take half a loaf and then go on

to  more?" Sir, the best way to answer that  argument

is  to try and repeat to you the argument of a member

of  the delegation who sought to advise us to accept.

The  Member for Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) was there

and  he  will  remember and this is how the  argument

went.  He said, "Let us take it. We will have control

of  Malayanisation.  We  will  have  control  of  the

Police.  We  would  have organised  the  country  and

worked  up  antagonism against the British  and  then

throw  them  into the sea"; and that is just  exactly

what  would have happened because if we had  accepted

this  constitution,  we  would  have  all  come  back

fighting  and  there would have been  no  distinction

between   the  Labour  Front,  the  P.A.P. or   the

Communists. Would this have made for stability?  That

is  what the Member for Stamford (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy)

was trying to explain. We were fighting for long-term

stability and to have accepted this constitution,  to

have  worked,  to have returned to a state  where  we

would all have to work up anti-racial antagonism  and

anti-British  antagonism,  would  have  destroyed  any

possibility of stability, because it would have  been

for  a  period of years. The British could have  said

quite rightly, "Look, you agreed to this. No more  of

this nonsense. We are not going to see you" and,  for

a  period of years, we would have to stomach and work

up  an ulcer that would have finally spoilt the whole

set-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listened to all the arguments and I

must  say  that  not one argument has been  presented

which has not underlined the correctness of our  move

in  rejecting  this constitution. I now  move  and  I

trust I will have the whole Assembly with me,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the stand of its

delegation   at  the  Constitutional  Conference   in

London.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly approves the stand of its

delegation   at  the  Constitutional  Conference   in

London.

<div align="center"><b>CORRESPONDENCE ON REOPENING OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, I move

the motion that stands in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly takes note of the correspondence

between the Chief Minister and the Secretary of State

for  the Colonies between the 17th and the 30th  May,

1956, as contained in Sessional Paper No. Misc. 2  of

1956,  on  the  subject  of reopening  the  Singapore

Constitutional Conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the normal course, this motion would not

have been necessary and the correspondence which you

now  see in Sessional Paper No. Misc. 2 of 1956 would

have  been incorporated with the White Paper  as, in

fact, Sir, is the case with the White Paper published

by   Her   Majesty's  Government  and  presented   to

Parliament; but I take this unusual step in order not

to   prejudice  the  debate  on  the  stand  of   the

delegation  and in order to afford an opportunity  to

those  who would censure me and who may not have  had

the time to put down a substantive motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will see that I have so worded my motion

that  any Member who may seek to censure me  can  ask

for  the  removal of the three words "takes note  of"

and substitute one word "censures". I cannot bring  a

vote  of censure on myself, Sir, and I think it  must

be  admitted that I am giving the fullest opportunity

to  those who may wish to do so. Because, Sir, it  is

not permitted to assume of any Member of the Assembly

that his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>



conduct   should   be   ascribed   to   irrepressible

unscrupulousness sparked by the malice  of  jealousy,

we  must  assume that he has acted with  a  sense  of

responsibility.  In the circumstances,  Sir,  I  must

assume  that when the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr

Lee Kuan Yew) called a Press conference in London  on

the very morning of the 17th of May when I was making

efforts  to reopen the constitutional conference,  to

his   knowledge,  and  publicly  made  the  filthiest

accusations against me, he was acting with a sense of

responsibility. It is true that by his actions he not

only  sullied me, sullied the whole delegation which

had  just  finished  negotiations with  the  Colonial

Office,  but  he  also  sullied  the  reputation   of

Singapore, in the very country where we were  seeking

to justify our claim for political freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State for the Colonies owes the

Member for Tanjong Pagar a debt of gratitude to  have

given  him  the opportunity to say on the morning  of

the  18th  of  May in the House of Commons  that  the

Singapore delegation had "clearly disintegrated"  and

to  put on record in his White Paper his view of that

disintegration thereby seeking to throw the odium  of

the breakdown onto the Singapore delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I returned to Singapore, Sir, I found that the

English  Press  had taken the cue of the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar and sought to lead the  country  in  a

campaign of virulent abuse that made me the scapegoat

of  the frustrations of defeat. I consider that  this

sadistic pastime, in which the Press of Singapore and

Members  of  this  Assembly have  indulged  of  bear-baiting  the  Chief  Minister, is  dangerous  to  the

welfare of the country and to the self-respect of the

people  of  Singapore. If a Member  of  the  Assembly

wishes  to  attack the Chief Minister  or  any  other

Minister, the proper forum for such attack is to face

him  openly  in this Assembly and not to go  stabbing

him in the back by one-sided Press statements. In the

circumstances, Sir, in order to bring this  important

principle  home,  I  have, as my last  act  as  Chief

Minister,  brought this motion so that  I  trust  the

Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>



of  this Assembly and the people of this country will

appreciate  that  the proper forum for  criticism  by

Assemblymen of Assemblymen and Ministers is here  and

I now give an opportunity to those who have so foully

reviled  me  in  my  absence  to  condemn  me  in  my

presence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar spoke truly

yesterday  when  he said that, on the  night  of  the

breakdown of the conference, I had no idea whatsoever

of  reopening  the  talks,  but  he  must  have  been

conscious  that I had not the slightest intention  of

giving  up the struggle for freedom from colonialism.

The  talks broke down at about 4.30. Between 4.30 and

11   o'clock   that  night,  I  gave  two  television

interviews, several radio interviews and I  addressed

a  large  gathering  at  a  public  meeting.  On  the

following  morning, I considered it my duty  to  hand

over  all  the  conference papers of  both  sides  to

various  newspapers  and I took them  to  Members  of

Parliament including Members of the Labour  Party.  I

then  learnt that at 3 p.m., the Secretary  of  State

was going to make a statement on Singapore. I did not

learn  it from the Colonial Office, Sir, but I learnt

it from some friends who are Members of the House.  I

managed to rush from one of my meetings to the  House

of  Commons  and there heard the Secretary  of  State

explain that the breakdown of the talks, as you  have

heard  from  Hansard, was absolutely, completely  and

entirely due to our refusing him powers over external

defence and foreign affairs. Mr Noel Baker, who  was

there, was good enough to assist me and when he heard

that  I  disagreed with the interpretation  suggested

that he call a Press conference at which I could give

my  own views of the subject, but before doing so,  I

asked  for  an  interview with  the  leaders  of  the

British Labour Party and, at that interview, whilst I

was trying to explain to them why I did not trust the

Colonial  Office - whereas I am completely  willing  to

trust  the British people and the House of Commons - an

idea occurred to me. I put this to them and they, who

are  experienced and impartial, said  that  the  idea

certainly had the possibility of an honest compromise

and it might well be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>

possible  to  reopen  the  negotiations  before   the

breakdown had turned cold. I then returned  in  haste

to  the  flat  and called an urgent  meeting  of  the

delegation  for 6 p.m. This was, Sir, Wednesday,  the

16th  of May. Only a few delegates turned up  and  it

was  quite obvious that they were suffering from  the

lassitude and depression of defeat. I did not wish to

press  it  further. I asked them all  and  I  sent  a

message  to  the remainder to come to the flat  again

for  a  final  meeting  at 9  o'clock  the  following

morning.   That   same  night  as  you   are   aware,

Sir - Wednesday  night - at the end of a very  pleasant

social evening and at the request of the Secretary of

State,  I  accompanied  him to  his  home  and,  from

midnight  till  2  a.m., we discussed  this  idea  for

reopening the talks. He and his Minister of State for

the  Colonies were present and when we ended up, they

both  suggested  that they would  wish  to  know  the

reaction  of  the  remainder of the delegates  before

they  would give their own views. So it was  arranged

that there should be a social function - a tea party - at

which  to  attempt an informal sounding of individual

members before the matter was taken up on an official

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at nine the following morning, the delegates

were  there  and  I  found that  in  so  far  as  the

Opposition  Parties  were  concerned,  they  had,  it

seemed,   received  Party  mandates  and   were   not

interested in reopening the talks. I asked whether  I

might,  on my own responsibility, make this  approach

and  this was agreed to. The Member for Tanjong Pagar

was present and he himself said, "If you want to make

it on your own responsibility, you can do so."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> When was this?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> This was at 9 to 9.30 a.m, in

my flat on Thursday, the 17th of May.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On the 16th of May.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The Chief Minister

says 17th and the Opposition says 16th.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If, it please you, Sir, I have

it  in mind. I have a chronology. Sir, on the 15th we

failed;  on  the  16th there was a statement  in  the

House  of  Commons  at 3 p.m.; on the  16th,  was  my

social  function with the Secretary of State for  the

Colonies, on the 16th also, at 6 p.m., was my meeting

of the delegates and on the 17th morning, was my next

and final meeting. From there, we rushed, I think, to

the  B.B.C. for a broadcast "Calling Asia".  Perhaps

the Member for Tanjong Pagar will now remember.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar, although it was

agreed   that   I   should  do   this   on   my   own

responsibility, lost no time in making impossible the

success  of  the  approach and he proceeded  to  take

steps,  very successfully, to torpedo my efforts.  He

called a Press conference at which he indulged in the

most  scurrilous abuse of me and of the idea and then

proceeded  to manoeuvre amongst the other members  of

the delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar seems to have the

effect  on some people of a hooded cobra on a rabbit.

He  fascinates them and then he hypnotizes them  into

docility and unthinking obedience. You know what  the

result was of that effort to reopen negotiations.  On

the  morning of the 17th, I put my conversation  with

the Secretary of State in writing and he received the

letter on the same day. Now, Sir, what was this idea?

If I may read the letter, Sir - it is not very long:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since the breakdown of the Conference on Tuesday an

idea  for  a  new  approach to  our  differences  has

occurred  to me. I am putting forward the  suggestion

contained   in  this  letter  entirely  on   my   own

initiative  and  responsibility. You  are  aware  how

repugnant  the whole principle of over-riding  powers

of  legislation is to me personally and how dangerous

I  consider the existence of such powers  is  to  the

principle I seek to establish of stable and  friendly

relations  with  the United Kingdom.  These  imperial

powers  of  legislation (as defined by you)  are  far

outside  the scope of what is normally understood  by

the phrase 'external defence'. This question of over-riding  powers is also very repugnant to the majority

of  my  colleagues and in the circumstances I do  not

wish to raise the matter with them again until I have

some assurance that there is a prospect that my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>



suggestion would be acceptable to the Colonial Office

as a basis for negotiation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion is this: -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the over-riding powers of legislation by

Orders in Council and Emergency Regulations sought by

you,  in  the context of your proposal  for  the

composition of the Defence and Security Council,

should be subject to affirmative resolution of the

House  of Commons (such approval to be prior  or

subsequent as the circumstances require);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in order to meet the very real need of the

people  of  Singapore for  an  end  of  colonial

rule,   the   relationship  of  the   State   of

Singapore  with  the United  Kingdom  should  be

outside the scope of the Colonial Office and  in

any other Ministry as may seem appropriate;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that there should be a representative of Her

Majesty in Singapore as the head of the State in

Singapore through whom the loyalty of the people of

this nascent state would find a means of coalescing.

Her Majesty's representative should be a Malayan and

completely distinct from the political representative

of Her Majesty's Government in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you consider this a basis for re-opening

negotiations, I should be glad to hear from  you  and

will  seek  to persuade my colleagues to agree.  Such

resumption   of  negotiations  would  be   completely

without  prejudice  to any decisions,  which  may  be

taken  by either side after full examination  of  the

implications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you have put a great deal of effort into

these  negotiations at a time when you  are  burdened

with  very heavy responsibilities in connection  with

other  territories.  We of the  Singapore  delegation

have  also  been  through  a  period  of  strain   in

stretching  to the uttermost our anxious  efforts  to

achieve agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am quite agreeable to any arrangement whereby the

resumption of the Conference should take place  after

a short period of rest, during which both sides would

undertake  to issue no statement or press interviews.

(This  was, Sir, to meet his particular circumstances

that he had planned a ten-day yachting holiday).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this suggestion proves unacceptable to you and

this becomes my last official communication with  you

permit  me to express my appreciation of the personal

friendliness  you  have  shown  towards  me  and   my

admiration for your very real abilities."



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. It has been pointed out

to  me that possibly the Governor's recommendation or

consent has not yet been signified.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am indeed indebted to you,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir. I keep forgetting  this  is  the

Rendel Constitution. His Excellency the Governor  has

given his consent for this motion to be considered by

the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that last phrase, I was taunted with it by

the  Member  for  Tanglin (Mr  Ede)  that  I  should

express  admiration  for  Mr Lennox-Boyd's  ability.

Well,  let  me say this and I repeat it: I  have  the

highest regard for that man's ability. He is an asset

to  any side for which he bats and I am sorry  he  is

batting  for the Colonial Office. That does not  mean

that I respect his policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may explain these three ingredients of my

suggestion.  I  think  I  have  made  it  clear   how

dangerous  I  considered  the  over-riding   imperial

legislative  powers which the Colonial Office  sought

to  retain  but  if, in fact, it was  no  longer  the

Colonial  Office  that would be responsible  for  the

relationship of Singapore with the United Kingdom but

some  other Ministry accustomed to dealing with human

beings as equals, and if - that is the main "if" - before

the  British High Commissioner could use these  over-riding  powers he had to seek the approval and public

debate of the House of Commons, I considered that the

imperial  over-riding legislative  powers  would,  in

fact,  if not in theory, become almost a dead letter.

Sir,  it  is true that the Conservative Party  has  a

majority.  It is also true that they can  steamroller

anything they want but to work on that basis would be

to  say,  "Let  us have one election and  close  down

Parliament and the majority can do what it  pleases."

That,  in  fact,  as  hon.  Members  in  these  short

fourteen  months of this Government have  learnt,  is

not  the  way  democracy works and the  fact  that  a

matter has to come before the House of Commons,  that

it  has  to be publicly debated and it has to  submit

itself  to  the  full  glare of the  country's  Press

publicity,  would  be a very grave deterrent  to  any

misuse of those powers. It is true that the continual

existence  of these powers even with this  protection

would be an irritation to the people of Singapore but

no  British civil servant would have dared to seek to

interfere in our daily life when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>



he  knew  that he had to obtain the sanction  of  the

House of Commons and his conduct would come under the

scrutiny  of Members of both sides of the  House  and

the people of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir - it may be a little difficult for the man-in-the-street to understand - I have followed with interest

parliamentary  procedure and traditions  for  a  long

time  and  I  was  satisfied  in  my  mind  that  the

acceptance   of  these  provisions  and   affirmative

resolution in the House of Commons would, to a  large

extent,  nullify the evil of the over-riding  powers.

It would, shall we say, be an agent to counteract the

poison in the cake.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second request, Sir, was one that merely

repeated   what   the  delegation  had   consistently

insisted  on - the transfer of our relations  with  the

United  Kingdom from the Colonial Office  to  another

Ministry.   To  those  who  have  not  suffered   the

authoritarian rule and traditions of arrogance of the

Colonial   Office   and   its   inhumanity   in   the

exploitation of its empire, this might seem  a  small

matter.  But to me and to many of us, this is  not  a

trimming  as the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim  Choon

Mong) suggested. This is a matter of importance  both

as  to  content and as to psychological  effect.  The

people  of  Singapore would then  be  conscious  that

there was an end to colonial rule and we ourselves in

our  relations with the United Kingdom would be  able

to  deal  with persons who have traditions of dealing

with  human  beings as equals and  not  as  imbecilic

slaves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and last ingredient of my suggestion,

Sir,  was  that  the British could  have  their  High

Commissioner. Very well, let him be the  Chairman  of

the Defence and Security Council but he should not be

the  head of the State of Singapore. We could not  be

expected   to   give  our  loyalty  to  a   political

representative of Her Majesty's Government with  whom

we  might be in constant conflict on various  aspects

of  the  constitution. It is impossible, Sir, to  ask

the people genuinely to give their loyalty to such  a

personality.  We therefore said we wanted  a  Malayan

Governor-General who would not be a representative of

Her   Majesty's   Government   but   would   be   the

representative of Her Majesty with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>



important  though decorative functions of the  Queen.

In  this fashion, we hoped to have the opportunity to

coalesce our feelings of loyalty and through this  to

grow   to  full  nationhood.  When  the  Member   for

Serangoon  says,  "There  is  no  difference  between

Governor and Governor-General", he showed, if  I  may

say  so, Sir, a complete lack of understanding of the

political  content  of  these  different  posts.  The

difference is the same as between Mr Hitler and  Her

Majesty  Queen  Elizabeth II. One is a constitutional

monarch acting on the advice of Her Ministers and  in

no way interfering her personality in the politics of

the day - which would be a Malayan Governor-General - and

the other is a dictator as is our Governor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, I received a message on the early

morning of the 18th - again from a friend in the  House

of Commons and not from the Secretary of State - saying

to  me,  "You said that you did not get a reply  from

the  Secretary of State to your letter. Well,  he  is

going  to  reply  to you in public in  the  House  of

Commons at eleven o'clock." So I rushed down  to  the

House   of   Commons,  Sir,  and  to   my   delighted

astonishment, I heard him say - I read from column 2381

of  Hansard,  Vol. 552, No. 157 of the 18th  of  May,

1956:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr Alan Lennox-Boyd):</b> I was approached early yesterday by the

Chief  Minister of Singapore (This is, Sir, after  he

has   received  my  letter)  proposing  a  basis  for

resumption of negotiations. As a consequence, I asked

the  Singapore  delegation  to  meet  me  informally.

Unfortunately,  out of the twelve delegates  who  are

still  in London, only the Chief Minister and two  of

his  Government colleagues found themselves  able  to

attend. When I asked whether these proposals had  the

support of the delegation he replied they were purely

his personal suggestions."



<br><br>Now, listen to this, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I stated that I was perfectly ready to discuss

these  proposals (in the plural) provided  that  they

were  put forward either by the delegation or by  the

Singapore Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at 5.30 that afternoon, I received his letter

on  page  2 and you will notice there that he  merely

referred  to  one  ingredient of  my  suggestion  and

conveniently,  may  I say it, intentionally,  ignored

the remaining two. That letter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>



was   received   by  me  after  his   departure   for

Southampton - no doubt, an accident. In any event, Sir,

I  sat  down and wrote the letter at page 3  pleading

for  clarification  and I asked the  Colonial  Office

that it be delivered to the Secretary of State. I was

told that the Secretary of State was on the high seas

and  would not surface for ten days. So I asked  that

it be sent by despatch rider to the Minister of State

for  the Colonies who had already gone to his country

home  and  I contacted him by telephone. I  was  told

that  I  need  not  expect a  reply  till  I  reached

Singapore, but, in fact, I did get a reply, Sir.  You

will find at page 4 from the Minister of State on the

night  before  my  early  departure  for  Delhi   and

Singapore - the  night of the 20th - I received  this  in

which  he said, "I should be in no doubt as  to  what

the  Secretary of State meant", but he still did  not

say what he meant. Sir, I wrote to him a reply on the

same  night  and I taxed him with the  terms  of  his

letter when he was good enough to come and see me off

at the airport on the following morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true we had a conversation then but it was a

conversation  which the Minister of State  emphasised

was  not  for  publication in any aspect  and  it  is

therefore with some surprise and not a little disgust

that I find the Secretary of State in his telegram of

the  30th  of  May  referring to these  conversations

which were supposed to be private in every aspect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was more than a little astonished at the

extraordinary reaction in Singapore to my efforts  to

reopen  negotiations and I asked my loyal friend  and

colleague,  the Minister for Labour and Welfare  (Mr

Lim  Yew Hock), "Can you understand?" He said to  me,

"Well,  to  the  Chinese population, your  action  in

rushing  back  to push open the door  that  they  had

slammed  in your face was undignified" and he  quoted

to  me, Sir, the Chinese proverb about the swallowing

back of your phlegm once you have spat it out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry if there are citizens in this city

who  consider  that  my action in seeking  to  reopen

negotiations was undignified and to them I  will  say

this: I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>



think dignity has its place at the proper time but if

dignity  interferes with the welfare of  the  people,

then  it is not only unrewarding and sterile, it  can

be criminal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I attended the House of Commons on the

afternoon  of Wednesday, the 16th of May, I  realised

that  here was an opportunity either for forcing  the

reopening  of  the talks or for making known  to  the

whole  world  in  the clearest possible  fashion  the

humbug  of  the  Colonial Office  and  their  blatant

unreasonableness.  Either  way,  we  stood  to  gain.

Either way it was for the benefit of Singapore. Was I

to  sit on my bottom with injured pride and sorrowful

dignity  when I could do something to help?  That  is

not  the  way  I  live,  Sir.  Since  there  was   an

opportunity to do some good, I took it even if I  had

to take it alone just as I welcomed the invitation to

break  my stay at New Delhi in order to acquaint  the

Prime  Minister  of India - that very human  and  truly

great  man - of the true facts of the case in the  hope

that  when he does discuss it - as I understand he will

discuss   it  at  the  forthcoming  Prime  Ministers'

Conference - he  would at least be fully  cognizant  of

our own point of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has any good resulted from my effort to force the

reopening  of  negotiations? If I am  to  believe  my

colleagues,  no good has resulted for me  personally.

They say that if I had returned immediately after the

breakdown,  I would have been a hero, but  thanks  to

the  opportunity  I  gave to the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan Yew) and to the English  Press,

almost  the entire population of Singapore was misled

as  to the nature of my efforts. I do say this,  Sir:

my  efforts, if they have achieved nothing else, have

proved  two  things.  They have  proved  the  genuine

anxiety  of the people of Singapore for an honourable

peace  with  the  United Kingdom and  for  an  honest

constitution. They have also permitted world  opinion

to penetrate the sanctimonious smokescreen of British

propaganda and enabled the world to judge of the ugly

brutality of the new British colonial policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This much is now clear as I indicated yesterday.

There  are only two issues dividing the Secretary  of

State  from  me  as these letters  prove.  One  is  a

Malayan  Governor-General; and let us make it  clear:

this  does  not interfere with the appointment  of  a

British  High  Commissioner to  be  Chairman  of  the

Defence and Security Council. That is their business.

We  want our Governor-General to be a Malayan and the

second  thing  Sir,  is  to  transfer  us  from   the

jurisdiction  of  the  Colonial  Office  to   another

Ministry. Only these two things separate us  and  yet

we have Prime Ministers saying, "The breakdown of the

constitutional talks is due to powers  over  internal

security"; and we have the Secretary of State saying,

"No,  no,  the breakdown is due to external defence."

How  is  it possible - I would ask not only this  House

but  I would ask the world that listens - to twist  the

truth  to such an extent as to pretend that  the  two

issues  now remaining between the Secretary of  State

and  myself  can be deemed to affect either  internal

security  or external defence? I have not known  even

Communist  propaganda go the length of  such  blatant

lies - I repeat lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is good for the people of Singapore and

world  public opinion to have these issues clear-cut.

I still hope that once the hurt pride of the Colonial

Office is mollified by the diplomacy of my successor,

it will give way to the pressure of world opinion and

especially  Asian  opinion and  let  me  add  English

opinion,  too, Sir, because when I was in England,  I

was  satisfied that if it was English public  opinion

or  even if it was the House of Commons that  was  to

decide  our  fate  and to decide freely  without  the

coercion  of  a  Whip, we would  have  got  our  very

moderate and very honest aims and plans. I would  not

like  to  believe,  Sir,  that  the  failure  of  the

constitutional conference in fact and in truth ushers

in  a new era and tolls the knell of passing day  for

the  humanitarian  policy and principles  which  made

possible the retention by the United Kingdom  of  the

friendship  and  co-operation of  her  colonies,  and

therefore  I say, Sir, that my efforts in seeking  to

reopen  these negotiations, although they  have  been

abortive - and in this as to who is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>



to  blame, I let the Assembly judge from the  recital

of  the  facts - they have, in fact, clarified  in  the

public  mind the real issues and the public not  only

of  Singapore  and  of  England  but  of  many  other

countries  now  recognise  that  there  is  no  truth

whatsoever  in  the Colonial Office propaganda  about

external defence and foreign affairs. I believe  that

there  will  be  mounting pressure  to  give  us  the

fulfilment of our legitimate aspirations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, I rise to second the motion

and reserve the right to speak at a later stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I nearly missed

this  last  opportunity of sharing a debate  together

with  our  illustrious Chief Minister. I was supposed

to  be  elsewhere at this moment. I still have to  go

very shortly but may I just speak on the position  as

I saw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday, 15th May, the talks broke down. It

broke  down  on  the question of who was  to  be  the

Chairman of the Defence and Security Council and  who

was  to have the last word on the necessity for these

over-riding  powers of legislation. It  was  a  vital

principle  which we had discussed for at  least  five

preceding  days and we decided, on Tuesday,  that  we

could  not yield and that we had to stand  firm.  It

was a matter of principle and we stood firm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think anyone can be more vehement

than  the  Hon. the Chief Minister when he  denounced

the  proposal  as bad, wicked and poisonous.  I  have

here  with me the English morning papers of  May  the

16th.  They  have  more  or less  fair  and  accurate

reports of the series of Press conferences and.  T.V.

interviews  held by our Chief Minister that  evening,

together with one public meeting where I was  on  the

same  platform. One report which gives a fair  report

is the one in the Manchester Guardian. It said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore constitutional talks were broken off

last  evening  with no agreement reached.  Mr  David

Marshall,  the  Chief  Minister  and  leader  of  the

Singapore delegation, will fly home on Sunday - earlier

if he can get a seat on a plane - and will then resign.

He has so informed the Governor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>



who  is in London. It is understood that the Governor

cannot  accept his resignation until they both return

to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall was in a bitter, angry mood on

emerging  from the final meeting, and at an impromptu

Press  conference, he used violent  and  ill-tempered

words.  If,  he said, there were fresh  elections  in

Singapore as a result of his resignation he  and  his

Party  would  boycott  them - or rather,  he  said,  on

second  thoughts, they would put up  advanced  lepers

for election and return lepers to show their contempt

for the present Constitution."



<br><br>Then it goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One need not question the genuineness of Mr

Marshall's disappointment at the break-down of  these

talks - "it  was  the  greatest  disappointment  of  my

life", he said. But it was embarrassing to witness so

frank  and uncontrolled an exhibition of it,  It  did

not inspire..."



<br><br>Sir,  if  we did not agree with those statements,  we

would  have dissociated ourselves from them. He spoke

as  the leader of the delegation. Though we ourselves

might   have   chosen  less  vehement  language,   we

generally shared the sentiments he expressed. But  it

is  important,  when  we conduct  the  affairs  of  a

people, that we should not only say what we feel, but

also  act  in a manner which leaves nobody  in  doubt

that we have acted according to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, Sir, there was no lassitude of defeat

as  far as I remember. I went round St. James Park in

the  morning  to shake off the ill-effects  of  smoky

conference rooms. I had a sturdy lunch -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Lucky man.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and I sat down to read the

afternoon  papers  one  of  which  was  the   Evening

Standard  and  I  think  this picture  of  the  Chief

Minister  described  the feeling of  the  delegation:

anger,  frustration and a slight touch of bitterness.

At five o'clock, I received a telephone call from the

secretary  of  the  delegation, Mr  Hoffman.  I  was

informed  that  there  was to be  a  meeting  of  all

delegates at six. I was astounded, because I  thought

that  henceforth we would just march on  holding  one

public meeting after another. Perhaps on a Sunday  we

would  hold  a  mass  protest  rally  of  10,000   in

Trafalgar Square just like the Cypriots did the  week

before. The students were or-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>



ganising  protest meetings. The Movement for Colonial

Freedom  was  organising a protest  meeting.  When  I

asked  the secretary what it was about, he said  that

there was a possibility of reopening the talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so this was one of the lighter moments those of

us  who were in London shared: I went to wake  up  my

friend  and  back-seat driver the  Member  for  Bukit

Timah  (Mr Lim Ching Siong) who shared my  flat.  He

was  fast  asleep - I do not know whether it  was  the

heavy, tiring and tedious labour of the conference. I

shook him up and said, "We have a meeting at six. You

know  we are going to reopen the talks." He stood  up

and looked at me astounded and he said, "Go away.  Do

not  play  fool with me." So I said, "No,  I  am  not

playing the fool. There is a meeting at six"  and  we

went  and  so  did  the Member for Tiong  Bahru  (Mr

William  Tan).  I think our memory on this  point  is

quite  clear.  It  was  the Wednesday  following  the

breakdown  and  we told the Hon. the  Chief  Minister

that  we could not share his point of view. We  could

not  stop him if he wished to do anything on his  own

initiative. In fact, on that occasion, I was somewhat

dazed by it all. The one who was most vehement was my

friend  the Member for Tiong Bahru. However,  it  was

all  confidential and I went off to dinner with  some

friends.  I  listened, with a sense of doom,  to  the

seven  o'clock B.B.C. news which opened up  with  the

headline  that  the Chief Minister of  Singapore  was

resigning. Then at ten o'clock the B.B.C. news  said,

"The  Chief Minister of Singapore has announced  that

he  has  a  fresh approach." Well, quite honestly,  I

thought  that it was a serious breach of  confidence.

We  were told at six o'clock that the whole thing was

in  confidence. At ten o'clock I heard  it  over  the

B.B.C. I then said to myself, "Well, since it is  now

public,  we  must publicly dissociate ourselves  from

it."  So  we  called  a  Press  conference  for   the

following day at half-past eleven.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the last sitting of this session. If

what  I  have said of him has affronted the Hon. the

Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>



Minister personally, I am sorry. Politically, I  will

not retract one word of what I have said. I acted  on

behalf of my Party and I am convinced that what I did

was  right,  that  my Party had to dissociate  itself

publicly from a secret move which had become public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister flattered me when

he  said that I have an intense power of fascination

over  other members of the delegation. I do not  want

that  compliment. I think it is an insult to them  to

say  that  they acted as a result of my  instigation.

They acted because I think they shared the feeling at

that  time that that was not the way in which affairs

of state should have been conducted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody in this House would be mad enough to

try  and  move  a motion of censure on the  Hon. the

Chief  Minister.  In fact, everyone would  like  this

episode  to  close gracefully and quietly. Unpleasant

things have already happened, and the less said about

them the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the letters which went between him and the

Secretary  of State make melancholy reading.  I  felt

that  the  right thing to have done was to stop  when

the curtain dropped on the 15th. We decided before it

dropped  that that was the right moment. I  still  do

not  believe  that  anything transpired  between  the

breakdown   of  the  conference  and  the   attempted

reopening or the fresh approach 24 hours later  which

had  altered  the situation. We had weighed  all  the

pros and cons before we acted. There was nothing new.

However,  we  are asked to take note of these  papers

and so we will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that whoever picks up from where the Hon.

the Chief Minister left off will be blessed with more

fortune,  with more goodwill; perhaps also with  more

united support from a movement which we should  spend

our  time  in  building. It  is  not  a  question  of

convincing the British people what nice and civilized

people  we  are  in Singapore. It is  a  question  of

building  up a movement which makes it quite  obvious

to them that unless we are allowed to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>



look  after our affairs, we are likely to  take  some

drastic  steps  to put it into effect  against  their

wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the retiring Hon. Chief Minister a pleasant

holiday.  Many  in this House, in spite  of  all  our

disagreements with him, would like to say that he did

not  spare himself in the conference; he worked hard,

he  believed in what he was doing and he went all out

to  do it. Sometimes he was very wrong and I am sorry

we  had  to tell him that he was very wrong. However,

all said and done, we wish him bon voyage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though I have

the  pleasure  of  speaking on this motion,  actually

there is nothing much for me to say except to confirm

my statement yesterday that there were party politics

and  disunity  within the delegation  at  the  London

talks.  Hon.  Members will remember  that  the  Chief

Minister had earlier tried to cover this up by saying

that  the  disunity was only behind the  scenes,  but

just  now  we heard him say that not only were  there

party  politics and disunity after the  breakdown  of

the   talks,  but  that  many  a  time  before   that

happened - at  public meetings, student gatherings  and

even  at  cocktail  parties - the disunity  was  there,

running beneath the surface like an undercurrent  and

only  awaiting the opportunity to come to the surface

when party politics would be brought in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee

Kuan Yew) this: "Why cannot he let the Chief Minister

have  a chance to reopen the negotiations on his  own

initiative?" It was said that the Chief Minister  did

not  keep  his word, which he gave at 6  o'clock,  to

keep  confidential his move to reopen the talks  when

at 10 o'clock the B.B.C. broadcast it. Why should the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar call a Press conference  on

the  following morning and say, "This is  the  P.A.P.

stand."  Was that not party politics? Why should  the

P.A.P. make clear its stand in London and not in this

House? It is true that I told a certain reporter that

I was also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>



responsible for the reopening of the talks. I  should

now like to state the facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to declare that the meeting with some

Labourite  Members  to  discuss  the  possibility  of

reopening  the talks was not prearranged. Second,  it

is  not  correct to say, as the Chief  Minister  did,

that  the  tea party that the delegation attended  on

17th  May  was  informal.  There  was  definitely  no

meeting on that day. No member of the delegation  was

officially  informed that there was  to  be  a  semi-official meeting -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> At 9 o'clock in the morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> No. But after the breakdown of

the  talks  on  16th May, yes, in  the  afternoon.  I

chanced  to  be with the Member for Ulu Bedok  (Inche

Abdul  Hamid  Bin  Haji  Jumat)  and,  I  think,  the

Minister for Health (Mr Braga). We were talking when

suddenly  the Member for Ulu Bedok said, "I think  it

is  nice  for  us to go to the House of  Commons  and

listen  to the debate on the Merdeka talks."  It  was

then  about 3 o'clock. I thought that was a good idea

and  we  went. About 20 minutes later, I  think,  the

Chief  Minister joined us. We enjoyed the debate.  We

appreciated the way in which the Rt. Hon.  Mr  James

Griffiths and the Rt. Hon. Mr Aneurin Bevan went all

out  to  press the Secretary of State to  reopen  the

Merdeka   talks   and  they  emphasised   the   point

repeatedly that he must not let the door close.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the debate, the Rt. Hon. Mr Bevan waved a

hand at us and gave us a sign that we three - the Chief

Minister,  the Member for Ulu Bedok and myself - should

join him in the lobby. We hurried to meet him. He was

joined  by the Rt. Hon. Mr Creech Jones and  another

friend.  Then the Chief Minister said that since  the

Labourite Members might not know much about the talks

with the Colonial Office, it was advisable to get all

the papers ready and he sent the Member for Ulu Bedok

and myself to get them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>



This  we  did  and  then  we went  into  one  of  the

committee  rooms  to discuss the  matter.  The  Chief

Minister  put  his  case very clearly  to  the  three

Labourites.  Then  he  had the idea  of  transferring

Singapore  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Colonial

Office  to another Ministry. He said, "Let us put  it

this  way.  We can trust the British people,  but  we

cannot  trust  the Colonial Office." I think  it  was

during  this  time that one of the Labourites  asked,

"Do  you  not think it is better for us to  make  the

initial  arrangements to reopen the talks?"  But  the

Chief  Minister said, "No, let me do it."  Thus,  the

Chief  Minister was responsible for the initial  move

to  reopen  the  talks.  Then  he  arranged  a  Press

conference,  but I did not know when he arranged  it.

During  this conference the Chief Minister repeatedly

attacked  the Secretary of State, and the Member  for

Ulu  Bedok and I were quite unhappy about it. Because

of  it,  I was forced to speak in Malay to the  Chief

Minister, "Tolong lah, chakap pendek sikit."  I  said,

in  Malay, that since he was going to try and  reopen

the  talks, he should not spoil things by lashing the

Secretary of State with his tongue. I had to stop him

twice by saying in Malay, "Jangan chakap, tolong lah,

jangan chakap." That is the truth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we rushed back to the Chief Minister's flat

and  had a meeting with the other delegates. My  then

colleague  the  Member for Tiong Bahru  (Mr  William

Tan)  asked, "How can I face my friends if we  reopen

the  talks? It would be shameful!" I think the Member

for  Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew)  said,  "I

strongly reject the idea of reopening the talks." The

Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong), I believe,

remarked, "All right, if the Chief Minister thinks it

fitting to reopen the talks, he can go ahead  on  his

own initiative." I can assure this House now that the

responsibility for reopening the Merdeka talks rested

solely on the shoulders of the Chief Minister. I  had

expected  to hear from the Chief Minister  after  his

meeting  with Mr Lennox-Boyd, but there was no  news

from him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>



I  did  not  know that it was arranged that  the  tea

party  should be the occasion for semi-official talks

because  we  did  not  have a meeting  the  following

morning.  We  did  not  know what  result  the  Chief

Minister  had from his meeting with the Secretary  of

State. My Party's view was, "Since we have failed  in

the talks, we are not very keen on going to this send-off  party  and say there, 'Goodbye, thank  you  very

much.'  "  So I did not attend the tea-party.  But  I

would like to take this opportunity to say that if  I

had known that the tea-party would be a semi-official

affair, I would have attended it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking on the motion, I appreciate the spirit in

which the Member for Tanjong Pagar puts it - that there

is no need to censure the Chief Minister. For myself,

I  think  the Hon. the Chief Minister did  the  right

thing, and if the public want to throw mud at him,  I

would ask them to throw a little bit at me too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion

here  says  that  "this Assembly takes  note  of  the

correspondence" and we also take note.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand by what we said to the Hon. the Chief

Minister  at the last delegate meeting in London - that

it  was just not done, for us - the representatives  of

the  people of Singapore - to go back and ask  for  the

reopening  of  the talks after the breakdown.  If  we

were  individuals, it would have been different.  But

we  represent the people of Singapore and I think  we

should know the feelings of the people. However, what

was already done could not be undone.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had the

opportunity   of  reading  these  letters   exchanged

between  our  Chief Minister and  the  Rt.  Hon. the

Secretary  of State for the Colonies, and I  came  to

the  conclusion  that our Chief  Minister  had  shown

exceptional ability in the negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know, Sir, that the colonial language and

the  letter written by the Secretary of State for the

Colonies is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>



an  example of colonial diplomacy. I feel sure,  Sir,

that although some people of Singapore do not now see

the  wisdom of the actions of our Chief Minister, the

people  of Singapore would, in due course, understand

the  purpose for which the Chief Minister  has  stood

and worked all along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These letters and the reports of the Mission have

clearly  indicated  to the people  of  Singapore  the

honesty and sincerity of a man who has worked for the

benefit  of  the people and who is still prepared  to

continue his good work for the people. The relentless

attacks on him from the Press have shown that in  him

lies   the   future  of  the  people  of  Singapore - a

courageous  man  who  is  patriotic  and  who   still

believes  in the sincerity of the people and  of  his

own  Mission. I say this, Sir, because I had occasion

to be present in the Press conference room on the day

the Chief Minister arrived. After half an hour of the

Press  conference,  I heard two European  journalists

talking to each other. One man was asking the  other,

"Now  that we have got these reports, what  shall  we

do?  Shall we praise him or shall we bury him?"  That

is  the attitude of the Press all along against  this

man  who  has  been working for the  freedom  of  the

people  of  Singapore. That is how  the  newspapermen

looked  at  the  man; and I say this,  Sir,  at  this

sitting,  that  the people of Singapore  will  always

appreciate the hard and sincere work which our  Chief

Minister has done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that his resignation and his absence from

the  Assembly will be a very short one  and  that  he

will come back to us and lead the people of Singapore

towards complete freedom and not a half Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly takes note of the correspondence

between the Chief Minister and the Secretary of State

for  the Colonies between the 17th and the 30th  May,

1956, as contained in Sessional Paper No. Misc, 2  of

1956,  on  the  subject  of reopening  the  Singapore

Constitutional Conference.

Revised  Edition of the Laws Ordinance. 1951 (No.  25

order,  by  notification in  the  Gazette,  that  the

Revised  Edition  of  Ordinances prepared  under  the

provisions  of that Ordinance shall come  into  force

from such date as he may think fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be clear to hon. Members, from the

terms  of the motion, that the work of preparing  the

Revised  Edition of Ordinances, which is designed  to

replace  the  existing  Revised  Edition  which   was

brought  into force in 1936 and, of course,  designed

to  replace  the Annual Supplements to that  Edition,

has now been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, copies of the new volumes have been in the

Assembly Library for some little while, I think,  and

I  have no doubt that many Members are familiar  with

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, all that remains to be done is to bring

the  new  Edition into force so that it may take  the

place  of  the 1936 Edition and I am now  asking  the

Assembly to authorise that this may be done.  Sir,  I

hope  that  the new Edition will be welcomed  by  the

Assembly and, of course, by the legal profession  and

indeed  by all who have, from time to time, to  refer

to the laws of the colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to say very much more but I do

not  think that I should allow this occasion to  pass

without   expressing   the   appreciation   of    the

Commissioners - one of whom was my predecessor - for  the

work done by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>



officers  of  my Department and, of course,  for  the

work done by the Government Printer and his staff.  I

am  sure  that it will be generally agreed  that  the

Government  Printer has produced a very handsome  and

well-bound Edition of the Laws. Finally, I  think  it

quite  proper on this occasion that I should  express

my  appreciation  for  the  work  of  Mr  Simpson - an

officer of my Department - and one of the Commissioners

who  has  so efficiently undertaken the bulk  of  the

work involved. Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>ARCHITECTS ORDINANCE, 1941</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly pursuant to subsection (1) (b) of

section  4 of the Architects Ordinance, 1941 (No.  23

of  1941)  resolves  that the Scale  of  Fees  to  be

charged  by persons registered under Part II  of  the

Ordinance   for  professional  advice   or   services

rendered  or  work  done, as contained  in  Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 32 of 1956 be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had better make clear the meaning of the

approval, which I seek from the Assembly. Under  the

existing  legislation, the Board of Architects  fixes

the  architects' fees, subject to the approval of the

Assembly.  The fees were last fixed by the Board  and

approved by the Legislature in 1932 and now, in 1956,

the  Board has had a look at them and has proposed  a

new scale of fees, fixed after discussion, and it  is

now for the Assembly to decide whether to approve  it

or  not. If the Assembly approves, then the new scale

becomes operative; if the Assembly disapproves,  then

the 1932 scale remains in operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing law gives this Assembly no power to

direct  the Board as to what fees should be  charged.

It  has  only the power of veto; it has no  power  of

initiative.  The choice, very simply, is between  the

1932  scale  and the scale now proposed - 1956.  Before

discussing  the new scale, I should like  to  explain

that this motion for changes in the scale of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>



fees  is only one stage in a general reassessment  of

the  professional organisation of our  architects.  I

have had valuable discussions with representatives of

the architects and I fully share their feeling of the

great   need   to   strengthen   their   professional

organisation.  In  the past, they have  maintained  a

close  link  with  the  Royal  Institute  of  British

Architects  and, in the earlier days  of  a  colonial

territory,  that  was no doubt very appropriate;  but

now   with   an   increasing  number  of   qualified

professional men and with Singapore moving very  fast

towards independent nationhood -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I hope so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> - it is desirable that we should have

also  strong  local professional organisations  which

can  conduct  their  professional  affairs  on  lines

appropriate   to  this  territory,  which   may   not

necessarily be the same in its local circumstances as

the  United Kingdom. I have no doubt that this build-up  of  our professional organisations can and should

be  done reasonably quickly. An essential step in the

build-up  of  the  architect's  profession   is   the

recognition  of the civil engineering  degrees  which

large  numbers of Malayans are seeking or have sought

in Australia, so that having acquired the appropriate

civil engineering degrees in Australia, they can then

sign  and  pass plans and function to that extent  as

architects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of getting their recognition accepted

and    approved    and   working   out   satisfactory

arrangements has involved a great deal of work but it

has  been done and has been embodied in a Bill - I must

not  anticipate future business of the Assembly,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, but I can mention perhaps that I had  a

Bill  on  the  Assembly Order Paper which  I  had  to

withdraw - and  one of the provisions would  have  been

allowing Malayans with civil engineering degrees from

Australia  to practise, as I have said.  However,  we

had  to  withdraw the Bill because the  life  of  the

Assembly was uncertain and it was obviously not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>



a  justifiable case for a Certificate of Urgency  to

go  through  the  First, Second  and  Third  Readings

today,  but  it  can be entered again  at  the  first

opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to turn to this actual motion for approval,

the  First Schedule and the Second Schedule  together

constitute a useful advance. The First Schedule deals

with  conditions of engagement of architects and,  in

fact,  it  has  been drawn up so as to follow  pretty

closely the 1954 revisions of the Royal Institute  of

British  Architects  in  the  United  Kingdom   which

provide  a satisfactory model for the purpose  wanted

at  this  stage. I see no objection to those R.I.B.A.

requirements being followed for the time  being.  The

revised  conditions of engagement do clarify  certain

points  on  which there has been, sometimes,  in  the

past,  vexatious  obscurity  and  which  has  led  to

uncertainty, and a more precise definition is for the

benefit of the architects' clients.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Schedule, which is perhaps more

interesting  to  the ordinary man,  introduces  three

valuable changes. The first is the principle of  what

is  called quantum meruit which should now be applied

specifically  when  friendly  relations  between  the

architect  and the client are broken off  before  the

building  is  completed.  The  principle  of  quantum

meruit  means, broadly, that the architect gets  fees

calculated on the work which is actually done and not

on  the  ultimate  cost,  whether  it  is  actual  or

estimated,  of  the  completed building.  The  second

provision is that the architects who are building low-cost  housing below $15,000 a unit need not be  bound

by  this  scale of fees and can negotiate with  their

clients any fee they like, presumably a lower fee for

simple  repetitive work. The client and the architect

can,   therefore,  get  together  and  work  out   an

appropriate  fee for a mass-production  type  of  job

and,  following from this, the former  sliding  scale

which  ranged from 10 per cent to 7� per cent of  the

total  value  of the work done is now replaced  by  a

fixed rate of 7� per cent. These three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>



significant   adjustments   undoubtedly    constitute

improvements over the 1932 Schedule and I think  hon.

Members  will  probably support  them.  If  any  hon.

Member would like to have any point explained, I will

heartily try to satisfy him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I second it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly pursuant to subsection (1) (b) of

section  4 of the Architects Ordinance, 1941 (No.  23

of  1941)  resolves  that the Scale  of  Fees  to  be

charged  by persons registered under Part II  of  the

Ordinance   for  professional  advice   or   services

rendered  or  work  done, as contained  in  Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 32 of 1956, be approved.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move the

motion standing in my name,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section   477  of  the  Merchant  Shipping  Ordinance

(Chapter  150),  resolves  that  the  Singapore  Port

No. S.L. 20 of 1956, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the necessity for an Assembly resolution is to

bring  into  force  the  Gazette  Notification,   the

purpose of which is to delete two landing places from

the  list  of landing places now existing. These  two

landing places are: one at Hylam Kongsi and the other

at  Clyde Terrace, and the need to close them down is

because there is a letter from the President  of  the

City  Council  stating that work on the coastal  road

has  been  hampered because of loading and  unloading

from small craft along these landing places. When the

road is completed, these landing places will have  to

go  anyhow and therefore it is thought that  it  will

help  the  construction of the  road,  if  they  were

closed  now.  Alternative landing places are  already

built  for  the  people formerly using these  places,

along  the  banks of the Rochore River  and  also  at

Crawford Street. Sir, I beg to move.
