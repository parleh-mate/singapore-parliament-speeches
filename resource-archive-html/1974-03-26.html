<div align="center"><b>MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF SINGAPORE FOR THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1974 TO 31ST MARCH, 1975</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of Supply [7th Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head OA --



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head OA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1004*. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs N. Govindasamy, Cheong Yuen Chee, P. Govindaswamy  and Lai Tha Chai.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government announced that all

civil  servants, including employees of  statutory

boards  and aided school teachers, clerical  staff

and servants could opt for a reduced medical leave

and   in   return  compensated  with  a   monetary

allowance or Leave Allow-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



ance, everyone was very happy. The civil servants

were paid their allowance last year, whereas the

teachers were paid only at the beginning of this

year. It is immaterial as to whether the allowance

was actually paid out earlier or later. But what

is unreasonable and unfair is that the conversion

to leave allowance for teachers and other teaching

staff was back-dated to the 1st of November last

year, whereas that for the other civil servants

was back-dated to the 1st of January, 1973. We

know that the salaries of civil servants in the

various grades vary according to their

qualifications and experience. Hence, there are

salary scales for general Pass degree holders,

professionals and non-professionals, skilled

workers and non-skilled workers. There are

different salary scales for different

qualifications, and we have no quarrel about this.

However, in the payment of an extra allowance

which is given more or less for the same reason,

then all of them should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



equally treated. There should not be any

discrimination. For example, take the reduced

medical leave allowance. All of us have traded our

sick leave for a certain sum of money as allowance

in return. It has nothing to do with academic

qualifications or experience. Why is it that

teachers had their medical leave allowance back-dated to only the 1st of October, 1973, whereas

civil servants were more generously treated as

they had their allowance back-dated to the 1st

January, 1973? What is the rationale behind this?

Teachers have complained as to why our Minister

for Finance should treat them differently. They

were treated like step-children by the Minister

for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about two weeks ago when we had a debate on

the Budget Statement, quite a number of Members

spoke at length on the subject of personal relief

from income tax. I do not want to dwell on this

any more, but just to air my views concerning the

reply given by the Minister on this subject. In

his reply the Minister said that he had carefully

considered the question of raising the amount of

personal relief from income tax, but he said that

if the request was acceded to, it would lead to

increased expenditure in the other sectors.

Therefore, he was of the opinion that it was not

feasible at this stage to increase the amount of

personal relief. The fact that the Minister had

now re-assessed this subject shows that the amount

of personal relief, which was fixed about 20 years

ago, is already out of date and inappropriate in

the light of present developments and inflationary

trends. If the amount of personal relief is

increased, it would result in the reduction of

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what I would like to ask the Minister is

whether he has considered the possibility of

getting those who are able and those who are well-off to bear the burden of taxation. We all know

that the general run of wage earners is that they

are living in difficulties. Their incomes are

small and therefore it is not reasonable to tax

them any further. The employers submit the annual

returns on the incomes of their employees.

Therefore, it is impossible for them to evade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



any payment of taxes. On the other hand, the

business houses in the private sector could look

for loopholes in the Income Tax Act to evade

payment of taxes. The Minister should plug these

loopholes and see that there is no evasion of tax

and should not ask the poor wage earners to pay

unduly heavy taxes. It can be done unless the

staff of the Income Tax Department do not want to

enforce the relevant provisions of the law. The

evasion of taxes by businessmen can be stopped.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, your 10 minutes are up.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, under

this amendment, I just want to congratulate the

Minister and commend him for introducing the

Singapore Allowance for pensioners. However, when

he replied to a Question for oral answer on 15th

March, it was pointed out to him that among the

pensioners, those who retired before 1969 had

their pensions computed on the basic wage drawn by

them prior to the time of retirement, and that

those who retired after 1969 had their pensions

calculated on a consolidated wage which included

the cost of living allowance. It is, therefore,

unfair to older pensioners drawing lesser pensions

through no fault of their own. When this point was

raised a few days ago, the Minister did not reply,

but said that it was a separate question

altogether. The Minister himself being an ex-civil

servant would appreciate the need for Government

to look after its old and faithful servants. I

implore the Minister to reconsider the case of the

few pensioners who retired before 1969 and to pay

them pensions computed on their consolidated wage

instead of their basic wage.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, it has been a

long time since chit fund companies were wound up.

Up to now the public has not been told anything

about the results of the winding-up, except for

the punishment meted out on the directors. Anxious

citizens are waiting to see how much can they

recover from their losses. How long have these ex-subscribers got to wait to recover



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



their losses? At the rate we are going, by the

time the payment is made, the amount will be

diminished to peanuts. Would the Minister tell us

what action is being taken in this respect?



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know the present ruling

governing the account of a C.P.F, member who dies

and who had, on his nomination form, named a

person who had since died. Is it true that the

nomination form of the C.P.F, is similar to a

will, and therefore in such a case the family of

the deceased nominee could put a claim through the

public trustee? Could the Minister enlighten me on

this matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic survey of Singapore has been very

well planned and written. Figures quoted in the

annual Budget Statement are apt and they really

show the precise situation. I note that the "oil

crisis" and the consequent economic slow-down in

the industrial countries, world-wide inflation,

international trade and the international monetary

system have affected our otherwise booming

economy. It is indeed sad to note this fact.

However, much credit goes to the planning of the

Government to off-set these ills and to rectify

deficiencies wherever they exist because of these

factors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil crisis, or what could be termed as our

own oil financial crisis, is going to be a

permanent feature of Singapore's life. Anyone who

believes that the oil-producing countries are

going to lower their oil prices to the pre-October

level is living in a fool's paradise. As such, it

is time we introduced legislation not only to

conserve our oil supplies, but also to make sure

that our foreign exchange is not drained out by

buying oil at prohibitive prices. May I ask what

measures have been taken to make sure that

shopping complexes, business houses and hotels

reduce their lighting to the barest minimum? Up to-date what other measures has the Finance Ministry

taken to deal with this energy crisis?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the question of reducing wastage is an

important one. Government should revamp and revive

all the special campaigns that it used to have

some time back. The TV and radio should increase

the number of warnings on the conservation of

energy and "save more" campaigns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget proper, we welcome the statement

requiring all Ministries and Departments to cut

down wastage and unnecessary expenditures. These

are two very important aspects of our economic

life. The Minister also stated that there is no

let-up in the implementation of desirable

development programmes and projects. I would like

to know how these proposals are going to be

checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though there is now publicity in the press and

on the air about inflation, something concrete

must be done if our lower and middle income group

citizens are to survive. Prices of essential

commodities have risen by about 200-300 per cent.

Prices are still rising. Every day a new price is

quoted by the shopkeepers and hawkers. When asked,

some of them say that the Government has allowed

them to raise the prices of goods. Shopkeepers and

hawkers seem to round up their prices to the

nearest 5 or 10 cents in any price increase. This

is because of the lack of I-cent coins. Is there

any method that can be adopted to prevent the

customers from being cheated because of the hack

of 1-cent coins? More effective price controls

must be substituted. Has the Price Control

Department appointed sufficient inspectors to

check on prices? Shopkeepers and hawkers are

adopting the "take it or leave it" attitude which

hits the poor below the belt. The people welcome

statements followed by action, such as the black-listing of bakeries producing short-weight bread.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with this there should be more

NTUC Welcome Supermarkets. These are fast becoming

popular. The people are heeding the call by the

Trade Division to boycott shops selling goods at

exorbitant prices. But there have been cases where

the price of an article in the Welcome Supermarket

was higher by as much as $2 for the same article

sold by the shopkeepers outside. A case in point



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



is the Thomson Road Market where a tin of cooking

oil was sold for $6 whereas it costs $7.15 at the

Toa Payoh Welcome Supermarket. Why should there be

such a vast difference in price? This will

discourage the consumer from buying at Toa Payoh.

Can an attempt be made to check the prices in

Welcome Supermarkets against prices in the other

shops, so as to make the Supermarket prices

attractive to customers? This is the time to do

it, as supermarkets are becoming popular. In this

way we can easily check profiteering by the

retailers. I would request the Price Control

Department, CASE and INTRACO to play their very

important role in the control of prices of goods

in the Welcome Supermarkets, and try to make them

more attractive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, some of the fresh foods like meat,

fish and vegetables in the markets are as old as

Noah's Ark. Cannot something be done to have them

changed or auctioned to the public, and new stocks

brought in? It is better to sell at a cheaper

price than to allow them to perish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Government has

taken the necessary measures, without harming any

sector of the economy, to diversify the sources of

our most essential food supplies, and to revive a

scheme for a rice stockpile. Welcome and SAFE

Supermarkets should be activated to fight against

inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the tourist boom a decade ago,

the Government encouraged people to build hotels.

What has been done to alleviate the plight of

hotel owners by bringing in more tourists and so

increase the occupancy of hotel rooms? Have our

foreign missions played any significant part in

this respect? It has been quite some time now

since Government began its industrialisation

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to-date very little propaganda activity has

been organised for the sale of Singapore made

goods. What action is the Government taking in

this regard? We have, in the past, been

emphasising on the promotion of our Singapore made

goods. It is time that we placed greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



emphasis on the promotion of our locally made

products, both locally and abroad, so as to

compete with foreign goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a daily peep of the newspaper reveals that

our youths are involved in some form of activity

or other. Youth problems of the Republic today are

different from those of the past. In view of the

far-sighted policies of our Government, there is

an urgent need for an effective youth council to

be formed in the Republic, where greater

participation of our youth in more responsible

activity can be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been suggested in the past that

deserving officers be given merit increments as an

incentive to work hard. How many officers have so

far benefited from this scheme?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is hardly any difference in the output of

work between clerical assistants and clerical

officers. Yet the clerical assistants are paid

less than clerical officers. It can be a terribly

frustrating experience for clerical assistants,

with the same qualifications as clerical officers,

to work in the same office with clerical officers

and doing the same job but paid less instead.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Mr P. Govindaswamy. Mr Lai?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai (Henderson):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Sir, we hear so much

about the credit squeeze these days. Indeed, in

his Budget Statement a few days ago, the Minister

has outlined the fiscal measures adopted to

counter inflation. However, the average man-in-the-street or the petty trader is still confused as to

what is going on. When he approaches his bank or

finance company for credit facilities, he is

either turned away or asked to pay fantastic rates

of interest which all goes to add to his cost

which, in turn, he will obviously pass on to his

customers. This will inevitably help to accelerate

the rate of inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request the Minister to

inform the House of the specific areas where such

a squeeze is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



being applied, and whether the measures taken

hitherto have the desired effect. In one of his

recent statements in this House, the Minister

mentioned that the economic prospects of the world

now looked rather more optimistic. I would like to

know when the Minister is going to relax the

squeeze, in the light of this remark. There are

also fears expressed that if the squeeze goes on

for too long the foreign investor will be

frightened away, and this will slow down the

economy of the country to such an extent that it

might be impossible to pick up later on. Sir, I

hope that the credit squeeze will not squeeze the

economic life out of this country in the long run.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Sir, yesterday in this

Chamber when we were talking about agriculture, I

said that it was my duty as a rural MP to raise

the point that the lifting of import tax on frozen

chicken had caused considerable hardship to our

poultry farmers. In fact, as far as I know, some

of them have already given up poultry rearing as a

result of this measure. The Minister for Law and

National Development in his reply informed the

House that this was a matter for the Ministry of

Finance, and that his Ministry was strongly in

favour of reimposing the import tax on frozen

chicken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

ask the Minister for Finance what is the reaction

of his Ministry on this matter, and when will the

import tax on frozen chicken be reimposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the

Singaporean is worried about inflation. Government

is worried about inflation. CASE is worried about

inflation. The trade unions are worried about

inflation. And so am I! I am just wondering how

far will this go, and will Government assist us

Singaporeans to cushion the effects of inflation?

I am wondering whether the Minister can tell us

whether he will, in the few months to come,

increase taxes on petrol, motor vehicles and other

items, or whether he will assist us by lifting

tariffs on more consumer commodities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir,

there are quite a number of questions to be

answered, particularly from the Member for Anson,

but I will answer them in the order in which they

were posed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar asked why the scheme

of allowance in lieu of medical leave for

employees in the civil service and statutory

boards was implemented on 1st January, 1973,

whereas for teachers this was made effective only

from October, 1973. He wanted to know the

rationale for this. First of all, I want to make

it quite clear that there has never been an

allowance in lieu of medical leave, as such. The

proposal which Government made to the unions was

for the payment of leave allowance in lieu of

reduced leave. That means reduced vacation leave.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose and objective of this proposal was

to solve the growing problem of accumulation of

vacation leave by employees in the civil service,

most of whom have very little likelihood of ever

being able to use up their accumulated leave.

There was no such problem with teachers who

enjoyed a different leave scheme and still enjoy

it, and who have their own school holidays.

Teachers were, therefore, excluded from the

proposal from the beginning. There was, as I said,

no intention to provide monetary compensation for

reduction of medical leave alone for any employees

in the public service. However, in the

negotiations with the unions, compensation for

reduction of medical leave was included as part of

a package settlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this settlement, representations were

also made by the Education Ministry, by the

Teachers' Union, and also by the Member for

Moulmein (whose services have not apparently been

entirely appreciated) for the concession of

monetary compensation for reduction of medical

leave alone to be extended to teachers who are

also enjoying school holidays. I must stress that

this suggestion was not initiated nor desired by

the Treasury, and there was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



indeed very considerable reluctance of my Ministry

to accept it. But finally we accepted it with

reluctance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a matter subsequent to and separate

from the proposal for leave allowance in lieu of

reduced vacation leave, and therefore it was

thought appropriate that a different effective

date for implementation should be used. As the

scheme for reduced medical leave for teachers was

accepted by the Teachers' Union sometime in

September 1973, the effective date was to be 1st

October, 1973, in accordance with the normal

Treasury practice of adopting the first of the

month following agreement as the date of

implementation. In the case of the main scheme for

the public service, 1st January, 1973, was adopted

as the effective date because general agreement on

the scheme was reached in September, 1972,

following consultations between officials of my

Ministry and those of several trade unions

representing employees in the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also referred to my

explanation, during the debate on the financial

policy of the Government, that in considering the

question of giving personal relief I had decided

that, other than the tax relief increase for

dependent parents and grandparents, there should

be no concession in the way of personal relief. He

thought this decision was inappropriate in the

light of present developments and that, as the

rate had been the same for the last 20 years, it

was out of date. In this respect, of course, I

have to consider not only whether the rate which

has obtained over the last 20 years gives the same

or more revenue, but also whether, in fact, there

is now very much more expenditure which will have

to be covered by fresh revenue. So it does mean

that if reliefs were given resulting in less

revenue, then I would have to consider applying a

tax in some other way which would make good the

loss in revenue and which would be sufficient to

cover the very much greater additional

expenditure, since the rate of personal relief was

decided 20 years ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I think a word on the income tax system may

not be inappropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



here. This system is progressive in its effect,

the higher income earner paying a higher rate of

tax. So from the point of view of imposing

taxation, if any method has to be used, this would

be as appropriate, if not more appropriate, a

method as any other. The existing reliefs already

ensure that only taxpayers who are in the middle

and higher income brackets are liable to pay the

tax. As an example, in 1972 only 126,000 persons,

or 17 per cent out of a total of 725,000 who were

gainfully employed, paid any income tax. A

taxpayer supporting, say, a wife, two children and

two parents, would therefore be liable to pay tax

only if his annual income exceeds $7,000.

Generally, therefore, the lower income groups do

not pay income tax, and any upward revision of

personal relief would benefit only those who can

afford to make some contribution to Government

revenue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international view of Singapore income

taxation is that we are rather generous in our

personal reliefs and we would do well to broaden

the base of such taxation. In fact, if our

taxation were examined further, it may be that

next year we shall have to reduce the rate of

personal relief rather than increase it.

Psychologically, it would bring home to the new

taxpayers that Government grants, subsidies and

concessions, which are being so liberally

advocated by Members, can come only out of the

generosity of taxpayers among whom perhaps many of

the advocates can be numbered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah asked a question

regarding the extension of pension benefits to

officers who retired before the consolidation of

salaries. He would like the present method of

computing pension based on the consolidated salary

to be also given to those officers who retired

before the setting up of the Salaries Commission.

I have had representations from pensioners as well

as the Member for Telok Blangah and I have

considered them, and I will always consider

representations which are made from time to time.

But this is really a very hardy and perennial

question, and I cannot really hold out any hope

that Government will extend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



the present method of computing pension based on

consolidated salary to those officers who retired

before 1-1-69 when pension was computed on the

basis of basic salary without taking into account

the variable allowances. The exercise to

consolidate salaries in 1969 was intended to

improve the terms and conditions of service of

officers who were then in service, and of others

who would be joining the service subsequently. It

was not intended to increase the pension of those

pensioners who had already retired from the

service before 1969. Officers who retired before

1969 on non-consolidated salaries are already

being assisted in that they are paid a cost of

living allowance and a Singapore allowance if

their pensions are (a) below $257 per month, and

they have no dependants, or (b) below $331 per

month, and have dependants to support. On the

other hand, officers who retired on consolidated

salaries are not paid this cost of living

allowance and Singapore allowance, so that if the

pension for officers who retired before 1969 on

non-consolidated salaries were to be recomputed as

though they had their salaries consolidated, and

if they were to give up accordingly the cost of

living allowance and Singapore allowance, then

about 73 per cent of such pensioners would be

receiving less pension. I do not know whether the

Member for Telok Blangah intended to have this

particular effect.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Oh, no!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I come now to the questions of

the Member for Anson. He has touched on a very

considerable number of topics, some of which are

not really under my jurisdiction or may only be

partially so. Nevertheless, I shall try to answer

him where I can. First of all, I think he said

that the public has not been kept informed of the

results of the winding-up of certain chit fund

companies. I think this is incorrect because a

press release was made on 19th December, 1973,

announcing the initial dividend payment for seven

chit fund companies being wound up by the Official

Receiver. To-date, five companies



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



have paid dividends. Another two companies

will make payments of dividends before the end of

May, 1974. The Government is aware that the

verification of claims for the various chit fund

companies that are wound up since late 1972 has

taken considerable time. This is inevitable as the

process of verification depends on the co-operation of the creditors and the substantiation

of their claims at the Official Receiver's Office.

Until each member's account has been verified, it

is not possible for the Official Receiver to

declare a dividend.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also sought some clarification on CPF

matters which no doubt my colleague, the Minister

for Labour, would be better able to answer. But I

believe that when a member of the Fund dies and if

the person nominated by him to receive his credit

balance had died before the member, the amount

will be paid to the public trustee to be disposed

of in accordance with the law for the time being

in force. If the nominee of the deceased member

dies after the demise of the member, the amount

due to the nominee will be paid to the estate of

the deceased nominee. I hope that clarifies the

point raised by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson then touched on the

Government's "Save Energy" campaign. He must

already be aware of the effects of the campaign

which began last November and the result of the

efforts of the public to restrict consumption of

petroleum fuel and electricity. We made a list of

suggestions to guide the public in the efficient

use of fuel and electricity and gave extensive

coverage in the local newspapers, radio and

television to this campaign. During the last few

months, the PUB sent out inspectors all round the

island to ensure that there was no unnecessary

lighting and that advertising lights were switched

off after 9 p.m. Since the commencement of the

"Save Energy" campaign, the weekly consumption of

electricity, as most Members would know, has

declined by an average of 10 per cent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Essential Supplies Act and the

Restrictions on the Supply, Distribution and Use

of Petroleum and Electricity Act enacted last year

give the Government legal powers to take action

against any wasteful consumption of energy, as and

when necessary. I think the recent increase in the

tariff rates for electricity would also act as a

deterrent against excessive consumption of fuel

and electricity. I think the Member also touched

on alternative measures to develop new sources of

energy. The PUB is replanning Stage II development

of Senoko Power Station to incorporate a dual

firing system which allows the use of either gas

or fuel oil. The possibility of burning coal is

also being examined. Another possibility, as far

back as 1971, is that the Government has

considered the introduction of a nuclear-based

power station in the Republic. Studies involving

the siting of a nuclear power station are in

progress. Detailed investigations on the

environmental effects of such a plant and the

necessity for additional safeguards against

dangers to nearby areas of high density population

in Singapore are being carried out with the

assistance of the International Atomic Energy

Agency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also asked how we check on

development proposals. This is a rather

complicated procedure. Presumably he has in mind

the check aimed at ensuring that only desirable

projects are allowed to go ahead. Generally, if

any project falls within the framework of

Government's major policies, it is prima facie a

desirable project. My officials examine the

various aspects of the projects, such as their

scale, location, phasing, alternative aspects to

achieve the same objectives and so on. When the

projects have been properly evaluated, they are

submitted to a Ministerial Committee, called the

Development Planning Committee, for approval.

Subsequently, the technical details are further

vetted by the Development Planning Sub-Committee

to ensure that there is no extravagance in the

choice of materials or designs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also touched on inflation and

price controls. I have already explained in my

Budget Statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



in some detail the action we have taken, and

I have explained the undesirability of price

control in general as an anti-inflationary

measure. I have also explained the measures that

Government has taken to dampen the price

escalation, including action against profiteers

and the promotion of consumer co-operatives - rather than fixing prices, it is more appropriate

to disseminate information on prices and stocks to

consumers to enable them to differentiate between

unscrupulous add dependable traders, thereby

enabling them to protect their own interest. Only

when consumers, armed with this information,

refrain from buying from high-priced shops and

make selective purchases from shops which sell at

fair prices can the Government's efforts be

assured of success. In the long run this is the

only way to deal with sellers who round up their

prices to the next five or ten cents, as

complained by the Member. At the end of 1973,

there were 35 million one-cent coins recorded as

being in circulation, and there is really no

excuse for sellers not to fix prices to the cent,

especially for the lower priced goods where a few

cents represent a significant percentage of the

price. If there is any difficulty in getting one-cent coins, I think the Currency Board is always

ready to issue more coins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing machinery in the Department of

Trade for the dissemination of price and supply

information and the investigation of complaints on

profiteering will be consolidated. The Singapore

Manufacturers Association will also be helping in

the fight against profiteering by, firstly, doing

their best to print the prices upon their products

wherever possible and, secondly, keeping the

Department of Trade informed of price increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned that he was aware

of over-charging by CASE or the Welcome

Supermarket. Perhaps he should forward his

inquiries to the Member for Potong Pasir and the

Member for Boon Teck. However, if I am asked to

answer this particular question, I would venture

to say that for a limited range of goods the

prices charged in the small retail shops can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



occasionally be lower than the prices charged in

the NTUC Welcome Supermarket. In the case of

cooking oil mentioned by the Member for Anson, as

prices increase some retailers who have stocks

purchased at the old prices may be able to sell at

the old retail prices, while popular organisations

like the NTUC Welcome Supermarkets, where the

turnover is much more rapid, have to pay higher

prices for new stocks and are, therefore,

compelled to charge higher retail prices. In any

case, these prices provide a reference to what

charges would be fair. The discriminating shopper

should, therefore, take advantage of any lower

prices and buy if he can from shops which sell

more cheaply. I do not expect the NTUC Supermarket

to object to this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also spoke on tourist

promotion. He may recall that in 1973 Singapore

passed the millionth visitor's mark, and there was

an increase of 28.9 per cent in the tourist

traffic over the previous year. The hotel

occupancy rate in 1972 was 61 per cent and this

rose to 67.2 per cent in 1973, despite the

increase in the number of hotel rooms from 8,358

in 1972 to 9,413 in 1973. This achievement was

largely due to the tourist promotion and publicity

efforts overseas by the Tourist Promotion Board

and other bodies such as the Singapore Airlines. A

major portion of the Tourist Promotion Board

budget has been expended for this purpose. Our

foreign missions have always supplemented the

efforts of the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board

in promoting Singapore as a tourist centre by the

dissemination of tourist brochures and

information. However, since tourist promotion is a

specialised function, this is done more

extensively by the overseas offices of the

Singapore Tourist Promotion Board which are

established in countries such as the United

States, Germany, Japan and Australia, the major

tourist markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also suggested action for promoting

sales of locally made goods. The Government has

always been conscious of the need for export promotion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



and the Exports Promotion Unit was

initially set up in the Economic Development

Division to fulfil this function in line with an

active trade policy to widen domestic and overseas

markets for manufactured goods. Since 1972 this

Unit has been transferred to the Department of

Trade. The Unit maintains a library service to

provide both product and area information. A

number of seminars have been organised to help

medium and small-sized manufacturers to break into

the export market. The Unit through the Commercial

Secretary stationed in Singapore missions overseas

also help traders and manufacturers to get in

touch with foreign buyers. At the same time,

buyers are actively encouraged to come to

Singapore. For this purpose the Department of

Trade maintains a trade register which gives

relevant details of firms interested in exporting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member concluded his remarks with comments

on staff matters. I am glad that at least one

Member has remembered the need to give incentives

to deserving officers. The merit increment scheme

was introduced in April, 1973. In June, 1973, a

total of 106 officers were awarded merit

increments as follows:



<pre>

   88 officers ... 1 increment

   15 officers ... 2 increments

   3 officers  ... 3 increments

</pre>



Thus, about 30.6 per cent of the officers who were

eligible for consideration under this scheme were

given merit increments. I think that deals with

the queries by the Member for Anson.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta raised a point on the anti-inflationary monetary policy. I mentioned in my

Budget Statement that while this anti-inflationary

policy would not be relaxed, resources would be

made available to facilitate economic growth.

Members may wish to know therefore that as a

result of the monetary measures implemented

recently, the tight liquidity situation in the

inter-bank money market has eased. Inter-bank

interest rates have moved from about 11 per cent

to a more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



reasonable level of 9 per cent. With the reduction

of the special deposit ratio from 5 per cent to

zero per cent in early March by the Monetary

Authority, a significant sum of $73 million was

released to the banking system to finance

investments and productive activities. It is, of

course, necessary that the funds being released

are directed towards financing the activities of

productive enterprises and not for inflationary

spending and speculation. The Member for Delta can

therefore rest assured that the liquidity

situation will not be allowed to inhibit economic

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think there are two comments and two

different points of view by the Member for Jurong

and the Member for Potong Pasir. The Member for

Jurong complained that the lifting of the tariff

on frozen chicken has affected the livelihood of

farmers. He wants to know whether I will reimpose

the tax. The purpose of lifting the tax is to act

against inflation of prices, which we thought had

perhaps gone too far. And the price of chicken has

since come down, and therefore it has to that

extent achieved our purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir made comments that

he hoped that we would lift further taxes in order

to fight inflation. In every case we consider, of

course, the respective merits of the effect on

inflation and also the effect on our manufacturers

as well as our primary producers. And when we

impose a tariff, we do so only for very good

reasons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister

for Finance has said in his reply, by way of a

challenge, that he might consider the possibility

of reducing the personal relief for income tax. I

would like to ask the Minister for Finance this

question. Does he accept the fact that the

recommendations of the NWC are reasonable? I feel

that the answer must be in the affirmative because

he has already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



accepted the NWC recommendation for the payment of

a $25 special allowance to those whose incomes are

below $1,000. My point is: since the NWC is aware

of the difficulties of those earning below $1,000

and even for those who earn as much as $975, then

if the income of $1,000 is used as a yardstick for

the maintenance of a family, it means that the

family will have an income of at least $12,000 per

annum. Then allowing for deductions for personal

relief, reliefs for wife and children, what is the

total amount of relief for a family with an annual

income of $12,000? It is my hope that in the next

financial year the Minister for Finance would

increase the amount for personal relief instead of

reducing it. I beg leave to withdraw the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head OA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1601.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission I would like to range

my comments over amendment (3)*, subhead AA 1702, because they are related matters.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment,  standing in the name of Mr N. Govindasamy, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head OA be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1702.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, this amendment is moved

merely to seek clarification. What is this CPF/MPF

contribution for? Why has there been such a

phenomenal increase from an appropriation of

$1,900 for FY 73 to $14,250 for FY 74, more than a

seven-fold increase? In respect of non-pensionable

allowances, the increase is almost threefold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, similar provisions are also seen for all

other Ministries, but the increases do not seem

proportionate, in other words, inconsistent. For

example, the CPF/ MPF contribution for the

Ministry of Law and National Development for FY 73

and FY 74 is almost the same, whereas for the

Ministry of Foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



Affairs the CPF/MPF contribution has, in fact,

decreased when compared to the previous year. Sir,

would the Minister care to clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, there is a fairly simple

explanation. Let me deal first with the difference

in the provision for CPF/MPF contributions. The

provision for FY 74 is much larger than that for

FY 73 because of two factors. First, about 62 per

cent of the Division III and Division IV officers

opted to leave the pension scheme to join the CPF

scheme. Second, the 9 per cent wage supplement

which became payable from July, 1973, involved

additional CPF contributions. Both these factors

could not be estimated even if they were foreseen

at the time of preparing the Budget estimates for FY 73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for non-pensionable allowances, the provision

for  FY  74  is much larger than that  for  FY  73

because  the former includes the 9 per  cent  wage

supplement which came into effect from July, 1973.

Again   no  fore-knowledge  of  this  factor   was

available  at the time of preparing the  estimates

for FY 73.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increases in respect of these two subheads

vary   from   subhead   to  subhead   because   of

establishment differences. For example, a Ministry

or department which has a high proportion of super-scale  posts  can  be expected  to  show  a  large

increase  in non-pensionable allowances  owing  to

the  salary  revision  for  such  posts  in  1973.

Similarly, a Ministry or department in which  many

of  the  Divisions III and IV officers have  opted

out  of the pension scheme for the CPF scheme will

have  a  large increase in the provision  for  CPF

contribution.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in view of the explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr N. Govindasamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head OA be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BB 1109.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (4), Mr N. Govindasamy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head OA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CA 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask a few questions on the

Jurong  Town Corporation. Firstly, when  will  the

Jurong Town Hall be ready for occupation, and when

will  the  JTC offices move into the  Jurong  Town

Hall? Will the JTC leave behind an area office  in

the  present  neighbourhood when it moves  to  the

Town Hall? And will it set up area offices in each

neighbourhood   for   the   convenience   of   the

residents? These area offices, in my opinion,  are

a great convenience to the residents of Jurong for

the payment of their PUB bills and other charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there have been complaints on the poor

quality  of  work of the JTC flats.  Most  of  the

complaints are related to wall and ceiling cracks,

choking of sewers, failure of the drainage system,

etc.  I  would like to know whether the JTC  would

exercise    stricter    supervision    over    the

construction of flats to make sure that there  are

no malpractices by contractors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, we are aware that the Housing and

Development  Board maintains its own  markets  and

hawker  centres within its housing estates.  There

is  a  Markets and Hawkers Unit to look after  all

these matters. I wonder whether the JTC will  also

set  up its own Markets and Hawkers Division  like

the HDB.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in Sembawang and in other places, the

JTC  will be setting up satellite towns. When  the

satellite  towns are built, will  the  JTC  ensure

that  the  essential facilities such  as  markets,

shop  houses,  schools  and  other  amenities  are

provided  when the flats are ready for occupation?

In  this  way,  when the residents move  into  the

satellite towns, they will not find that there are

no facilities for shopping and marketing.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, I would like the Minister to tell this

House   whether  the  JTC  will  consider   giving

concession to Jurong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



Town  residents  when  they visit  the  parks  and

gardens  or  make use of the sports facilities  in

Jurong Town?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, I would like to seek information from

the   Minister  whether  the  JTC  will   exercise

stricter  supervision on the work  of  the  refuse

collection  contractor to  ensure  that  there  is

regular collection of refuse and cleaning  of  the

grounds within the precincts of the JTC so  as  to

avoid accumulation of rubbish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, I would like to deal with the

question  of  flats.  There are  now  non-citizens

tenanting  JTC flats. Some of them  are  asked  to

quit their present premises and to rent rooms from

Singapore citizen tenants. In some cases, although

the head of the family is not a Singapore citizen,

members  of  his family are Singapore citizens.  I

wonder  whether  the Jurong Town Corporation  will

give  sympathetic consideration to those  affected

families  with  at  least  one  member  who  is  a

Singapore citizen to continue occupying the  flat?

In  the  case of new applications, will the Jurong

Town  Corporation consider those cases where  only

the head of the family is a Singapore citizen,  is

a  worker in Jurong Town, and wishes to settle  in

Jurong  for good? These people who work in  Jurong

Town  are hoping that they will be able to  settle

down in Jurong, provided accommodation is good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to deal with the question

of  the  luxury  flats  in  Jurong  Town  for  the

executives. When will such flats be completed, and

when will applications for purchase of these flats

be  opened  and  called  for?  What  will  be  the

condition  and minimum requirements governing  the

application for the purchase of these  flats?  How

will these flats be priced?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I think I ought to explain

that  while  I  am  responsible  for  the  general

performance and policy relating to the Jurong Town

Corporation,  I  am  not aware of  the  day-to-day

details  of its operations, nor can I be  expected

to  go  into them in full detail. Subject to these

comments,  I  will  try  my  best  to  answer  the

questions which have been raised by the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



Jurong. He asked: when will the Town Hall be ready

for occupation; when will the JTC office remove to

this  Hall, and will there be an office after  the

removal  of  the main office to the Town  Hall?  I

understand that the Jurong Town Corporation  hopes

to  move its offices to the Jurong Town Hall  next

month. It will maintain an area office in part  of

its   present  premises  for  the  collection   of

rentals,  maintenance of flats, and it  will  also

set    up   similar   area   offices   in    other

neighbourhoods  that it develops.  The  next  area

office  will be set up at Neighbourhood  II,  Boon

Lay Garden in Jurong Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained of poor supervision

over construction of flats. The JTC, I understand,

tries to exercise very strict supervision over all

its   construction  work  through  its   team   of

engineers, technical officers and particularly the

clerks-of-works.  If, in fact,  there  are  really

cases  of  unusually bad workmanship, perhaps  the

Member for Jurong can give the particulars  to  me

and I will look into this matter further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about JTC setting up a

Hawkers  and Markets Division. The JTC is  in  the

process  of  setting  up  a  Hawkers  and  Markets

Division to manage all markets and hawker  centres

in  the  industrial and housing estates under  its

control.  This will, I assume, include  Sembawang,

which the Member mentioned. This new Division will

also control unlicensed hawkers in all JTC areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wanted to know whether the JTC

will   ensure  that,  in  planning  and   building

residential  premises, other  essential  amenities

such  as  shop  houses, markets  and  schools  are

provided at the same time. The answer is that,  in

the   planning   and   building   of   residential

neighbourhoods, the JTC ensures that not only  all

essential  amenities, such as shops  and  markets,

are  provided  but  also as far as  possible  that

these amenities are completed about the same  time

the flats become tenantable. It works closely with

the  Ministry of Education in providing sites  for

the construction of schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether the JTC will consider

granting  concession  rates  to  the  Jurong  Town

residents  when they visit the various  parks  and

gardens or use the various sports facilities.  The

JTC  developed  a  70-acre park land,  beside  the

Jurong   Lake,  consisting  of  undulating  wooded

areas,  parks  and pavilions for the  use  of  the

public,  including Jurong Town residents, free  of

charge.  The  admission charges for  the  Japanese

Garden at 40 cents for an adult and 20 cents for a

child are already concessionary rates. This garden

is  not built solely for Jurong residents but also

for  the enjoyment of all Singapore residents  and

tourists.  As such, it is not possible  to  reduce

the  rates for Jurong Town residents. As  for  the

sporting facilities under JTC control, the charges

for  their use are nominal and are about the  same

as those charged elsewhere in Singapore. It is not

considered  necessary to grant further concessions

to Jurong Town residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked whether the JTC supervises the

work  of  refuse collection contractor  to  ensure

that regular collection is done and that the areas

are  cleaned up after removal. The JTC  contractor

is  responsible for collecting refuse from  refuse

chutes  and  transporting it to  the  various  bin

centres  where  they are collected by  the  Public

Health Division. The JTC has a team of supervisors

to  ensure  that the refuse collection  contractor

does his work regularly and properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question which the Member asked is: will

the  JTC  consider  relaxing  its  rule  regarding

renting  of flats to allow a family with only  one

member  who  is a Singapore citizen to apply?  The

present  policy adopted by the JTC for the renting

of flats is that the applicant must be a Singapore

citizen and the majority of his family must either

be  Singapore  citizens  or  permanent  residents.

Single  citizens are not eligible for  JTC  flats.

This  policy on low-cost housing follows  that  of

the  HDB, and it is considered undesirable for JTC

to  deviate from this policy, thus setting up  two

standards.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, about the luxury type of flats now

under  construction, he asked: when will  they  be

completed and open for application, and what  will

the  price  be? The two blocks of 20-storey  flats

comprising  144 units at Yuan Ching  Road,  Jurong

Town,  are expected to be completed by the fourth-quarter  of this year. The selling price of  these

flats will be fixed after work has been completed,

so  that  a proper costing can be computed.  These

flats   are  built  to  meet  the  needs  of   top

executives working in Jurong Town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head OD be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1107.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

say  "Thank  you very much" to the Hon.  Minister,

his Anti-Inflationary Committee and the Department

of  Trade, for their contribution to consumers  in

Singapore. I want also to pay a special tribute to

the  Hon.  Minister for taking such pains  in  his

attempts to alleviate consumer discomfort,  and  I

would like hon. Members to note that I do this not

on  the  basis  that he has not said  nice  things

about  me in the House on the 15th instant nor  in

the hope of prompting him to say nice things about

me in the House today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also rise in support of suggestions to

enact  a Consumer Protection Act by Members during

the debate on the Budget Statement. The Member for

River  Valley spoke on this at length, and I would

also  like  to speak on the subject to  complement

his intelligent proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley called it the

Consumer Protection Act. I would like, however, to

call  this  piece of legislation, which should  be

introduced  as  soon  as  possible,  the  Consumer

Information   Act.   I  call   it   the   Consumer

Information Act because this Act will ensure  that

consumers  are truthfully informed  in  regard  to

products  purchased and because a  Protection  Act

could   insinuate  that  consumers  need   to   be

protected  against  all traders  when,  in  actual

fact,  only  some  of  them are  guilty  of  trade

malpractices.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Act, for example, will require the

labelling  of  all packaged goods  truthfully.  It

will require a statement of weight of contents  or

volume.  It  most  certainly will  curb  deceptive

packaging  and labelling. There will also  be  the

necessity to include the name and address  of  the

packer  on  the  label,  to  prohibit  false   and

misleading labelling, advertising and pricing, and

misleading  packaging shapes. The Act should  also

require   quantity  markings  for  packages,   the

compulsory use of standard quality units and  that

advertisers  furnish the proof in respect  of  the

claims  made.  All goods should  also  be  clearly

marked  reflecting  the  volume,  weight  or   the

dimensions  of  length and width,  wherever  these

considerations  apply.  Consumers  will  also   be

anxious  to  see, indicated, the date  of  use  in

respect of commodities of limited life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE)

does  not  regard  legislation as  necessarily  an

appropriate method of ensuring that consumers  get

a   fair   deal.  CASE  does  not  also   advocate

legislation in cases where it feels it can achieve

the desired end by agreement between the interests

concerned.   CASE   does  not   also   press   for

legislation   unless  the  problems   raised   are

sufficiently serious to warrant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



such  action.  Unless  a  considerable  number  of

consumers  are  affected by  the  conditions  CASE

considers need correcting, legislation is not,  in

the view of CASE, appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still a wide field where it is

necessary  to  lay down rules in legislative  form

not  only to the benefit of the consumers but also

for  the  protection  of the honest  trader.  This

proposed legislation is an obvious example and  it

will   benefit  not  only  purchasers   but   also

reputable traders, who are in the majority and who

are  adversely affected by some of the  activities

of certain dubious entrepreneurs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister did say that he would be

looking  into  this matter very carefully  on  the

15th  instant in this House. I would like to state

that  this  is  a  matter of  utmost  urgency  and

request that it be given high priority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister be charging his Ministry to

seriously   study  the  suggestion   of   enacting

legislation   for  both  consumers  and   traders'

interests at the earliest possible juncture? Would

the Hon. Minister permit CASE to work closely with

his  Ministry to determine the feasibility of this

consumer legislation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, as the Member has noted, I

have  stated  earlier in reply to the  Member  for

River  Valley and others that the legislation  for

consumer protection requires study to ensure  that

there is no danger of accusation of erecting  non-tariff  barriers,  and to prevent  duplication  of

legislation  such as we already have  in  specific

Acts,  which protect Singaporeans from health  and

safety  hazards, and also from the  more  recently

enacted  legislation of some urgency. My  Ministry

is,  however,  prepared to examine  the  need  for

enacting    further   legislation   for   consumer

protection.  I certainly would welcome  worthwhile

suggestions   from   CASE   and   other   consumer

associations to facilitate the study  for  further

legislation. To start this examination of the need

for  further  legislation,  perhaps  CASE  or  the

Member for Potong Pasir could send me a memorandum

outlining the special



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



areas he wishes to have considered early. My

officers can then look at it, and then perhaps

there could be a discussion between him and my

Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that was a most

encouraging reply by the Minister. Most  certainly

I  will put forward suggestions from CASE.  I  beg

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head OG--



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of Messrs. N. Govindasamy and P. Govindaswamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head OG be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1105.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N. Govindasamy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head OG be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the present income tax return form does not

provide any space to claim reliefs for parents and

grandparents   as  well  as  relief   for   garden

maintenance.  Why  must the taxpayer  be  made  to

travel to separate places to ask for the necessary

forms?  If these forms had been designed properly,

this  unnecessary travel could have been  avoided.

Could  a  simpler and clearer form be issued  from

next  year onwards? Moreover, many people find  it

difficult to fill in the present form. May I  know

how   many  people  had  their  forms  filled   in

incorrectly for the last few years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the relief for parents and grandparents is

most  welcome. At least the Government  has  shown

some consideration for the aged and the needy.  At

the  same time it would have been better to  offer

some  tax  relief  for wage earners.  The  present

reliefs were drawn up a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



long time ago, and are no longer practical in view

of  the present cost of living and inflation. This

item  of relief has not been considered along with

the  compensation  for the  high  cost  of  living

nowadays, such as the 13th month pay, 9  per  cent

wage  increase and the $25 interim payments, which

have  swelled  the annual incomes of wage-earners.

But then these higher incomes will be affected  by

their  inclusion in the income tax  returns  later

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Minister will reconsider

the  decision  which he has made in Parliament  on

the  15th  of this month, and instead  consider  a

further  personal  relief  for  taxpayers  in  his

Budget calculations for the next financial year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the present

policy  goes,  we  allow private  house-owners  to

claim  a  tax deduction for maintaining a  garden.

Sir,  the  intention  of this  tax  relief  is  to

encourage  people to help beautify  Singapore  and

make  it a garden city. But I do not think  it  is

wise  to  make it a permanent feature of  our  tax

policy.  Otherwise the Government might be accused

of  being  in  favour of those who can  afford  to

maintain a garden over an extensive piece of land,

as far as the policy is concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> You are not a gardener!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Sir, any tax relief measure

should  be  beneficial to all, poor or rich.  This

particular relief, at present, benefits  the  rich

only  and  should  be  discontinued.  Singaporeans

should have been well-indoctrinated by now that it

is  their duty to keep or maintain a clean, green,

beautiful  living environment with or without  tax

relief or other incentives. Furthermore, these so-called  private gardens are never  meant  for  the

pleasure  and enjoyment of members of the  public.

Instead, members of the public will be accused  of

trespassing  or be chased away by fierce  dogs  if

they approach these private gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, persons who have donated cash to charitable

organisations are allowed to claim tax deductions,

but no such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



tax  relief  has ever been given to blood  donors.

For  these  blood  donors I  think  their  public-spiritedness is recognised only in terms of  medal

awards and certain medical benefits. I do not mean

that these blood donors are mercenary-minded.  But

since  we  allow tax deductions for maintaining  a

private   garden   and  for  cash   donations   to

charitable organisations, why can we not give  tax

relief  to  blood  donors,  whose  blood  is  more

important  and  more precious than cash  donations

and private gardens? Sir, if the Hon. Minister for

Finance  agrees to this suggestion,  I  think  the

Blood Bank will appreciate the generosity and will

not  have  to make appeals in the press for  blood

donations from time to time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

our  existing tax structure relating  to  personal

earnings,  as  pointed out by  the  Hon.  Minister

earlier  on, is a progressive one in that  as  the

income  of  an individual increases, so  does  the

rate of tax. On this basis, the rich pay more, the

poor pay less or not at all. This is fair enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am just wondering whether the Minister

would  consider differentiating those  individuals

who  are salaried employees from those who  derive

their  income from capital investments, either  in

landed  properties  or other business  operations.

For   salaried  employees,  perhaps  the  existing

progressive rate of income tax could be made  less

drastic  so  as  not  to cause disincentive.  Sir,

those  who  are in the so-called middle management

bracket   suffer  most  under  the  existing   tax

structure   and   are  perhaps  among   the   most

frustrated group of people in Singapore today.  As

they advance in life, despite what appears to be a

very  attractive pay, in most cases after the  tax

boys  have finished with them, their net take-home

pay  is  reduced to such an extent that  there  is

hardly  enough left to save either for a house  or

for a rainy day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I will deal first with the

Member for Anson. The income tax return forms  fo

the year of assessment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



1974 were drafted and printed in the  second

half  of  1973,  when the regulation  relating  to

relief  for  maintenance of aged parents  was  not

ready.  A supplementary form therefore has  to  be

used for this year. The parent-relief requirement,

however,  will be incorporated in the  income  tax

returns for future years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax relief for maintenance of gardens is not

an exemption, but a concession by way of remission

and  is  subject to approval from  year  to  year.

Besides, the claim form for garden relief  has  to

be  certified  by  an authorised person  and  tax-payers may not want others to know the details  of

their  income  when  they go  to  this  authorised

person  for  his  signature on  the  forms.  So  a

separate  form for claiming the garden relief  is,

therefore, necessary.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format of the income tax return form has

been made as simple as possible and most taxpayers

have  become  quite familiar with it.  Explanatory

notes  are  also attached to the forms  to  assist

taxpayers in filling up the forms. If any taxpayer

still finds difficulty in filling up the forms, he

can  contact  the Income Tax Department  which  is

always  ready to give information and  assistance.

There  is  no  record  kept of  forms  incorrectly

filled  up  so  that I cannot answer the  Member's

question.  But  I  am  told  that,  judging   from

experience,  the majority of forms  received  have

been correctly completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards giving increasing personal reliefs, I

have already explained in detail in my answers  to

the Member for Paya Lebar and other Members, and I

do not think I have anything else to add to what I

have already stated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta did not think very much of

the relief for keeping gardens and thought perhaps

it  should be eliminated because the relief is not

of  general application. Instead, he wanted relief

for  blood donation in the same way as relief  for

charitable contributions. I only wish blood donors

were  of  such great numbers to be of significance

that  this  principle of relief, being of  general

application, can also be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



applied to relief for blood donation. I think  our

blood donors are so generous that they do not mind

forgoing this slight relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Jalan Kayu, he made the

point   that  the  salaried  earners   should   be

differentiated  from  people  who  receive   their

income  from property and other sources. There  is

already this differentiation in the earned  income

relief,  although  I admit that the  incomes  from

profits,  which are also earned, fall within  this

relief. I do not see how we can really distinguish

them  and  why  should there  be  any  distinction

between a salaried income worker and a man who  by

his  own effort makes a profit on his business.  I

agree  with  him  that perhaps the  middle  income

group  feel the burden of income tax most  because

as they go up the scale, the rates for income tax,

being  progressive, become higher and higher  and,

therefore, they feel that it is very burdensome to

have  to pay income tax. Perhaps they can live  in

the  hope  that  when they go to the  top  bracket

there  will  be  no  further progressive  taxation

beyond that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, what I am trying to point

out is that there are certain inequities. With the

businessmen  there are all sorts of  loopholes  in

the  law through which they can get away, and  yet

their own personal income is subjected to the same

rate  of tax as a salaried person. It is very easy

to  differentiate an employed person from  a  non-employed person. There are people who, because  of

wealth  handed  down to them, just  sit  back  and

collect  rents,  and for their  entire  life  need

never  sweat  for their income and  yet  they  are

taxed at the same rate as you and I, in fact,  the

whole  lot  of  MPs here. Is that social  justice?

This  is the point I am trying to make. It is  not

difficult to differentiate them because  there  is

the CPF which keeps statistics. All employees have

got  CPF  numbers.  I do not  see  why  we  cannot

differentiate them through these numbers  if  they

are employed. But towkays do not have numbers!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when the

Minister  said  that  the income  tax  forms  were

simple  and that all of us know how to  fill  them

in,  I  am  sure he did not mean it. I  have  been

filling  in these forms. Those who can afford  it,

that  is,  the  large business  firms,  which  the

Member  for  Jalan  Kayu was talking  about,  have

accountants  and many other agents  who  not  only

fill  the income tax forms for them but also  help

them  to  fill in in such a way that they get  the

most  rebates. But for people like us who have  to

fill  in ourselves, the tax form becomes more  and

more  complicated as the years go by.  The  Income

Tax  Department now wants us not only to  fill  in

what  we have earned but it wants us to tell  them

how  much  they should collect from us. I  do  not

mind  doing  this  work for them,  but  it  is  so

complicated that I cannot do it. For the past many

years, as the Minister has said, I have faithfully

gone  to the Income Tax Department requesting them

to  help me fill in these forms. It is being done.

But  as  the  years go by I find  that  previously

where we had to wait for perhaps half an hour,  we

now have to wait for one hour, and the crowd there

is  becoming unmanageable. I think there is a need

for a simplification of this form. In spite of the

explanatory notes, if we read them we become  even

more confused. I think it would not be really  too

difficult to design a much simpler form, and  this

is  a  matter which the Inland Revenue  Department

should pursue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I think it is a well-known fact that a  good

number  of  hawkers in Singapore are  making  good

profits.  In  fact,  a good  number  of  them  own

houses,  motor cars, and properties. I  understand

that  some  of them are also partners  in  finance

companies.  In  view of this,  I  would  urge  the

Minister for Finance to look into this matter.  It

is  not  fair that workers are required to  reveal

their  income  to  the Income Tax  Department,  on

which  they have to pay income tax, while  a  good

number  of  hawkers who are making good profits  - some  of  them  are earning more than  executives,

professional people or even MPs - do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



not  have to do so. Perhaps the Minister will look

into  it  to ensure that they do contribute  their

share of tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Why compare them with us?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of

blood  donors, what I advocated was  a  matter  of

principle.  It  is  not a question  of  the  blood

donors   being  generous.  It  is  a   matter   of

principle. Since we allow charitable contributions

to  be  deducted from income for tax purposes,  we

might as well allow blood donors some sort of  tax

relief.  As far as the garden relief is concerned,

this tax policy benefits only a small minority  of

the population.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to

the  Member for Jalan Kayu's comments - he is  not

here now, but perhaps I can still answer them.  He

said  that  there were loopholes which were  taken

advantage of by people who were non-salaried, such

as  towkays and so on. May I assure him that these

loopholes are being looked into all the time. Some

Members   have   even  commented  that   we   have

recognised  the  value of the contributions  which

the Income Tax staff have made towards closing the

loopholes and punishing those found to have  taken

undue advantage of these loopholes, assuming  they

were not legal loopholes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has complained

about  the  income  tax forms and  the  additional

amount of time it requires to fill in these  forms

even  with  the  assistance of the Inland  Revenue

Department. Perhaps he may console himself  to  be

in   good  company  with  people  like  Dr  Albert

Einstein who could not fill up his income tax form

correctly.  But  there  is  also  a  very   simple

explanation as to why it now takes longer for  him

to fill his forms, and this may be that his income

is getting more complicated!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Ho Swee suggested that we

should  tax the hawkers. I do not want to  make  a

general investigation, but I would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



quite  prepared to consider an investigation  into

certain   hawkers   who  are  making   more   than

professional  people only if I could  be  supplied

with  a  list  by Members of all such  hawkers  in

their  respective constituencies. I would be happy

to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has pressed again for tax

relief for blood donors. If he is serious, perhaps

he  can send me a memorandum, as I have suggested,

giving  the reasons why they should be  given  tax

relief, whether they really want to take advantage

of  a  fairly  small relief, and at what  rate  we

should  compensate these blood  donors  for  their

blood.  The general principle which the  hospitals

have  assumed  is  that  blood  donation  is   not

something  which should be paid for. In  fact,  in

certain  countries I believe payment is  made  for

blood  donations, and this is more direct. But  he

is  suggesting an indirect method, and perhaps the

principle of no payment for a donation is  a  good

one which I commend for his consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one unique

feature of this current Budget session seems to be

that  Members of Parliament have been assigned  to

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we

are  giving  too  much work to  the  Minister  for

Finance. However, regarding the income tax  forms,

why could there not be two types of forms, one for

the  workers and the other for businessmen? It  is

better  this  way. The businessmen  will  have  to

declare  everything  in their  income  tax  forms,

while  the  workers  need fill only  their  earned

income and how much they spend. That is all. I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime this year there was a report in

the  newspaper  that two Government aided  schools

had merged into one. This newspaper report made me

feel  that the Government should go a step further

by  taking full responsibility for the improvement

of  accommodation and facilities of aided schools.

Consideration  should  also  be   given   to   the

absorption  of  aided  school  teachers  into  the

public  service. This will break the psychological

barrier  between  Government  teachers  and   non-Government  teachers.  This is  important  because

Singapore  depends on its manpower  resources  for

its development and survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in educational circles, it is quite common

for  Government  teachers to  have  a  superiority

complex over non-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



Government teachers.  As  a  result,  some   good

teachers from the Government aided schools rush to

apply   for  transfer  or  absorption   into   the

Government  education service in  order  to  raise

their  status and reputation. As a matter of fact,

it  will not be much of a problem or difficulty to

absorb  Government aided school teachers into  the

public  service because for the past 20 years  the

Government  has  been paying the salaries  of  the

aided   school  teachers  and  expenses  of  aided

schools,  including CPF contributions.  So  it  is

just  a matter of procedure to absorb aided school

teachers into the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the increased expenditure on aided

schools,  I  feel that the Government should  also

have  a  greater  control over  aided  schools.  I

believe  that the Board of Governors of the  aided

schools  will be only too happy to agree  to  this

move. Furthermore, education is an important life-line  in the survival of a country, and it  should

by  right  be  the overall responsibility  of  the

Ministry  of Education. Only in this way  can  the

development and reform of education be possible on

a comprehensive basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the request of aided school teachers for

medical  benefits  after their  retirement  should

also be considered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sia Khoon Seong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, I am not speaking at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy, are you not speaking too?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, with the implementation

of  the  43  per cent-exposure to second  language

this year, a great number of teachers particularly

in  the  English stream have become redundant.  If

this  is so, I wonder why secondary schools  still

have  a  great shortage of qualified teachers.  At

one  time it was reported that there was an excess

of  400 teachers in the English stream, and yet  a

good  number  of  relief teachers are  still  seen

manning  full  classes in secondary schools.  What

steps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



is  the Education Ministry taking to correct  this

anomaly? The Minister has said that the problem of

mass  transfer of teachers has been resolved.  Can

he elaborate on it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions were supposed to be a regular annual

exercise. Nothing has so far been done about this.

Why?  In  the  last  Budget session  the  Minister

remarked  that the promotion exercise for teachers

would   be  an  annual  exercise.  For  the  first

exercise, applications were called for in 1972 and

promotions  took  place in 1973.  But  since  then

there  has  been  no news. Has the  heart-breaking

exercise  introduced  at  the  beginning  died   a

natural  death?  What steps  have  been  taken  to

correct   the  many  errors  made  in  the   first

exercise?  If  there  is  another  exercise,   the

Ministry   must  make  sure  that  some   of   the

principals do not bungle up things this time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps is the Ministry of Education taking

to  make  sure that there is an increasing rapport

between principals and teachers? How many teachers

are drawing salaries in excess of their principals

and   senior  teachers?  Why  and  how  does  this

situation arise? Should not something be  done  to

correct  this anomaly so that teachers  with  much

more  salaries than principals and senior teachers

be  made  to hold similar positions? This is  only

logical. Would such principals and senior teachers

treat  these  other  teachers  with  respect   and

decorum?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe in 1969 the Primary Pilot Project

was put on trial in certain primary schools by the

Minister.  This project has now been  extended  to

many  other schools. I wonder whether this project

is a successful one. Though the specialists say it

is  successful,  I understand that  many  teachers

sincerely say it is not so, because the project is

still  on  trial  and that the  implementation  of

bilingualism    clashes   with    this    project.

Furthermore,  the children take  a  long  time  to

complete  the  syllabus and they do not  have  any

written  examinations. So later when they reach  a

higher  primary  level where  they  have  to  take

written examinations, they will find it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



difficult to pass due to lack of training. Can the

Minister comment and enlighten me on this subject?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year when primary school pupils leave for

entry  into  secondary schools they  are  given  a

choice  of two schools. Does the Ministry make  it

compulsory for the pupils to go to schools nearest

their home? If not, why is this not so? The pupils

can  save a lot of money and time if they  do  not

have  to go to schools far away from their  homes.

This  will  also  ensure  that  secondary  schools

receive  the  same  number of quality  pupils.  At

present many pupils with good results land in  the

so-called good schools. The rest, especially those

who pass after two or three attempts, are sent  to

some  other  mediocre  schools.  This  is  totally

unfair  to  the  schools that receive  the  poorer

quality  of pupils. Not only do the teachers  find

it  frustrating to teach them, but the pupils  too

do  not have the sense of esprit de corps with the

school for they too know what category they belong

to.  Further,  sending pupils to  schools  nearest

their   home  will  eliminate  traffic  congestion

during  school  days. I am sure the Minister  will

agree  with me that this "class distinction" among

schools should be done away with and should not be

encouraged in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has experienced another laboratory

blast  in  a secondary school. Could these  blasts

and  unnecessary  injuries have  been  avoided  if

proper precautions had been taken? What steps  are

being taken in science laboratories to ensure that

this sort of incident is not repeated?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What steps are being taken in schools to

conduct   fire   drills?  Are   there   sufficient

provisions  of  fire hydrants and  fire  hoses  to

fight fires in schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago it was reported in the press

that  some secondary schools had accumulated funds

to  the  tune of $100,000-plus. There may be  many

more  secondary schools accumulating amounts close

to  the  $100,000  figure. The miscellaneous  fees

have   been   collected  from  pupils  and   these

contributions are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



supposed  to be used for their benefit. But  there

are  schools where such funds are not released  by

the principals to purchase items sorely needed for

pupils' use. The worst case I have come across  is

the   use  of  funds  for  the  purchase  of   art

materials. Many of the schools cannot be  bothered

about art. As such they see no need to spend these

funds  on  the  purchase  of  materials  for   the

teaching of art. In fact, in one secondary  school

the principal allocated a miserable sum of $25 for

art  per  term.  This  is a  ridiculous  state  of

affairs  in  our  schools.  Certain  schools  have

beautiful art rooms built at great cost,  and  yet

some  principals  refuse  to  allocate  sufficient

funds for the efficient teaching of this important

subject.  This is really a sorry state of affairs.

I  have  quoted only one example. Funds meant  for

sports  facilities are not used, and so  also  for

science.  Thus  we  see  why  these  schools  have

inflated bank accounts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, I believe the financial

section  of  the Ministry dictates  the  amount  a

school  may spend per month. For example, a school

with  2,000  pupils may collect $6,000 per  month,

yet  it  is not allowed to spend more than  $4,000

per  month from the miscellaneous fees account.  A

saving  of $2,000 lies in the bank only to collect

interest, and serves no other purpose. Such  cock-eyed policies must be done away forthwith. Let the

money go back to the children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ETV lessons have not been very

satisfactory.  Standards have to be improved.  One

classroom lesson has far greater value than an ETV

lesson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know what is the programme

of   training   teachers  in  the   Institute   of

Education.  It would appear that the Institute  of

Education  is  similar  in nature  to  the  former

Teachers' Training College. What is the Minister's

view on this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are being taken by the Ministry in

their regular inspection of schools to ensure that

schools  carry out education policies effectively?

Some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



schools  are  rarely visited by  anyone  from  the

Ministry of Education, and these schools  tend  to

wallow  in anonymity. Some of the schools deep  in

the  rural areas are never visited by any official

from the Ministry for years.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some schools, the teachers do not check the

compositions written by the students. It  is  just

like  what  is done in the University,  they  just

give  a  lecture,  and that is all.  How  can  the

students  progress in this way? The teachers  just

give them notes, and that is all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, regarding the word "million". The last

time   I   brought  this  matter  up,  the  Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary said  that  it  had  been

referred to the Ministry of Education. May  I  ask

the  Minister  for Education whether  instructions

had  been  given to the Ministry of Culture  about

this?  I  know it is bad for me to talk about  the

word "million" again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if you may

recall,   in   1973  the  Ministry  of   Education

increased the collection of miscellaneous fees  by

$1  per student. At the same time the Ministry  of

Education also announced that the teachers were to

be  paid  the 9 per cent wage supplement.  Putting

these   two   facts  together,  people   get   the

impression that the $1 increase is to pay for  the

9  per  cent  wage  increase.  But  the  fact  was

disclosed  a  few  days ago by  the  Minister  for

Finance  in  this  House  that  the  Ministry   of

Education  had a large balance of some $7  million

in  the School Fund Account. So the cat is out  of

the bag. This increase of $1 in miscellaneous fees

was  made because of higher expenditure.  But  the

Member  for Anson has already pointed out that  it

is quite difficult to make use of the money in the

School  Fund  Account. So  I  would  like  to  ask

whether   it   is  because  of  the  very   strict

regulation  governing the appropriation  of  money

from  the  School Fund Account or  whether  it  is

because  of  too  much red tape. I entirely  agree

with the Member for Anson that since the fees  are

collected from the students, they should  be  used

for the benefit of the students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to speak

on  school clerks. Although the school clerks draw

the same salary as those in the public service, we

must  realise that the duties of the school  clerk

are  more onerous because they have a lot of other

duties to do. They have to answer telephone calls.

They  do typing work, printing, and a lot of other

things.   But  their  services  are  not  properly

recognised.  They do not have division  of  labour

like  other  clerks  in  the  civil  service.  The

allocation of school clerks is based on the number

of  students in each school. However big a  school

may  be,  one  may  only get two or  three  school

clerks.  In some small schools, there is none.  In

other schools they have to share the services of a

school clerk. I feel that the school clerk plays a

very  important part in the running  of  a  school

because,  like  civil  servants  in  the   British

system,  they are so familiar with the  rules  and

regulations  that  they know all  these  at  their

finger tips. So they are just like the head  of  a

department.  As  they  know  all  the  rules   and

regulations,  they  can advise  the  principal  on

procedural  matters.  If  the  school   clerk   is

efficient  he  will be a tremendous  help  to  the

school and to the principal. That being the  case,

we  can see that he is a very important person. So

his  remuneration  and service  conditions  should

also  be  properly adjusted to benefit  him.  That

will only be a reasonable gesture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After considerable negotiations with the

Teachers' Union, the Ministry of Education has  at

last accepted the proposal that teachers with  ten

years'  experience are to be recognised as trained

teachers.  This  only shows that the  Ministry  of

Education is amenable to public opinion.  It  also

shows  that the Teachers' Union has done the right

thing.  But  there are few tens of graduates  from

some foreign universities who have been trained at

the  TTC  for  one  or  two years.  They  are  not

entitled to this benefit, and have not been  given

the  salary  of graduate teachers. Sir,  since  we

want  to  raise the quality of teaching and  solve

our educational problems, we must give the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



teachers  the  proper remuneration  and  conducive

working   conditions.  I  feel  that  the  foreign

graduate teachers who have been trained in our TTC

should  be  properly  recognised  and  given   the

benefit  of  graduate teachers' pay  as  had  been

accorded to an earlier batch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to deal with the question of

medical  benefits for aided school teachers.  This

is only a recent innovation to enable aided school

teachers  to  enjoy the same medical  benefits  as

teachers  in  the  Government  schools.  This,  of

course,  is  a  very enlightened policy  which  we

appreciate.  But unfortunately when  a  Government

aided  school teacher retires, he has to surrender

his   medical  benefit  entitlement   card.   Sir,

generally  speaking,  when a  man  gets  older  he

becomes   weaker  and  so  requires  more  medical

attention.  But a Government aided school  teacher

will not be entitled to medical benefits after his

retirement. So he has to rely on his meagre sum of

money in the Central Provident Fund to pay for his

medical  expenses. This will cause him  a  lot  of

financial  difficulties. Sir, a few days  ago  the

Minister  for  Finance announced  that  pensioners

would  be  given a special new Singapore Allowance

because of the rising cost of living, but there is

no corresponding increase in the CPF contributions

for  retired aided school teachers. So this proves

that they require medical benefits even more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our national policy is to build a fair and just

society.  We  recognise  that  civil  servants  or

Government  school teachers do contribute  to  the

society,  but  we  cannot deny that  aided  school

teachers also make the same contribution. We  have

done  a  great  deal  in the promotion  of  multi-racialism and multi-culturalism. We have also been

actively promoting bilingualism in our educational

system. This is praiseworthy. In pursuance of such

a policy, I understand that this year the exposure

time  for  second language in the various language

streams  has  been  increased.  Because  of   this

English   school  teachers  who   had   taken   an

examination  in second language are asked  by  the

Ministry to teach that second language. Of course,

administratively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



it  may be quite right.  But  from  the

Education  point of view a language  teacher  must

not  only know that language but he must  also  be

proficient in that language. Otherwise he can only

prepare one lesson ahead of the students, and that

is  not the right way of doing it, as the students

will lose the benefits of proper teaching. I fully

endorse the implementation of bilingual education,

but  I  cannot  agree to this method  of  teaching

because  such teachers took their second  language

examination  some  eight or ten  years  ago  as  a

single  subject  and  since then  without  further

brushing  up  the  language they  might  have  now

forgotten  it. Whatever they may remember  now  is

inadequate for teaching purposes. If there is,  in

fact,  a  shortage of second language teachers  in

English  schools, I would like to  urge  that  the

Institute of Education should set up more  classes

to  train  such  teachers and,  if  necessary,  to

borrow  teachers  from Chinese  schools  for  this

purpose.  The  retirement age of Chinese  language

teachers  may  even be extended  by  unifying  the

retirement  age  at 60, instead of  some  teachers

retiring at 55 and some at 60 years. In this  way,

perhaps  the  problem of second language  teachers

can  be solved. But whatever it is, Sir, it is not

right  to make use of teachers who happen just  to

have  passed a second language as a single subject

to  teach  that  second language  in  the  English

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister concerned

whether  he  is  aware  that the  second  language

textbooks  have been changed frequently.  In  some

schools, the student has bought the first Book  I,

but  he  is required to buy Book II of a different

edition.  This  adds to the burden of  parents  in

Singapore,  particularly in the face of  a  rising

cost of living.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, your time is up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore is a small island country with no natural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



resources. The only resource that we have  is  our

limited manpower. In order to make full use of our

manpower and to nurture every individual to  be  a

useful citizen, the Government is allotting  large

sums  of  money every year for education.  In  the

estimates  for  the  coming  financial  year,  the

Government  has  greatly increased its  allocation

for  this  purpose. I am glad  to  note  that  the

Government  intends  to build four  new  secondary

schools and eight primary schools in the next  two

years.  There  are  also plans  to  build  28  new

primary schools and 26 secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure and match the speedy and

progressive   development  of  our   economy   and

industrialisation  programme,  the  Government  is

paying  great  attention to the task of  technical

education   and   training.  The  Government   has

allocated  large sums of money for the  Industrial

Training Board, the Singapore Polytechnic and  the

Ngee  Ann Technical College. At the same time  the

Government  has  also  increased  the  votes   for

industrial    training   abroad   and   industrial

development scholarship schemes. With  all  these,

we  hope  that the votes can be usefully spent  to

realise  our  intentions and that  the  industrial

circles  will  also sincerely participate  in  the

Government's  efforts in providing  the  technical

education needed for our economy, and in  striving

for  the development of industrial groundwork  and

technological  skills  of our  new  country.  From

these  we  can see that the Government  is  paying

much attention to the education of our people  and

is  trying  to  help train our  people  to  become

skilled  workers  so  that they  may  be  able  to

contribute towards industrial development  of  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we know that there are many school

students   who,   because  of  poor   results   in

examinations, cannot pursue their studies and have

become   drop-outs.  These  youngsters  have   not

reached the age for national service and they  are

too  young  to  be suitably employed.  So  without

anything  to  do at home they roam  about  in  the

streets,  visiting the different places, going  to

shopping centres and coffee shops and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



mixing   up   with  bad  elements  in  anti-social

activities. Thus, they become a social problem and

increase  the  burden  of  our  society.  I  would

therefore  suggest that the Government should  try

its  best  to arrange for these youngsters  to  be

trained  in  some industrial training  centres  so

that  they can learn some kind of skill to  enable

them  to earn a living and to contribute something

to  our  society. Of course, there is  a  need  to

further   improve  the  training  facilities   and

contents  in  these centres. On  the  other  hand,

parents should also change their attitude and send

their  children  to  such centres  for  industrial

training because in the long-term it would benefit

them and the country as a whole.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a higher institution of learning is a very

important  link in the educational system  of  any

country  for  the  training of  better  personnel.

Therefore,  our  college and university  education

should   be   in  keeping  with  the   needs   and

development  of  our country in order  to  educate

more  useful citizens to enable them to help build

our country and contribute to our society. Nanyang

University  is  one of our higher institutions  of

learning.  It was built in the colonial  days.  At

that  time,  the  purpose was  to  provide  higher

education  for Chinese middle school graduates  in

Singapore and Malaya and also to provide  teachers

for  Chinese  middle schools. However,  today  the

situation  is  different. Singapore  and  Malaysia

have  become  separate independent  countries.  In

recent  years, our Government has been trying  its

best   to   promote   industrialisation   and   to

modernise.  In order to match our development  and

practical   needs,  our  educational  system   has

changed   basically.  The  Government   has   been

implementing   the  policy  of  bilingualism   and

technical education in all schools. The University

of  Singapore  and the Singapore  Polytechnic  are

also  opening their doors to students from Chinese

middle  schools.  Thus, Nanyang University  is  no

longer the only institution of higher learning for

Chinese  school students. Nantah has also provided a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



large number of teachers It should adapt itself to

the  needs of our society. Otherwise Nantah  would

be  wasting  its resources and producing  manpower

that  does  not meet the requirements of  our  new

society.   So,  suitable  development   of   human

resources  should  be the new mission  of  Nantah.

Recognizing the value of Nantah, and in  order  to

make  Nantah  an important link in our educational

system, the Government has positively assisted  in

its  development and has, in the short  period  of

nine years since Singapore's independence, granted

more  than  $27  million financing  the  recurrent

expenditure   of   Nantah.  During   the   period,

donations  from  Singapore and  Malaysia  totalled

only  $5.05 million, almost 90 per cent  of  which

came from supporters in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our two universities are important links in

our  educational  system. Recent  trends  seem  to

indicate  that  in  order to  better  develop  our

educational   resources  to  train   our   limited

manpower   resources  to  meet   the   needs   and

development   of  our  society  and   to   provide

university education for more people from  various

language streams, our two universities have  taken

several  steps of co-operation between them.  This

is the turning point, and I hope that they will co-operate  on  the basis of quality  and  of  mutual

benefit,  while at the same time preserving  their

individual  characteristics  and  traditions.   In

order  to  enable the public to better  understand

the  co-operation between the two universities,  I

would like to ask the Minister for Education a few

questions. (1) About the Joint Admission Committee

of  the two universities, I would like to ask  who

are  the  members on the Committee  and  what  are

their  functions and duties? Do they  include  the

selection of new students for all the faculties in

the  two  universities? (2) About  the  University

Service Commission, what is the purpose of setting

it  up, and what are the objectives, functions and

duties?  Who are the members, and to whom is  this

Commission  responsible?  (3)  About  new   salary

scales  and  designations for  teaching  staff  of

Nantah, I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



to  say  that Nanyang University had adjusted  the

salaries and also the designations of its teaching

staff  in  1970. And it is going to  do  the  same

exercise  again  on  par with  the  University  of

Singapore.  I  would  like to  know  what  is  the

standard  or  criterion for this exercise.  Is  it

based  on  qualifications, experience  or  present

salaries? How many people in Nantah will  be  made

professors, assistant professors, senior lecturers

and  lecturers after this exercise? (4)  Regarding

Honours   degree  courses,  will  general   degree

graduates  of the two universities, if  qualified,

be  encouraged to continue their higher studies in

the other University? If so, what will be the time

needed for such purpose?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am sorry, but your time is up,

Mr Ch'ng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  read in today's newspaper about streaking in  a

certain area in Singapore. This reminds me of what

the Minister for Finance referred to in his Budget

Statement about birds of passage. I also heard the

Deputy  Prime  Minister answering the  Member  for

Sembawang  in  this House that it  would  be  very

difficult to train our young men through  national

service  to be loyal to our country. According  to

the  Member  for Kim Seng, these birds of  passage

will  in the end leave here and settle abroad.  So

this  has caused me to think of a reason  for  all

this,  and I have found out that it is all due  to

education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to tell you a little

experience. About two weeks ago, I had occasion to

visit   our   young  intellectuals  in   our   two

universities.   I   found  that   those   studying

accountancy or medicine in these universities  are

imbued  with  the  sense  that  if  they  had  the

opportunity to go abroad, they would certainly  do

so,  and  leave  behind their  parents,  brothers,

sisters,  relatives  and  friends  to  live   like

foreigners  and  to  die as  "foreign  devils"  in

foreign  lands. Why is this so? I learned from  my

conversations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



with  them  that they  think  that  in  a

developing  multi-racial country  like  ours,  the

languages  are too complicated, thoughts  are  too

diversified,  and  there is intense  struggle  and

strenuous work. Life is therefore very monotonous.

On  the  other hand, they felt that if  they  were

abroad,  they could enjoy better pay and a  better

life - they would have shorter hours of work,  and

they  could have a longer vacation - so that  with

whatever   knowledge  and  experience  they   have

acquired they could roam the four corners  of  the

earth  as and when they please. If the elder folks

passively criticise these youngsters who are  bred

here, they would be shirking their responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope that from now on the Ministry

of  Education  would,  in addition  to  the  usual

administrative   work,  go  a  step   further   to

strengthen the leadership that guides the thoughts

and ideology prevailing in educational circles. Of

course,  this will affect the career of  thousands

of  teachers. Our teachers today, as we know,  are

enjoying a more stable and better environment  for

teaching. They received better training  in  their

profession,  and  are enjoying a  better  material

life.  On  the other hand, the younger  generation

today,  who are now taught by these teachers,  are

wiser than the previous generation. Of course, the

difference   is  that  their  learning   is   more

advanced, more burdensome and arduous, because  we

have   progressed.  We  are  now   stressing   the

importance of nurturing talents and not the simple

education of a people to be useful workers,  which

was  a system we inherited from the previous  era.

Therefore, our education should now be a  positive

one, aiming at leadership training, and not one of

passive education. So all this will have to be the

new  burden  of our teachers in the  new  era.  Of

course,  in  educational circles  there  are  many

teachers  who  are very faithful and  hardworking;

during the day they are busy teaching; during  the

night  they  are  busy  correcting  homework,  and

during  vacation  or on free days  they  are  busy

going  round  bookshops to look for more  teaching

materials, or visiting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



students  or  taking  students  to  factories  and

places of interest. All this dedicated educational

service  will  influence our youth  and  bring  up

nation-builders. This kind of behaviour,  compared

with that of a small group of rotten and so-called

educational workers, calls for our admiration  and

these faithful teachers deserve better treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a year ago, the Minister for Education

addressed  an educational gathering. He said  that

there were certain black sheep among teachers  and

suggested  the  necessity of drafting  a  code  of

professional conduct for teachers. Subsequently he

told   the  House  that  there  would  be  another

promotion   exercise  which  would  benefit   many

teachers. The Ministry should not give up its role

of promoting ideological leadership in educational

institutions.  It should not ask another  body  to

take  charge of matters of ideological  education,

because  to  do so would give rise  to  the  false

impression  that our Ministry is  not  playing  an

active leadership role in the sphere of education,

as  it would then be no more than a machinery  for

issuing  circulars. For example, I agree with  the

Member  for Jurong that hardworking and  dedicated

teachers should be rewarded. They should  also  be

allowed  to  work  with a sense of  security.  The

Member  for  Paya  Lebar  also  referred  to   the

differences  between Government schools  and  non-Government    schools   in    respect    of    the

administration and traditions and also differences

between schools of different language streams. And

if  we  just talk about the promotion of  teachers

without   paying   attention   to   the   specific

surroundings of the school, it will not contribute

to  the interest or advancement of education or of

the   teachers.  It  will  lead  to  psychological

barriers  and a low morale among the  teachers.  I

hope the Minister for Education would, in addition

to  paying more visits to the schools, play a more

active role in the leadership of thought education

so that the evil influence from the small group of

black sheep will not spread to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



other   teachers.  Thus,  the  integrity  of   the

teachers  may  be  preserved  and  the  cause   of

education furthered.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, as we all know, education is a  very

important link in nation building. The educational

system  is now being systematically and frequently

changed and, as a result, the content of education

is  improving. This is important in  our  task  of

nation building. In recent years, the Ministry  of

Education  has done a lot for education,  such  as

increasing   the  teaching  hours  for   technical

training and consolidating the teaching of  second

language. All these are very good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only like to raise a few questions about which

all parents are very concerned and which they want

the Minister to know. First, is the Minister aware

that in the first few months after the opening  of

the  new  school year some primary  school  pupils

were still short of textbooks? What is the reason?

Is the Minister aware that these pupils who do not

have  textbooks  would suffer a great  setback  in

regard  to their lessons? Is it not also  a  great

loss to their parents and to education?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, how many graduates from Nanyang

University  and  the University of Singapore  have

joined  the  Institute  of  Education?  And  after

graduation,  how  many will be sent  to  teach  in

middle schools?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, has the Minister received complaints

about  textbooks  and  exercise  books  being  too

expensive? I myself have received complaints  from

parents  that  the  prices  of  these  books  have

increased  50 per cent or even more compared  with

those  of last year, thus causing a greater burden

to parents in the middle and lower income groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, I would like to ask the Minister about

the Industrial Training Board. Since its inception

in   April  last  year,  how  many  students  have

completed  their  training? And  after  graduation

have these students been recruited by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



the  factories  to  do jobs for  which  they  were

trained? What was the treatment like? How many  of

the graduates have been employed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, since setting up of the Industrial

Training Board, how many tutors have resigned, and

why? Is it because their salary is lower than that

offered in the private sector? If it is so,  would

the Minister consider adjusting their salaries  so

as to enable them to stay on?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, I would like to ask the Minister whether

he  is  aware  that  in  various  schools  in  the

different   language  streams  the  flag   raising

ceremony, in which the students give their pledge,

is  not performed with solemnity so much so  that

when  parents pass by such schools they feel  very

disappointed.  Sir, in fact, this ceremony  should

be   carried  out  in  a  serious  atmosphere   of

solemnity and respect so that our students can  be

inculcated  with  a  deep  sense  of  loyalty  and

patriotism,  while  they  are  still   young   and

impressionable.  I  think  those  are   the   only

questions that I want to ask.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was

reported  in  the  press  that  prices  of  school

textbooks  sold in certain book-shops  were  quite

high.  Moreover, at times students could  not  buy

certain textbooks because they were not available.

I understand that school principals have the right

to  select textbooks for use in their schools.  In

fact, certain schools change their textbooks  from

time to time. Sir, in order to stabilise or reduce

the  prices of school textbooks and to  avoid  the

difficulty  of  getting certain textbooks,  may  I

suggest  to  the  Minister for Education  for  his

consideration whether he would utilise $3  million

out  of the $7 million in the School Supplementary

Fund  to  establish a School Textbook Co-operative

for  the bulk purchase of school textbooks and re-sale  to  the  students. Perhaps this co-operative

may  also include buying cloth in bulk for  school

uniforms. This would definitely reduce the  prices

of textbooks and school uniforms. If this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



co-operative is to buy school textbooks and  cloth

for  the  students, then it should be  called  the

School Textbook and Cloth Co-operative. I am  sure

all  parents, teachers and students will give full

support  to this co-operative. I hope the Minister

for  Education will give his approval to establish

this  School  Textbook and Cloth  Co-operative  as

soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

profess to know much about education, but I  would

just  like to speak simply as a parent.  Sir,  for

the  past  years  the Ministry  of  Education,  in

conjunction with the Ministry of Health, have been

looking  after the physical health of  our  school

children very well and as parents we ought  to  be

thankful.   However,   in   our   endeavours   for

qualitative development in education, the time has

now  come  for us to pay closer attention  to  the

mental health of our school children. Most parents

who  have  young  children  at  school  are  often

aggrieved  to find that some teachers -I emphasise

some  -  at times demonstrate a complete  lack  of

understanding of child psychology and  would  seem

to  make  little  or  no  attempt  to  assess  the

learning  capacity, both physical and  mental,  of

their  pupils so much so that these poor  children

are  often overloaded with work and all  sorts  of

extra-curricular activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching methods also leave much to he desired.

In  an extreme example reported to me recently,  a

child was asked to write a word 2,000 times  as  a

punishment  just because he had copied it  wrongly

from  the  blackboard. It is this sort of attitude

on  the  part  of some teachers that  causes  many

children to develop a dislike or fear of going  to

school even at an early stage. And it is one  sure

way  of  producing  school dropouts  who  in  time

develop into social misfits. In 1971 we were  told

there were some 7,000 school drop-outs. This is  a

staggering  figure. The 23rd March  issue  of  the

Straits  Times  carried  a  letter  written  by  a

mother, under the heading "Inquisitive pupils  who

fight shy of asking questions". In the concluding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



paragraph of a very touching letter she said,  and

I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If children in schools do not feel free to

discuss  a  problem or even query  something  they

feel  sure  is  wrong they are being  treated  not

better than robots. Is this education?'



In  saying so, she has touched a soft chord in the

heart  of every parent with school-going children.

Quite  by  coincidence, on the same  day  all  the

newspapers  reported a speech by the Minister  for

Education   on  opening  a  Seminar  on   "Problem

children and children with problems". In one  part

of his speech, the Minister stated and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have upon our shoulders the sacred task of

developing   the   qualitative   aspect   of   our

children.'



In another part he said, and again I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We bear the responsibility, jointly with our

parents and the community at large,.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I agree that, generally speaking, the

responsibility should be a collective one  amongst

teachers,  parents and the community at large,  in

the context of Singapore, I feel strongly that the

brunt  should be borne rather more heavily by  the

schools. I say this because I think in the area of

parent/child relationship, we have a rather unique

situation  not  found in many other countries.  On

account   of   the   emphasis  placed   on   equal

opportunity  in  education, since our  Party  took

over  the  reins of Government and as a result  of

the tremendous success of this policy, we now find

in our midst a large number of illiterate or semi-literate parents with children going to schools at

different levels, and because of the plural nature

of   our  society  we  now  find  Chinese-educated

parents with children going to English schools and

vice-versa,   or  Tamil  or  Malay  parents   with

children   receiving  English  or   even   Chinese

education. This has resulted in a situation  where

there are both a generation gap and a cultural gap

between  parents  and children in  Singapore.  The

opposing  sets  of value judgments often  make  it

difficult  for  a proper dialogue between  parents

and  children.  This, to my mind, is  one  of  the

major     contributory    causes    of     serious

misunderstanding  or  breakdown  in  communication

between parents and children, and in extreme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



cases  it leads the young to resort to anti-social

and  self-destructive activities either as a  form

of protest or simply because of the lack of proper

guidance. The young need to be understood  and  be

guided in their problems. I feel strongly that our

teachers  are  not only better placed  but  better

qualified  in the context of our society  to  give

such help as may be necessary or required by their

pupils from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding, I can do no better than to quote

from Mr Chan Kai Yau, the Deputy Director (Schools

Division).  He was reported to have  said  at  the

Seminar which was attended by the Minister, and  I

quote again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Teachers should realise and put into effect

this  realisation  that pupils  were  individuals,

each of whom had a distinct and unique personality

and required personal attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When teachers take a personal interest in every

child,   they   would  have   no   difficulty   in

distinguishing the problem children, the  children

with  problems  and their problems, and  hopefully

had the solutions to these problems as well.'



<br><br>High sounding principles and lofty views are often

to be heard at seminars expressed by the so-called

experts, but only if words can be translated  into

action, the world would be a much happier place to

live in.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, a few days

ago the Minister for Communications distributed  a

chart  to  this House showing the distribution  of

the  total transport trips on a 24-hour  basis.  A

study  of the chart shows the aggravation of peak-hour travel by school children. In most countries,

there are only two peak periods. However, the mid-day  peak seems to be peculiar to Singapore. In  a speech made at a dinner held jointly by the  Tiong

Bahru  and  Henderson constituencies to  celebrate

the  election victory on 14th October,  1972,  the

Prime  Minister stated that it was desirable  that

primary  school  children  should  not  travel  to

school  beyond  a  two-mile  limit  and  secondary

school  children should not travel beyond a  four-mile  limit.  In view of this and  the  fact  that

there are more than half a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



million  school  children in Singapore,  will  the

Minister  for  Education inform the House  whether

steps  have  been taken towards the implementation

of  such  a  scheme for school children to  attend

schools in their immediate neighbourhood,  and  to

construct  schools in areas where there are  none,

for such purposes?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to know whether the Ministry

of  Education has given a directive to  principals

to  assist parents in forming car pools. Sir,  you

will  recall  that the Minister for Communications

has  mentioned the success of this scheme  in  the

Methodist Girls' School. This being the case,  why

cannot we ask the other schools to follow suit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now

have my say?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I thought Members would

rest  satisfied with lashing their  criticisms  on

the  conduct  of  bus workers at this  session  of

Parliament and spare the annual ritual of flogging

the teachers in public in the current sessions  of

Parliament.  But I was wrong, and  I  will  humbly

make  an  attempt to defend the teachers.  I  must

thank  the Member for Henderson who has understood

the  problems  of  teachers  and  is  an  eloquent

champion of the cause of teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, I must confess, has got a

very  efficient network of intelligence to  enable

him  to  find  out what went wrong in the  various

Ministries. I think he found out about  what  went

wrong  with the Hawker Inspectorate, the Emergency

Unit  of  the  Ministry of  Health,  and  also  in

schools   where   teachers  did   not   mark   the

composition  books. It could be  true  that  there

were  one or two teachers who did not fulfil their

duties.  But one swallow does not make  a  summer.

One  teacher  who did not do his work  should  not

give the impression that the whole lot of teachers

did  not  mark  composition books. The  system  in

force  at present, with supervision by headmasters

and  inspectors,  does not allow teachers  by  and

large



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



to  get  away  scot-free if they do not  mark  the

books.   Teachers,   at  least  the   overwhelming

majority of them, definitely have a conscience and

a commitment to fulfil their obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also a little bit surprised at the

very  wild  allegation  made  by  the  Member  for

Sembawang  that  flag raising ceremonies  are  not

properly   conducted.  That   would   imply   that

principals and teachers are not conscious  of  the

seriousness and the solemnity of such occasions. I

wonder  whether  he had attended  such  ceremonies

because,  if he had not, then it is a rather  wild

allegation. In every day of the 200 school days  a

year,  there has got to be a flag raising ceremony

where  thousands  of young children  pledge  their

loyalty to Singapore. Surely once in a while there

could be moments when children become fidgety. But

this  does not mean that throughout the  year  the

flag  raising ceremony is not properly  conducted.

In  any situation where human beings are involved,

one  cannot  expect perfection. If, as the  Member

has   said,  he  had  witnessed  a  flag   raising

ceremony,  it  was probably done  by  chance.  But

there  again it is rather too sweeping an instance

for him to generalise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the sentiments of the Member for

Jalan  Kayu  over  his desire to attain  desirable

objectives   in  our  context  of  a  multi-racial

society of generation gaps, of parents who  desire

to  have  nothing but the best in the  educational

pursuits  of  their children. I wish to  tell  him

that  there  could be a few black sheep,  but  the

vast  majority are very conscious of  the  various

desirable  objectives that should be  attained  in

the execution of their tasks as teachers, not only

in  the  academic or educational  field  but  more

important  still in the attainment of  a  national

objective of building a truly Singaporean society,

multi-racial, multi-religious, multi-cultural  and

Singapore-orientated  society.   This   is   being

consciously carried out by the teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards mental health of school children,

surely  it is a very important aspect. I  wish  to

tell  the Member that the Singapore Teachers Union

conducted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



a  seminar  in  co-operation  with  the  Singapore

Mental  Health  Association, and  we  had  various

papers advising teachers on the pitfalls that they

would  meet  if they did not handle  the  children

carefully,  and that they should be  conscious  of

the  importance of mental health of children. This

has  been  disseminated to  teachers  without  the

Ministry doing anything about it. But we did it. I

am  not  saying that the Ministry does not concern

itself  with such problems. It probably does.  But

it  has  got  so many other matters to look  into,

that  it probably gives top priority to some other

things and less priority to others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point I want to put across is that

teachers on their own, under the leadership of the

various  teachers  unions, are consciously  making

attempts to fulfil their tasks as nation builders,

as educators, and as people who fill in the gap as

parents  when the children are at school. This  is

seen  to not only by the Singapore Teachers  Union

but   also  teachers  unions  led  by  my   fellow

colleagues  in  this  House  and  other   teachers

unions. But then, with all the best intentions and

with all the best efforts, when one carries out  a

task  where human beings are involved, one  cannot

expect  perfection. With all the  best  intentions

and  with  all the best efforts of the educational

authorities in England, in America, and in various

other   advanced  countries  in  the  West   where

considerable amount of care, attention  and  money

have   been  spent  on  education,  yet   hippies,

streakers  and  what  have  you  hail  from   such

countries.  Is  it because efforts were  not  made

towards  achieving desirable objectives  in  their

educational system? I think nobody could say  with

conviction  that these countries had  never  spent

considerable  time and energy, money  and  effort,

towards     attaining    desirable     educational

objectives, and yet such things happen. That  goes

to prove that in the field of education every time

an achievement is made, other problems arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I think it must be understood that

in  the  last  decade or so we have attained  very

impressive  objectives  - we  have  brought  about

integration,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



bilingualism  (and even multi-lingualism  in  some

cases)  patriotism, loyalty to the country.  These

are  objectives which other countries took decades

to  attain.  In Singapore, in one decade  we  have

achieved  them with a greater measure  of  success

than   many   other  countries.  These   are   the

achievements that do not appear in the  press  and

are  not  publicised. These are  the  achievements

that  cannot  be measured tangibly and  are  often

forgotten.  But the misdeeds of a  few  are  often

publicised. Therefore, the attention that is drawn

to  the  misdeeds  and to the failures  is  always

highlighted more than the attention drawn  to  the

successes that we have achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that we

must keep on correcting the faults of the few.  We

must  make  every  effort towards improvement.  We

must   make   every  effort  towards   qualitative

development in our educational system, and we must

never slacken in all these efforts.

course, I could not go to all the schools.  But  I

have been to certain schools and I myself saw such

incidents. I believe that the Member for  Moulmein

himself  is not able to go round all the  schools,

and yet he believes that the flag raising ceremony

conducted in all the schools is proper.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.14 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, various Members have in their speeches

ranged  through  a vast area of interest.  I  will

answer them according to the main subject matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many questions on the conditions of

service.   The  Member  for  Anson   asked   about

promotions.  I  did  say that promotions  will  be

carried   out   regularly  but   not   necessarily

annually. It may be shorter than one year. It  may

be  longer.  But  we  propose  to  carry  out  one

promotion exercise at the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the point about

emplacement of holders of foreign degrees  on  the

graduate-teachers' scale. This  has  been  debated

before   in  this  House,  and  there  have   been

prolonged negotiations between the unions and  the

Ministry.  I am afraid the position still  remains

the same - each case will be considered on its own

merit. As regards those teachers who have not been

emplaced,   they  have  to  satisfy  the   various

requirements  before they can be emplaced  on  the

graduate-teachers' scale.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson drew my attention to the

fact   that  some  teachers  are  drawing   higher

salaries than principals and senior teachers. I am

afraid   this  is  an  inherent  feature  of   the

restructured  education service. This  matter  has

been  thrashed out for 1~ years between the  union

officials, the Ministry of Education and  Ministry

of Finance. This feature has been fully understood

by all parties as a means to enable flexibility in

the deployment of the teaching staff.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of

school  clerks.  As  the  Member  may  recall,   I

mentioned  it  on  other occasions  that  we  have

invited  the Management Services Unit  to  make  a

study of the work-load of clerks in schools.  They

will  submit their report soon, and we hope to  be

able  to make a decision on this. But I am  afraid

that a clerk is a clerk. He belongs to the General

Clerical Service within the civil service, and  we

just cannot raise their salary unilaterally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar mentioned something

which  has far-reaching effects. Although  he  did

not  say it in so many words, but I think he wants

to nationalise the entire education service. First

of  all,  aided schools have their own traditions,

and  I  do  not think they like to be nationalised

and  become Government schools. Of course,  we  do

not  prevent  any aided school from  applying  for

conversion into a Government school, in which case

whether  or  not their teachers will  be  absorbed

into  the  Government  service  depends  on  their

qualifications  and  whether  they   satisfy   the

necessary requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also queried the difference in conditions of

service  between  an aided school  teacher  and  a

Government  school teacher. This  is  one  of  the

topics  that  has been discussed year after  year,

and  I  would  again have to repeat  what  I  said

before.  Aided  school teachers are  aided  school

teachers.   They   have  certain  benefits   which

Government  school teachers do not enjoy,  as  for

example,  CPF. When they resign or are  dismissed,

they  still retain their CPF. A Government  school

teacher,  however,  on resignation  or  dismissal,

loses all his pension. You cannot have the best of

both  worlds.  I  think this also applies  to  the

question of medical benefits for the retired aided

school  teachers, which was raised by  the  Member

for  Jurong. Again, this is one question  which  I

have answered before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson raised the question on

whether  there  should be a code  of  conduct  for

teachers. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



a code of conduct for trainee-teachers at the TTC.

We  believe in tackling the problem at  source.  I

must  admit  I  am rather touched  by  his  rather

poetical  speech. We do agree that there  must  be

some black-sheep among 20,000 teachers. We try  to

identify them. And for the good teachers, we  must

give them due recognition. No one disputes that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of

deploying English school teachers to teach Chinese

as  a second language. I would like to correct his

statement.  These teachers volunteered,  in  their

personal  particulars form, the  information  that

they were capable of teaching the second language.

It  is  not  just that they understand the  second

language, but that they are capable and  have  the

confidence  to  teach the second language.  So  we

deployed  about  100 teachers  for  this  purpose.

Thirty  of  them changed their mind. They  decided

that they cannot teach in that language after all;

we  are  making the necessary adjustments  to  see

that the students do not suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asked whether we could

force  children to go to a school in the  vicinity

of  their houses. For various reasons, I am afraid

we  cannot. Fundamentally, they are entitled to  a

freedom  of  choice,  and  we  cannot  deny  them.

Secondly, to be very frank, we do not have  enough

schools  in  densely populated areas.  As  Members

know,  we  are  engaged on  a  very  major  school

building  programme, details of  which  have  just

been   released  a  few  days  ago.  When  it   is

completed,  we  will  be able to  accommodate  the

wishes  of parents to send their children  to  the

school  of their choice as near to their homes  as

possible.  That  answer, I  believe,  answers  the

question raised by the Member for Aljunied also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Members for Anson and Jurong raised the

question  of miscellaneous fees. It is  true  that

over  the  years  large sums of school  funds  are

accumulated.  There  are many  schools  with  over

$50,000 in their account. However, I would like to

refer both Members to the Third Report of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



Public  Accounts Committee to this House presented

on the 2nd of this month:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Your Committee observed that since 1968,

expenditure has been on an annual average of  83.9

per  cent  of  the total collections yearly.  Your

Committee  appreciate that strict control  appears

to  have  been exercised by school principals  and

the Ministry of Education over expenditure.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons for the unspent

miscellaneous  fees.  First  of  all,  there   are

certain  principals who do not consider it prudent

to  spend  every cent collected from miscellaneous

fees.  They consider it desirable to have a  small

balance  to meet unforeseen expenditure which  has

to  be  met  from such funds. Secondly, there  are

certain schools which deliberately make an  effort

to  accumulate balances in order to meet  expenses

for  special projects. For example, a  school  may

want a gymnasium or a bitumen track which costs as

much  as $300,000. So he accumulates this  sum  by

careful  saving over the years, without  depriving

the  students  of current essential  requirements.

For  projects  in  which  the  Ministry  considers

worthwhile   and  beneficial  to   the   students,

approval will be given. In fact, approval has been

conveyed to a few schools for certain requests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

In  the  absence  of the Chairman  of  the  Public

Accounts  Committee, I feel  I  am  duty-bound  to

stand  up  and request the Minister  to  read  the

entire  context  of  the  recommendations  of  the

Public Accounts Committee, and not just quoting it

out of context.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, I was just coming to the

third  point, when I was interrupted.  Perhaps  if

the  Member had waited for two seconds,  he  could

have saved a few minutes of our time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I am going to mention is that the

Schools Fund Regulations, as they stand now,  have

been too stringent in limiting the scope for which

funds may be used and the freedom of principals to

use  them.  We are revising these regulations.  We

are  preparing a "Revised Schools Fund Manual"  to

enable principals to utilise their funds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



more freely in the interest of their pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Ministry has also the following

projects  which  are too large to  be  handled  by

schools individually. They have to be met from the

miscellaneous  fees collected. First  of  all,  we

intend   to  establish  a  number  of  centralised

language  laboratories  to  serve  a  cluster   of

schools,   in  line  with  our  language   policy.

Secondly,  we  propose to construct and  establish

various  centralised centres for ECA,  which  will

include  facilities such as swimming pools,  where

these facilities are not available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these projects in hand and with a

greater  flexibility and freedom given  to  school

principals to utilise their funds, it is  expected

very  soon  that  the collection of  miscellaneous

fees   may   not  be  sufficient  to   cover   the

expenditure   spent  on  students  on   ECA.   The

miscellaneous fees may have to be increased again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various points have been raised about textbooks.

The Ministry of Education discourages too rapid  a

change  of  textbooks, and this  is  the  declared

policy; I would like to reiterate this policy.  At

the beginning of the year there was a shortage  of

textbooks.  We were aware of it, but this  applied

only  to a few titles. The position has since been

rectified.  Of  course, in certain  instances,  it

seemed to be a deliberate attempt to run down  the

Educational   Publications   Bureau   by   falsely

reporting that books published by the EPB were not

available,  which is not true.  It  is  true  that

certain   textbooks  have  increased   in   price,

especially those that are imported. But I have  to

point  out  that  all textbooks published  by  the

Educational Publications Bureau remain  unchanged,

and as long as it is feasible we will maintain  it

that way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various ways of reducing the burden on

parents  of  the  higher prices of textbooks.  Co-operative  is only one of the various ways.  I  am

not quite sure whether it will be as successful as

the Member for Bukit Ho Swee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



envisaged. All the institutions of higher learning

have  their co-operatives, and I believe  some  do

not  know what to do with them now. We are  toying

with  the  idea  of encouraging  a  few  secondary

schools  with  large enrolments to set  up  a  co-operative  to  buy  books, set  squares,  teaching

materials and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways to solve the problem. For

example, instead of asking the bookshops to tender

on  the  basis of commissions to be  paid  to  the

school, we can ask the bookshops to tender on  the

prices  of  books, and then allocate the bookstore

which  can sell books at the lowest prices to  the

pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson raised the question of fire

precautions. We do carry out regular  fire  drills

in schools to prevent any mishap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been very unfortunate that there has been

an   explosion  in  a  certain  secondary   school

recently.  But  accidents do happen.  We  have  no

intention to find a scapegoat or go witch-hunting.

What  we are trying to do is to ensure the  safety

of  children. As a result of the explosion at  the

Anderson   School,   we   have   drawn   up   very

comprehensive precautionary measures  for  schools

to adopt. We are very pleased to say that had that

not been done the recent explosion may have caused

greater casualties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned that certain schools

had  not been inspected for years. I am not  aware

of any such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards teachers who had not marked their

class work or compositions, as pointed out by  the

Member  for Moulmein, there may `have been  a  few

cases but I do not think we can generalise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards assembly, the Member for Sembawang

said  that  he had attended a few assemblies  -  I

hope  he  himself  stood still instead  of  moving

around.  Recently the Ministry sent a circular  to

all principals reminding them of the importance of

the  assembly  and  that  it  should  be  properly

conducted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied mentioned about car

pools,  and  the  success  of  MGS.  Although  MGS

appears to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



solved the problem, I think the problem should not

exist in the first instance. Not very many schools

in Singapore have 1,000 cars converging at any one

given time. It should not be so. We are trying  to

encourage  those  schools in the Central  Business

District  to  organise car pools. The Ministry  is

sending  circulars asking principals to  form  car

pools.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



This  is not always possible. For example,  we  do

not  expect  rural schools to form car pools.  The

chart    circulated    by   the    Minister    for

Communications  must  be  read  in   the   correct

perspective. It represents the total person  trips

per  day  throughout the country, not  necessarily

those  going  into  the Central Business  District

where the traffic jam is worst. There are very few

schools in the Central Business District, and  the

Ministry  is  planning  to  resite  those  schools

within the Central Business District away from the

City centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson passed some comments on

ETV.  I think `he is wrong. Our ETV is quite good.

In  fact, I recall three years ago the Member  for

Punggol, raised a similar question in this  House.

He said that ETV should not spend too much time in

winning prizes. Our ETV production is of a  fairly

high  standard. The Ministry carries  out  regular

surveys to see how frequent does a school use  the

facilities provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Henderson that the

Ministry  is  sparing no efforts in inculcating  a

sense  of  proper national values  and  patriotism

among  our  school  children.  We  appreciate  the

importance of doing this at the school  level.  He

can  be  rest assured that the Ministry  considers

this  as one of its top priorities, although I  do

not  think his observations about the attitude  of

his  friends  in  the  two  universities  prevail,

otherwise  we  would not have so many professional

members in this Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also mentioned about the

Tamil word for "million". I must apologise for not

being in this Chamber when the answer was given by

my colleague, the Minister for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



Culture.  But  as far as I am aware, the  original

version  of  the word "million" is being  used  in

schools. Unfortunately, I am not at all conversant

in that language, therefore I am in no position to

comment on its use over TV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar asked about

improvements  to  rural schools.  My  Minister  of

State  had on some occasions urged that all  rural

schools close to each other should try to merge so

as  to provide better facilities and amenities for

the  students. This is the direction we are taking

and  we are trying to help rural schools to  merge

to provide better facilities for their pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very flattered that the Member for Jalan

Kayu  should  quote from my speech. Since  he  has

done  so, I presume he must have read the rest  of

my  speech and the deliberation at the seminar. So

there  is  no need for me to reply to his question

at  all. Of course, he would have known that in my

speech I also made references to an earlier speech

I  made four months ago regarding what we proposed

to  do  in that area of social work. Therefore,  I

presume that answers his question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru asked a series of

questions  on  institutions  of  higher  learning.

Regarding  the  joint admission exercise,  in  the

past   the   admission   criteria   of   the   two

universities  differed vastly. In  order  to  have

better   academic  interchange  between  the   two

universities,   we  decided  to  have   a   common

admission criterion and procedure. Therefore, from

this   year  onwards,  there  will  be  a   common

admission  exercise  for courses  common  to  both

universities.   Obviously  if  one   applies   for

admission into the Faculty of Medicine,  there  is

no  point in doing a joint exercise since  Nanyang

University  does not have a medical  faculty.  The

members  on  this  committee are drawn  from  both

universities, the Registrar and the Dean. I do not

know the names of the members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked for information on the university

service commission, its functions and its terms of

reference.  As  the  Member is aware,  the  salary

scales of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



the  institutions of higher learning, particularly

the  universities, were revised  recently.  During

the   revisions,  we  made  certain   distinctions

between professional and non-professional academic

staff.  For clear-cut cases, like the medical  and

legal  professions, accountancy, and so on,  there

is  no  difficulty  in appraising  the  respective

lecturers  and putting them on the proper  scales.

But  the difficulty exists in the peripheral area.

For  example,  should  outstanding  lecturers   in

Economics and Business Administration be  emplaced

on  the  professional  scale?  So  the  university

service  commission was appointed jointly  by  the

councils of the two universities to consider these

cases.   The   members   are   drawn   from   both

universities  as  well  as  from  the  professions

outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also raised the point about re-designations

and   asked   how   many   professors,   associate

professors, etc., were left at Nantah. I am  sorry

I  do  not  have the exact figures, but I  believe

that only a handful of substantive professors  are

left  at  the Nanyang University, and as a  result

Nanyang University has started a recruitment drive

to fill these chairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time we have a common admission criterion

and the academic structure of the two universities

harmonised,  we can foresee a greater exchange  of

students  between  the  two universities.  Perhaps

then   we   could  see  more  students  from   one

university  taking Honours courses  in  the  other

university.  But I think it is a bit premature  at

this stage to predict what would happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked for information

about  how  many graduates from the University  of

Singapore  and  the Nanyang University  are  being

admitted  into  the Institute of Education.  I  am

afraid  I cannot supply him with the figures  off-hand. He can file a Question and I will supply him

with the details. Similarly, this also applies  to

his  enquiry  on  the  number of  graduates  being

turned out by the ITB, how are they employed,  how

much  they  are earning, and how many  staff  have

resigned. I am sorry I really do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



have this sort of information now. I do not have a

computer out here unfortunately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have answered most of the

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, the Minister has not  answered  the

complaint  raised  by  the Member  for  Henderson.

Since  the  complaint is also the subject  of  the

next  amendment, I will only beg leave to withdraw

this amendment after the answer has been given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Henderson has said that there was

a  little  act  of  bureaucracy  on  the  part  of

officers in the Ministry of Education. This is, in

fact,  the true position, Sir. There are a  number

of  principals who are unhappy over the  arrogance

of   the  senior  officials  of  the  Ministry  of

Education,  but  they do not have the  courage  to

speak  up  against such arrogance  or  bureaucracy

because,  as  the Member for Henderson  has  said,

this   affects   their  rice-bowl   and,   fearing

victimisation,  they have to eat the  humble  pie.

But, Sir, because of my position, I have heard  of

such  complaints from my colleagues in the  course

of my teaching duties. I would, therefore, like to

have  an  answer in this House to the question  of

arrogance on the part of senior officials  in  the

Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1971 the Ministry of Education announced

new regulations for the recruitment of principals.

Of course, I am not here to speak on the merits or

demerits  of  the principals, but I  want  to  say

something with regard to the remarks passed  by  a

senior official of the Ministry of Education at  a

certain  meeting.  This  official  more  or   less

challenged  the principals attending the  meeting,

saying  that  if they were not happy because  they

were   not  paid  any  charge  allowance  or  post

allowance  they  could  give  up  their  posts  of

principals  and  go  back  to  teaching.  If  such

arrogant  words  could  be  uttered  by  a  senior

official  in  the  Ministry of  Education,  it  is

tantamount  to compelling principals  to  rise  in

rebellion. But some principals among them had  the

guts to speak out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



against the senior official. One of them stood  up

and  tendered his resignation. But instead he  was

requested  to  go  back to school  to  become  the

principal again. Sir, from this incident,  we  can

see that we must inculcate in the senior officials

of  the  Ministry of Education the  importance  of

courtesy  and  tact  in dealing  with  principals,

because  if  they  want to be  harsh  or  hard  in

dealing with principals, I think they would get  a

harder  reaction from the principals. If  they  do

not  show  courtesy and tact, the principals  will

gang up together and send a joint petition to  the

Minister, or even resign en bloc. In fact, it  has

happened;  a  principal tendered  his  resignation

there   and   then  at  the  meeting.   How   much

embarrassment was caused to the senior official at

that  meeting? So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like  the  Minister to look into the attitude  and

public  behaviour  of  senior  officials  in   the

Ministry  of  Education,  particularly  in   their

dealings with principals. After all, they are  all

part  and parcel of the entire educational system.

There  should be proper communication and  harmony

between  officials in the Ministry and  principals

in the schools. They should not employ high-handed

measures and adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards

principals in the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised this matter because, although

it  was brought up by the Member for Henderson, it

was  not answered. Therefore, I would like to have

a definite answer from the Minister concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

actually  I  did  not speak strongly  against  the

administrative staff of the Ministry of Education.

What  I  emphasised was that the Minister  himself

and key men in the Education Ministry should think

out  how  best  to improve `the education  of  our

younger  generation. What I want to point out  -it

is  theoretical but an important point -  is  that

many  Members of Parliament sitting behind me  had

said  that a small group of teachers had not  been

doing their jobs properly. As a matter of fact,  I

do not know what the Minister's view



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



was  on  hearing  that teachers go  to  the  stock

exchange every day after school hours to speculate

on shares, or telephone the stock brokers for news

on  stocks and shares. I do not know. A few  years

ago,  the ex-Minister for Education mentioned that

a   teacher  should  not  go  to  night-clubs   in

Singapore  or in Johore Bahru. I do not know  what

the  Minister's view is on whether or not teachers

can  be  allowed to go to such places. My view  is

that  if a teacher is good - the majority of  them

are  good teachers - he will not have the time  to

go  to  such  places.  As a matter  of  fact,  the

majority of good teachers in Singapore are  trying

their   best  to  do  something  for  our  younger

generation.  But  as  far as the  small  group  of

teachers  is concerned, as the Member for Moulmein

has pointed out, the Minister for Education or his

officials should try to find out ways and means to

correct  them. The Minister should  not  just  say

that the Ministry of Education is trying to do its

best to help these teachers. Surely they are doing

very  well.  But  what I am saying  is  that  they

should  do  better.  They should  not  think  that

because they are doing well they can sit down  and

enjoy  life. The Member for Paya Lebar might  say,

"Well,  you see some key officials in the Ministry

of  Education will try to play ball". He might say

that; I do not know.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to my point which the Minister did

not  answer properly. I am quite sure he would  go

round  quietly  to  all the  schools  in  all  the

language streams from the primary schools  to  the

secondary schools and then to the universities, to

check  on what I had said earlier. The Member  for

Anson  has also mentioned that point. The Minister

should  find  out what is the real situation  that

the Ministry is facing today. He may then have  to

take  another year to find a new solution to  help

nation building!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  was  so flattered merely because  I  had

quoted  him  that he has missed the wood  for  the

trees. I made a few critical remarks and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



I  share the sentiments of the Member who has just

spoken before me. One point I made was, and it was

reported during the course of the seminar, that in

1971 there were 7,000 school drop-outs. Why do  we

have  these  7,000 school drop-outs? What  is  the

Ministry  doing to find out what is the  cause  of

the large number of drop-outs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also talked about emphasis on the mental health

of  our  school children. The Minister  sought  to

evade  the  issue.  There was not  a  word  on  my

reference  to his speeches which he had  made.  He

seems to be so pleased with his speeches. We  want

more  specific answers in this House. What  is  he

going  to  do  about  it? And as  the  Member  for

Henderson has just said, "He should not just  say,

`Just refer to my speech.'" But if he had listened

to  me  carefully, he would have noted the remark:

how  often  were  his speeches  made  at  seminars

subsequently  taken up seriously by  the  Ministry

concerned?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, on a point of order. This

amendment  (1) has been under discussion  since  5

o'clock.  It  is now going on for  7  o'clock.  If

every  Member who sends in an amendment is allowed

to  speak twice, or three times, at ten minutes  a

time,  what  is  going  to  happen  to  the  later

amendments  that have been submitted?  I  think  a

little judicial recommendation should be given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. So far, the debate has been

on  general policy, and it is within the bounds of

Standing Orders for Members to speak. But I  would

ask Members to exercise some control so that those

Members who have moved other amendments would have

a chance to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I do not intend to participate  in

the  argument. But the Minister has  not  answered

certain points which I have raised earlier  on.  I

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



like to ask him again: what was the criterion used

for  the conversion into the new salary scales for

the  academic staff in the Nanyang University? Was

it  based  on  their  academic qualifications  and

teaching  experience,  or  was  it  based  on  the

salaries  that  the staff concerned are  currently

drawing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also said that after the conversion

the number of professors in the Nanyang University

would  drop and that new professors would have  to

be  appointed or recruited. My question is,  among

the  present professors in the Nanyang University,

I  think  most  of  them, if  not  all,  have  the

required  qualifications and experience, otherwise

they  would  not  have been allowed  to  teach  in

Nantah. In the circumstances, will they be allowed

to continue holding the posts of professors?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just

want  to  make an observation on the  teachers.  I

feel  that  the Ministry of Education has  got  to

review the holiday scheme for the schools.  I  for

one  cannot  blame the teachers for going  to  the

Stock Exchange or anywhere else. It is because the

holidays  that are given to them are too long  and

it  looks  as if they are forced to take them.  In

one year there are four school terms with holidays

in  between. In March there is one week's holiday,

in  June, three weeks, and then in September,  one

week,  and then the school year ends up with  five

weeks'  holiday.  So  there  is  the  problem   of

unproductive  days. I think this  is  the  problem

that  we have got to face. We are all humans. When

we have got nothing to do, we would be looking for

something to do. This is the problem, and there is

no  joke about that. I think this is a very  valid

point. Most of our very good teachers thought that

they are forced to take a holiday.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, could

I, with your permission, speak now as I have moved

an  amendment* under Head PA, in respect  of  the

Main Estimates?

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) That the total sum to be allocated for Head PA in respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would suggest that the Member

might  as  well  wait until the debate  under  the

present amendment is over.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, at the rate this debate is

going on, I would not have a chance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We still have an hour to go. Will

the Member please wait?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to a

certain extent I agree with the Member for  Changi

that the year-end holidays are too long. I do  not

think  there are that many teachers who go to  the

Stock  Exchange.  Members  will  recall  that  the

Ministry  has shortened the year-end vacation.  We

have  tried  to spread them out evenly  throughout

the year. But unfortunately we are handicapped  by

certain  restraints, for example, lack of physical

facilities  to  conduct  the  PSLE  and  the   GCE

examinations.   When   physical   facilities   are

available    to    conduct   these    examinations

separately,   without  having  to  interrupt   the

schools'  functions, we should be able  to  spread

the holidays out more evenly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry that I have forgotten to reply to the

Member  for Tiong Bahru about the conversion.  The

conversion  is  based  on the  existing  salaries.

There   is  a  conversion  table  and  we  convert

according  to the salaries, because qualifications

and  experience and other considerations must have

been  taken into account on first appointment.  Of

course,  there is nothing to prevent the  existing

staff  from applying for higher posts.  I  believe

they have done so and will continue to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu said that I was rather

pleased  with  my  own speech. I  am  not.  It  so

happened  that  in  my  speech  I  mentioned   the

measures that we were going to take to enlarge the

social  work  unit and to prepare the teachers  to

cope  with  the different conditions. I  did  make

reference  earlier  to  the  heavy  load  on   the

students.  That is precisely why we introduce  the

PPP,  the Primary Pilot Project. The whole project

is  so constructed that it gives the children  the

minimum amount of homework to do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned about the 7,000 school

drop-outs. What do we mean by "drop-out"? I  think

the  figure of 7,000 which he referred to was  the

figure  given  in 1971 by a certain local  English

paper.  It  was  a very well written  article  but

completed  with the wrong headline. I  think  this

article  referred to those who twice failed  their

Primary School Leaving Examination and were  asked

to  leave  school. As he may be aware,  the  Adult

Education  Board  is  carrying  out  a  very  good

programme known as the Pre-Vocational Class  (PVC)

to  train  these pupils of 14 to 15  years  for  a

vocation. At present, about a few thousand of them

are  in these centres under training by the  Adult

Education  Board  to  prepare  them  for  specific

vocations.  The  courses range  from  construction

trade to welding, spraying of motor cars, and  all

sorts of other trades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member for Henderson that the

Ministry  of Education never rests on its laurels.

We are never satisfied with what we have achieved.

We  always  try to aim at a better  and  a  higher

target.  That is what we will do, and will  do  it

again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lai Tha Chai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lai Tha Chai:</b> Next year?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Even next year, we will still

aim  at  a  higher target even if we have achieved

what  we had set out to do. He can be rest assured

of that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar referred to a certain

incident.  I  was  familiar  with  this   incident

because the union saw me on this. I think we  must

look at this problem in its true perspective.  The

senior  official  made  the  remark  that  if  the

principals  were not prepared to carry  out  their

jobs  they  could step down as school  principals;

nothing  prevented  them from doing  so  and  they

would  lose  nothing. I believe the  long  meeting

with  a  large  group  of  school  principals  had

exasperated him. In fact, this particular  officer

had  proved to be one of the most polite  and  the

least  aggressive  of all officers.  It  was  most

unfortunate that this happened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Please do not defend him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> I am not exactly defending

this  officer, but I just happened to know of this

particular  incident.  I  had  attended,   similar

meetings before. If those who attended the meeting

asked the same question 200 times and we explained

200  times, and if they still asked for the 20 1st

time, then who would not feel exasperated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, may I make a small

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I suggest that we stop the

debate  on this Head now? Does the Member want  to

clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> The Minister seems to think

that I quoted the figure of 7,000 school drop-outs

from some paper in 1971. I did not. It is a figure

quoted by his own officer who participated in  the

seminar recently.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> I do not know which article he

referred  to.  There were a few  articles  on  the

question  of dropouts. As I said, the question  of

drop-out  is  a  question  of  definition.  If  by

"dropouts"  we refer to those students  who  leave

the  primary  school as a result  of  failing  the

PSLE, then that is what we have done.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I still think the

Minister  has  not  answered  the  point.  I  have

suggested  that the Ministry should  try  to  find

out.  He  himself has said that they do  not  know

what is the definition of a "drop-out". That means

that  they have not done anything to find out what

is the cause of the drop-outs.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, it is not that I do not

understand.  The definition of "drop-out"  varies.

It  depends on how one looks at it. If by  leaving

school, one means a drop-out, then there are  lots

of people who are drop-outs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in spite of

the Minister's praise of the senior officer that I

referred to, I am not here to praise him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, will you stop the debate

now and either withdraw or do not do so? If you do

not withdraw, then I will put it to a vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, Sir.

Although  I  am not satisfied with the  Minister's

reply,  I  am  forced  to  withdraw  my  amendment

because of lack of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head PA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AB 1105.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I am aware that Backbenchers are not

allowed  to speak for more than 10 minutes  on  an

amendment, I have therefore reserved this item  to

enable me to continue with what I could not finish

just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar referred to an

incident of an act of bureaucracy on the part of a

senior  official. I am in sympathy  with  what  he

said.  I  feel  that there is a  lack  of  rapport

between officials in the Ministry of Education and

principals and teachers in the schools.  In  fact,

the gap between them is widening. I remember a few

days  ago  the Minister for Education addressed  a

gathering of some 25 principals in which  he  said

that the gap between the Ministry of Education and

the schools should be narrowed. This is proper and

is an urgent matter to be tackled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some traditional reasons and

causes for principals and teachers of school to be

afraid  of Inspectors of Schools because,  in  the

past, the Inspectors went to the schools and threw

their  weight around, thinking that they  had  all

the power in the world to control the schools, the

principals and the teachers. And they wielded  the

power  in  order to satisfy their  own  ego.  Sir,

Inspectors  of  Schools  are  given  such  a  name

because we hope that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



would  be  able  to  help the  teachers  in  their

duties,  instead of throwing their weight  around,

and  threatening  school teachers  and  principals

with  their  power. Henceforth I  hope  that  when

Inspectors  of  Schools visit  the  schools,  they

would  go  about in a more friendly  manner,  with

sincerity, in order to help bridge the gap between

them and the teachers and principals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reply to my query the Minister said that

there  will  be  another promotion  exercise  this

year.  This,  of  course, is  good  news  for  the

teaching    profession.    According     to     my

understanding,  in  the  early   days   when   the

teachers'   unions  were  negotiating   with   the

Ministry of Education, there were certain criteria

for   promotions,   i.e, in   addition   to   the

confidential   reports  put  up  by   the   school

principals, the additional qualifications and  the

social work done by the teachers were also factors

to  be  considered  for  promotions.  I  think   I

mentioned   all  this  at  the  last  sitting   of

Parliament,  and  I  hope  that  the  Ministry  of

Education  will  look into this  matter  and  take

these  matters  into consideration in  the  second

promotion exercise to be conducted this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Pre-University classes in the Chinese

stream  have just started their lessons. According

to  my  reckoning, it appears that the opening  of

these  classes  at  Pre-U level  has  been  rather

belated  and the number of students has  dwindled.

In  some schools, only one class has been  set  up

instead  of  two.  Sir,  before  opening  I  think

comprehensive arrangements had been made  for  the

provision  of  activities and other facilities  in

the  school  for  the whole year.  But  after  the

opening, there has been a sudden change in respect

of  the  Pre-U  classes.  This  will  cause  great

difficulties  to  the schools and  also  to  those

students   who  have  enrolled  for  these   Pre-U

classes. What arrangements are being made to  look

after  the  interest of these  students  who  have

enrolled but who have no classes to attend?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to raise is the

question of post allowance or charge allowance for

principals. Teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



seem to be losing interest in applying  for

the  post  of principals because of the additional

duties  and the greater responsibility and  burden

entrusted on principals. This is probably  because

of  the abolition of the system of paying post  or

charge   allowances.  Of  course,  I  agree   that

teachers  or  those  in  the  teaching  profession

should  not  quibble too much  about  dollars  and

cents.  But teachers are also human beings and  so

they   will   also   think  for  themselves.   The

principals  have  more work, more responsibilities

and longer hours of work. They have even got to be

school clerks sometimes or take over classes  when

necessary.   During  school  vacations  principals

still  have  to  go  back to  the  schools  to  do

whatever   there   is  to  be   done.   In   those

circumstances, who will be interested in the  post

of  principals or in becoming principals for  that

matter?  This  particular  problem  is  of   great

interest to us because in some cases teachers  are

promoted  to  a salary scale higher than  that  of

principals. In such a situation, how do we  expect

the principals to be able to supervise the work of

the   teachers,  particularly  in  schools   where

teachers work to rule, so to speak? Sir, I ask for

the  restoration of the payment of post or  charge

allowance for principals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since the Member moving the

amendment  has touched on the functions  performed

by  the  Director of Education, maybe Members  who

have,  in  fact, sent in amendments in  regard  to

subhead AC 1105 could also speak now and need  not

then  move the amendment to that subhead so as  to

save time. Mr Tay, you might wish to speak.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now I

said  that I wanted a little more time so  that  I

could complete what I wanted to say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, you have 10 minutes now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): That is enough

time  for me to complete my speech. Just  now  the

Minister said that the senior officer had  behaved in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



such  a manner as I have described was because  in

pursuing his routine work he was harassed by  work

that  he  had  misbehaved, and by a  slip  of  the

tongue he had made such a remark. But there  is  a

Chinese saying that if you are humble enough,  you

will  not  bring about such a situation. In  other

words,  the saying means something like  this.  He

who  holds  a  high post and is not arrogant  will

stay  on  the  high  post without  the  danger  of

falling  down, and complacency invites harm  while

humility begets benefit. Our Ministry of Education

has  always  adopted the same attitude in  dealing

with  matters.  In 1963, when the  Prime  Minister

"slipped  into  the drain" because  of  Opposition

members,  he  was still smiling. So we  should  be

humble  in  facing all questions and dealing  with

all  matters.  I  am only trying to  say  that  in

future our senior officers should try to be humble

so  that their prospects would be bright. If  they

could  adopt  such  a humble attitude,  this  will

benefit them greatly in their own future and  will

also benefit education in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Thank you very much, Sir,I

never  thought  my time would be  coming.  Let  me

touch  on  a  slightly different  theme  from  the

problem of teachers. I want to talk about exposure

to second language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no quarrel with the Government's

policy on second language. But my criticism is  on

the manner in which our second language policy  is

being  implemented.  I agree that  the  additional

exposure   to   second   language,   thus   almost

equalising  the exposure time for  the  first  and

second languages, is still new and I believe there

will  be teething troubles. How are these teething

troubles attended to?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only time can tell whether the results of

such  exposure hours mean that students will leave

school  competent  in both languages.  Or  is  the

first language going to suffer as a result of  the

lack  of  time? Would we have our future  citizens

fluent in two languages, or fluent in neither?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strict adherence to the quota of teachers posted

to   schools   does  not  allow  for  the   proper

implementation of the policy. The magic formula of

the  Ministry of "x times y upon z" applied to all

schools  does not really provide the schools  with

sufficient  teachers competent in  the  first  and

second  languages  to implement  the  policy.  The

quota  of teachers must necessarily differ from  a

purely  English  school to that of  an  integrated

school.  And here too the quota will  have  to  be

different from school to school depending  on  the

number of second languages the school is offering.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite rightly, the Ministry has allowed

principals   of   schools  some   flexibility   in

arranging  their  time-tables.  Even  with   these

flexibilities,  principals  and  senior   teachers

responsible for arranging the time-tables find  it

difficult   to   implement  the  second   language

exposure time properly. In fact, there are schools

where, even in lower primary classes, in order  to

allow  for  a sufficient number of periods  to  be

taught  in the two languages as advocated  by  the

Ministry,  the time-table can only be arranged  in

such a way as to expose a class sometimes to up to

five  teachers per day. Can you imagine, Sir, five

different teachers going to a lower primary  class

to  teach  the  tiny  tots  in  one  day?  Certain

subjects,  for instance, Arithmetic  and  English,

are  taught by two or three different teachers  in

the   same  class.  Sir,  you  need  not   be   an

educationist to know that this should not be done.

I  wonder if the Ministry of Education is aware of

this  state of affairs. Is the Hon. Minister aware

that  certain classes in some primary schools  are

jokingly  named "international classes"? In  these

"international   classes"  normally   the   second

language teacher is the Form Teacher who hops from

class  to  class, and the first language  teachers

breeze  in  and  breeze  out.  Teachers  who   are

concerned  about  this state of  affairs  describe

them  as chaotic and say that pandemonium prevails

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



such classes. Teachers do not know the pupils  and

the  pupils  are  bewildered  by  the  number   of

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased to hear from the Minister recently

that the inspectorate is to he decentralised. Will

the  inspectors,  after  decentralisation,  assist

schools in getting a sufficient number of required

teachers  so that the time-tables can be  properly

arranged?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that needs looking into is the

question  of  tuckshops in the  schools.  Sir,  in

these  days of rising cost of living we  ought  to

see  that the shrinking dollar is stretched to the

maximum. One area where the Ministry can  help  is

to  review the tuckshop rentals so that the  meals

and   drinks  sold  at  the  tuckshops   are   not

expensive. The Ministry should also look into  the

possibility of supplying mass produced meals to  a

number   of  school  tuckshops  that  are  grouped

together in one area. Such mass prepared meals  in

central   kitchens  could  be  cheaper  and   more

hygienically prepared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Government's policy on family

planning.  The  Hon. Minister for Health  gave  at

least  one year's warning to people who refuse  to

keep  their families small. He has introduced  the

increased  accouchement charges  for  mothers  who

have more than two children only after a lapse  of

10  months. He told them to be careful during  the

10  months. In other words, warning has been given

that  those who do not pay heed to it have to  pay

more for the luxury of having an additional child.

The  Ministry  of Education, in its enthusiasm  to

support the small family concept, clamped down  on

the registration of the third child in a school of

the  parents' choice, i.e, where elder sisters and

brothers are then schooling. In other words, seven

years  later  the third child has to pay  for  the

sins  committed by his parents. Sir,  this  in  my

opinion  is  misplaced enthusiasm. This enthusiasm

must  have  contributed to additional hardship  to

parents  with more than two children, and  perhaps

also contributed to the transport problem as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



the  children  in  a family had to  be  posted  to

different schools.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to

answer  the  Member for Telok Blangah  first?  His

remarks  on the second language and the  increased

exposure time for second language, and so on,  are

actually  confined to primary schools where  there

is no such thing as specialist teachers. All these

changes resulting in what we call the block  time-tabling,  are  being carried out  in  the  various

schools.  What  does block time-tabling  mean?  It

simply  means  this: all subjects that  are  being

taught in one single language are put together. We

also  increase  the exposure time  of  the  second

language to 43 per cent. The advantages are  quite

obvious.  First  of  all, we  allow  teachers  the

flexibility  of allocating teaching time  for  the

various  subjects  within  the  same  block,  i.e.

subjects   being  taught  in  the  same  language,

instead  of adhering to the very strict time-table

prescribed.    Secondly,   it    eliminates    the

undesirable feature at the moment where we turn on

and  off  a child's interest in any subject  every

half-hour according to the clock. Thirdly, it cuts

out the unnecessary wastage of curriculum time  as

teachers are not required to teach single subjects

at  half-hourly intervals. Fourthly,  the  43  per

cent  magic  figure we worked out represents  half

the teaching load of a single teacher. The purpose

is  that  each teacher will take two classes,  and

for every class the children will be taught by two

principal  teachers for the two  main  blocks  and

other  teachers for the third block which consists

of  physical education, music, arts and craft, and

so  on.  Arising out of the fourth  advantage,  we

hope    to    cultivate    a    more    meaningful

student/teacher relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately when this system was introduced at

the beginning of the year there was some confusion

and  it backfired. As the Member for Telok Blangah

pointed   out,   these   are  the   "international

classes",  where  five  teachers  teach  the  same

subjects, and so on. This is obviously not in line

with  the rationale of the policy. Since then  the

inspectors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



have  been  going round to schools to  assist  the

principals in re-arranging the time-table. We have

sent out circulars to school principals explaining

how this can be done. We invite principals who are

in  difficulty to contact the Inspectorate so that

assistance  on  how to arrange  this  block  time-tabling could be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether this new approach will result in a fall

of  standards of either one or both languages only

time  will  tell, as the Member for Telok  Blangah

has also pointed out. Personally, I do not believe

it  will lead to a fall in standards. We all  know

that  every lesson could be a language lesson  and

within  every  language lesson  knowledge  can  be

imparted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, 1971, that was a few years' ago, we

introduced  the  primary pilot project,  the  PPP.

This  was  discussed in this House and  was  given

wide  coverage in the media. I do not want  to  go

into  this again lest I will be accused  of  being

carried away by my own work. Last year, we invited

some  overseas  experts  to  do  an  analysis  and

evaluation of this particular project. The  object

was  to  evaluate  those  children  who  had  gone

through the PPP against those who had not,  taking

into  consideration  their social  and  economical

background. The preliminary results indicated that

the  standard  of  spoken and written  English  of

those  children who had undergone the PPP  is,  in

fact,  higher.  PPP,  incidentally,  Sir,  is  the

forerunner of the block time-tabling, which I have

just mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked questions about tuckshops. We

have  reduced  the  rental  of  tuckshops  at  the

beginning  of this year. We have also  introduced,

since last year, a milk feeding scheme whereby  we

approached a major dairy to provide milk at a very

low  price,  10  cents  per  150  milliliters,  to

primary  school children. It has been extended  to

about  30,000 students at the moment. We  plan  to

extend  it  further. At present  our  efforts  are

concentrated in densely populated housing  estates

where one-room flat prevails. We are negotiating



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



with dairy firms to see whether they can provide a

wholesome meal, milk with different flavours, plus

something more substantial, like a bun or pudding,

and  so  on.  We  are working on this  scheme.  Of

course,  our  main effort will be concentrated  at

the lower income group at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah queried the policy

of  admission  to primary one. It seems  that  the

Ministry of Education is a bit heartless  in  this

respect, but it is not quite so. No one is  denied

the  opportunity of choice. What we have done over

the  years  was  to  accord privilege  to  certain

groups  of  people. This year we have  decided  to

withdraw this privilege to a group of people, i.e.

children  of  the fourth and higher order.  It  is

true that the Ministry of Education has at no time

given this warning that children of the fourth and

higher order will not enjoy this privilege. Anyway

the  privilege is something earned  and  may  vary

from year to year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to point this out. The

Family  Planning  campaign has been  going  on  in

Singapore  for  a long time, and  the  poster  for

family  planning,  which is a  silhouette  of  two

parents  and  two children has been  in  existence

since  1966.  It is now used as the  logo  of  the

Family Planning Board. Members will recall that in

the  1967 National Day Message it was specifically

mentioned that Singapore wants to encourage people

to  have  small  families of three or  even  fewer

children. Then the Minister for Health gave a  10-month  warning  in 1968 that accouchement  charges

for  children of the fourth and higher order  were

to be increased in 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not really that heartless. We entertained

hardship cases. Where a child is the last child in

a   family,  we  allow  him  to  enjoy  the   same

privilege.  Where  one  of the  parents  has  gone

through sterilisation, we also allow the child  to

enjoy  the same privilege, whether he is the  last

child  or not. Having done all these, out  of  the

47,600  pupils  who  applied  for  admission  into

primary one, 93 per cent got a place in schools of

their choice. Of the 3,000 who did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



not  get a place in schools of their choice,  only

500 belonged to the fourth child and higher order.

So  although we may sound heartless, in hard facts

and figures we are not that bad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong asked about the promotion

exercise.  He  will recall that the  Ministry  had

written  to  all the teachers' unions asking  them

for  their views about shortlisting and so on. The

views   of   the   unions  will  be   taken   into

consideration in the next exercise. I  can  assure

Members of that.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Pre-University admission, it is true we

increase the standards of admission for the simple

reason  that  every year only about  60  per  cent

obtain  a  full certificate or a good certificate.

We  do  not want to waste the student's  years  in

studying  in the Pre-U in vain, when he  can  gain

admission  to  the  Polytechnic,  the   Ngee   Ann

Technical   College,   or  to   other   vocational

institutes  to  learn a vocation  and  be  a  more

useful citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also mentioned about allowance for principals.

I  regret  I  simply cannot consider that  because

this is a subject which has been discussed by  the

teachers'  unions and the Ministry for  l�  years.

This  point  has been thrashed out over  and  over

again,  and we have signed the agreement. That  is

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is one more point raised by the

Member for Paya Lebar. But he is not here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindasamy, are you on a point

of clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that case I suggest you give Mr

Ho a chance to withdraw his amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister replied that

the standard of admission to the Pre-U classes has

been raised. I did not mean to say that the

standard should not be raised. What I meant was

that there should be prior



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



planning,  and not at the last minute  change  the

number  of  classes. If the number of  classes  is

reduced all of a sudden, it will be very difficult

to allot the number of teachers for these classes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do not think a reply is needed. Are you going to withdraw, Mr Ho?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): would like to listen to the Minister's



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the

fact is that the decision to raise the standard of

admission  has been known to principals for  quite

some  time.  There have been meetings between  the

Admission  Section and the principals  before  the

exercise was carried out. The reason why there are

not  enough students in certain schools is that  a

new  Junior  College has been established  and  it

attracts  a  lot  of  students  away  from   other

schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, for amendment (4), may I

suggest that you speak for about five minutes  and

allow the Minister another five minutes; this will

give the Member for Potong Pasir time to speak  on

amendment (5).



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head PA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead DA 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to ask the

Minister a few questions. In Jurong Town, which is

in  my constituency, the population is increasing.

People  are now moving in to live in Neighbourhood

II  and  the total population will be about 50,000

ultimately.  At  about this  time  last  year  the

Minister  said in this House that there  would  be

plans to build a primary school. However, only now

do  we hear that work has just started. So I would

like  to ask the Minister whether he can speed  up

the work and when can this school be completed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is that even if the primary

school is completed, it cannot accommodate all the

students from Neighbourhood II. I believe there is

a primary school called the Joo Long School in the

vicinity.  The school is trying to  apply  to  the

Land  Office for permission to extend its premises

and it was advised to make a request to the Jurong

Town  Corporation. But the Jurong Town Corporation

in  turn asked the school to apply to the Ministry

of Education. So I would like to urge the Ministry

of  Education to give favourable consideration  to

its application for extension.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  as the hon. Member for Jurong is aware, work

on  the construction of Jurong Town Primary School

in  Neighbourhood II is already  in  progress.  In

fact,  piling work started about 10 days  ago.  If

all  goes  well, the school will be ready sometime

next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Joo Long School, the management

committee  of  the  school has enquired  into  the

possibility of constructing an extension block  of

10  classrooms. The Ministry of Education welcomes

the   provision   of  additional  school   places.

However,  as far as Joo Long School is  concerned,

it  would be better and in their interest too  if,

before implementing this proposed extension block,

they can further consider whether or not the place

is  due  for  urban renewal, whether  or  not  the

Ministry  is  going to build more schools  in  the

area, and whether or not they have enough land for

the building extension.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, according to the reply given by  the

Parliamentary  Secretary, the  primary  school  in

Neighbourhood II will be completed  next  year.  I

want to know a more definite date. January next is

next  year; December next is also next year. So  I

would like to know the definite completion date of

this school.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, regarding the extension of Joo Long

School  that I mentioned, the position as  I  have

said  just  now  is that this school  has  already

applied  to  the Land Office and the  Jurong  Town

Corporation. But according to the reply given,  it

should  get  the  permission of  the  Ministry  of

Education. So I would like to ask the Minister for

Education  whether  he will allow  the  school  to

extend  its  building. As to whether more  schools

would  be  built  in  the vicinity,  I  think  the

Ministry  of Education is in a better position  to

tell.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with

regard  to the question on the completion date  of

the  Jurong  Town Primary School in  Neighbourhood

II, I think it is very easy for the hon. Member to

estimate.  Piling  work alone  takes  about  three

months  and  then  a  few more  months  for  other

construction works to be completed. Sir,  I  think

it  will not be possible for me to give a definite

date.  I hope this time next year the hon.  Member

will  not  ask  any more question on  Jurong  Town

Primary School in Neighbourhood II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Joo Long School's request to build

an extension block, the Ministry of Education will

be  considering the application for  the  proposed

scheme,  subject to its satisfying certain minimum

requirements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Although the

reply is not very satisfactory to me, but in  view

of the time, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (5), Mr Baptist. If you

want  the Minister to reply, could you please give

him at least five minutes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head PA in respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the educational progress of many children is

significantly  affected by  a  variety  of  social

handicaps. Can the Hon. Minister inform me of  any

effective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



attempts to solve this problem? I do believe there

is  a grave need for school social care. This will

enable  a  child  to derive maximum  benefit  from

education, by identifying and trying to help solve

the  social problems affecting him and his family.

Of course, the role of the teacher in this process

is  of  prime importance, though many teachers  at

the  moment  are  insufficiently informed  of  the

workings of the social services. It is imperative,

therefore,   that  teacher-training  should   also

include  the study of the social factors affecting

children's educational progress, and some study of

the  social  services. Another possibility  is  to

employ  social workers to be attached to  schools.

Will  the Hon. Minister consider implementing  any

one of these proposals, and elaborate his thinking

in regard to this rather real problem?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, is the

present  increasing rate of crime  which  includes

drug-taking,  drug-pushing,  and  other   offences

among  our  youth. Let me quote some figures  from

the  Police Department's Annual Reports on  youths

convicted   by  Juvenile  courts.   1968   -   444

convictions; 1969 - 439 convictions;  1970  -  332

convictions; 1971 - 390 convictions;  1972  -  633

convictions.  This  reflects to  some  extent  our

present  education policies. There are some  areas

in our education policies that could change to the

advantage  of  alleviating this problem.  I  would

like  to  deal with one area; the area  of  school

holiday amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, amenities available to

children  during  school  holidays  need   to   be

extended  and improved. All school playing  fields

should be made available to groups of children and

young  people during the school holidays;  various

restrictions are now placed upon the use  of  some

school  playing fields. No doubt there  should  be

adequate  supervision. There are also available  a

number  of  swimming  pools in  Singapore,  and  a

policy that the Ministry could adopt would  be  to

enable  organised  groups of  school  children  on

holidays to utilise them. A meagre number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



facilities for holiday camping are available.  The

Ministry  should  look  into  the  possibility  of

establishing  its  own  holiday  camps,   properly

organised and supervised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is clearly a need to improve tremendously

both  the  scale  and quality  of  school  holiday

amenities. Such amenities are obviously helpful to

many  parents  and  children and  have  particular

value  in  an urbanised area like Singapore  where

there  is  very little open space.  This  need  is

further  accentuated by the presence of  high-rise

housing  and  heavy  traffic  on  the  roads.   In

addition properly organised amenities have also an

educational value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Hon. Minister consider a definite policy

to  radically  increase the present meagre  school

holiday  amenities and charge responsible  persons

to  organise  these amenities for the  benefit  of

school  children, especially those from the poorer

families?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

regarding  the first point about social care,  the

Ministry  has  plans to enlarge  its  social  work

unit.  It will not be school-based, as recommended

by  the  Member  for Potong Pasir, but  community-based,  and we intend to introduce a pilot project

in a few constituencies for a start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His suggestion on the use of school facilities is

a  good one. I did mention a couple of months  ago

that we would consider allowing the public to  use

the  school facilities and that we would  welcome,

say,  the  CCC of any constituency to be the  body

responsible for the use of these facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other suggestion on increasing school holiday

amenities  is  a very good one, and  the  Ministry

will definitely look into this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that was a

most satisfactory answer. I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $299,181,900 for Head PA ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.
