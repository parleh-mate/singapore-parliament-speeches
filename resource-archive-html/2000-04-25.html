<div align="center"><b>(Business dealings with Amos Industries Pte Ltd)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether his Ministry has investigated the matter relating  to

Unicorn  International Pte Ltd's business dealings with  Amos

Industries Pte Ltd, and whether he will provide an update  on

his Ministry's findings and conclusion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, during the Committee of Supply  on  8th  March

2000, the Member related that SMEs would probably do well  to

form  alliances  and that Government-linked companies  (GLCs)

are their obvious alliance partners. However, he said that he

had received negative feedback to this idea, and then gave an

account  of  the personal experience of one of his grassroots

leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He came across a new product in Italy that was

superior and would prove to be an advantage in bidding for  a

certain Government tender. Being a small-time businessman, he

approached  a GLC to jointly pursue this Italian contact.  He

thought  he  could  trust the GLC without signing  a  binding

joint  venture  contract or non-circumvention agreement.  ...

When he brought the Italian principals to Singapore, the  GLC

partner  ferried  them away, bought them an expensive  dinner

and  proposed  to  deal directly. With the  GLC's  immaculate

credentials, it is no surprise that the Italian  company  was

convinced  to deal with the GLC directly, and the  small  guy

was excluded from the arrangements."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, according to Mr Ong Kian Min, the grassroots

leader  alleged  that  a  GLC  had  acted  dishonourably   in

excluding   him  from  a  business  arrangement,  which   the

grassroots leader had introduced to the GLC, and that the GLC

had reneged on an agreement to jointly pursue the contact, by

dealing directly with his Italian principal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLC concerned is Unicorn International. The Italian

principal  referred  to  was FB Design,  and  the  Government

contract  relates to a Mindef tender.  The grassroots  leader

was  Mr Ng Cheng Hwee of Amos Industries.  Mr Ng subsequently

told  the Sunday Times on 19th March 2000 that the GLC  "then

proceeded  to  ask a sister company to try and displace  Amos

from  its  existing  servicing contract with  the  government

agency".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have investigated the case and am satisfied that the

allegations  have  no  merit.  Unicorn  International   acted

correctly  and  honourably in its  dealings  with  the  local

company,  Amos  Industries,  and its  Italian  principal,  FB

Design.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts of the incident are as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1997, Mr Ng approached Unicorn on a possible

collaboration  to market to Mindef a product manufactured  by

FB  Design.  Mr Ng represented to Unicorn that Amos  was  the

sole  and exclusive agent in Singapore for FB Design. On this

basis, Unicorn and Amos agreed that Unicorn would submit  the

tender to Mindef, while Amos would not. Mr Ng confirmed  this

in  writing on 5th September 1997. FB Design also affirmed Mr

Ng's  fax that "Unicorn will be the prime contractor for  the

tender".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th June 1998, FB Design stated in a letter to

Unicorn, which was copied to Amos, that Amos was its agent in

Singapore  and was rewarded on a commission basis,  and  that

Amos  had  not  been given any contractual capabilities,  ie,

Amos  did  not have the right to enter into any contracts  on

behalf of FB Design. Once the tender requirements were clear,

FB  Design would offer the product directly to, and  possibly

sign a contract with Mindef, or Unicorn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mindef has confirmed that Amos was not a

pre-qualified  supplier  and  thus  could  not  bid  for  the

contract directly.  Since Amos was not in a position  to  bid

for  the  contract in the first place, there is no  basis  to

claim  that Amos decided not to enter into any joint  venture

agreement or non-circumvention agreement with Unicorn because

it felt it could trust Unicorn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At meetings conducted on 11th and 12th August 1998,

Unicorn  management  met FB Design representatives  in  Singa

pore. Mr Ng was present. It was agreed that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Unicorn would be the party which would submit the

tender bid to Mindef;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) FB Design would submit a quote directly to Unicorn

for  the  supply  of  the  products required  by  Mindef.  FB

Design's quote would include Amos' contractual commission;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In the event that Unicorn succeeded in the tender,

FB Design would pay Amos its contractual commission; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Amos would provide Unicorn with the requisite

services  for  Mindef's maintenance and service  requirements

during the one-year warranty period, the understanding  being

that  Amos  would  give a reasonable quote  for  its  service

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting on 11th August, the Unicorn and FB

Design  representatives proceeded for dinner. Mr Ng  did  not

attend  the  dinner because FB Design brought along  a  guest

known  to  Unicorn, but not to Mr Ng. This was the "expensive

dinner"  which  Mr Ong Kian Min referred to. In  reality,  it

cost only S$375.58 for six persons, or about $63 per head.  A

lunch  the  next  day with the same FB Design representatives

included Mr Ng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore clear that all material discussions on

the  transaction  took  place in Amos' presence,  with  Amos'

consent on the agreed terms. It was FB Design which chose  to

deal  directly with Unicorn. At no point did Unicorn  propose

to  deal directly with the Italians, or exclude Amos from the

arrangements.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereafter, Unicorn sought Amos' quote for its

maintenance  and  service charges for the  one-year  warranty

period. Amos quoted an unrealistically large sum, compared to

figures  furnished  by FB Design. When this  was  brought  to

Amos'  attention, they insisted on maintaining  their  price.

This  threatened to make the bid uncompetitive.  Unicorn  was

thus   compelled  to  approach  various  parties  to  provide

alternative quotes, of which only ST Marine reverted. Even ST

Marine's price was not low enough.  Unicorn therefore did not

give the maintenance contract to either Amos or ST Marine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef awarded the tender in March 1999. Unicorn failed

to  secure the contract. Amos complained to Mindef  the  same

month. Mindef investigated the matter and found the complaint

to be without merit. Mindef replied to Amos as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our investigations showed that Unicorn International

had  never requested FB Design for the agency right. We  also

learned  that  when your Company's agency agreement  with  FB

expired in December 1998, FB did not appoint UI or any  other

party as their new agent."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this reply, Mr Ng was not satisfied. Hence,

after Mr Ong Kian Min raised the matter in Parliament, Mr  Ng

spoke to the press to voice his grievances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts of the case show that the

accusations  against Unicorn International have no  basis.  I

have  laid  out  the  details  of  the  entire  incident   in

Parliament today, because the Government takes allegations of

misconduct  or  unfair practices by GLCs very  seriously.  We

have  made it clear, both to GLCs and to the public, that  we

expect  GLCs  to maintain the highest standards of  corporate

conduct.  We  will  not  tolerate any  unethical  or  illegal

behaviour  by GLCs, and will act swiftly and firmly  to  deal

with  any wrong-doing. At the same time, we cannot allow  the

reputations   of  our  GLCs  to  be  smeared   by   unfounded

allegations.  The  GLCs  have painstakingly  built  up  their

businesses  and  reputations over the years.  Any  accusation

against a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>

GLC   must  either  be  refuted  conclusively,  or  else   be

substantiated and the GLC put right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that after Mr Ong Kian Min spoke in

Parliament  on  8th  March 2000, he had been  in  touch  with

Unicorn International, which had informed him of the facts of

the  case. Subsequently, Mr Ong told the Sunday Times on 19th

March 2000 that the matter was "a misunderstanding". However,

the   matter  could  not  be  left  there  unresolved.    The

"misunderstanding"  had to be properly and  publicly  cleared

up.  I  therefore  thank Mr Ong for asking  the  question  in

Parliament, and giving me the opportunity to put the facts on

the public record.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, I thank the Minister

for  his  full investigation and comprehensive reply.   I  am

satisfied   that   Unicorn   International   acted   properly

throughout this transaction.  In raising this matter I had no

intention  of misleading anyone into thinking that  our  GLCs

were   adopting  cut-throat  business  practices.   If   such

impression was indeed created, I apologise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note the Minister's reassurance to this

House  that the Government expects all our GLCs to adhere  to

responsible business practices.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Having

heard  the Minister, may I ask whether the Minister does  not

think it right that perhaps it is time that a Board of Ethics

be appointed to investigate any misconduct or malpractices of

any sort in the business sector in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I have just explained that there

was  no  misconduct  in this case.  I know  what  the  Member

means,  that  is,  in general, there should be some  sort  of

appeal board.  But I think it is unnecessary because I do not

believe  the  problem is a major one and I  do  not  see  any

reason to create a so-called Ethics Board.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister not agree that it will

make  for  greater transparency if we had a Board  of  Ethics

which investigated and reported it publicly?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> My speech this afternoon and the

response are as transparent as he can hope to have.  I do not

see what else he wants to do.

<div align="center"><b>MANAGEMENT OF OVERALL CREDIT RISK</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister,

given  the  changing  nature of the  provision  of  financial

services, especially where a more timely extension of  online

credit  may  mean that credit risk assessment lags approvals,

how overall credit risk will be managed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  there are signs, anecdotal or actual,  of  excessive

consumer  credit,  given the recovery in confidence  and  the

advent of online services, and how the Government will act to

curb such excess, if necessary.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  may I answer, with your permission,  Question

Nos. 2 and 3 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Consumer credit, overall, has not

increased  significantly.  Total bank  loans  to  individuals

declined by 0.8% in 1999 to $21.6 billion, and picked  up  by

only  2%  in  February 2000, compared to a year ago.   Credit

card  spending has gone up by 16% in 1999 and 19% in February

2000,  after  declining in 1998 due to the  downturn  in  the

economy.   After a slowdown in 1998, the amounts  rolled-over

on  credit card balances have also grown by 23% in  1999  and

25%  in February 2000, compared to a year ago.  But bad debts

on credit card spending remained low, at 0.6% of spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a rapid emergence of online services

allowing purchases by credit card.  This will no doubt  grow,

as  e-commerce  becomes prevalent and more  consumers  become

familiar  with the Internet.  While this may alter the  means

of   payment  and  spending  patterns,  credit  spending   in

Singapore is still governed by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>

the  minimum income requirement and two times monthly  salary

limit that MAS imposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional methods by which banks assess and manage

their  credit  risks  still  apply  in  the  electronic  age.

Offering  on-line  credit facilities should  not  change  the

criteria  that  banks  use to evaluate  credit  applications.

Banks  will have to carefully balance the need to grant quick

approval of on-line applications with the need to verify  the

income and credit history of the applicants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, technology exists for banks to perform credit

assessment more efficiently and quickly, and thus become more

responsive  to  consumers, particularly for those  with  whom

they  have  an  existing  banking relationship.   Within  the

industry,  the  Association  of Banks  is  looking  into  the

formation of a Consumer Credit Rating Bureau which will  help

the  banking  community identify risk candidates for  credit.

All  these  enable the banks to manage their  overall  credit

risks  better, while raising the quality of service to  their

customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the pick-up in credit so far has not been

excessive, the Government will continue to monitor the trends

in consumer credit to see if further measures are necessary.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

just  want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister that in  view  of

the fact that consumer credit can sometimes be encouraged  by

financial  institutions  which  advertise  seemingly  minimal

interest  rates and perhaps hide charges and penalty  clauses

which  actually  make  the low interest rates  non-effective,

would  the  Government look into legislation to prevent  such

practices?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, we will study the matter. I do

not  believe  legislation is a good solution.  Basically,  we

want  people who are selling things or offering loans  to  be

honest  and to advertise honestly and accurately, and not  to

make  misleading  claims.   Of  course,  the  whole  idea  of

advertising  is to make your thing look even better  than  it

really is.  So, there is a fine

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>

line  to be drawn, and I believe CASE has been helping us  to

draw that line.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

know  whether, as a philosophy, the MAS would be inclined  to

be more stringent with regard to the granting of non-security

backed on-line credit.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a Question

to  be  answered next concerning credit for security.  It  is

slightly different from unsecured lending.  We have limits on

unsecured  lending  of  two  months  of  salary,  and  it  is

basically   an   income  requirement.   We  think   that   is

satisfactory, because as incomes rise, the two months' salary

automatically increases.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

DPM  whether  he  thinks that it is more  effective  to  have

legislation and to come out with a standard that  banks,  for

example, must have when they advertise interest rates -  like

effective  annual  interest rates.  CASE,  being  a  members'

association and not a Government agency, would lack the  bite

that legislation has.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, let us see whether we have a

problem.   If so, then we can study the solutions, because  I

do  not  think, up to now, we have had a problem  with  banks

making  misleading advertisements of interest rates they  are

offering.  So I would be inclined to wait for the problem  to

arise before examining possible solutions.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>NEW INITIATIVE ON SHARE FINANCING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether

the  recent  new  initiative  by  financial  institutions  in

relation  to  share financing will lead to  excessive  credit

exposure by investors.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, share financing is

an integral part of the securities market.  Before 15th March

this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>

year,  under the old T + 5 settlement system, investors often

did  not have to pay up until 12 days after their trades were

executed.  The contra buyer could sell on the fifth day after

the  initial purchase, and only pay the broker the difference

between the purchase and sale prices after settlement of  the

contra  sale, which was another six days later.  In addition,

brokers  often  extended informal credit, so  that  when  the

market  entered  a downswing, some customers  would  default,

exacerbating the problem of contra losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have shortened the settlement cycle to T +

3,  contra  trading  has become less  attractive.   This  may

dampen   market   turnover.   Brokers   have   responded   by

introducing  new  forms of financing for their  clients,  and

reviving  older forms.  For example, at least one  broker  is

giving  its  preferred clients up to 14  days  interest  free

credit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where securities firms are concerned, the Singapore

Exchange  (SGX)  requires its members to  impose  an  initial

margin  requirement of at least 50%.  This means that  if  an

investor  buys $2,000 worth of securities, he  must  pay  the

first  $1,000 upfront.  SGX rules also require the broker  to

make  a  margin  call when the value of the securities  falls

below  $1,800.  If the investor is unable to meet  the  call,

the  broker  will  sell  the  securities  and  liquidate  the

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These margin requirements have helped to keep our

stockbroking  firms  healthy and not over  exposed  to  risk.

They  should adequately protect the firms should  the  market

turn  down.  From the macro perspective, the rules have  also

prevented  excessive leverage in the stock market, much  like

MAS' rules on property financing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these margin requirements do not currently

apply  to banks, or to other lenders that are not members  of

the  SGX.   Hence,  UOB could recently offer  customers  100%

share financing up to six times their monthly salary, so that

they can buy shares without putting up any money upfront.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our banks are well capitalised. Margin loans form only

a  small  percentage of their total loan portfolio.   MAS  is

therefore not worried that the banks will become over exposed

to  the  stock market.  However, MAS is concerned  that  over

generous  margin loans may create froth in the stock  market,

and  increase market volatility.  They may also  lead  to  an

excessive   expansion  of  consumer  borrowing,   and   tempt

individuals to speculate in shares beyond the limits of  what

they can afford.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US Federal Reserve Board (FRB) imposes margin

requirements  on  brokers, banks and non-bank intermediaries.

All  providers of share financing are required to  impose  an

initial margin requirement of at least 50%.  There is thus  a

level  playing  field, unlike in Singapore.  The  US  Federal

Reserve  Board requires investors to pay $1,000 upfront   for

$2,000  worth  of  securities.  The  exchanges  also  require

margin  calls  to  be made when the value of  the  securities

falls  below $1,333.  This is more liberal than our threshold

of  $1,800,  but,  in practice, many American  broker-dealers

maintain   stricter  internal  policies  on  initial   margin

requirements as well as margin calls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the US stock market has risen, margin debt has grown

sharply.   There  have been calls on the  FRB  to  raise  the

margin requirement, especially after the recent volatility in

US  equity  prices.  The FRB has not agreed to  do  so.   Its

position  is that the present requirements are adequate,  but

it   is   continuing   to  monitor  the   situation.    Other

commentators have observed that margin financing is only  one

form  of  leverage in the stock market, and is still  only  a

small percentage of total market capitalisation in the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is reviewing whether to extend limits on margin

financing across the broad spectrum of margin providers,  and

whether  our present requirements provide the proper  balance

in our markets.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Deputy  Prime Minister whether the new financing by financial

institutions has aggravated the stock market fluctuations  in

Singapore recently?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I doubt it, because I do not

think  the volume is very large.  It is only about 1% of  the

stock market.  So it is unlikely to have a major impact.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  there  is  a  need  to  have  a  control  on  margin

requirements presently or in the near future in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is standard to

have  margin requirements, because we want to make sure  that

individuals do not over borrow, and that if the share  prices

go  down,  they are actually able to pay for it  and  do  not

default.    And   we  also  want  to  make  sure   that   the

intermediaries, like the brokers and the banks, do  not  over

lend.   Because  if there is a default, it is  not  just  the

individual  customer's  problem or  the  individual  broker's

problem,  but it could become a systemic problem, as  Members

will  remember  from Pan Electric.  When  Pan  Electric  went

bust,  a  lot  of brokers found that they had  over  extended

themselves  and  several went out of  business.   We  had  to

organise  a life boat fund to try and rescue the rest,  which

we  succeeded  in  doing.  So there  is  a  need  for  margin

requirements.  The question is how strict they should be, and

how  they  should  be applied, and what  we  should  do  with

brokers  and  non-brokers.   These are things  which  we  are

studying now.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, may I ask the Deputy Prime

Minister,  regardless of whether the Government  thinks  that

margin  debt  is the cause or the effect of a rising  market,

would  the MAS use the percentage of margin debt to the stock

market  capitalisation as a benchmark when deciding on margin

requirements?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I think the two have different

parameters.    The  percentage  of  margin  debt   to   total

capitalisation  is  very small.  We  do  not  have  an  exact

number,  but  I  said  it is about 1%.   Whereas  the  margin

requirement relates not to the size of that debt but  to  the

volatility  of the debt.  Because if you bought shares  worth

$2,000,  and  you  have  paid $1,000, you  still  owe  $1,000

secured against the $2,000

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>

piece  of paper  -  shares.  If the shares go down to $1,500,

you  still owe $1,000, but it is only secured against  $1,500

of shares.   If your broker is slow to sell and liquidate the

position,  he  may find the market has moved further  against

him  and  then  he has a loss on his hands.   So  it  is  the

volatility which concerns us when we have to judge how  tight

to make that margin financing limit.

<div align="center"><b>BOND EXCHANGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether the Monetary Authority of Singapore will help set  up

a  bond  exchange, especially as an electronic  platform,  to

facilitate  bond-trading  for both  institutions  and  retail

investors,  as  well as to further establish Singapore  as  a

regional debt hub.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few

years,  rapid  advances  in electronic  bond  technology  has

caused electronic bond trading systems to proliferate in  the

US  and  Europe.   These range from the Euro-MTS,  which  was

launched  in Europe in June 1999 by 24 financial institutions

who  are  primary dealers in the various European  government

securities  markets, to exchange systems  operated  by  stock

exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic bond systems bring several benefits to the

bond   market.   For  the  issuer,  it  removes   traditional

geographical  barriers  and facilitates  a  wider  reach  and

distribution  of  bonds.  For the bond  investor,  electronic

platforms offer greater transparency, lower transaction costs

and more value-added services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more important than state-of-the-art electronic

infrastructure are the fundamental conditions  for  efficient

and  liquid bond markets.  Electronic bond systems  are  most

prevalent  in  countries where the bond markets  are  already

highly developed and liquid.  Necessary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>

conditions  to  create  thriving  and  liquid  bond   markets

include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A robust market making mechanism. This requires a group

of  financial institutions committed to making markets,  both

in government securities as well as corporate bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An efficient market structure. This includes a reliable

government  yield  curve, and a liquid  bond  repurchase  and

futures  market to enable market participants to hedge  their

S$ debt positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large base of diverse investors. This should comprise

a  mix  of  long term- institutional investors like insurance

and  fund management companies, short-term value traders,  as

well as retail investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will be taking steps soon to enhance the efficiency

and  liquidity of our bond markets.  To support this, we  are

also   studying  ways  to  facilitate  the  introduction   of

electronic bond systems in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung</b> asked the Minister for

Home Affairs if he will indicate what are the steps taken  to

establish a Speakers' Corner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs what is the purpose of setting up a Speakers'  Corner

and  for  what considerations has the Government changed  its

mind in setting up this Corner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

if  he will outline the rules that will apply to the proposed

"Speakers' Corner" in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,

may  I  have your permission to answer Questions 6, 7  and  8

together as they are all related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, the Speakers' Corner will give

Singaporeans a designated venue where they can speak

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>

outdoors in public on any issue, without having to apply  for

a Public Entertainment licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of having a Speakers' Corner, modelled on the

Hyde Park Corner in London, was mooted about a year ago.  The

Government initially did not support the proposal, as it  was

concerned over the potential for public disorder in our multi-racial,   multi-religious  society.   Irresponsible  speakers

might use the Corner to make speeches to create social strife

and  division  for whatever reason.  However, after  studying

the  matter  further, the Government has decided  that  while

there is some risk, the risk can be managed, and the idea  is

worth  trying out, especially in view of the support  it  has

attracted from civil society groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules for using the Speakers' Corner will be kept to

the  minimum. The Police has carefully studied how the  Royal

Parks  Agency and the Royal Parks Constabulary in the  United

Kingdom manage Hyde Park Speakers' Corner in London.  We will

adopt  many  features of the Hyde Park  example  in  our  own

Speakers'  Corner.  I will ask the Clerk  to  distribute  the

comparison  (Cols. 77-80) of the conditions of our  Speakers'

Corner  and  the  Hyde  Park  Speakers'  Corner.  [Copies  of

document  distributed to hon. Members].   Members  can  study

that afterwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now outline my Ministry's plans for the Speakers'

Corner and the basic rules that would govern its operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address the choice of venue. The

Speakers' Corner will be set up at Hong Lim Park.    It  will

be  open during the daylight hours of 7 am to 7 pm, 7 days  a

week, throughout the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also ask the Clerk to distribute a map (Cols. 81-82) which shows the exact extent or location of the Speakers'

Corner.   [Copies of document distributed to  hon.  Members].

Hong  Lim Park is easily accessible and close to the business

district and Chinatown, which are areas of high

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>

concentration  of  people  and  activities.    It   is   also

historically  the venue for political rallies  and  speeches.

The Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post nearby will make  it

convenient for speakers to register to use the Corner.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000425/20000425-HA-0720081.gif">map - SPEAKERS' CORNER AT HONG LIM PARK (Cols. 81-82)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry considered other possible locations, such as

the  Padang,  the  Civic Plaza at Ngee Ann City,  Bras  Basah

Park,  and  the  Botanic Gardens.  However,  they  were  less

suitable  for  various  reasons, such  as  interference  with

frequent  commercial or sporting activities, relatively  poor

accessibility and redevelopment in the near future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will only be one Speakers' Corner. Given

Singapore's  population and geographical size,  there  is  no

need  for  more  than one such venue, nor to have  venues  of

different  sizes to cater to different levels  of  formality.

Even  London, with a population of over seven million  people

and  about  three times the size of Singapore, has  only  one

Speakers'  Corner at Hyde Park.  There have been  suggestions

to set up more such venues in the UK, but these are for other

cities across the country, rather than for London itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some ground rules will ensure that speakers and audience

use  the Speakers' Corner without creating a fracas,  or  law

and order problems. There will be three basic conditions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The speaker must be a Singapore citizen;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The speaker must register his intention to speak

before he makes his speech;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The speech should not be religious in nature, and

should  not  have the potential to cause feelings of  enmity,

hatred,  ill-will  or hostility between different  racial  or

religious groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on each of these conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speaker must be a Singapore citizen. The Speakers'

Corner is meant to provide Singapore citizens with an avenue

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>

to  express  their  views on issues that concern  them.   The

Corner  should not become an avenue for foreigners to  pursue

their  own  agenda whether in respect of their  own  domestic

issues, or those of other countries, including Singapore's.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers must give notice of their intention to speak,

and  present  themselves in person  to  show  that  they  are

Singapore  citizens, before they start speaking.  This  is  a

very  simple requirement.  All they need to do is to turn  up

in  person at the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post, which

is right next to the Speakers' Corner, produce their identity

cards  or  passports to prove their citizenship, and register

their intent to speak. They need not inform the NPP what they

intend  to speak on.  Approvals will be granted on the  spot,

and they can then proceed to the Corner to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will allow advance registration by

individuals  who  wish to speak, but not advance  booking  of

whole  or  part  of the venue for an organised public  event.

This is to ensure that the Speakers' Corner remains available

at  all  times to all Singaporeans who wish to speak, and  no

person or group can take over whole or part of the venue  for

themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No speeches that would cause racial or religious enmity.

Singapore  is  a  multi-racial, multi-religious  society.  To

safeguard  racial and religious harmony, the  rules  prohibit

religious speeches, and speeches that would cause feelings of

enmity,  hatred,  ill-will  or  hostility  between  different

racial or religious groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers can speak on any other subject they wish,

in  any of our official languages.  They must naturally abide

by  the  laws of Singapore, including the Sedition  Act,  the

Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act and the Penal Code.  For

example,  if  a speaker issues a threat to kill  someone,  it

will  be  treated as criminal intimidation.   A  speaker  who

makes slanderous remarks can be sued for defamation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the Hyde Park Speakers' Corner, no sound

amplification  devices will be allowed.  This  is  to  reduce

noise  pollution, and ensure that no one speaker  drowns  out

the other speakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will adopt a minimalist, hands-off approach

towards  the  Speakers' Corner. The Police will  not  try  to

control  activities there, as long as there  is  no  law  and

order  problem.  But should rioting, affray, or a  breach  of

the  peace occur, the Police will take firm action to prevent

the  situation  from getting out of hand.  For  less  serious

offences,  the  Police will investigate and take  appropriate

action,   ranging  from  verbal  and  written   warnings   to

suspensions  from  speaking at the Corner, depending  on  the

severity of the breach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Chin has asked about the steps to be taken

to establish the Speakers' Corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs will gazette an exemption

under  the  Public Entertainments (PE) Act to  exempt  public

speeches  at  Speakers'  Corner from licensing  requirements.

The  exemption order will specify the three basic  conditions

which  I  have  just  outlined.   Regulations  will  also  be

required to facilitate the smooth operation of the Corner  as

well as to deal with any breaches of the conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, some physical improvement works will also

be  carried out at the site. For example, signages need to be

erected,  and the boundaries of the Speakers' Corner  clearly

demarcated,  so  that  speakers will know  where  the  Corner

extends to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are targeting to complete all preparations and launch

the Speakers' Corner by end August 2000.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Just a matter of

clarification,  Sir.   The Minister just  now  mentioned  the

registration  process and said that once the registration  is

done, permission would be given to speak.  I would just  like

him  to clarify that actually no permission needs to be given

because  it is just a registration process and it  is  to  be

distinguished from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>

the   licensing  process,  which  is  a  different  form   of

registration.  That is the first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is this. The Minister points out that

there  will be very few uniformed officers on patrol  in  the

Speakers'  Corner.  What would happen if  there  is  a  rowdy

scene  provoked by speeches or otherwise?  What would  happen

in that case?  Who will maintain law and order?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Firstly, Prof. Chin is right. The

licensing  requirement  is  granted  an  exemption   by   the

Exemption  Order of the Public Entertainments Act.   All  the

speaker  needs to do is to put his name down and he would  be

given a form which would state the conditions.  He would sign

it  and he would go forth and speak.  In that sense, there is

no  licensing.   It  is  simply that  he  has  indicated  his

interest  and  then he can go ahead and speak,  having  taken

note  of  the conditions.  For people who go to the Speakers'

Corner  and  speak there or as a member of the  audience,  we

hope  that  they will be sensible enough not to  provoke  any

disturbance and not to disturb the peace.  Of course, if  the

peace  is disturbed and people complain about it, the  Police

will be there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to seek the Minister's view on the significance of  the

Speakers' Corner to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> This subject was raised last year and

there  was  a lot of public interest among certain groups  of

people  who said that we should be like some other countries.

We  should have a free speech corner to allow people  to  say

anything  they want without regulations and without the  need

to  apply for a Public Entertainments licence and so on.   We

thought  it was not quite a good idea.  But, in the  end,  we

thought  that if that is really what the people want  and  we

can  manage the risk, we will provide for it.  Basically,  if

the people really want this, we will let them try it out.  We

hope that they can make it succeed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, since there are

no qualified privileges and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>

the  defamation  law  will be enforced, will  there  be  tape

recorders around to tape every word that a speaker says?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I think the police has a lot of

better  things to do than just to carry a tape  recorder  and

tape  speeches.   But Mr Chiam should not be suspicious  when

people  turn up with a tape recorder.  Let me tell  him  why.

Because this is something new, there could be people who  are

interested  to go there to speak and perhaps to make  a  name

for  themselves.  There could also be people who  are  really

interested to find out what is going on and what the speakers

will  say.   Maybe  they will say something interesting.   So

curious  onlookers may carry a tape recorder.  Or a  research

student, for example, writing about political developments in

Singapore and he thinks that it is such a grand thing that we

have  taken  such a step, he may carry a tape recorder.   Who

knows?   Journalists will also carry a tape  recorder.   They

will  even  carry  a  video recorder, and  not  just  a  tape

recorder.  Therefore, Mr Chiam should not be suspicious.   At

the  same time, if he has something to say, do not be  afraid

to say it.  That is the best test, is that not?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  must compliment the  Government  for  this

decision, but I have a couple of questions.  First,  I  am  a

little bit concerned about the location of Hong Lim Park.   I

know  that historically it may be good, but I would  like  to

ask  the  Government whether they are prepared to change  the

location  if  in future it is found that other locations  are

more  suitable, for example, Bras Basah Park, with  its  more

intellectual   atmosphere  with  the   Singapore   Management

University.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government spoke about enforcement.

There  is a difference here.  If somebody were to speak quite ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Zulkifli, can you move on to your

question?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> If he does not provoke

someone, but a passer-by just decides to break a park  bench,

is  the police going to prosecute the speaker or the guy  who

breaks  the park bench?  Can the Minister please clarify  the

level  of  enforcement  and  against  whom  is  he  enforcing

against?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I have mentioned that the Bras

Basah  Park is not suitable, if that is his suggestion.  Bras

Basah  Park  is  going  to  be  redeveloped  because  of  the

Singapore Management University.  Hong Lim Park is actually a

very  suitable  location.   It has  historical  significance.

Some  of  the most fiery and important speeches were made  at

Hong  Lim Park.  So there is a good reason to go to Hong  Lim

Park and it is very convenient.  It is very accessible.   The

MRT station is nearby.  It is within walking distance of many

office  workers and even those going home will pass by there.

There  are two MRT lines, the North-East line as well as  the

line  running along Raffles Place.  So I do not think we need

to  worry  about  the  location because  once  the  place  is

established as a Speakers' Corner, people will turn up.  Have

Members been to Hyde Park?  It is a very large place and  yet

people  know where the Hyde Park Speakers' Corner  is.   They

are not afraid of losing their way just because it is in some

quiet place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enforcement, as I have said, we hope people will

behave  themselves and not provoke anybody.  If there  should

be  a  case to be investigated, it must depend on the  facts,

the  circumstances and the evidence.   The police just cannot

go  around  chasing and prosecuting everybody.  That  is  not

what the police does.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister,

and  I  hope it is not to be thought impertinent, but because

of  the view expressed by the Deputy Prime Minister that this

was  merely  symbolism, whether the Government  is  seriously

intent on promoting free speech in Singapore or is this  just

another  mere  show?   If  it  is  seriously  interested   in

promoting free speech, would the Minister agree to an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>

open debate with the Workers' Party outside?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has always asked

for  a  debate.  We can have a lot of debates in this  House.

Any  time  he wants it, we can have it. And he can  stand  up

there  and make his speech as he wants, except that  when  we

give  an answer, he is not around to listen.  So there is  no

point  talking about a debate with us when he does  not  even

bother  to stay in the House.  There is nothing to  stop  him

from going to the Speakers' Corner and make a speech.  So, do

not  worry about where.  If he wants to debate, do  it  right

here.   This is where the public forum really is for a proper

policy debate, not in the Speakers' Corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me put it more seriously. It is not just a

question  of symbolism.  Of course, we have a place to  show.

It  is symbolism in the sense that, yes, if you want a place,

there  is a place.  But for free speech, I think we must  not

delude  ourselves.  He can do so on the Internet.  He can  do

so  with  the  press.  He can do so in any  place  he  wants,

subject  to  the rules of the land.  And he can do  so  right

here.  So, what is the worry about having free speech?  There

is  free speech all the time.  It is a question of whether he

is  prepared  to have it or not.  Do not run  away  from  it.

When we give him an answer, stay here to listen.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

two questions for the Minister.  Firstly, would the Speakers'

Corner from now on be a permanent feature in Singapore?  What

happens if in future Hong Lim Park is redeveloped?  Move  the

Speakers' Corner to some other places?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have is regarding the language

used.  The rule says four official languages will be allowed.

I  would like to find out from the Minister whether dialects,

for  instance,  Hokkein,  Cantonese,  or  Teochew,  would  be

allowed in the Speakers' Corner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, first, the question on

redevelopment.  There is this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>

saying  - I think you all understand - that when you  get  to

the bridge you will cross it.  You have not got to the bridge

yet;   so   wait  for  the  time  to  come.   If   there   is

redevelopment, we will find another place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On language, we say four official languages. But if he

cannot speak any of them, and want to speak in Cantonese,  go

ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow one more question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister: what is he

afraid of about public debate?  Is he afraid of the public of

Singapore  or  is he afraid of the Workers' Party?   Is  that

what is worrying him?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, may I ask the Minister: is he aware that it is

not just Hyde Park where the people of London are allowed  to

speak up?  They can speak up anywhere else, and not only just

in  London but in any other part of the country.   So  it  is

nonsensical  to  say that London has only got  one  Speakers'

Corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, why is there any need even for registration?

May  we have an assurance that the particulars of the speaker

will not be sent to the Internal Security Department?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, if we are afraid of having a

debate with the Workers' Party, we would not be here.  And if

we  are afraid of having a debate with the Workers' Party, he

would not be given a chance to be here, by us, by the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> rose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, order. Mr Jeyaretnam, can you

resume your seat?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We can have free speech anywhere in

Singapore so long as it conforms to the law.  Nobody says  he

cannot have free speech.  He can do so anywhere so long as he

conforms to the law.  He can do so on the Internet, if he  is

Internet-savvy enough.  He can talk to a lot of  people  that

we do not even know of.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On registration and sending the particulars to ISD, let

me  tell  him that ISD has a lot of better things to do  than

just to read his name.

<div align="center"><b>HARBOURING OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Policy review)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  if  he  will  consider amending the  legislation  on

harbouring  of  illegal  immigrants so  as  to  differentiate

landlords who may be unintentional offenders from those  with

intent,   and   to   prescribe  lesser  penalties   for   the

unintentional offenders.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether the Government will consider reviewing its policy  of

mandatory  jail  sentence for those convicted  of  harbouring

illegal immigrants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether  the Singapore Immigration and  Registration

Department  has  ever  had internal guidelines  to  determine

whether a person who committed an immigration offence  should

be charged in court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  why  the  authorities have  seen  fit  to  prosecute

ordinary  landlords for renting premises to tenants who  have

turned out to be illegal immigrants.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, this is a serious subject. Let

me  answer  all  these Questions relating  to  harbouring  of

illegal immigrants altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, give the background and the reasons why

we  have  strict laws to deal with the immigration  offenders

problem.  This is not a new problem.  It has been with us for

a  long  time.   So long as Singapore's economy continues  to

grow,  there will always be desperate foreigners who want  to

come  in  here illegally and to stay here illegally  to  find

jobs.  They will pose a serious threat to Singapore's safety

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>

and security if they are allowed to remain here, particularly

in large numbers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are four parties who contribute to this

illegal  immigration problem: (i) the trafficker who smuggles

in  the illegal immigrants, (ii) the illegal immigrant or the

overstayer himself, (iii) the person who gives him a job, the

employer,  and  (iv) the person who gives  him  shelter.   We

therefore must have strict laws to deal with all of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale of the problem is large. In 1998, about

23,000 immigration offenders were arrested, comprising 14,700

illegal  immigrants  and  8,300  overstayers.   This   number

remained  unacceptably  high  last  year,  with  some  17,000

arrested,  comprising  11,500 illegal  immigrants  and  5,500

overstayers.   These  numbers have grown  steadily  over  the

years since the early 1980s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Team adopts a multi-pronged approach in dealing

with  the  immigration offenders problem.  To  deter  illegal

immigrants  and their traffickers, the Singapore  Immigration

and  Registration  (SIR) conducts strict checks  at  all  our

entry  points.  More than 40 Police Coast Guard boats  patrol

our  waters  intensively  every  day.   The  Police  and  SIR

regularly conduct raids at construction sites, forested areas

and   other  possible  hideouts  to  arrest  and  flush   out

immigration offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all these efforts will come to nought if we do not

deal with the people who maintain, support or facilitate  the

immigration   offenders'  stay  in  Singapore,  namely,   the

employers and harbourers of immigration offenders.   So  long

as  there  is  work  or  a  place to  stay,  the  immigration

offenders   problem  cannot  be  tackled   effectively.    By

providing  them work or a place to stay, these employers  and

landlords  make  it harder for the authorities  to  find  and

catch   the  immigration offenders.   In  recent  years,  the

number  of  persons  arrested  for  employing  or  harbouring

immigration offenders has increased from 230 in 1996, to  326

in  1997,  436 in 1998 and 698 in 1999.  Stricter enforcement

in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>

recent  years has led to more employers and harbourers  being

arrested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1984, the Immigration Act has been amended several

times  to  tighten  up  the  problems  of  enforcement.   The

mandatory   jail   sentence  for  convicted  harbourers   and

employers  is not a new punishment introduced only  recently.

Let   me  repeat  this:   The  mandatory  jail  sentence  for

convicted  harbourers and employers is not a  new  punishment

introduced  only  recently.  It was introduced  way  back  in

1984,  when  the Immigration Act was amended to  provide  for

enhanced   penalties  against  immigration   offenders,   and

employers  and  harbourers  of  immigration  offenders.   The

mandatory  jail term is necessary to send a clear  signal  to

all  would-be offenders of our tough stance towards those who

give shelter or work to immigration offenders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amendments to the Immigration Act made in

1993, the prosecution had difficulties in securing conviction

of  errant  employers  and  landlords.   Many  employers  and

harbourers  of  immigration  offenders  managed   to   secure

acquittals by simply arguing that they were shown a  copy  of

the  work permit by the foreign worker, even though the  work

permit later turned out to be a forged one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1991, Justice F.A. Chua in the High Court, held

in  the  case  of Vadivelu that, to rebut the presumption  of

knowledge  in a charge of harbouring an overstayer [and  this

case  refers to a harbourer], a person must show that he  has

exercised  due  diligence  in  ascertaining  the  immigration

status  of  the overstayer.  In that case, Justice Chua  said

that  the social policy of the Immigration Act, and  I  quote

him,   "would   not  be  achieved  if  mere   negligence   or

recklessness on the part of the accused to enquire about  the

status of the illegal immigrant or overstayer, if he knows or

has  reason to believe that the person is a foreigner,  would

be sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an appeal case heard at the High Court in 1993, the

Chief  Justice  himself affirmed the strict  requirement  for

employers [and this time he refers to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>

employers]  to comply with the Immigration Act to  thoroughly

check the foreign worker's status before employing him.   The

Chief  Justice said clearly and firmly in his judgement that,

and  I  quote him, "to allow an employer to evade the section

by  shutting his eyes to the immigration or employment status

of  his  foreign  employee, would  make  proper  control  and

enforcement impossible.  It cannot be placing too  onerous  a

duty  upon  employers in Singapore to require them to  screen

their   foreign  workers  before  employing  them  to  ensure

compliance with immigration policy and the law."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is instructive to note that both the courts

and  the  Government  are both agreed on  the  importance  of

ensuring  the  effective enforcement of our immigration  laws

and  the  need to impose a high level of diligence  on  those

employing or giving shelter to foreigners.  By ensuring  that

immigration offenders have no place to stay and no  place  to

work, we are addressing key factors on the demand side of the

equation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, a person who provides shelter or work to the

foreigner  must  exercise due diligence in  letting  out  his

premises to foreigners or in employing them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the observations of the Chief Justice, the

Immigration Act was amended in 1993 to expressly require both

employers  and  landlords to carry out certain basic  checks,

failing  which  they  would  be liable  for  the  offence  of

employing  or harbouring an immigration offender, should  the

worker  or  tenant  turn  out to be  one.   The  employer  or

landlord  was  required  to  check  the  passport  or  travel

document  of the foreigner he intended to employ or  let  out

his premises to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The due diligence requirements were refined again in

1998,  to  make  clear  what  persons  who  give  shelter  to

foreigners  must check before letting out their  premises  to

them,  and  in  view of the fact that visit  passes  were  no

longer endorsed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>

in  the  passport.  The landlords were required to check  the

original  immigration  and work passes, and  check  that  the

particulars  on the passports correspond with the particulars

set  out  in  the  passes.   If the employer  is  named,  the

landlords should also check with the employers to verify that

the  prospective  tenants are indeed employed  by  them.   If

employers or landlords are not sure, they can also  call  SIR

or  the  Ministry  of Manpower to check  the  status  of  the

employee or tenant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These due diligence requirements to check on potential

workers  or tenants are not onerous.  Indeed, they are  based

on  common  sense.   Surely,  it cannot  be  unreasonable  to

require  the  employer or landlord to do some straightforward

checks  on  the  status of his foreign  employee  or  tenant,

especially  as  the safety and security of the community  and

country are at stake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for such checks has been well-publicised. The

due  diligence requirements were publicised in the newspapers

in  1993,  when  the requirements were first introduced.   In

1998,  when  the  requirements were refined, they  were  also

publicised.   These requirements have been  reported  through

radio  and  television news stories.  These same requirements

have also been covered in the popular television documentary,

Crime  Watch, in 1996, 1997, 1999 and this year, each episode

attracting  about 730,000 viewers watching  the  English  and

Mandarin channels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB in 1998 sent out a letter to all the tenants and

lessees  of  HDB  flats.   I  will  also  ask  the  Clerk  to

distribute  a  copy  of  that  letter.   [Copies  of   letter

distributed  to hon. Members].  This letter dated  20th  July

1998 set out very clearly, step-by-step, what a landlord must

do  when  he  were to let out his premises.  And this  letter

reaches  to  more than 80% of the Singapore households.   For

the  remainder, I suppose they are educated enough; otherwise

they  would not be living in private property and they should

be well read.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently SIR has also pamphlets showing how to

verify the status of foreigners and these have been placed at

the NPP and HDB branches.  In short, there has been more than

enough  publicity  on this issue.  But we  will  continue  to

publicise this and I have asked SIR to send the pamphlets  to

all  households that pay property tax to remind them  of  the

requirements, and this will be done very soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides publicising the requirements of the law, the

authorities  have  also  been  meticulous  in  examining  the

circumstances  and facts of each case, before a  decision  is

taken  as to whether to charge a landlord in Court.  Internal

guidelines to determine whether an offender should be charged

in  court have been in place all the while.  Over the  years,

the guidelines have been fine-tuned to ensure their relevance

and effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a party to the 1993 Convention on the

Prohibition  of the Development, Production, Stockpiling  and

Use  of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, or CWC for

short. We need to enact this law to implement our obligations

under   that  Convention.   The  Convention  banned  a  whole

category  of  weapons of mass destruction and  established  a

comprehensive  verification  scheme  to  ensure  that  member

countries comply with their obligations under the Convention.

The  CWC  is  the result of 20 years of negotiations  in  the

United  Nations Conference on Disarmament.  To date,  it  has

been  ratified by 129 countries, including the United States,

China, Indonesia and Russia.  Singapore signed the Convention

in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I need not spell out for Members the horrifying

effects  chemical  weapons can have on human  life.  To  make

matters  worse, chemical weapons are cheap and can be  easily

produced, requiring little by way of technical expertise  and

raw  materials.  Unlike nuclear weapons, they can  easily  be

disseminated using commercially available equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemical weapons have been used in a number of armed

conflicts  in the past causing death and injury to  millions.

The best known examples are during World War I, the Holocaust

and  the  Iran-Iraq War.  A few years ago, the Aum  Shinrikyo

cult  released  Sarin  gas into a Tokyo underground,  causing

5,000  casualties.  It highlighted the fact  that  a  country

remains at risk from a chemical attack even during peacetime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore ratified the CWC in 1997. Besides the obvious

security  benefits  in  a  world that  is  free  of  chemical

weapons,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>

there   are  also  other  advantages  to  ratification.   The

Convention  established the Organisation for the  Prohibition

of   Chemical   Weapons  (OPCW).   As  a   member   of   that

Organisation, we can obtain technical assistance  from  other

member  countries  if threatened with an attack  by  chemical

weapons.   Ratification is also expected to facilitate  trade

in  chemicals  which are controlled by the  Convention.   The

Convention   progressively  prohibits  transfers   of   these

chemicals  to States that are not parties to the  Convention.

However,  as a State Party, our chemical industries are  able

to  freely import or export these chemicals to and from other

State Parties for legitimate purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore does not produce or possess chemical

weapons, nor do we have chemical weapons facilities or stocks

to  destroy, as required by the Convention.  The verification

measures required by the Convention have limited implications

on parts of our chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries

which  I  will elaborate shortly.  The verification measures,

which   consist   of  periodic  declarations  of   activities

involving   chemicals  controlled  by  the   Convention   and

inspections of facilities producing or using such  chemicals,

are  necessary as a number of chemicals produced or used  for

normal  commercial activities also have applications  in  the

manufacture of chemical weapons.  Therefore, these activities

have  to be constantly monitored to ensure that countries  do

not   use   their  commercial  chemical  industry   for   the

clandestine production of chemical weapons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the salient provisions of the Bill.

Clause  8  makes  it  an  offence to use,  develop,  produce,

acquire,  stockpile, retain or transfer  a  chemical  weapon.

Singapore  is  obliged under the Convention to  prohibit  the

carrying  out  of  these  activities.   As  required  by  the

Convention, this clause also applies to acts and omissions of

our citizens overseas and persons on board ships and aircraft

registered  in  Singapore.   Penalties  for  committing   the

offence  are  severe  to  reflect  its  seriousness  and  the

devastating effects of the use of chemical weapons  on  lives

and property.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 creates a licensing system for the use,

development, production, acquisition, stockpiling,  retention

or  transfer  of scheduled chemicals for permitted  purposes.

Permitted  purposes  include protective,  research,  medical,

pharmaceutical and law enforcement purposes.   The  licensing

system  is administered by the National Authority, an  office

created  as part of the Trade Development Board.  The  system

will  facilitate the gathering of information  from  chemical

facilities  to enable Singapore to make periodic declarations

to  the Organisation established under the Convention.    For

the  same  reason,  clause  12 requires  those  carrying  out

activities  involving  such  chemicals  to  keep  appropriate

records  and  provide certain information to the Director  of

the  National Authority, and clause 13 empowers the  Director

to  require  any  person with information  relevant  to  such

declaration to furnish the information to the Director.   Any

information  so  provided is protected from disclosure  under

clause  26.   This  is  to  give our  chemical  industry  the

assurance that commercially sensitive information will always

be kept confidential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill provides for two types of inspections

of   premises:   national   and  international   inspections.

National   inspections  are  carried  out  by  the   National

Authority  and police officers to determine if  the  Act  and

regulations   have  been  complied  with  at  the   premises.

International   inspections   are   carried   out   by    the

international inspectors of the Organisation, OPCW, which can

be  of  two  types. They could either be routine or challenge

inspections.    Routine  inspections  are  carried   out   at

facilities using controlled chemicals to ensure that such use

is  consistent  with  legitimate  purposes  and  with  annual

declarations  made by a State Party.  A challenge  inspection

is  carried out when a State Party to the Convention requests

the  Organisation to conduct an inspection in any other State

Party  to  the  Convention.  A request may  be  made  if  the

requesting  State Party has good reason to suspect  that  the

other  State Party has violated the Convention.  However,  to

allay  any  concern  over the intrusive  nature  of  such  an

inspection, the Bill provides that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>

an inspection may only be carried out with the consent of the

person  in  control of the premises or with a court  warrant.

Other safeguards are set out in clause 24 of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will have limited impact on the commercial

operations  of  our  companies  in  the  chemical  and  other

industries.   In  fact, since 1997, they have  actually  been

making   annual   declarations  to  the  National   Authority

voluntarily  and  have already factored the  making  of  such

declarations  in  their  work  schedules.  From   information

obtained  in  1999,  less  than  60  companies  will  require

licences for activities involving chemicals controlled by the

Convention.  Of these, only eight will be subject to  routine

inspections  by  the international organsiations  as  set  up

under  the  Convention.  Trial inspections here and elsewhere

have  shown that they cause only minimal disruptions  to  the

operations of companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it is morally right for

Singapore  to  sign the Chemical Weapons Convention  on  14th

January  1993  and ratifying the Convention on  21st  October

1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my sincere hope is that Singapore shall never

support  any form of weapons of mass destruction in war  and,

in  peacetime,  to prevent their proliferation,  manufacture,

stockpiling  and  take  a stand for their  destruction.   All

forms  of  mass  destruction, be it  nuclear,  biological  or

chemical are inhuman.  When they are used, they destroy  both

combatants  and non-combatants.  In a war, when  conventional

weapons  are used, it is the civilian population that  really

suffers  and when weapons of mass destruction are  used,  the

civilian population suffers even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I visited Hiroshima in 1998 and I visited the

museum  which  told the story of the dropping of  the  atomic

bomb on that city.  All inhabitants of that city within

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>

range of the bomb died. The atomic bomb, which is a weapon of

mass  destruction, killed every one in its path. It  did  not

discriminate  whether a person is a soldier,  a  woman  or  a

child.   It just simply wiped out every one.  In the case  of

Hiroshima,  the  inhabitants on 6th August  1945  suffered  a

terrible death.  The inhabitants were seared by heat of  4000

degrees Celsius. Then there were strong winds of intense heat

followed  by  acid rain. Finally, those who were still  alive

suffered radiation which destroyed their immune system.  Many

later died of leukemia and related diseases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass destruction done by chemical weapons is equally

bad.  The  difference  between chemical weapons  and  nuclear

weapons is that the former destroy only living things.   They

do  not destroy physical properties, such as houses and other

buildings.   However, like all weapons of  mass  destruction,

they  still do not discriminate between soldiers who are  the

actual combatants and the civilian population. When they  are

used, they kill every one. Some chemical weapons are designed

to  kill  plants such as the agent orange chemical  that  was

used  in  Vietnam to destroy vast areas of foliage instantly.

The main use of the chemical agent orange was deployed mainly

to  kill  plants and trees but it was also harmful  to  human

beings  who  came  in contact with it.   Those  who  came  in

contact  with that chemical later suffered from sickness  and

disabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is right that we should have this law to

prohibit  chemical weapons in Singapore and  give  effect  to

Singapore's obligation under the Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I have listened to Mr Chiam and I

thank  him for his support.  I think Members would share  his

views  and  comments  on weapons of mass destruction,  and  I

should add to what I said in my speech that Singapore has  in

fact   signed   all   the  key  treaties  and   international

conventions   involving  weapons  of  mass  destruction.   In

addition to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>

convention, which is the subject of the Bill today,  we  have

also ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention  as

well  as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). We  have

also  signed the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)

last  year  and  we are now in the process of  examining  the

ratification in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.46 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Science and Technology Board (NSTB)

Act  was  introduced  in 1991.  At that time,  the  Singapore

economy  was making the transition from a developing  economy

to   a  more  advanced  developing  economy.   We  needed  to

strengthen our capabilities in undertaking higher value-added

activities,  and  invest in R&D to better  harness  the  full

potential  of  latest development in science and  technology.

We  therefore upgraded and expanded the Science Council  into

the  NSTB to nurture manpower development, and encourage  R&D

in the public and private sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 10 years have gone by. Gross expenditure in R&D

has  increased  from 0.84% of GDP in 1990 to 1.78%  in  1998.

The  number  of research and scientific engineers  (RSE)  has

tripled from about 4,300 to 12,600 over the same period.  The

private  sector  now  accounts for  more  than  60%  of  R&D,

compared  to  only  54% in 1990.  The NSTB  has  also  helped

establish a technology infrastructure comprising 13  research

institutes and centres

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>

to  support R&D in the industry.  On the whole, we have  made

good  progress  in enhancing our capabilities  in  technology

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead to the next 10 years, our new challenge is

to  transform  the  Singapore economy into a  knowledge-based

economy.  We recognise that innovation and speed are the  two

key  attributes for success in the New Economy.  We therefore

need  to continue to strengthen not only our capabilities  in

up-stream  technology development, but also our  capabilities

in mid-stream innovation; and down-stream commercialisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, we also need to strengthen the link

among    these    up-stream,   mid-stream   and   down-stream

capabilities,  so  that we can speedily turn  creative  ideas

into  marketable products and services to enjoy first mover's

advantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business communities will need to reinvent their

businesses to seize the huge opportunities presented by these

rapid  changes.  Likewise, NSTB and all our economic agencies

will  have to rapidly evolve in response to the emergence  of

the New Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of the proposed amendments to the NSTB

Act  is  to enable the NSTB to respond to the New Economy  by

expanding  its  role.   The  expanded  role  encompasses  the

development of an environment conducive not only for  science

and  technology  development, but also  for  innovation  with

science  and technology, and commercial deployment of science

and technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now run through the proposed amendments. In

clause  2,  we  have inserted the definitions of  "commercial

application" and "financial assistance".  This  is  to  state

clearly  the  proposed  expansion  in  the  scope  of  NSTB's

functions  beyond  science  and  technology  development   to

include innovation and commercialisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill and the amended First Schedule will

allow the Minister to appoint up to two members of the NSTB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>

Board  to  be  Deputy Chairmen instead  of  one.   This  will

provide  greater management flexibility to NSTB,  bearing  in

mind its expanded scope of functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen the link between up-stream R&D with mid-stream innovation and down-stream commercialisation, we will

expand  NSTB's functions to include development and promotion

of  technopreneurship  in Singapore.  This  is  reflected  in

clause 4 of the Bill.   This will empower the Board:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to create a pro-enterprise, pro-discovery and pro-innovation environment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to promote pervasive development and exploitation of

science and  technology knowledge in commercial applications;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to encourage more collaborations in the education and

research  communities,  as well as  between  the  public  and

private sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will also step up its activities in the

development  and attraction of local and foreign science  and

technology   and  technopreneurial  talents,  investors   and

corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill empowers NSTB to embark on a wider

range   of  developmental  activities.   This  includes   the

granting   of   financial  assistance  to   individuals   and

enterprises for manpower development, technology development,

innovation and commercialisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also includes the provision of incubator and business

support  facilities, as well as the development of properties

such  as  the  proposed Science Hub for  the  development  of

science and technology, innovation and technopreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also provides for partnership with the private sector

to  offer incubator and business support facilities  for  new

and growing technology-based start-ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, NSTB has done a good job in building

our capability in science and technology.  In our next stage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>

of  economic  development, we need to build and  exploit  our

science  and  technology  capability  speedily,  and  to  the

fullest potential for maximum commercial returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments would empower the NSTB to

perform  an  expanded role in the development of science  and

technology,  innovation  with  science  and  technology,  and

commercialisation of science and technology,  as  we  venture

into the era of the knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in joining this debate on the National Science and Technology

Board  (Amendment) Bill, I wish to raise two issues so as  to

seek further information from the Acting Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I wish to ask the Acting Minister what are the

future plans of the Government and the role of the NSTB  with

respect  to the Technopreneurship 21 plan.  In particular,  I

understand,  as reported in the press covering a speech  made

by the Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan, he said that the $1

billion  technopreneurship fund would be  fully  invested  by

about the middle of this year, which is quite soon.  Hence, I

would  like  to know what are the Government's intentions  to

provide  additional funding of this programme,  and  how  the

NSTB would be involved in actively pursuing the objectives of

Technopreneurship 21.  I also like to urge  the NSTB to  work

closely  with  the  private sector in  its  future  plans  in

promoting entrepreneurship and technopreneurship development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second query relates to clause 5 of this Bill.

It  says  that the amendment Bill would expand the powers  of

the  NSTB  in order for it to discharge additional functions.

And  the  NSTB  would have powers to provide or  develop,  in

partnership  with  the  private sector,  programmes  such  as

incubator centres and other business support facilities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here, I would like to declare that I am a director

of  a  company  involved in incubator  centre  facilities  in

Singapore.   However,  my view is that  we  should  encourage

technopreneurship, there should be more competition and  more

incubator centres and more of such support facilities  to  be

established   in  Singapore.   Only  by  having   more   such

facilities can we then be able to build up a critical mass of

young entrepreneurs among our Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the experience of other countries such as in the

US, incubator centres have been set up by the private sector.

In  the  US, they call them by various names like hatcheries,

garages or even accelerator programmes.  These are all  based

on  the same concept, which is to help start-up companies  to

be  formed  and enable them to grow quickly from  a  start-up

stage to a mature stage.  Even in Malaysia, I understand that

they have the Multi-Media Super Corridor.  They have provided

a  very  huge  area  to provide for a very massive  incubator

centre,  so  as  to  encourage Malaysians to  get  into  this

incubator centre concept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what are NSTB's

plans   to   support  or  develop  incubator  facilities   in

Singapore,  and  what  are  the programmes  of  the  NSTB  to

collaborate with the private sector to create more  incubator

centres.   Also, will the Government consider giving  special

incentives  or  encouragement so that the NSTB together  with

private  enterprise  can  set up more  incubator  centres  in

Singapore in future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to make some general comments on the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members of the House have recently given many

excellent suggestions on how we could effectively participate

in  the new economy that will be mainly driven by information

and  the  technology sectors of our industries.  It is  quite

obvious  that  more  can  be done  in  creating  a  conducive

environment that can nurture entrepreneurs as well as many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>

more  new start-up companies, and also in supporting the many

new  small  companies in Singapore to be  groomed  to  become

world-class companies in the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore timely that an agency be given the task

to  focus  on  doing  the things I just  mentioned,  and  the

National  Science and Technology Board is the best agency  to

assume this role.  I must say that in the past few years, the

NSTB  has  played  a  proactive role  in  trying  to  promote

technopreneurship  and  in  encouraging  the  development  of

technological activities, and we have been very successful in

doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of the functions and powers of the Board

is   therefore   an  excellent  measure  for  promoting   and

supporting  technopreneurship and to  organise  Singapore  to

continue  to  be  the centre of technological development  in

this  region.  Increasingly, I feel that the role of NSTB  is

being  divided  into  two  parts.   The  first  role  is   of

initiating and promoting longer term development efforts, the

results of which may not be so obvious in the short term, and

which  will  involve  huge investments  that  may  not  yield

financial returns for the Board or for the Government in  the

short  term  or  in  the  long term.   But  these  are  still

necessary so that we could steer the country and the  private

sector to the desired directions, the results of which  would

create the future industries and therefore the wealth for the

country, and also future jobs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second role is one that can have an immediate or

short  term  impact and which could also result in  financial

gains for the Board.  The amendments in clause 5 of the  Bill

basically reflect this role.  In this role, the NSTB acts  as

an  incubator  and  as an angel investor,  or  as  a  venture

capitalist which can help stimulate many new start-ups to set

up shop in Singapore.  With its infrastructure, the Board can

also help start-up companies with a network of companies that

it is incubating and with the connections that the Board has,

and this will help them basically progress in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>

setting up their companies and in progressing further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of being an incubator and an investor is also a

useful role in creating a dynamic environment where many  new

companies   can   thrive  and  grow  to  become   world-class

companies.   In this capacity, the Board should not  restrict

itself  to the local market, but rather it should participate

as  a global player entering into the best technology centres

around the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, it would be wise to at least have a

separate organisational structure for each of these two roles

that  I have mentioned.  In fact, in order not to lose focus,

it  may  be  a  good idea to have separate agencies  handling

these  two roles, with the possibility of the second role  or

function being privatised in the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other suggestion I have is for the Board to be

responsible for supporting and growing the smaller  companies

from  the  point of them being in the start-up stage  to  the

point  when  they  become world-class companies.   Currently,

both the Economic Development Board and the Productivity  and

Standards Board have a bigger role to play in supporting such

companies.   In  my  opinion, the  NSTB  could  play  a  more

effective  role  than  both of these  agencies  that  I  have

mentioned,  especially for the technology-type of  companies,

if  we  are  serious  about growing  many  more  world  class

companies in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is also being amended to allow for the

appointment of two Deputy Chairmen.  I would like to  suggest

that  one  of  the Deputy Chairmen's position  be  filled  by

someone who is still in the private sector to complement  the

strength of the existing members of the Board.  In this  way,

industry  perspective  and  current  trends  will  always  be

available  and will be useful in the decisions of the  Board.

The  Vice-Chairman should also have executive  functions  for

greater ownership and effectiveness in executing his  or  her

role.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the changes proposed in this Bill, in my opinion,

are  good and I hope that the Minister of State will consider

the suggestions that I have made in executing the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank

the two Members for speaking up in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked whether the Government would

inject  additional funding for T21 beyond  the  US$1  billion

TIF.   Since  the  launch of the US$1 billion  TIF,  we  have

invested in 24 funds amounting to about $620 million.   As  a

result of the TIF as well as the efforts by the EDB and  NSTB

in promoting venture capital in Singapore, in fact, today the

total pool of venture fund managed out of Singapore has grown

to  about  $10.2 billion.  So the total fund size is actually

quite  large  and is still growing.  The NSTB  right  now  is

studying whether there is a need for the Government to inject

additional  funding  into  the  venture  market.    We   will

certainly  do  so  if there is a need for the  Government  to

continue  to  play this role of risk sharing by  co-investing

with  the  industry.  Certainly, if we were  to  inject  more

funds,  the  intention  is  to work  very  closely  with  the

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked whether NSTB and the Government

would  do  more  to promote the creation of  more  incubation

centres  to  create more competition in the market  place  in

order to create the critical mass of technological start-ups.

We agree with Mr Leong's assessment.  It is important that we

continue  to  encourage more start-ups and at the  same  time

create  more incubation facilities for the start-ups so  that

they could go into operation as quickly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the NSTB started the incubation centre programme

about five years ago, I am happy to report to this House that

at  this  moment we are seeing at least 20 incubation centres

being  set  up  by  the private sector.  What  is  even  more

exciting   is   that  some  of  these  private  sector-driven

incubation centres even offer equities in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>

lieu  of  rent so as to reduce the cash flow demand on  these

start-ups.   Looking to the future, the NSTB does  intend  to

continue  to work very closely with the private sector.   For

example,  NSTB will continue to refer new start-ups and  deal

flow  that we come across to these incubation centres.   Some

of  these  incubation centre management companies do  set  up

incubation venture funds to invest in the start-up.  If  need

be,  the  NSTB  is prepared to co-invest with them  to  share

their risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe Mr Inderjit Singh brought up

three  points.  First, he divided the role of NSTB  into  two

parts - long term development to create future industries and

short-term  impact to stimulate new start-ups.  He  suggested

that we have two separate agencies to handle these two roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the two roles are inter-related. After

all,  the  long term is made up of a series of  short  terms.

What is long term today will become short-term in five to  10

years from now.  Our key challenge is really to find ways  to

better align our efforts for long term development and  short

term impact so as to maximise the benefits we can derive from

our  investment in these long term and short term development

efforts.   In  fact, this is the main motivation  behind  the

proposed amendments to ensure that we will be able to  derive

maximum  synergies from science and technological development

and  technopreneurship development.  It will therefore  still

be  useful,  at  least for the time being, for  the  NSTB  to

continue  to  perform both roles, of long  term  science  and

technology   development  and  short  term  technopreneurship

development.   However, I would like to  assure  Mr  Inderjit

Singh that in performing these two roles, the NSTB will  work

very  closely  with the industry, the research  community  as

well as the private sector because, at the end of the day, we

recognise  that the private sector is really  the  engine  of

growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the NSTB be responsible

for supporting and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>

growing  companies  from  start-up  through  to  world  class

corporations.  I think companies at different stages of their

development  do face different challenges.  Over  the  years,

various  economic agencies such as, the EDB, NSTB,  PSB,  TDB

and  so  on,  have built up their areas of core  competencies

that  can complement and supplement each other.  We feel that

it  would be useful to continue to let each of these agencies

play  its role.  What we will do is to continue to strengthen

the  coordination across these agencies so that  collectively

they will be able to provide a better level of support to our

start-ups as they grow into major corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested that one of the

positions of the Deputy Chairmen be filled by someone who  is

still in the private sector.  The NSTB believes in drawing on

the expertise of the private sector.  In fact, on the present

board of 12 members, six of them are from the private sector.

With these proposed amendments, the Minister will now be able

to appoint not more than two board members to the position of

Deputy  Chairman.  In that sense, the private sector  members

of  the  board likewise can be appointed to the  position  of

Deputy  Chairman.  The Minister will certainly  consider  the

suggestion put up by Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<div align="center"><b>BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Prime Minister if he

will  (i)  give  an  assessment of his recent  visit  to  the

People's  Republic of China from the economic point of  view,

and  (ii)  inform the House what business opportunities  have

been identified or made available for our business community.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>

<br><br><i>Economic assessment</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recent visit to China has re-affirmed my bullish

assessment of  its growth prospects.  It is a large market of

1.2   billion   consumers   and  an   attractive   investment

destination.   It  can be a strong economic partner,  if  our

businessmen can grasp the opportunities it offers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, like all emerging economies, there are some

areas  of concern that bear watching.  For instance,  China's

traditional  industries  are  still  suffering   from   over-capacity.  Domestic  demand  remains  sluggish  although  the

government is trying to encourage greater spending.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, I am confident that the Chinese government

remains  committed to the path of economic  reforms,  and  is

prepared  for  the  full introduction of foreign  competition

upon WTO membership.   China's impending accession to the WTO

will  keep  up the pressure to speed up reforms in its  State

Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and financial sector in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One strong impression I had from this trip is that while

the  Chinese government is vigorously pushing ahead with  its

economic  reforms, it is at the same time busy preparing  for

the  New  Economy.   During  our visits  to  Zhongguancun  in

Beijing and the Xi'an Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone, we

saw   that   the  Chinese  government  had  begun  to   build

infrastructure, including info-communications infrastructure,

and  to  enhance institutional capacities such as in research

and development, with a view to riding on the New Economy for

sustainable long-term growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue of particular concern to the Chinese

leadership  was the outflow of Chinese talent.   Premier  Zhu

Rongji told me that China was losing about 70 to 80 per  cent

of its graduates from top Chinese universities, mainly to the

US.     Beijing's  Tsinghua  University  has  10,000  of  its

graduates  working  in  Silicon  Valley.   Xi'an's   Jiaotong

University lamented that two thirds of its graduates did  not

stay  in  Shanxi  Province  after graduation.   The  Shanghai

leadership is aggressively attracting talents to help convert

opportunities  offered by the Internet revolution  and  other

growth  sectors  such  as  life  sciences  to  real  business

activities.  For  example, they are offering  scientists  and

professors  from  Beijing  double the  salary  and  rent-free

accommodation  plus  flexible employment  terms  to  work  in

Shanghai.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why when I suggested that Asian countries should

collaborate to forge a "Silicon Valley of the mind" to retain

Asian talents in Asia, it met with an immediate and receptive

response.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Business Opportunities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As China continues to develop and open up, there will be

many  new  opportunities  for our businessmen.   The  Chinese

government  is now giving greater emphasis to the development

of  the inland provinces. The inland provinces are many years

behind the coastal region.  Their opening up will create even

more  investment  and trade opportunities. I understand  that

the  business  delegation which accompanied me to  China  had

identified  37  business opportunities  while  in  Xi'an  for

further consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to the private sector to assess and decide on

the  type  of  investments to be made.  The government  will,

however,  help  to  facilitate  their  efforts  through   our

economic  agencies.    For  example,  the  Singapore-Shandong

Business  Council,  established  in  1993,  has  successfully

initiated  12 areas of cooperation such as manpower training,

finance  and  banking,  enterprise  development,  hospitality

services  and  information exchange.  Our economic  agencies,

universities  and research institutes will also  continue  to

work with their Chinese counterparts to enhance exchanges  in

mutually  beneficial areas such as IT and telecommunications,

tourism, R&D and financial services.

<div align="center"><b>MEDISHIELD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  there  are any plans to ensure that MediShield  will

remain  affordable and effective such that  the  coverage  is

adequate and the premium deductible will not rise unduly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MediShield is an insurance scheme. Just like other

health insurance schemes, the premiums will be higher if  the

co-payment is low, or if more disease conditions are  covered

by  the scheme.  We are fortunate that since its introduction

in  1990,  we  have  been able to keep the premiums  low  and

affordable  and expand MediShield coverage to new  treatments

and drugs, without increasing the premiums or co-payment.  To

give  just two examples, we have recently extended MediShield

reimbursement to stereotactic radiotherapy for the  treatment

of  brain tumour, and Prograf, an immunosuppressant drug used

in  organ  transplants.  So, MediShield has delivered  better

and better value for money to patients over the years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot take this for granted. The best way

to  keep  MediShield  premiums as well as patient  co-payment

affordable to Singaporeans, without compromising its coverage

of  a  wide range of disease conditions, is by ensuring  that

Singaporeans remain healthy and when they do require  medical

care, the cost increases are moderated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is already heavily subsidising health

care  in Singapore. Acute hospital care is subsidised at 80%,

65%,  50%,  and 20% for Class C, B2, B2+ and B1 respectively.

Polyclinics are subsidised at 50%.  The measures  to  contain

health   care  costs  must  be  complemented  by   individual

responsibility.  Our  best insurance for  the  future  is  to

continue  to  encourage  all  Singaporeans  to  lead  healthy

lifestyles. If they fall ill and have to be warded, they must

choose  their wards prudently based on their financial means.

For  those who cannot afford to pay even the subsidised rates

due  to  financial hardship, Medifund acts as a final  safety

net.

<div align="center"><b>SAFE AND HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  existing  office workplaces are generally  safe  and

what  steps  his Ministry is taking to ensure that  our  work

environment  will be highly favourable and on  par  with  OHS

standards of developed countries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office environment in Singapore is generally safe. Our

offices  are  mostly air-conditioned. There may be  potential

air  pollutants from the use of office equipment,  ie,  `sick

building' syndrome. However, good air quality can be achieved

by  adequate ventilation and proper maintenance  of  the  air

conditioning  system. My Ministry and  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment  are  monitoring  the  situation.  Guidelines  on

improving  the indoor air quality of such premises have  been

issued. Our assessment is that currently air quality  in  the

office  workplaces is generally within the acceptable  limits

and there is no cause for alarm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry will continue to provide

safety  and health training for workers and promote a culture

of  safety  and health at work. Last year, the Factories  Act

was  amended extensively to enhance safety at workplaces.  We

will  continue  to actively enforce safety and  health  laws.

Industries with poor safety performance, such as construction

industry,   will   receive   special   attention.    However,

maintaining  high  standards of safety  and  health  at  work

requires  the  commitment and combined efforts of  employers,

workers  and  regulatory agencies.  We must work  closely  in

partnership  to  achieve a safe and healthy work  environment

for all workers.

<div align="center"><b>METAL-WORKING INDUSTRY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether there are plans to improve safety record in the metal

working sector.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety record of the metal-working industry is

indeed a cause for concern when compared to other industries.

The  accident  frequency rate (AFR), which is the  number  of

accidents  per  million man-hours worked was  3.4  for  1997.

While  it  had  improved to 3.2 in 1999, this  AFR  is  still

higher than the figure of 2.4 for all industries in 1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is working closely with the industry to

organise  safety  and health promotional  activities.   These

include  the  annual  safety  campaign  in  October,   safety

seminars  and  workshops and a mobile exhibition highlighting

past  accidents and appropriate remedial measures.  A  safety

training  course for supervisors, comprising 13  modules  was

developed  for  the industry.  In 1999, a  CD-ROM  on  Safety

orientation  programme  for workers  was  also  developed.  A

series  of  7  Handbooks to help workers and  supervisors  to

improve work safety were also produced and distributed to the

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has formed Advisory Committees on Accident

Prevention  for  both  the  construction  industry  and   the

shipyards. These Committees provide a good platform  for  the

discussion   of  safety  and  health  issues  and  organising

activities  and  programmes to reduce accidents  in  the  two

industries.  My Ministry is looking into forming an  Advisory

Committee  for the metal-working industry to further  improve

safety and health in this industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we made the implementation of a safety

management  system  a  mandatory requirement  for  shipyards.

Since  then,  the  safety records in shipbuilding  and  ship-repairing industry have improved significantly. The  Ministry

is  considering making it mandatory for bigger  metal-working

factories to implement similar safety management systems.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN MOTOR MECHANICS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

(a)  if  he  is  aware that some foreign motor mechanics  are

carrying  out repair work on break-down motorcycles in  make-shift  workshops within the vicinity of Woodlands  checkpoint

without  work  permits;  and (b) whether  his  Ministry  will

allow  these  foreigners to continue with such activities  in

competition  with our local motor repair workshops,  contrary

to  our  stringent  control over the  employment  of  foreign

workers by our local industries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower is not aware of foreign motor

mechanics  carrying out repair work within  the  vicinity  of

Woodlands checkpoint without work permits.  The Ministry  has

checked  with  the  Ministry of Home Affairs  which  has  not

received any reports of such activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on the circumstances, these foreign mechanics

would either have infringed the Employment of Foreign Workers

Act  or  the Immigration Act.  For example, if a work  permit

holder  freelances  as  a motorcycle mechanic,  he  would  be

moonlighting  and  this  constitutes  an  offence  under  the

Employment  of  Foreign  Workers Act.  The  employer  of  the

mechanic  would  also  be liable to be prosecuted  under  the

Employment  of Foreign Workers Act.  On the other  hand,  any

foreigner on a social visit pass who engages in any  form  of

paid  employment  or  business  would  have  contravened  the

Immigration Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM will work with the Immigration Department to look

<div align="center"><b>COMPENSATION FOR DISRUPTION OF POWER SUPPLY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry  whether it is the policy  of  utilities

companies  such  as  Singapore Power Limited,  to  compensate

consumers   (including  commercial  and   industrial   users)

affected by disruptions to the supply of utilities, as in the

case of the recent dip in power supply.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voltage dips are momentary drops in voltage levels,

usually in the order of a fraction of a second.  Voltage dips

occur  in all electric power systems and are caused  by  many

reasons  such as cable damage by excavation works and  ground

movements; equipment failure at customers' installations; and

equipment failure at power stations and the transmission  and

distribution  network.   Voltage  dips  cannot   be   totally

eliminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voltage dip on 24th March 2000 was caused by the

failure  of  a voltage measuring transformer in  the  230  kV

switchgear   at  Pulau  Seraya  Power  Station.  The   faulty

equipment caused a short circuit which resulted in a  voltage

dip.  The short circuit was detected and the faulty equipment

was  immediately  isolated  by its  protection  system.   The

defective component has since been replaced and it  has  been

sent back to the original equipment manufacturer in Japan for

further investigation to determine the reason for failure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disruptions caused by voltage dips vary from one

customer  to  another depending on the sensitivity  of  their

equipment   and  the  protective  devices  which  they   have

installed  to help their equipment ride through such  voltage

dips.   It is hence difficult to estimate losses suffered  by

companies.  Since many of our companies now manufacture  high

value  products  such  as  semiconductors,  power  dips   are

therefore a serious concern for many of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensation payments will arise if there is a contract

between  a  customer and its utilities supplier  based  on  a

mutually  agreed  set  of  power quality  standards  and  the

compensation where there is failure to meet these standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, we do not have a generally accepted standard

for power quality with respect to power dips although we have

standards  for power outages.  However, in view of  the  need

for  very high quality power by our high-tech industries  for

their sensitive equipment, PUB is currently working with  the

industry  to establish power quality standards for compliance

by utilities companies.  This will provide clearer guidelines

on the quality of the power supply expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are also undertaking measures to provide

an  even  higher  quality of power  supply.   Last  year,  we

amended  the Public Utilities Act to impose heavier penalties

on  earthworks contractors who damage power cables.  This has

helped reduce the number of voltage dips.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as part of the restructuring of the

electricity  industry  which  the  Minister  for  Trade   and

Industry  announced last month in this House, PUB  will  also

implement  performance-based regulation  for  PowerGrid,  the

transmission and distribution company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a liberalised electricity market, we can expect to

see   a  variety  of  service  providers  provide  customised

solutions  to meet the specific needs of high-tech customers.

Meanwhile, to help existing high-tech companies in Singapore,

PUB  is  working  with the EDB and PowerGrid to  implement  a

scheme  to  provide premium quality power.   These  customers

will   have  to  bear  the  additional  costs  incurred   but

Government will assist by co-sharing the cost.  Details  will

be announced when the scheme is finalised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, I had said that the Government was

contemplating the introduction of legislation to regulate the

sale and promotion of foreign properties in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After consideration, the Government has decided against

regulating foreign property sales.  The main reason  is  that

laws and regulations created in Singapore cannot provide full

or  even  adequate protection for the purchase of  properties

located   in   foreign   countries  and   therefore   outside

Singapore's legal jurisdiction.  Administratively,  it  would

be  impossible  to  establish the  veracity  or  adequacy  of

information provided by vendors of foreign properties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caveat emptor is still the best rule for those who wish

to  purchase  foreign properties, not Government  protection.

Singaporeans  are  well  advised  to  transact  only  through

reputable  real estate valuers and law firms in the countries

in  which  the  foreign properties are  located  before  they

conclude any deals.

<div align="center"><b>SHELTERED WALKWAYS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   his

Ministry  will  consider building sheltered walkways  linking

the  major  private residential estates and large  commercial

buildings in the Central Business District with MRT  stations

and bus shelters like those provided in HDB estates so as  to

encourage  more  Singaporeans to  make  full  use  of  public

transport  and  to  help the national effort  in  easing  the

increasing  traffic congestion on our roads and in conserving

energy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building of sheltered walkways to commuter

facilities  such  as MRT stations, bus interchanges  and  bus

shelters  is  a  shared national responsibility  between  the

Government, town councils and private developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1998, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has spent

$18.6 million constructing covered walkways to provide better

linkages  to the MRT stations and bus interchanges.  This  is

intended  to encourage commuters to use our public  transport

system.  Through  these projects, LTA  has  demonstrated  the

attractiveness of such an infrastructure provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will continue to focus on providing sheltered

walkways  at  the  major  transport  nodes,  namely   MRT/LRT

stations  and  bus  interchanges.  For  this  financial  year

(FY2000),  it  will  be spending about $6  million  on  these

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Councils will continue with their efforts to build

more  sheltered  walkways  in  the  residential  estates.  We

understand that the Ministry of National Development is  also

exploring the provision of sheltered walkways to link private

estates  to  commuter  facilities in the  proposed  upgrading

programme for private estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the city area, LTA works closely with the Urban

Redevelopment Authority and other authorities on the planning

and   provision   of   commuter   facilities,   taking   into

consideration   motorists'  and  pedestrians'   needs,   site

constraints and the need to preserve the city landscape.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRT stations in the city area are usually

underground  to optimise land use. Where possible,  LTA  will

ensure that underground linkages are provided to link the MRT

stations  to  the  key developments in the  vicinity  of  the

stations. As a result, most of the major developments next to

MRT  stations in the city have direct underground  access  to

the  stations, eg, developments around the Raffles  City  and

Orchard Stations. Such underground linkages are planned  when

the  stations  are designed and if a station is built  before

adjacent  development takes place, knock-out panels  will  be

provided  within  the station box so as  to  facilitate  easy

linkage in the future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the ground level, many streets are lined with arcaded

walkway,  traditionally called 'five-foot way'. Such walkways

are   provided  by  developers  when  they  construct   their

commercial  buildings. These walkways  already  provide  good

shelter for pedestrians and commuters making their way to the

bus stops.

<div align="center"><b>JURONG ISLAND</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology (a) whether  Jurong

Island will be gazetted as a public area and all roads on the

island are public roads;  (b) when can public bus services be

provided  to  the island;  and (c) whether the  approved  bus

fare structure will increase the cost of transport of workers

on the island.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong Island is a public area. This means that the

public  has  access.  The  roads on  Jurong  Island  will  be

declared  as  public streets when the Jurong Town Corporation

completes all the road works and hands over management of the

roads to the Land Transport Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the causeway was constructed in April 1999,

workers  had to travel to Jurong Pier, board a ferry  to  the

island,  and  then  take  a shuttle bus  within  the  island.

Ferries  and shuttle buses were provided by employers.  Since

the  completion of the causeway, JTC has been providing a bus

service between Jurong East Interchange and the island.  This

is  a public bus service for Jurong Island workers as well as

members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus service is heavily subsidised by JTC. This is

because  Jurong Island is a huge sprawling industrial  estate

with  very  low ridership density. To compare, the island  is

about  two  times the size of Ang Mo Kio town, but the  daily

bus  ridership is only about 1.5% of the ridership in Ang  Mo

Kio.  The  island  serves  mainly workers  which  means  that

transport demand is very peakish. It is difficult for any bus

operator to run a viable bus service on the island unless the

correct level of fares is charged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Transport Council has called for a tender to

operate a public bus service on the island after the contract

with the current bus operator ends. This will ensure that the

operator  that  wins the tender offers the  most  competitive

fares  and  gives the best value for money. Tender  proposals

are  being  evaluated and will be awarded by early May  2000.

The new operator will start operations from 1st June 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has been in contact with employers on Jurong Island

to  brief  them  on  developments.  I  understand  that  many

companies  are  prepared  to provide transport  allowance  to

their  staff to make it more attractive for them to  work  on

Jurong  Island.  This  is a common practice  for  workers  in

remote  locations, and I encourage employers and  workers  to

work together for a mutually beneficial solution.

For  replacement  taxis,  ie, taxis that  are  registered  to

replace  those  that have been de-registered, they  are  only

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The replacement of front windows has been included in

the  standard package of the Revised Main Upgrading Programme

from  Batch  16 onwards. This is possible due to the  savings

that  would be derived from the omission or scaling  down  of

other works as a result of a review of the MUP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For existing MUP precincts before Batch 16, some

residents  may  have  already  changed  their  front  windows

through their own arrangements. Including the replacement  of

front  windows now as part of the standard package for  these

precincts may create unhappiness among the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MND has no objection for existing MUP precincts

to include this item as part of their standard package if:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) there is strong demand from residents for the item;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) substantial construction works have not yet started for

the precinct; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) the item can be funded within the MUP budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If necessary, the precinct will have to forgo other

improvement items to accommodate this addition.

curb speculation in our property market.  The overall package

was effective in cooling the property bubble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the anti-speculation measures have since been

lifted.   However, the restriction on Singapore dollar  loans

to  foreigners  to  buy  residential property  remains.   The

Government  has left this in place as a signal that  it  does

not  encourage speculation in the property market, especially

by  non-Singaporeans using borrowed funds.   The  restriction

does not in practice cause a problem, because employment pass

holders  who take up permanent residence become eligible  for

Singapore dollar property loans.  Those who do not take up PR

probably  do  not  plan  to stay on  for  the  long  term  in

Singapore, and are unlikely to want to buy property for owner-occupation.

Health  (a)  from  1990 to 1999, how many  cases  of  problem

drinking were reported to hospitals annually and what was the

profile of these problem drinkers by gender and social  class

factors;   (b)  what  measures  are  in  place   to   address

intervention  and  treatment issues at the institutional  and

community  levels; and (c) whether it is time for a  national

campaign against problem drinking.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of admissions to hospitals from 1990 to 1999

for  conditions related to problem drinking,  such  as  acute

alcoholic    intoxication,   alcohol   dependence   syndrome,

alcoholic  liver  damage and alcoholic  psychosis,  is  about

1,100-1,200  annually. The annual number of  such  admissions

over  the  years has remained fairly constant.  The  male  to

female  ratio is approximately 8:1. We do not keep  track  of

the social class of patients admitted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woodbridge Hospital runs an Alcohol Treatment Centre for

the  treatment  and rehabilitation of problem  drinkers.  The

Centre accepts referrals from hospitals, polyclinics, general

practitioners, community groups dealing with alcoholism, like

Alcoholics  Anonymous, social service organisations  such  as

the   Family   Service   Centres,  community   agencies   and

counselling  centres. In 1999, the Centre had  managed  about

170   admissions,  100  new  outpatient  cases,   and   3,600

attendances  at its alcohol recovery support group  sessions.

The  staff  of  the  Alcohol Treatment Centre  also  conducts

public  seminars  and training for general  practitioners  on

early identification of persons with alcohol problems and the

management of such persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the community, the Alcoholics Anonymous and two

halfway  houses  offer  counselling  and  group  therapy  for

problem drinkers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current size of the problem does not warrant a

national  campaign. Nevertheless, my Ministry will  focus  on

public  education  to increase awareness of  the  dangers  of

excessive drinking, specify safe drinking limits, and  manage

problem drinkers.

<div align="center"><b>FOR WOMEN ALCOHOLICS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development and Sports (a) what  capacity-building

resources   are   identified  to  curb   increasing   alcohol

consumption  among  young women; (b)  what  intervention  and

treatment  strategies can be developed to help families  cope

with alcoholic members; and (c) whether it is appropriate for

his  Ministry  to  facilitate the setting  up  of  Alcoholics

Anonymous  for Women and to fund the setting up  of  half-way

houses  for  women under the influence of multiple  substance

abuse.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health's National Health Survey 1998

found  that there has not been any significant change in  the

prevalence of drinking among young women.  In 1998, 72.4%  of

women  were non-drinkers.  Of the remaining 27.6% who  drank,

only  0.8%  drank on a regular basis.  Among those who  drank

regularly,  ie,  more than 4 days per week, 0.5%  were  women

aged 18-29 years.

<br><br><i>Capacity-building   resources  to  curb  increasing   alcohol consumption among young women</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst alcohol consumption among young women does not

appear  to  be  an  increasing  trend,   nevertheless   MCDS,

together  with  other  government  agencies,  volunteers  and

community  groups will highlight alcoholism as an anti-social

behaviour. This would be done through our regular  talks  and

group  sessions for youths, which are held to teach  them  to

resist peer pressure and to practise responsible behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community groups also play an important role. For

example, Project Access, a non-profit social enterprise  runs

programmes in schools and community organisations which  seek

to  teach  girls aged 13-16 years and young women  leadership

skills,  personal effectiveness and professional development.

The  acquisition  of  positive life-skills  is  important  to

counter negative habits such as drinking and smoking.

<br><br><i>What  intervention and treatment strategies can be  developed to help families cope with alcoholic members</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treatment for alcoholics comes under the care of

Ministry  of  Health.   For example,  the  Alcohol  Treatment

Centre  (ATC)  in Woodbridge Hospital (WH)  has  in  place  a

counselling  and  support group for families  with  alcoholic

members.   Besides the ATC, private hospitals like Adam  Road

Hospital   and   Mount   Elizabeth   Hospital   also    offer

detoxification and rehabilitation programmes for persons with

a drinking problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCDS assists families who are affected as a result of an

alcoholic  member  in  the family.   For  example,  temporary

shelter  for  families from an abusive drunkard,  funding  of

crisis  shelters which provide temporary refuge,  counselling

and  support.   Families facing financial difficulties  as  a

result  of  the breadwinner's drinking problem get help  from

MCDS,   Family  Service  Centres  and  Community  Development

Councils, eg, interim financial assistance and care  for  the

child's well-being.  More importantly, MCDS will help  family

members  to  develop life-skills to care for  themselves  and

their  children and educate them on the steps that they could

take  if  their  spouse  refuses to seek  treatment  for  the

drinking problem.

<br><br><i>The  appropriateness for MCDS to set up Alcoholics  Anonymous for  Women and to fund the setting up of half-way houses  for women under the influence of multiple substance abuse</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As WH already has in place an existing framework for the

intervention  and  treatment for  recovering  alcoholics  and

their  families,  MCDS  would not  want  to  duplicate  this.

Currently there are two half-way houses for women under  MHA.

One  of  them  has  a specific programme to  help  recovering

addicts  cope   with their drinking problem.   This  half-way

house is also open to members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will continue to monitor the extent of

alcohol consumption among young women and men.
