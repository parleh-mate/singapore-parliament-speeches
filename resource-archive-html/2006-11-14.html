Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:&nbsp;</B>Mr Speaker, Sir, I&nbsp;appreciate the frustration of Singaporeans with this perennial haze occurrence.&nbsp; The smoke haze in the region is from land and forest fires in Indonesia.&nbsp; The fires are a result of land clearing practices by farmers and plantation companies.&nbsp; The smoke haze situation is aggravated during El Nino years such as in 1994, 1997 and this year.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, the three-hour PSI hit a high of 150 on 7th October 2006, the highest level recorded since 1997.&nbsp; The 24-hour PSI levels also hit "unhealthy" range on&nbsp;three days in October 2006.&nbsp; The 24-hour PSI level was 128 on 7th October, 109 on 8th October, and 102 on 20th October.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, we have been working closely with the Indonesian Government to help them mitigate the fires and smoke haze.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to elaborate.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Singapore&rsquo;s assistance</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1997, Singapore has been providing satellite pictures to alert the <p align=left>Column: 756</p>Indonesian authorities at the central and&nbsp;local government levels on the locations of hot spots in Sumatra and Kalimantan.&nbsp; We will continue to provide satellite pictures to assist Indonesia to locate the fires on the ground in order that they could take immediate action to put out the fires.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have provided other technical assistance to Indonesia, such as communication and computer equipment, to facilitate fire detection and enforcement and air monitoring equipment.&nbsp; We have also conducted training courses for Indonesian officials, including those at the district level, on interpretation of satellite imagery, geographical information and health effects of haze and air quality monitoring.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 2005, Singapore provided one C-130 aircraft to assist Indonesia in its cloud-seeding operations and a contingent of 54 SCDF fire-fighters to put out the fires in Sumatra.&nbsp; This year, Singapore also extended the same offer, which Indonesia did not take up.&nbsp; Our offer still stands.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Regional mechanisms and assistance</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1997, Singapore helped to shape the regional mechanism to tackle the haze problem.&nbsp; In December 1997, Singapore hosted the First ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Haze (AMMH), which developed the Regional Haze Action Plan (RHAP).&nbsp; The Plan sets out measures to prevent and suppress land and forest fires as well as early warning and monitoring to detect smoke haze in the region.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998, the Sub-Regional Fire-Fighting Arrangements for Borneo and Sumatra (SRFA) were set up.&nbsp; The SRFA comprises Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore.&nbsp; The aims of the SRFA are to focus on fire prevention and suppression measures on the ground in Sumatra and Borneo.&nbsp; Thailand joined the <p align=left>Column: 757</p>SRFA in 2005 when they too were affected by the smoke haze from Sumatra.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore also hosts the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre (ASMC) since 1993.&nbsp; The ASMC provides weather forecast and monitoring of smoke haze and land and forest fires in the region.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite all the efforts over the past 10 years, the measures taken have not been adequate and effective.&nbsp; The region is still badly affected by the haze this year.&nbsp; Clearly, more needs to be done.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Recent developments</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the three-hour PSI reached its peak of 150 last month, Singapore registered our concerns over the haze issue with Indonesia at the highest level.&nbsp; Our Prime Minister&nbsp;wrote to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on 10th October 2006 to express our concern and disappointment over the recurring haze problem.&nbsp; At Singapore&rsquo;s suggestion, Indonesia hosted the Sub-Regional Ministerial Meeting (SRMM) on Transboundary Haze Pollution in Pekanbaru on 13th October 2006.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Sub-Regional Ministerial Meeting (SRMM)</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Environment Ministers from Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore attended this meeting.&nbsp; Thailand was represented by its Deputy Permanent Secretary.&nbsp; The SRMM acknowledged that the measures taken to tackle the land and forest fires in Indonesia over the past 10 years had not been effective.&nbsp; They agreed to formulate a comprehensive Plan of Action (PoA) to deal with the smoke haze issues in the short and long term.&nbsp; In this regard, assistance and support from international and regional organisations are needed to help prevent and suppress land and forest fires in Indonesia.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 758</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) comprising Environment Ministers from Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand was set up to oversee the implementation of the PoA.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Regional Workshop on Haze</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the meeting in Pekanbaru, Indonesia hosted a Regional Workshop on Haze in Jakarta on 2nd November 2006, which developed a comprehensive PoA to tackle the land and forest fires in Indonesia.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indonesia had identified 35 fire-prone&nbsp;districts in&nbsp;eight provinces, including Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, West and Central Kalimantan.&nbsp; Indonesia then suggested that ASEAN member countries and international organisations could consider adopting fire-prone areas to build up their capacities to implement measures to prevent and suppress the land and forest fires.&nbsp; This could then be replicated in other fire-prone areas.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>1st Meeting of the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1st Meeting of the MSC was held on 9th November 2006 in Cebu, Philippines.&nbsp; I attended the meeting together with my environmental counterparts from Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the MSC Meeting, we noted that the Regional Workshop on Haze, organised by Indonesia on 2nd November 2006 in Jakarta, had been very useful in profiling the transboundary haze pollution issue.&nbsp; We were told that many international and regional organisations had indicated their interest to assist in the implementation of the PoA.&nbsp; The comprehensive PoA, which was endorsed by the Ministerial Steering Committee, <p align=left>Column: 759</p>comprises the following key areas which the Indonesians will implement:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire Prevention;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire Suppression;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Surveillance and Enforcement;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Early Warning and Monitoring; and</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp; Regional and International Assistance and&nbsp;Collaboration.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MSC Meeting also endorsed the formation of a Technical Working Group (TWG) to support the MSC and the implementation of the PoA.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under its PoA, Indonesia has suggested that member countries of the MSC consider adopting one or more fire-prone districts/regencies for enhancing capacity to deal with land and forest fires.&nbsp; The Meeting welcomed Indonesia&rsquo;s proposal.&nbsp; To show our support, Singapore indicated that we would be keen to work with a regency in Jambi Province.&nbsp; We also encouraged other member countries to consider such adoption programme.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Meeting also agreed that financial support from member countries of the MSC could be used as seed funds to attract support from international organisations and donor agencies.&nbsp; Recognising the urgency and importance of the PoA, Indonesia has agreed to host a high-level international conference in December 2006 to generate support and partnership for the implementation of the PoA.&nbsp; Singapore will provide support and participate in this conference.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only with sustained efforts by Indonesia, with assistance from regional governments, regional and international organisations that we are likely to see changes in land clearing practices without <p align=left>Column: 760</p>the use of fire.&nbsp; This is a long-term process.&nbsp; Land and forest fires are not likely to stop overnight.&nbsp; Fire prevention requires concerted and sustained efforts by all.&nbsp; As a first concrete step, the Indonesian authorities must step up its enforcement actions against plantation owners and companies for carrying out illegal land clearing practices by fires.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a clear and strong political commitment to eradicate the haze problem by Indonesian President Yudhoyono.&nbsp; There is a need for changes to the various levels of governance, public education, enforcement and prosecution, such that the root cause of the smoke haze issue could be comprehensively addressed.&nbsp; Indonesia also needs to ratify the ASEAN Haze Agreement to demonstrate its political resolve to tackle the haze challenge.&nbsp; We should be prepared for a long-haul process which would require substantial amount of commitment from Indonesia, with assistance from ASEAN countries, regional and international organisations.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><I>Impact of haze on the environment, economy and health</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mdm Halimah Yacob asked about the health effects of the haze.&nbsp; NEA&rsquo;s 24-hour PSI readings can be directly correlated to the indicative health impacts.&nbsp; 24-hour PSI levels between 101 and 200, which are in the 'unhealthy' range, may result in mild aggravation of symptoms among the population with chronic heart or lung ailments.&nbsp; Transient symptoms of irritation, eg, eye irritation, sneezing or coughing may also surface in some of the healthy population.&nbsp; I would also urge the vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, the very young, asthmatics and diabetics, to take greater precaution and seek medical advice where necessary.&nbsp; When the readings exceed 100, NEA will issue health advisories to advise the public to avoid vigorous outdoor activities.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 761</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prolonged periods of haze also lead to economic losses for Singapore.&nbsp; The losses are from a rise in hospitalisation and treatment costs, losses in tourism, losses in productivity because people take time off from work, and losses in recreational opportunities.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To minimise the adverse impacts of smoke haze on Singaporeans, an inter-ministry Haze Task Force (HTF) has been put in place since 1994 to co-ordinate the actions of various ministries and agencies.&nbsp; The HTF has developed a national Haze Standard Operating Procedure&nbsp;(SOP).&nbsp; This puts in place plans and measures to inform and protect the public during a smoke haze episode.&nbsp; We will continue to be vigilant in updating our SOP and work effectively across relevant agencies for a coordinated response to tackle the haze.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore strives to provide a good environment for its citizens to live, work and play in.&nbsp; Despite being an urban city State with a sizable vehicle population and industrial activities, Singapore&rsquo;s air quality has been rated well consistently.&nbsp; For example, the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) report in 2005 concluded that expatriates perceive Singapore's air quality to be the best, ahead of other countries surveyed, such as Australia, Japan, South Korea, and&nbsp;even the US.&nbsp; This has not come about by accident and can be attributed to the comprehensive measures that the Singapore Government has put in place over the years to control air pollution and to improve air quality in Singapore by taking the following steps:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minimising pollution at source by stipulating stringent air emission limits and fuel quality on industries and motor vehicles, eg, the implementation of EURO IV emission standards for diesel vehicles since 1st October 2006;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stringent legislation and enforcement to control air pollution, eg, a more <p align=left>Column: 762</p>stringent smoke test for diesel vehicles - the Chassis Dynamomter Smoke Test will be used for the mandatory periodic inspections from 1st January 2007;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proper land use planning and judicious siting of industries; and</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promoting cleaner energy and energy efficiency through various schemes like the Green Vehicle Rebate scheme for vehicles and the Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance scheme for our buildings and industries.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government regularly monitors international standards for ambient air quality and reviews our measures to curb domestic sources of air pollution.&nbsp; We constantly monitor the ambient air quality in Singapore via a comprehensive network of 14 air monitoring stations across the island.&nbsp; In recent years, from 2003 to 2005, Singapore has been experiencing more than 85% "good" days per year with no 'unhealthy' days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this year, the haze has caused our air quality to deteriorate.&nbsp; As of 31st October 2006, we have 85% "good" days, 14% 'moderate' days and 1% 'unhealthy' days due to the recent transboundary haze.&nbsp; This shows that despite our best domestic efforts to maintain good air quality, we remain vulnerable to external threats such as the periodic haze.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since the onset of the inter-monsoon in late October, the winds are increasingly blowing from the northeasterly direction and will keep smoke haze away from Singapore.&nbsp; For the rest of the year, we can expect the air quality to be in the "Good" range on most days.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would like to assure the House that preventing and combating the causes of haze is something which my Ministry will continuously put as top priority in our agenda.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Minister has said that there is now another PoA - Points of Agreement,&nbsp;but I think what we are not&nbsp;short of are&nbsp;points of agreement and agreements!&nbsp; There have been so many since 1997.&nbsp; What we want to see is actually implementation.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp; what measures are there within ASEAN in order to ensure implementation, so that next year Singaporeans do not have to suffer another terrible haze.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question I would like to ask&nbsp;the Minister&nbsp;&ndash; he has said that there are health and economic costs &ndash;&nbsp;has there been any analysis done in terms of dollar terms?&nbsp; How much has that really cost us in terms of health and our economy?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, I share the Member's concern, but a clarification, PoA is Plan of Action, not Points of Agreement!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think if we look back at what has happened in the last five weeks, it will give us enough hope and optimism that something is happening.&nbsp; When we had the high reading of 150 on 7th October, we quickly mobilised our ASEAN partners and we were able to have the meeting one week later on 13th October in Pekanbaru.&nbsp; Thereafter, Indonesia took upon itself to conduct a regional workshop on 2nd November, one week after Hari Raya.&nbsp; Being a Muslim country with a long celebration, they were able to put together a very good regional workshop with international partners.&nbsp; Then, on 9th November, we managed to bring everybody together to Cebu, and the Philippine government was more than happy to host a special meeting on haze for all of us to agree on the Plan of Action and form a technical working group and,&nbsp;more importantly, Indonesia's commitment to hold an international conference <p align=left>Column: 764</p>in early December.&nbsp; We were thinking</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B></span></B></div><BR>							<div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>that it could be delayed to January or February, but they wanted to do it in early December.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think, in the last five weeks, we have seen much progress on the part of the Indonesians and the countries affected in the region.&nbsp; I am a bit more optimistic this time round because now we have something concrete.&nbsp; With the international conference coming up, the technical working group will help to knock out some details in order to present to the international community what exactly we are going to do and where the funds are needed.&nbsp; So it has to be very concrete.&nbsp; The Ministerial Steering Committee has agreed to meet on a quarterly basis in order to monitor the implementation of the programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By all account, things are moving and they are in motion.&nbsp; Will we solve the problem next year?&nbsp; I do not think so because it will require long-term efforts.&nbsp; Slash and burn has been around this region for centuries, and the haze problem has been around since the 1990s.&nbsp; Obviously, you need concrete action at the ground to develop new capacities among farmers and plantation owners to make sure that they resort to land clearing methods which are more environmentally friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the strategy will be two-fold. One, obviously is to prevent fires from occurring and that will take some time.&nbsp; The second thing is fire suppression, which is to make sure that if a fire breaks out next year, we can deal with it quickly.&nbsp; To the credit of the Indonesian government, they rented two Russian water bombers, late - but better late than never - to try and douse some of the flames in Kalimantan.&nbsp; So things are moving in the right direction.&nbsp; On our part, the Singapore Government is committed to working with our colleagues in the region to ensure that the plan get <p align=left>Column: 765</p>implemented.&nbsp; I am a bit optimistic, but I also want to alert Singaporeans that we cannot expect this to be solved in the short term.&nbsp; We will do our best&nbsp;to work&nbsp;not only with the countries in the region but, I think, with the international community and NGOs.&nbsp; Let me share with you an example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peatland fire is one of the big problems that we face because that is the nature of our region.&nbsp; But a particular NGO has been able to work with the local province in Kalimantan to deal with the peat fires over there quite successfully.&nbsp; So it shows that there is capacity within certain sectors and certain NGOs in which we want to draw upon to work together with our Indonesian counterparts.&nbsp; The fact that the Indonesian government has offered 35 fire-prone districts for adoption is another good sign to allow us to go down to the local level, to work with the regional fire-prone provinces to develop local capacity.&nbsp; But having to get farmers to change livelihood, to adopt new clearing methods, will take time.&nbsp; Because, for example, from clearing land by fire, now you have to use tractors, you have to use machinery, you have to be able to have the equipment and you have to know how to use the equipment and maintain it, and so on, will require a lot of plans that will have to be implemented.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will assure Members that we will continue to work on this, but I do not think I can promise to Singapore and Singaporeans that we can solve this within one or two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second question, we have done a comprehensive study, and we have engaged some consultants in the university to help us&nbsp;understand the impact - I think, more importantly, the health impact - because we want to understand that further.&nbsp; But based on studies in other countries, especially in America, one of the pollutants which is PM 10 is known to be quite bad for <p align=left>Column: 766</p>health,&nbsp;if you are exposed over&nbsp;a long period.&nbsp; On economic losses, studies have been done by one of our local professors.&nbsp; We are in touch with him to understand that further and to do a bit more comprehensive work to understand the impact.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B>&nbsp; Two supplementary questions, Sir.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister on his concern&nbsp;about the experts predicting a possible super El Nino weather effect which can lead to drought and raging forest fire, resulting in worse haze next year.&nbsp; Does he have to further step up the efforts on preventive measures in view of this?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the Prime Minister mentioned last week that funds were set aside for efforts to fight the haze.&nbsp; Could the Minister elaborate on this fund and efforts referred to by the Prime Minister?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the point is exactly because we cannot predict the weather pattern and El Nino is expected to come next year, or all the weather experts, both in Singapore and beyond, predicted that we will have a stronger El Nino next year.&nbsp; The last time we had&nbsp;an EL Nino was in 1997 and we remembered how bad the haze was.&nbsp; We have alerted our colleagues in the region that because of this likelihood of an El Nino next year, if we do not suppress the fire or prevent it from occurring, it will become a big problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me, I think there is a strong sense of urgency among the five countries in the region to try and tackle this.&nbsp; For example, our counterparts in Malaysia are keen because next year is Visit Malaysia year, and it may affect tourism for Malaysia.&nbsp; So, all of us have a common cause here to make sure that this thing does not get out of hand, but we cannot predict the weather pattern.&nbsp; For example, <p align=left>Column: 767</p>the wind direction can change.&nbsp; If it blows from the south westerly direction, the Sumatra haze will come to Singapore.&nbsp; If it blows from the south easterly direction, the Kalimantan haze will come to Singapore.&nbsp; Now the wind is blowing in the north easterly direction, so it is blowing&nbsp;the haze away&nbsp;from Singapore.&nbsp; But weather pattern can change, so we will have to live with that.&nbsp; But I think the Member's point was that we have to put programmes and measures in place, which we plan to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping that by the time we arrive for our next meeting in February in Brunei, the details will be sorted out, the responsibilities among the countries will be sorted out, and then we can see what are the things that we can do at the ground.&nbsp; Because, ultimately, it is working with the regional partners so that they can adopt alternative practices which would be our best plan in the longer term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the funds, SPS Amy Khor was at the meeting in Cebu on my behalf.&nbsp; We have announced that Singapore&nbsp;is happy to pledge US$50,000 for the haze fund.&nbsp; At the moment, both Singapore and Indonesia have pledged.&nbsp; We hope that the other countries will do so.&nbsp; The numbers may not be big, but these funds will be used to also attract other funds when Indonesia hosts the international conference in December.&nbsp; The use of the funds will be dictated by the Ministerial Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we want to spend more money on fire prevention rather than fire suppression. So, we will have to sit down, together with the technical working group, to decide how best to allocate the money.&nbsp; But, at this point in time, what we need is actually support from the international community before we can really get off the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:&nbsp;</B> May I&nbsp;just ask one last follow-up question?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 768</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what&nbsp;does adopting&nbsp;fire-prone areas mean?&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that even our offer of an aircraft has not been accepted, what kind of flexibility and how effective are the systems that we can render by making this adoption?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the details are not clear yet, but I think the first thing we have to credit the Indonesian government is that they are offering us districts to work with.&nbsp; From the Singapore Government's point of view, we are more than happy to do so, not only working with the local province authority but also bringing in outside help into the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this as a tripartite relationship between Singapore, the Indonesian local authority and support from outside the region, perhaps an international NGO or even some international community organisation that might want to come in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the exact plan, we have cobbled something in Singapore but we have to work with our Indonesian colleagues.&nbsp; But, as I mentioned earlier, there will be two things: one, is really fire prevention, which means working with the local authorities, with farmers and plantation owners on alternative land clearing methods, and what is it that we can do.&nbsp; Secondly, on building capacity internally because, in order for this to be sustained, we cannot have our Singapore team there for the next 20 years, we have to build up local capacity among the farmers and among the regional authorities.&nbsp; What are the capacities needed?&nbsp; We have to define that.&nbsp; Obviously, it will be in terms of ensuring&nbsp;compliance of the land clearing practices that we have agreed upon, making sure that people are trained appropriately to use whatever equipment and machinery that is needed, and so on.&nbsp; So it will be at that level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, I think there are other environmental challenges like the <p align=left>Column: 769</p>peatlands that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Peatlands require agreement on the part of the Indonesian government to build up the water tables so that they rise high enough to be able to douse out the peat fires which are below ground.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, there are already some successful results in Kalimantan and this came from an NGO, working together with a local province in Kalimantan.&nbsp; So, clearly, I think we can also try and replicate some of this&nbsp;in our collaboration at the local level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:HAZE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HAZE:::772--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 769</p><B>HAZE</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Implications on bilateral ties between Singapore and Indonesia--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Implications on bilateral ties between Singapore and Indonesia)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Lee Bee Wah</B> &nbsp;asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what implications does the haze issue have on bilateral ties between Singapore and Indonesia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Indonesia and Singapore are ASEAN partners with a multi-faceted relationship and many common interests. Both of us agree that the haze is a serious transboundary problem with very harmful effects - on Singapore and other countries neighbouring Indonesia, and even more so on Indonesia itself. Hence, there should be no reason for the haze issue to affect relations between Singapore and Indonesia.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House would nonetheless have read in our newspapers about the recent exchange of correspondence between our Ambassador in Jakarta and the Indonesian Industry Minister, following his decision to absent himself from the Joint Steering Committee meeting on 3rd November to discuss the implementation of our Special Economic Zones (SEZ) initiative in Batam, Bintan and Karimun. He was protesting against <p align=left>Column: 770</p>Singapore&rsquo;s statement on the haze problem at the United Nations. We have explained our position to the Indonesian government and the Industry Minister himself, and this has been carried widely in the media.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the haze has affected the health and economic and social activities of millions of people and communities in our region. Beyond our region, the haze has also aggravated the problem of global climate change. World-wide deforestation from burning and cutting alone is responsible for 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp; The fires in 1997-98, the worst on record, contributed 22% (over 700 million metric tons) of the world's carbon dioxide production that year.&nbsp; According to experts at the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) in Bogor, Indonesia's peatlands contain 21% of the earth's land-based carbon. Indonesia's 1997 peatland fires alone had accounted for 60% of the haze. Unless we ensure that there are no more extensive peatland fires in the future, all that carbon will end up as greenhouse gas.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic cost from the annual haze should not be overlooked. According to the ASEAN Secretariat's Environment and Disaster Management Centre, the 1997-98 fires cost regional economies a staggering US$9 billion. As MM Lee pointed out recently, the haze will drive foreign investments away from the entire region, including Indonesia and Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the very serious and far-reaching effects of the haze, it would not have been credible for ASEAN to remain silent on this issue at the United Nations. The members of the UN have a profound interest in this issue because an environmental problem of this scale has global implications.&nbsp; Singapore had strongly urged our ASEAN partners to make a joint statement on the haze. <p align=left>Column: 771</p>Unfortunately, the Indonesian representatives in the UN did not want the haze issue mentioned at all. Hence, we had no choice but to make our own statement. We made a factual statement which acknowledged the commitments and efforts made by Indonesia and other countries. Our statement also aimed to present a comprehensive and balanced appraisal of the issue, including pointing out some of the more problematic issues that remain.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The haze has already afflicted our region for 10 years. The problem has persisted despite efforts by Indonesia and other regional countries. Neither Indonesia nor ASEAN can solve this problem without international support.&nbsp; This is a major environmental problem that we can only overcome with full international support.&nbsp; Moreover, there is urgency to find a speedy and lasting solution as meteorological experts have warned that the haze could be far worse next year if the El Nino weather effect returns. We must take these warnings seriously. That is why Singapore felt compelled to take up the issue at the UN to help mobilise international expertise and resources.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on the Environment (AMME) in Cebu (9-10 November 2006) has endorsed a good and comprehensive Plan of Action, which Minister Yaacob had touched on earlier. This includes a high-level international conference, which would be hosted by Indonesia in the coming weeks to mobilise international support and assistance. I am confident that Singapore and Indonesia will be able to work together as well as with ASEAN and the international community, including UN agencies, to find a lasting solution to this very serious international environmental problem.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is heartening that Indonesian President Susilo Bambang <p align=left>Column: 772</p>Yudhoyono understands the severity of this problem, really a problem he inherited from the past. In April 2006, President Yudhoyono declared war on haze. President Yudhoyono had also told PM Lee last month that he was determined in resolving the haze problem. Last week, President Yudhoyono wrote to update PM Lee on Indonesia's ongoing efforts to tackle the haze issue, including ratification of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. We appreciate President Yudhoyono's efforts.&nbsp; PM Lee has since replied to support President Yudhoyono's efforts and initiatives. I believe the forthcoming APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Hanoi on 18-19 November 2006 and the ASEAN Leaders' Summit on 11-13 December 2006 in Cebu will provide good opportunities for this issue to be discussed further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">        	      		<!--TITLE_NAME:TEMASEK HOLDINGS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:TEMASEK HOLDINGS:::784--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 772</p><B>TEMASEK HOLDINGS</span></B></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Acquisition of Shin Corp of Thailand--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Acquisition of Shin Corp of Thailand)</span></B></div><BR>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. <B>Mr Inderjit Singh</B> asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) if he will give an update to the House on Temasek Holdings' acquisition of Shin Corp of Thailand and the resulting problems with the deal; (b) whether the Government agrees with Temasek acquiring such a large percentage, of around 97%, of the strategic asset of another country; (c) whether Temasek abided by all of Thailand's rules and regulations; and (d) how much money has Temasek lost in the Shin Corp deal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. &nbsp; <B>Mr Alvin Yeo</B> asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance in relation to Temasek's investment in Shin Corporation which has caused a considerable stir in Thailand, whether the Government agrees with such an investment and is satisfied that the necessary due diligence was carried out and no laws were broken in respect of the transaction.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 773</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take Question Nos. 6 and 7 together?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker:</B>&nbsp; Yes.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> <B>&nbsp;</B> Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Alvin Yeo have asked questions concerning Temasek&rsquo;s investment in Shin Corp in Thailand and the Government&rsquo;s position on the acquisition.</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoPlainText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temasek invested in Shin Corp because it assessed that the company offered a good opportunity to participate in Thailand&rsquo;s growing economy for the long term.

Asia represents opportunity.&nbsp; It is not as simple an investment landscape as, for instance, the United States.&nbsp; But Asia is where the returns are highest.&nbsp; We have to expect some bumps along the road.&nbsp; We have got to be willing to take the risks&nbsp;-&nbsp;some patience, a strong heart, occasionally your heart skips a beat -&nbsp;but&nbsp;that is how we will achieve good long-term returns on our reserves, which&nbsp;is in the interest of Singaporeans.&nbsp; If the Government starts intervening, influencing or setting detailed guidelines, it will ultimately backfire.&nbsp; Because once it is seen that the Government is involved in the investment decision-making process, then every transaction that goes wrong, and there will be transactions over time that will go wrong in&nbsp;a large investment portfolio, will backfire on us, and it will backfire on Temasek as well.&nbsp; So I&nbsp;rather we keep this simple and clean.&nbsp; We appoint the board, subject to the approval of the Elected President.&nbsp; We change the board if the board is under-performing over time.&nbsp; The board ensures that the <p align=left>Column: 777</p>management is accountable for performance and the various subsidiary companies are also accountable for performance.&nbsp; And we expect good long-term returns from Temasek.&nbsp;

It is not an unviable strategy.&nbsp; But it is unfortunately a low return strategy.&nbsp; We have got to maintain a diversified portfolio. But we have also got to be willing to take significant risks because that is how significant returns will be obtained&nbsp;in our Government portfolio.&nbsp; There is a difference between Temasek and GIC because&nbsp;GIC is involved primarily in the public markets which tend to be liquid markets.&nbsp; Temasek has a larger portfolio of what we might call private equity-like investments.&nbsp; So the risks will be higher.&nbsp; And we also expect that the returns on the Temasek portfolio will be higher over time.&nbsp; If you look at the past, this has indeed been the case.&nbsp; Temasek has delivered historic returns of about 18% total shareholder value.&nbsp; GIC has delivered good returns.&nbsp; It published&nbsp;its 25-year record a couple of months back which was 8% nominal in Singapore dollar terms, good returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 778</p>reflects the different types of markets they are involved in.&nbsp; GIC - a large portfolio investor in public markets; Temasek - somewhat more concentrated investments, with higher risks.&nbsp; Overall, the Government looks at this as one large portfolio.&nbsp; We too, like Temasek, must have a strong heart and a bit of patience&nbsp;so that we&nbsp;sustain these good returns.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, even in the recovery phase, when we were told that Temasek will be setting up a representative office in Thailand, it was announced that they would be appointing an army general to work in our representative office only to be followed swiftly by a comment from the Crown Prince Office to say that this person is not a suitable person for such a post.&nbsp; I wonder if the Minister could comment on whether the Government is satisfied with the advice that Temasek has received as far as managing the political risk is concerned.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; What we are satisfied&nbsp;with is that Temasek undertook appropriate&nbsp;due diligence to ensure that it is in compliance with Thai laws and regulations, not just the laws, but the regulations of the Stock Exchange of Thailand which was where the transaction was undertaken.&nbsp; They obtained the best advice they could obtain - Thai advisers as well as international advisers.&nbsp; They went in with reputable investors who were able to validate Temasek's own risk assessments.&nbsp; So the process was rigorous.&nbsp; Temasek, to the best of its ability and knowledge, acted in compliance with Thai laws.&nbsp; It was not a reckless investment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her second specific question about Temasek's intention at one point to <p align=left>Column: 779</p>appoint an advisor, I think his name is M R Tongnoi.&nbsp; Temasek had been discussing this prospect with him.&nbsp; From what I understand,&nbsp;the person&nbsp;had some experience,&nbsp;he is the Chairman of an audit company of a reasonably significant listed company.&nbsp;&nbsp;They subsequently terminated the discussions by mutual agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are matters for Temasek to sort out.&nbsp; The Government should not get involved, and should not intrude in these decisions.&nbsp;Specific&nbsp;appointments, advisory appointments,&nbsp;these are matters for the board to sort out.&nbsp; We are not concerned about Temasek's decision in this matter&nbsp;as it was acting in good faith and with due process.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Alvin Yeo (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p align=left>Column: 780</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Second Minister for Finance always talks&nbsp;about "due process".&nbsp; Can he elaborate further as to what due process Temasek Holding has gone through in this particular investment, in particular,&nbsp;the political risk assessment, because there were ground sentiments brewing in Thailand before the decision to purchase?&nbsp; There were some&nbsp;adverse ground reactions to the purchase as well as the political reaction to the then-Prime Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my second question is: whilst the Minister has said that the Government has nothing to do with Temasek because it does not influence nor direct what investments Temasek should do,&nbsp;the fact is that&nbsp;whenever something happens on account of an investment that runs afoul or whatever, the Minister would have to answer, and sometimes the Prime Minister would have to answer some questions on it, it shows that Temasek is no ordinary company just purely on a commercial basis.&nbsp; With that link, does the investment&nbsp;not also take into account&nbsp;the political risk analysis of that&nbsp;investment, especially high-profile investments involving political figures in other countries?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister talked about investment returns of Temasek.&nbsp; May we know whether comparing Temasek's size of investment, in terms of the total capital it has to invest vis-a-vis some other similar investment outfit internationally, how do we fare in terms of investment returns?&nbsp; This is because it is not only in terms of comparing figures but also the size of investment you have which could allow you to have the gain in return.&nbsp; How do we fare on that?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> &nbsp; On the first question on political risk, I am not very keen to provide our own analysis of what the political outlook for Thailand was at the point that Temasek made its investment.&nbsp; Suffice to say that Temasek <p align=left>Column: 781</p>did obtain the best advice possible at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for me to be involved in assessing whether Temasek made its investment based on the right assessment of political risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a clean transaction on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, paid for entirely in Thailand, totally clean, no influence-peddling.&nbsp; So, I am not keen to get involved in a discussion or debate on whether the specifics of assessment of political risks were accurate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his other two questions, which I think are relevant, he pointed out that there is&nbsp;a connection to Government, that&nbsp;this is not just an ordinary commercial company.&nbsp; That is true.&nbsp; Temasek is a Fifth Schedule company and I am confident that the Temasek Board understands that, as a commercial company with a close link to the Singapore Government, it will want to play a constructive long-term role in all the markets that it has invested in.&nbsp; That, indeed, is the philosophy of Temasek.&nbsp; But what we should not do is, as I mentioned earlier, to start vetting transactions and deals on the basis of possible political sensitivities because, once we do that, it will backfire.&nbsp; Once we do that, every subsequent transaction will be read into to see, for example, how much of this is in sync with the foreign policy of the Singapore Government.&nbsp; Should we be holding Temasek back from a transaction?&nbsp; Should we be pushing it even harder to move into certain markets?&nbsp; It becomes hazardous.&nbsp; Temasek would not gain and neither would the Government.&nbsp; So, I would say this quite firmly -&nbsp;our policy of not wanting to intervene, whether it is in political risk assessment or commercial risk assessment, is a sound one and it is in the best interests of both Temasek and the Government.&nbsp; This is how we will be able to sustain this business of earning good long-term returns in fairly risky markets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of size, Temasek has been publishing its figures for a few years <p align=left>Column: 782</p>now.&nbsp; In its last annual review, it published its total assets&nbsp;at S$129 billion, a fairly large size.&nbsp; Investment experts will not necessarily agree, by the way, that being a very large asset manager&nbsp;is always an advantage.&nbsp; There are pluses and minuses, depending on the sector you are in and your investment strategy.&nbsp; Suffice to say that we are satisfied that, compared to other reasonably large investors - there is no investor perfectly comparable to Temasek -&nbsp;including those who are involved in private equity-like&nbsp;transactions, Temasek has been performing well.&nbsp; The 18% return obtained historically has been a good return.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I can tell you that the&nbsp;investments it has made since 2002, when it started investing more actively in Asian markets, have been substantially above the 18% historical return.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh:</B>&nbsp; Sir, what is still not obvious is whether Temasek went into the Shin Corporation deal knowing that it was going to cross the general offer limit.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp;&nbsp;in the process, did Temasek plan to do this or was it&nbsp;accidental, because there are some reports about Temasek acting in concert with other parties which kind of worked around the rules and regulations on acquisitions&nbsp;in Thailand?&nbsp; This is market talk.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister might want to clarify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have read some reports that the Thai government may revoke some of the licences, particularly the telco licence that Shin Corporation owns, in which case, Shin Corp&nbsp;may become a lot less valuable.&nbsp; In that case, in making this acquisition, did Temasek safeguard itself by having a process of being able to recover its investment from the selling shareholders?</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp; On Mr Inderjit Singh's first question,&nbsp;on the takeover, Temasek understood full well <p align=left>Column: 783</p>the regulations of the Stock Exchange of Thailand and fully expected to have to make a general share offer.&nbsp; The offer was very well received, perhaps better received than most people expected, so that the eventual share ownership of the consortium as a whole went up to 96%.&nbsp; But it fully expected that it was going to have to make a general offer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of licences, I would rather not speculate on these rumours that have been floating around, whether&nbsp;on AIS or ITV or&nbsp;any other&nbsp;subsidiaries of the Shin Group.&nbsp; Our basic posture should be that, from time to time, there will be surprises wherever we are&nbsp;investing.&nbsp; There may&nbsp;be regulatory changes.&nbsp; In fact, the Thai government is now reviewing the Foreign Business Act which governs all foreign investments in Thailand.&nbsp; And we have to make sure we comply with the laws and regulations at every point in time.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

<B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the Lift Upgrading Programme aims to bring 100% lift access to HDB blocks built before 1990 which do not have the lift stopping on every floor.&nbsp; As lift upgrading can be extremely costly for some types of blocks, we introduced a cost cap of $30,000 per benefiting unit to ensure that the LUP is carried out in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those blocks which currently exceed the cost cap, HDB has been working to bring&nbsp;down the cost through new lift technologies and procurement methods.&nbsp; My Minister informed Members at the Committee of Supply this year that an additional 250 previously-ineligible blocks had become eligible for the LUP.&nbsp; This was the result of HDB's introduction of new technologies, such as machine-roomless lifts (MRLs) and alternative materials for lift shaft cladding, as well as new methods of procurement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, HDB has explored other lift solutions for the HDB blocks that still exceeded the LUP cost cap.&nbsp; I am happy to inform Members that there has been further progress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB will soon introduce new lift solutions, such as use of shaftless lifts, which&nbsp;are similar to 'bubble lifts' found in commercial complexes, and smaller types of lifts that are suitable for low-rise blocks.&nbsp; In addition, for blocks with internal voids which were previously expensive to retrofit with lifts due to the extensive structural works required, HDB <p align=left>Column: 789</p>has found a more cost-effective method of providing lift upgrading by reconfiguring the lift access to flats located within such blocks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these new lift solutions, another 520 blocks&nbsp;will now be eligible for lift upgrading.&nbsp; As the track record has suggested, HDB will continue relentlessly to look for ways to bring down the&nbsp;costs further for&nbsp;the remaining blocks that still exceed the cost cap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the question posed by&nbsp;Ms Lee Bee Wah, I am confident that HDB will manage to find cost-effective solutions for these flats.&nbsp; And because&nbsp;we expect more of these remaining blocks to qualify for LUP, it is premature at this point in time to advise any residents that their flats are currently not eligible for LUP.&nbsp; For residents who do need to move to a flat located on a lift landing floor urgently, HDB can assist them under the "Mutual Exchange of Flats" scheme or to look for another flat that meets their needs.</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In the elections, what the PAP candidate said was, "I will approach the Government, specifically the Minister for National Development, with a certain package for my residents.&nbsp; And if I am elected, I will fulfil that promise."&nbsp;

Mr Low is even better, instead of asking for $100 million, now he says his bill is actually $140 million.&nbsp; He has a bill, but he forgets that there are other parts to it&nbsp;- that the bill comes with a cost, that it involves the Government having&nbsp;to undertake certain policies.&nbsp; If we undertake all those policies,&nbsp;we&nbsp;generate&nbsp;surpluses, then we are able to distribute some of these surpluses in the form of upgrading programmes, for example.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What if we were to&nbsp;follow the Workers' Party's policies and, say, instead of having a social security system based on CPF, housing and the 3Ms, we go for the "unconditional permanent needs-based social security net"?&nbsp; That is what the Opposition is advocating, is it not?&nbsp; That is the Workers' Party's platform.&nbsp; That is the Opposition's platform, and, if we go for that, then that is where the money is going to.&nbsp; We are not going to have enough money for upgrading.&nbsp; We are not going to have enough money for education,&nbsp;healthcare and so on.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was what my Minister of State was putting across just now that, when the constituents&nbsp;vote for the PAP candidate, they are not just voting for the goodies, they are not just voting for that part of the package, they are also voting for all the other policies that come together with the package - the prudent fiscal policies, the taxation policy,&nbsp;the low direct taxes, low GST.&nbsp; That is what they are voting for.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mr Chiam and Mr Low&nbsp;come to the House with a bill and say, "Why don't you give me this money since you have promised it?", surely, that is being very naive, is it not?&nbsp;&nbsp;They are saying to the Government, "Here is my bill for the upgrading, but I don't support all your other policies.&nbsp; You go and deal with the people.&nbsp; You go and sell your other <p align=left>Column: 797</p>policies, difficult though that may be.&nbsp; I am only going for the good part.&nbsp; I am going to advocate "unconditional permanent needs-based welfare", because that is popular.&nbsp;

Is that not what the Member for Potong Pasir said?&nbsp; I heard him say very clearly, "I do not need the package", and that was before the election.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the election, he now says, "Please give me the package."</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Member for Potong Pasir should tell us how he is going to implement his policies, how he is going to implement his promise to the people of Potong Pasir, and not just to the 55% who voted for him but also to the rest.&nbsp;

Premiums are low, at $30 per year.&nbsp; Early subscription will prevent future regrets as MediShield has to exclude&nbsp;pre-existing illnesses.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a small group of the uninsured&nbsp;comprises elderly Singaporeans above the age of 75.&nbsp; They make up 9%.&nbsp; Their exclusion may not be by choice, as MediShield has a maximum coverage age but we are taking steps to improve this.&nbsp; This year, we raised it from 80 to 85 years old.&nbsp; We will continue to review the maximum coverage age, although we have to recognise that the benefits of risk pooling diminish for very old age groups.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the rest of the uninsured fall between the age of 21 and 75.&nbsp; They make up 35% of the uninsured.&nbsp; This is a heterogeneous group who opt out for various different reasons.&nbsp; Some are well-covered by their employers; others may not feel vulnerable.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 802</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But like Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, I have a special concern about the housewives who are not insured.&nbsp; They and their husbands should sign them on.&nbsp; There are many opportunities for that.&nbsp; If they have worked before, they should have enough Medisave funds to pay MediShield premiums for many years.&nbsp; For those with insufficient Medisave funds, they can tap their husbands&rsquo; or children&rsquo;s Medisave funds to pay for continued MediShield coverage.&nbsp; For those who have never worked, they would have been automatically signed on to MediShield at the point of marriage registration, using the husbands&rsquo; Medisave funds to pay for their MediShield coverage.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry will continue to remind all Singaporeans, through regular publicity, to join MediShield early and to stay insured.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">3.00 pm</p></div></span>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

[Mdm Halimah Yacob].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 803</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question again proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join in the debate. I support the motion in thanking the President for his Address.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has seen significant changes and events over the past few years, many of which were unexpected. We managed to overcome a number of major problems since 1997: economic downturns, the threat of&nbsp;racial and religious polarisation, if not conflict, following the 911 incident, SARS and the Avian flu. With everyone working together, we managed these difficult times and have emerged stronger today. Our economy is doing well, and job creation is expected to reach another record high this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, the only constant we can expect is change. The President, in his Address, has highlighted four key changes affecting Singapore: (a) globalisation bringing shifts to the economy; (b) ageing society; (c) generational changes; and (d) the need for a new social and political compact. These changes, if not carefully managed, can be unsettling and even create friction in society and amongst Singaporeans. Let me touch on some potential hotspots which will need greater attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the widening income gap. Globalisation brings opportunities for the higher-skilled workers, but the lower-skilled face downward wage pressures and higher risk of structural unemployment. In the last few years, the income gap has widened. The Gini coefficient, which measures inequality of income distribution, has risen from 0.490 in 2000 to 0.522 in 2005.&nbsp; This is not unique to Singapore, but we must acknowledge that the widening income disparity is a looming issue which can <p align=left>Column: 804</p>cause social friction between the haves and have-nots if it is not properly tackled. The Government has already taken steps last year to help the lower-income group through the Workfare Bonus and other recommendations of the Ministerial Committee on Low Wage Workers. I am glad that, as announced by PM and Ministers, the Government will do more to help those who have difficulty coping, so that no one will be left behind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in extending the helping hand to the needy, we must always emphasise three fundamental values: personal responsibility, hard work and self-reliance. It must help people to level up and seize opportunities for self improvement. Workfare is thus a very important approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all good things, it must have the strong support, in this case, financial support and to ensure that&nbsp;resources&nbsp;that&nbsp;are needed to help the poor and the needy will be there to&nbsp;help them.&nbsp; The Prime Minister yesterday announced the need to increase GST by up to 2%.&nbsp; I think Singaporeans are bracing for that but, more importantly,&nbsp;Singaporeans are waiting for the GST offset package to be announced in July.&nbsp; Like all Singaporeans, I do hope that the offset package will be helpful enough to Singaporeans, particularly those who are needy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, amidst dealing with the challenges ahead, we must continue to be mindful of the need to maintain our racial and religious harmony. Members may recall the publication of the Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in Europe. That incident caused racial and religious tensions to soar and even sparked off protests and violence in some countries. In Singapore, we were able to sit down and discuss&nbsp;issues and deal with them peacefully due to our strong racial and religious relations and mutual understanding.&nbsp; However, it was a good lesson on how an insensitive act could stir <p align=left>Column: 805</p>things up and, if not managed carefully, it could spiral out of control. Maintaining an environment of mutual understanding and tolerance of differences thus remains fundamental to ensuring Singapore&rsquo;s continued social harmony and stability.&nbsp; We must thank our community and religious leaders for having guided their communities towards mutual understanding and tolerance, and help them to strengthen the foundation further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, managing young and old workers. In the 60s and 70s, as a young nation, one of Singapore&rsquo;s value propositions to investors was our relatively young workforce. Today, with an ageing resident population, our workforce is also ageing. About one in three workers is expected to be above the age of 50 in 10 years&rsquo; time, compared to around one in four today. This means that we will have a much more age diverse workforce, with younger and older workers working together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are benefits from having an age diverse workforce, as younger and older workers have different strengths that employers can tap on. However, just as some families face problems of generation gaps between the young and old, potentially there could also be similar frictions between younger and older workers at the workplace. I recently visited Japan&nbsp;to study the law for the re-employment of older workers, and met some unionists there. They told me that this is one of the workplace issues that they have to grapple with as their workforce ages. I suggest that the Government, employers and HR professionals as well as unionists look into the workplace challenge of managing age diversity and address any potential issues before they affect workplace performance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, influx of foreign workers. With an ageing population and not having enough babies to replace it, we need <p align=left>Column: 806</p>foreign workers to augment our workforce to meet labour demands of our economy. However, some Singaporeans continue to have reservations over the open-door policy to attract foreign talent. They are concerned that the foreigners will deprive Singaporeans of jobs. Recently some residents in Jurong East had complained about empty flats being rented out to foreigners. Others had also expressed concern over foreign worker dormitories being built near their homes.&nbsp; As we need more foreign workers to meet the needs of growing industries, we will have to build more foreign worker dormitories.&nbsp; So we will have to manage this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a doubt, we will need foreign workers in our workforce to create more jobs for Singaporeans. However, the challenge here is for the Government to strike an appropriate balance between meeting the economic need of workers and putting in place the control measures to ensure that the foreign workers are deployed in the right numbers, in the right places and with the right skills. At the same time,&nbsp;we need to allay the fears of Singaporeans. The key safeguard for Singaporeans is not in protecting jobs for locals, as this may not mean more jobs for Singaporeans if there is a skills mismatch. Protecting jobs could ultimately also affect the competitiveness of our companies and their ability to grow and create more jobs. Instead, the key safeguard for Singaporeans is to continue to grow the economic pie and create more jobs for locals to take up. We also need to work on removing the suspicions towards foreigners by building up a better mutual understanding between locals and foreigners. Otherwise, the fears and concerns will infest and create rifts, tensions and misunderstanding, which will disrupt social harmony. Here, we can encourage grassroots leaders to work with residents to ensure that this understanding of the need for foreign workers and working with foreign <p align=left>Column: 807</p>workers can be driven at the grassroots and community levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, relationship between employers and workers. Globalisation has created a new business environment - one which requires companies to face competitive and rapidly changing markets. To survive in the new economy, companies need flexibility and innovation. Some will restructure their organisation or reduce costs to keep pace with the changes. However, workers ask for job security and fairness in treatment and reward.&nbsp; As workers feel insecure, they are also less engaged, resulting in lower productivity and quality. Therein lies the dilemma between company&rsquo;s needs and the workers&rsquo; needs, between flexibility and security, and between security and the ability of workers to adapt and innovate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the tension and with the view of enhancing workers&rsquo; productivity, employers will need to place greater importance on managing their relationship with their workers, share with them information on company's performance, tap on their ideas and improve the workplace environment and safety. Workers, on the other hand, would also need to be flexible and open to change. Here lies the importance of tripartism. With our strong tripartite relationship and continued support from the Government, employers and unions, I am confident that we can manage the dilemmas and workplace issues, and continue to maintain a peaceful industrial environment. The key point is, we must help strengthen further this three-party partnership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA is a good example. Members may recall that several years ago, PSA needed to retrench workers and adjust wages to stay competitive. It was a very difficult period faced by the management and the union, but with strong labour <p align=left>Column: 808</p>relations, they worked together to tide through. Today, it is a very different picture. I read in the <I>Sunday Times</I> last weekend that PSA had done well and rewarded the staff generously. The Singapore Port Workers' Union (SPWU), where I had the privilege of serving as Executive Secretary some years back, is now getting thanks and a pat on the back from its members and PSA workers, quite unlike the brunt of workers&rsquo; unhappiness that it had to bear during those difficult times.&nbsp; Just last weekend, I attended the 60th anniversary of the SPWU and I saw the mood was different, compared to about four or five years ago.&nbsp; There, I saw unionists, members of the union as well as management staff and other union leaders got together in a very friendly atmosphere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I have outlined five potential hotspots in our society as we venture into the new future. The key to addressing the various differences and potential frictions and conflicts in our society is to facilitate mutual understanding and tolerance among the different groups of people, and the Government will need to play a major role here. Our strong tripartite partnership is a workable <I>modus operandi</I> that can be adapted to address other differences and reaching win-win for all. I would like to suggest that we use this approach in all our endeavours to improve the quality of life for Singaporeans, whether it is on specific needs of Singaporeans or on the needs of people on the ground for better facilities and services, which&nbsp; means that everyone in Singapore will have a role to play in ensuring that the environment they live in and&nbsp;the relationships they establish can be improved further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me continue my speech in Malay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2006/20061114/20061114VS_135828.pdf"">Appendix A</a> *.</I> ] Like other Singaporeans, Malays have enjoyed great <p align=left>Column: 809</p>benefit from the development and stability of Singapore.&nbsp; The challenges faced by Malays in Singapore are similar to those that are faced by other communities, whether it is&nbsp;a result of the effects of globalisation or the relationship with employers or problems at work.&nbsp; The challenges faced by the Malay community as workers and as Singaporeans are the same as others.&nbsp; Malays can and should be confident of their opportunities to progress in future based on the progress that they have achieved so far, whether in terms of education, employment, home ownership&nbsp;or in other social aspects.&nbsp; The Malay community, however, also has its own problems, just like other communities here. However, other than being able to benefit from the various programmes and assistance offered at national level, whether by community organisations or the Government, Malays also benefit from various self-help programmes and efforts within the community itself.&nbsp; I believe this will bring a very good effect to the community because it improves their confidence and self-esteem as they are able to assist each other or assist those who are facing&nbsp;problems and difficulties.&nbsp; This, I think, is not a small matter because it shows the desire to progress, the desire to improve ourselves based on the principles and values that we hold high, which&nbsp;are hard work,&nbsp;responsibility for our own welfare and&nbsp;self-reliance.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the community leadership level, I am proud that the Malay community leadership has advanced far in their effort to assist the community to help them progress, particularly in facing social problems and enhancing their progress in education.&nbsp; For the past number of years, the Malay community leadership has worked together with the Malay political leadership in the People's Action Party to move self-help efforts in four main areas - improving educational achievement, encouraging skills upgrading and work assistance, strengthening family relationships so that the family has a strong <p align=left>Column: 810</p>foundation to ensure that children grow up healthy and active and benefit from all the opportunities in Singapore, and, fourthly, to overcome social problems.&nbsp; As I said earlier, self-help efforts which were initiated together with Malay community leaders, Malay organisations and the Malay political leadership have been a source of strength and self-confidence for me and the Malay community in general because this shows an inner effort within the Malay community to progress together, taking advantage of the opportunities that exist in Singapore.&nbsp; This also helps Singapore to progress&nbsp;because, in line with other communities, the Malay community also contributes to the national and community development of Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think in many aspects, the less skilled, less educated within the community need more help.&nbsp; In this respect, the Malay community will always rely on the support, understanding, assistance from the Government and also the other communities so that, together from within the community itself and also in cooperation with the other communities, the Malay community will also be able to assist in enhancing the progress and development of Singapore.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I would like to conclude by saying that what we have achieved so far in overcoming our problems at the national level, overcoming internal problems within certain communities, including the Malay community, give us a sense of satisfaction because this further improves our community strength in overcoming new problems.&nbsp; This will of course further strengthen our foundation to achieve continuous progress in future.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 903-906.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand among the ranks of those who have risen in support of the motion to thank the President for his Address at the <p align=left>Column: 811</p>Opening of the 11th Parliament.&nbsp; The President has presented the framework in which our Government will tackle the various challenges confronting us and I am pleased that, among other things, we will be committing more resources and efforts to help especially the elderly and the disabled, together with the low-income group.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am happy to hear also from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's address to this House yesterday, outlining the new social measures to help the lower and middle-income earners, in particular to include more help in education and more regular Workfare Bonuses within reach of the poor.&nbsp; I am sure the middle-income earners are also pleased, as they have always been in the sandwich group, that attention and care&nbsp;are given to this group as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the idea that we must do as much as we can to help the lower-income move up the economic ladder, particularly through assistance in education rather than handouts.&nbsp; Nothing beats&nbsp;a good education and employment, if we want to help raise the household income and free a family from the malignant effects of abject poverty. The curative effects of education and regular work are far more effective in getting the intended results.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would like to voice my concern with regard to the proposed increase in GST tax. Our economy is just beginning to breathe a little easy and many workers in the lower wage group are beginning to enjoy the blue sky.&nbsp; There are some whose visions are still shrouded by hazy conditions.&nbsp; Many of these workers with monthly wages hovering at $1,500 and below are still trying to get a helicopter ride to safety.&nbsp; For this group, efforts must be made to understand their needs, and&nbsp;the new <p align=left>Column: 812</p>package of social measures&nbsp;to be reviewed during the next Budget debate must be able to lift them from the tailspin of the intended increase of GST.&nbsp; I urge the Government to carefully review and&nbsp;weigh the impact of its package on the lower and middle-income group;&nbsp;also, that the delivery must be accurate, as the doctor making a surgical incision on a patient to give him long-term relief from his pain and suffering.&nbsp; This would enable them to catch the wind and stay on course.&nbsp; Better still, if they fly above the storming clouds and, at worst, be exposed to only minor short-term turbulence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may also make reference to a recent speech by PM Lee Hsien Loong when he addressed the 7th Asian-European Editors' Forum on&nbsp;6th October.&nbsp; One of the points mentioned was the changing global environment and how political leaders must be able to respond creatively.&nbsp; Each country, including Singapore, would have to make changes in its own way, with its own balance, taking into account its unique circumstances.&nbsp; He also spoke of the opening up of our society to encourage frank debate and diverse views.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to hear PM's views and I hope it permeates down to the other policy makers.&nbsp; We should continually review old policies and make bold revisions if it is for the better of our society.&nbsp; In the last five years, much has been done in education,&nbsp;health and&nbsp;CPF.&nbsp; I am glad for that.&nbsp; I would like to congratulate two Ministers - Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Mr Khaw Boon Wan - for such great work done within the span of five years.&nbsp; In education, we have tackled important issues so that our children are happier&nbsp;in schools and outside schools, as they no longer belabour.&nbsp; Many parents, including myself,&nbsp;are indeed grateful that the sacred cow of streaming had been slaughtered and not just sent to the veterinarian.&nbsp; For health, <p align=left>Column: 813</p>we have brought comfort to our residents with the review of the 3Ms, especially so for the coverage of&nbsp;MediShield and its payout.&nbsp; It is now not so frightening to be in a hospital, and residents will not need to suffer another shock when the bills are subsequently received.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this 11th Parliament, I sincerely hope to see more changes being made to the following areas of transport, housing and our paid broadcast media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our public transport system.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that we could look deeper into our public transport system, especially with regard to the creation of a healthier competitive environment.&nbsp; I feel that not enough is done to look deeper into our public transport system though the Minister for Transport has somewhat cleverly deflected the rising tide of calls for action when he made public the review that his Ministry was going into.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My issue is competition or, more rightly, the lack of it in our public transport.&nbsp; The strength of any business is its ability to survive competition.&nbsp; Competition challenges the whole organisation from the top management to the shop floor to be efficient and responsive to&nbsp;market needs.&nbsp; In Singapore, we have many examples of healthy competition which have benefited both the industry and&nbsp;consumers.&nbsp; Take McDonald's or KFC, they all compete on equal footing.&nbsp; There is no such thing as private turf, gated community, or safe haven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in our public transport sector, the rules of engagement are somewhat different.&nbsp; There are special flight paths where each of the operators carves out one sector.&nbsp; This is not competition.&nbsp; This is not serving the best interest of the community.&nbsp; I know in the Budget debate we were told that because of the large commitment of public funds, the <p align=left>Column: 814</p>Government would not want to see a duplication of services.&nbsp; I feel that it is precisely because of this large commitment of public funds, the public deserves a good competition from these companies so that they can get the best services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, these transport operators are not willing to overlap or cross each other's routes.&nbsp; Presently, the transport system for nearby estates is not only time consuming but also costly, especially when one crosses between the two transport operators,&nbsp;for example, between Upper Serangoon and Upper Paya Lebar estates.&nbsp; If you are&nbsp;in Upper Serangoon area and heading for Boundary Road, you would have to change buses as most of the buses would bring you to Serangoon or Hougang Central bus or train interchange, instead of to the Boundary Road area.&nbsp; There are too many transfers.&nbsp; For some, it means a six-bus or train rides daily.&nbsp; The cost of transportation is high as the transport fares are geared towards longer distance and from the same company.&nbsp; Can we then not have free feeder or shuttle bus services?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, let us see what competition can bring to the people.&nbsp; Look at the shopping malls.&nbsp; They are providing free shuttle bus services.&nbsp; If shopping centres can provide free shuttle bus services, why not our transport operators?&nbsp; I know "free" is a four-letter word. But it is also not a dirty word.&nbsp; I know our Government is sensitive to providing anything for free.&nbsp; However, these transport operators are not the Government.&nbsp; They are commercial private sector entities.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the shopping malls can do it, then why not the transport companies?&nbsp; The answer is lack of competition.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Transport Ministry to do away with the existing rules which have derailed the true spirit of competition.&nbsp; Do <p align=left>Column: 815</p>more for the commuters.&nbsp; Do more than just aesthetic changes.&nbsp; The ultimate goal should be how to get efficiency, not only in terms of operation, but in the context of creating savings for commuters.&nbsp; Each time, there is a route rationalisation exercise, the commuters&nbsp;are left at the losing end.&nbsp; They end up having a longer travel time and having to spend more on fares, as&nbsp;highlighted in an article in the&nbsp;<I>Sunday Plus</I> 20th July issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year, commuters have to hold their breath as these bus operators seek for upward revision in fare prices.&nbsp; Sir, taking it in&nbsp;isolation, 1 to 3-cent fare hike last October is not a big issue.&nbsp; But when you take the accordion effect, then&nbsp;the rise becomes like a virus, embedded in the computer system and taking up the memory space and slowing down your computer time, this is serious.&nbsp; For the needy,&nbsp;$1 a month is&nbsp;$1 less food on the table.&nbsp; And, as if to show remorse for their actions, the operators come up with all sorts of schemes to try and mitigate their cases.&nbsp; Then why ask for a fare hike in the first place?&nbsp; Why must the poor go through the entire form filling and be subjected to scrutiny of their savings or&nbsp;earnings to get travel discount?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These operations make profits but they said the money is not from the same operation.&nbsp; So do we deal with a transport company or a department rendering domestic services only, and that the account has to be isolated from its other operations overseas?&nbsp; Is it not because of the special opportunity granted locally that is given to them that they are able to source for their business overseas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what is the motivation behind the public transport service?&nbsp; Is it to serve the public or&nbsp;the shareholders?&nbsp; As there is a&nbsp;biblical saying, which I would like to borrow and rephrase it, you cannot serve two masters at the same time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Sir, in the last few years of economic doldrums and structural unemployment, when people's salaries had been cut, we still had fare increases.&nbsp; I do not see under what situation&nbsp;there can&nbsp;be a case when the fare would not increase.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me use an example of how a local cooperative handled the situation of an egg supply shortage.&nbsp; Here I would like to declare my interest as an employee of that local cooperative, ie, NTUC Fairprice.&nbsp; When there was a ban on the import of eggs from Malaysia due to avian flu, supply from Australia was sought immediately and the eggs were sold to&nbsp;consumers at the lowest price among all retailers.&nbsp; The cooperative could have increased prices by a few cents more for each egg as it is one of the main egg retailers.&nbsp; But it did not.&nbsp; Moreover, the cooperative was the first to reduce the price of eggs when the ban was lifted and normal supply resumed.&nbsp; Will a private transport company embrace the social mission and serve the public interest role?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To wrap up this section, let me visit this question:&nbsp;Why are people not taking to public transport?&nbsp; Would the transport companies be able to achieve the service standards as set out recently by LTA to improve overcrowding and long delays - loud calls from the commuters for a long, long time?&nbsp; Any private company would argue that the higher service standards you demand, the more it will cost the commuters.&nbsp; We do not want a situation where&nbsp;the cost goes&nbsp;up in view of the demand for higher service standards from <p align=left>Column: 817</p>the operators.&nbsp; Price affordability must still be the key factor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I will address my next concern in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In Mandarin)</I>:<I>&nbsp;</I>[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2006/20061114/20061114VS_152621.pdf"">Appendix A</a> *.</I>]<I>&nbsp;</I> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to talk about our public housing policy.&nbsp; Our public housing policy seems to be affected by the public transport policy.&nbsp; Prices for public housing are rising all the time.&nbsp; The HDB has no objection to residents upgrading to bigger units, but when they have financial problems, not being able to pay for their instalments and&nbsp;utilities bills, and wanting to downgrade to smaller flats, HDB would not allow them to apply for concessionary loans, and it says each case will be considered on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the resident applied for his flat, his affordability was based on his financial situation at that time.&nbsp; But over the years, circumstances could have changed.&nbsp; His financial position could be different.&nbsp; He could have been retrenched, downgraded to jobs with a lower income, or suffered from ill health.&nbsp; Anything can happen.&nbsp; Then, he finds that he can no longer afford the flat that he is occupying, as he is unable to service the loan that he had taken in his better days.&nbsp; He has no choice but to downgrade to a smaller unit.&nbsp; But he runs into difficulty with HDB when he is refused a concessionary loan.&nbsp; I would ask the Ministry of National Development to review this policy so that home owners would have an option of downgrading to a smaller flat with a HDB loan.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lee Yi Shyan mentioned last week that we should provide more education and skills upgrading opportunities for our workers to enhance their employability.&nbsp; In other words, in our job, we have to meet with a lot of changes and the circumstances will change and our financial situation will also change.&nbsp; From <p align=left>Column: 818</p>the time we were married at 30 years old to the time we retire at 62, many things have changed in our life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main policies of the Ministry of National Development is for everyone to own his own home, and it provides&nbsp;security for&nbsp;his old age.&nbsp; So, if this is your property, then you should be able to sell it and realise it for cash so that you do not become a burden to others.&nbsp; We should adjust our policy to take into consideration the affordability of the people and their changing circumstances.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, we have a Government that is ready to help the people to create wealth.&nbsp; But sometimes we should allow the people to exercise their own options and to choose the lifestyle that they would like to have, so that they do not have to worry so much about the cost of living.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Minister mentioned last Friday that senior citizens can sell their bigger flats to move to the studio apartments.&nbsp; But they should still be able to afford it before they can think of buying these studio apartments.&nbsp; I think it is fairer if we allow our people to sell their property so that they can get cash for their living expenses.&nbsp; They have such a need.&nbsp; So I think we should allow them to downgrade and still be entitled to a HDB loan.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have three children.&nbsp; If they are unable to get into the local universities and they want to go overseas for further studies, I would have to pay for all their overseas expenses.&nbsp; According to my own estimation, my income will not be increased substantially in the foreseeable future, and there is even a possibility that my income will be reduced, so by the age of 55, I may have to change my lifestyle.&nbsp; So, we need to look after the interests of our senior citizens.&nbsp; I know that the Minister had reiterated that his Ministry will provide the studio apartments for the elderly citizens, but I think we need to do more and better for them.&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 819</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I met an officer in charge of public housing in Hong Kong.&nbsp; He told me that the Hong Kong government is building apartments for its senior citizens.&nbsp; Anyone who has reached the age of 60 will be entitled to apply for these apartments.&nbsp; These apartments are comparable to our studio apartments for the elderly.&nbsp; A lot of Hong Kong senior citizens are living in these apartments provided by the government.&nbsp; But in Singapore, only 0.26% of our senior citizens are living in these studio apartments and now we have only 1,030 units.&nbsp; Should we not provide more such apartments for our senior citizens?<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, the Prime Minister gave us the projection of our population profile by the year 2020.&nbsp; In a few years' time, we would have to feel the pressure of an ageing population when we have more and more people above the age of 65.&nbsp; Recently, in Bishan Street 11, a development known as Golden Jasmine was launched.&nbsp; There were 176 units altogether, but during the soft launch, more than a thousand applications were received.&nbsp; We have not been able to meet the demand.&nbsp; In five or 10 years' time, the demand will be even greater.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry of National Development will have more innovative ideas and breakthroughs so that they could build more flats for our senior citizens and also allow our lower income people the choice of the flat that they can afford.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In English)</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I now come to the FIFA&nbsp;World Cup 2006.&nbsp; I know that this event is over.&nbsp; But it is really concerning paid broadcast media and sports.&nbsp; There are many major sporting events that will be coming on-stream.&nbsp; The European Cup and the Beijing Olympics are just two.&nbsp; I hope the Government will do something about live broadcasts so that we do not repeat the debacle during the World Cup 2006.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 820</p>Except for the opening match and the final matches for the first, second and third placings, it is regrettable that our national television failed to broadcast this once-in-four-year event to our people on the free channels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in Cairns, Australia, when the FIFA soccer matches were going on. &nbsp;I could tune in any time of the day.&nbsp; When I was back in Singapore, I had withdrawal symptoms and really had to insist that&nbsp;my husband&nbsp;subscribe to the paid channels.&nbsp; But how many Singaporeans can afford that?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the national television stations of other countries, such as Malaysia, Indonesia and even Kosovo, were able to provide&nbsp;the matches to their public for free.&nbsp; We want to make our country a sporting nation.&nbsp; We know soccer has a pull among the local people and it is one of the best platforms for bonding the masses.&nbsp; Yet we threw away this opportunity.&nbsp; Do we have to again be so commercialised in our considerations, even at the expense of bonding the people together?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the points I have made on transport and public housing are but some of the issues tossed up by the heartlanders and others in Aljunied GRC.&nbsp; We really need to strike a right balance when making policies so that the needs of the people and the state are adequately addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the motion.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We went from Sendai to Matsushima facing&nbsp;the Pacific coast.&nbsp; In between, we crossed the mountain range to the western side of Honshu, spending some time in the mountains, hiking and <p align=left>Column: 821</p>visiting ancient temples.&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, that was how I geared up for the 11th Parliament.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We re-traced a section of a long journey made by Matsuo Basho&nbsp;over 300 years ago.&nbsp; Basho was a Zen practitioner and one of the most popular poets in Japan.&nbsp; He left behind many poems or <I>haiku</I>, and is well-loved by the Japanese.&nbsp; He is the&nbsp;equivalent of Li Bai in Japan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Yamadera, which is a village in Yamagata Prefecture, among the temples and mountains, we paused at where Basho wrote his famous <I>haiku</I>, in English translation:<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Silence<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penetrates the rocks &ndash;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;cry of the cicada"<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was grateful for the opportunity to savour that wonderful moment when Basho, the rocks and the cicada all melted into one.&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, after 50 speeches, I am sure you&nbsp;wish for such a moment of tranquility in this Chamber, too!&nbsp; But please hear me out first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese villages and towns that we explored are no longer like what Basho experienced.&nbsp; The population has grown and, in particular, it has aged considerably.&nbsp; In the villages, the old visibly outnumber the young.&nbsp; Conversation topics are distinctly elderly: "How is your knee?&nbsp; Does it still hurt?"; "Are you sure&nbsp;that <I>mochi</I> is good&nbsp; for you?&nbsp; Is it not too sticky for your dentures?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Active ageing</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During those few days, I had a glimpse of what Singapore may be like in the future when our population would be as elderly as Japan is today.&nbsp; Though on holiday, I asked my Japanese friends to arrange for us to visit a nursing home and we did.&nbsp; Very high standard,&nbsp;top-of-the-<p align=left>Column: 822</p>range, very good facilities,&nbsp;with happy residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a&nbsp;typical hospital administrator, I&nbsp;asked how long do the residents stay.&nbsp; He said, "Well, until death do us part."&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was buzzing with activities, both indoors and outdoors, day and night.&nbsp; Of course, it comes with a high price tag.&nbsp; The residents co-pay about 10% of cost, with the rest paid for&nbsp;by long-term insurance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the home for&nbsp;the admission criteria because, as far as we could see,&nbsp;the residents did not look sickly or frail at all.&nbsp; They said that all applicants were interviewed.&nbsp; The main criterion is that their children were unable to care for them at home.&nbsp; But I said that would surely qualify practically everyone.&nbsp; In a typical Japanese way, they answered "no", but I think&nbsp;they meant "yes".&nbsp; There is, therefore, a very long waiting list.&nbsp; But all this while, demand was still manageable because most Japanese consider it shameful to put their parents in nursing homes.&nbsp; But my Japanese friends told me that, unfortunately, that attitude is eroding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commented that the long-term funding prospects for such a model must be poor.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They confirmed that this is in fact&nbsp;their biggest challenge going forward.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Japan's shrinking birth rate does not help and the Japanese attitude against immigration further compounds their problem.&nbsp; But the Japanese are actively thinking out solutions to their&nbsp;demographic trend, and they are trying out various experiments, pilots and different approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have not got all the answers but some of their approaches offer useful reference for us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the elderly in Japan work longer years.&nbsp; You see them in their late 60s, the women, many hunched up because of osteoporosis, manning counters, sweeping floors, cleaning spas, directing <p align=left>Column: 823</p>traffic, ushering tourists.&nbsp; They work, keep busy, stay active both physically and economically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, their elderly are well-represented among the self-employed, running small businesses, like mom-and-pop shops, ramen stalls.&nbsp; They keep the cost of living low for the consumers, while allowing the elderly themselves to make a living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, shops and businesses are responsive to the needs of the elderly clientele.&nbsp; The mini-marts' items reflect elderly needs, while the stores have wide corridors for wheel-chairs and the price tags are large in font size, really huge ones. I asked them, "Why so?"&nbsp; They said that sometimes for "8", they thought it is "3" and they&nbsp;got into trouble at the counter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, there is an active programme to develop devices and systems to allow the elderly to be home alone, while giving peace of mind to the children who have to work outside.&nbsp; They have bracelets or wrist watches which monitor heart beats, blood pressures, body temperatures and transmit the readings wirelessly via the Internet to a central monitoring centre.&nbsp; This way, if an elderly suddenly appears to be motionless, like there were no readings&nbsp;or&nbsp;abnormal readings, an alarm will sound and the operation centre can alert the neighbours to quickly pop in&nbsp;to take a look.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, the community builds on the traditional Japanese sense of neighbourliness to help support each other as a system.&nbsp; They help to check on one another, cook and&nbsp;buy groceries for the frail, clean the house.&nbsp; I help you while I am okay; you reciprocate when I am frail.&nbsp; The community self-help spirit is strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 824</p><p><I>Stronger 3Ms</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I went to Japan not to study how they cope with ageing.&nbsp; I went there to enjoy the autumn leaves with my wife and to be inspired by Basho's poems.&nbsp; But I return reminded that we too should prepare early for a future when ageing will be even more pronounced.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As PM put up yesterday,&nbsp;today, Singaporeans above 65 are less than 8% of our population.&nbsp; But by 2015, it will be 11%, but still not yet quite like Japan&rsquo;s 21% today.&nbsp; But one day, we will be.&nbsp; By 2030, one in five (18%) will be above 65.&nbsp; And there will be a significant number of the "old-old", people living beyond 90.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What does ageing mean in our context?&nbsp; How can we make ageing a smooth and graceful process in our society?&nbsp; We cannot wait until it hits us.&nbsp; We need to intensify our planning efforts and begin the process today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Health Ministry, we are acutely aware of this demographic trend as most of our clientele&nbsp;are elderly.&nbsp; Our 3Ms framework was put in years ago, precisely to address ageing.&nbsp; Medisave is growing at about $1 billion a year.&nbsp; MediShield, after last year's reform, is building up its reserves again.&nbsp; And we are steadily topping up Medifund and Eldercare Fund as and when we have budget surpluses.&nbsp; All these efforts are in anticipation of the day&nbsp;when we will be drawing down Medisave, MediShield, Medifund and Eldercare Fund faster than we put in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I worry each time I hear requests to me to use&nbsp;Medisave for this illness or for that condition.&nbsp; I have to be the unpopular gate-keeper that says "no".&nbsp; But I do not&nbsp;say "no" all the time.&nbsp; Where appropriate, I have said "yes".&nbsp; In that way, I am not that unpopular.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members have commented on the 3Ms' enhancements which we have <p align=left>Column: 825</p>made over the last three years.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua just did that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank her for her kind words.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that you appreciate the efforts.&nbsp; I am not through yet.&nbsp; There are still some more enhancements that I want to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Medisave will cover&nbsp;three more chronic illnesses (stroke, high blood pressure and high cholesterol) from next January, ie, in a few weeks' time.&nbsp; The pilot for diabetes has gone well.&nbsp; Last month, over 7,000 diabetic patients have benefited from this Medisave enhancement.&nbsp; But my interest in this scheme goes beyond just funding.&nbsp; I hope the scheme will raise the level of care for these common chronic illnesses so that&nbsp;patients can avoid severe complications in the future.&nbsp; Today's medical science offers no cure for diabetes, so we cannot&nbsp;eliminate diabetes.&nbsp; But my ambition is to make Singapore the best in the world for diabetic patients, where there is early detection of the disease and effective long-term care of the disease in the community.&nbsp; The science for this is well-known but turning it to reality requires full cooperation and compliance from the patients.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I am planning a sequel to last year's MediShield Reform.&nbsp; If there is public support, I hope to further increase the MediShield payout for patients with large hospital bills.&nbsp; Preliminary sounding suggests that patients are prepared for such an enhancement if the premiums do not go up by too much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, at each budget cycle, I will apply to the Ministry of Finance&nbsp;for top-ups to Medifund and Eldercare Fund.&nbsp; So far, I have been successful because they have been very understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will continue to try, but I know that this assumes healthy budget surpluses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, I will press on with greater information sharing so that patients can make informed choices and hospitals can learn best practices from one another.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 826</p>We have published hospital bill sizes for the common illnesses.&nbsp; The public hospitals do so systematically because I require them to do so, but the private hospitals less consistently.&nbsp; I am thinking of making it a requirement for all hospitals to disclose the hospital bill sizes if they want to claim from&nbsp;Medisave.&nbsp; I think that is a reasonable&nbsp;request.&nbsp; This way, patients to private hospitals will also benefit from greater transparency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, I plan to publish service standards of our hospitals and how well they are being met, to help our hospital CEOs focus on the key concerns of our patients.&nbsp; How long do patients have to wait for their new clinic appointments?&nbsp; On the day of an appointment, how long do they have to wait before they get to see the doctor?&nbsp; Standards vary between specialties and between hospitals.&nbsp; We do not have comprehensive data yet, but I will publish what we have compiled so far and improve on the data collection as we progress.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, we have implemented in polyclinics this year the policy of differential subsidies among citizens, PRs and foreigners.&nbsp; This way, we keep heavy health subsidy as a citizen's privilege while requiring foreigners to pay for their own cost.&nbsp; PRs continue to be subsidised although slightly less than citizens.&nbsp; We will look into extending this policy to hospitals.&nbsp; The Government will work with employers of foreign workers and require them to buy medical insurance for their foreign workers.&nbsp; As the workers are generally young and healthy, the premiums will be affordable.&nbsp; We will announce the details when available, probably next month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Focusing on the unglamorous<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These enhancements are largely for the acute care sector, where patients receive treatment in hospitals and specialist clinics.&nbsp; The enhancements will ensure that Singaporeans continue to <p align=left>Column: 827</p>have access to high-quality care, without causing severe financial strain to themselves or to society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the continuing ageing of the population, I will now begin to spend more time focusing on&nbsp;primary healthcare and step-down care.&nbsp; Unlike tertiary care, this is the&nbsp;unglamorous cousin.&nbsp; But for the elderly, this is a more&nbsp;important sector.&nbsp; The better a sick elderly patient is cared for by his family physician or in the step-down care sector, the better off the patient will be.&nbsp; We will study how best to strengthen and grow this sector.&nbsp; This sector ranges from care at home to care at day centres, to GPs, to nursing homes, hospices and community hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not yet have all the solutions, but some of the problems are known.&nbsp; First, the care is not well-integrated.&nbsp; When patients move from one care provider to another, they often encounter obstacles.&nbsp; Patient flow across facilities and institutions is certainly not seamless or hassle-free.&nbsp; To make proper chronic disease management happen, our doctors, nurses and other professionals need to work together, in a different, improved manner across inpatient, outpatient and step-down care.&nbsp;We need to have public sector specialists collaborate with private sector GPs.&nbsp; We need VWOs running community hospitals and nursing homes to work with acute care institutions and family physicians, to deliver better patient care.&nbsp; Ideally, all care providers should regularly share information and consult each other, but the reality is not quite there yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the care quality varies over the range of providers.&nbsp; While some providers do provide good care and service within their facilities, there are places which do not do as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, information on this sector is incomplete and hazy.&nbsp; Patients do not <p align=left>Column: 828</p>know the full range of step-down care choices that are available to them.&nbsp; Some feel that they are stuck with no option other than their current provider.&nbsp; Last month, we published the key data on nursing homes and community hospitals.&nbsp; It is a first step, a small step but I&nbsp;will refine the publication as we go along.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we do not know if our range of step-down care services is comprehensive enough.&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; Are there gaps?&nbsp; I am sure there are.&nbsp; Are there niche services which are absent today but can usefully meet a real need?&nbsp; Some of these services go beyond my Ministry&rsquo;s portfolio, and we will work with other Ministries to ensure that genuine needs are adequately met.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our population will continue to age.&nbsp; We will try to slow it down by raising births and stepping up immigration, but we cannot avoid it.&nbsp; The better prepared we are for this inevitable demographic change, the better we can ensure that elderly Singaporeans face old age with confidence, calm and peace of mind.&nbsp; My Ministry will do its part to anticipate rising demand for healthcare services, both at the acute and step-down care sectors, and marshal resources to ensure that there will be sufficient beds, manpower and expertise.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we spend about 4% of our GDP on healthcare services.&nbsp; Considering the high standard of our care and Singaporeans' health status, this is quite an achievement.&nbsp; But to meet the future needs of our population, it is not possible to keep healthcare expenditure in this region of 4% indefinitely.&nbsp; It is bound to increase.&nbsp; This increase will have to come from all stakeholders: Government, employers, insurers, patients and their families.&nbsp; This is part of the reason why GST has to go up.&nbsp; But I will recommend to the Ministry of Finance&nbsp;to fully offset any GST increase on medical costs incurred by subsidised patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 829</p><p><I>Happy ageing</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, inspired by what I saw in Japan, I decided to visit two elderly day care centres here in Singapore even though they do not come under my Ministry&rsquo;s portfolio: one in Tampines run by Tampines PCF, another one in Marsiling run by NTUC Eldercare.&nbsp; They are doing very good work, caring for the elderly whose option is otherwise home alone in front of the television, counting the hours and minutes.&nbsp; I know of a group of bank managers who do voluntary work, visiting the old folks at nursing homes and checking out what they need.&nbsp; It turned out that the single biggest issue with old age is loneliness at home and loss of dignity when they feel that they are no longer useful and sometimes unable to even control their bodily functions.&nbsp; There is a lot that the Japanese are doing that we can learn from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Basho certainly had much to teach us about ageing and living.&nbsp; As his own health deteriorated, he continued to work, composing poems.&nbsp; In Osaka, he penned this famous <I>haiku</I>:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This autumn<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I ageing so?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It appears, in spirit, to be similar to the Chinese poem "the beauty of sunset, unfortunately it is fleeting" (<I>xi yang wu xian hao,&nbsp;zhi shi jin huanghun</I> ).&nbsp; But it is not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basho was a serious&nbsp;Zen practitioner and had realised the road of poetry, the road of&nbsp;Zen and the road of life itself.&nbsp; He was not lamenting his impending death.&nbsp; He was sharing his insight when he was confronted with the solitude of an autumn evening.&nbsp; We came to this world alone and we will leave&nbsp;the world&nbsp;alone, whether we are rich or poor, strong or weak.&nbsp; But how we live this life makes the crucial difference to our final eventual exit.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But he left behind a rich legacy of wonderful <I>haiku</I> which immortalised him.&nbsp; He lived a full life doing what he loved, and taught us how to live, how to age gracefully and how to make a wonderful exit when the end is near.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But I think more important than having more doctors are also large numbers of allied health professionals.&nbsp; When I visited the day care centres, they are not manned by doctors or nurses, because most of the time, the care is out of the heart, a lot of counselling work, attitudes, social workers.&nbsp; In these areas, the allied health professionals have been neglected for too <p align=left>Column: 833</p>long, and part of my job is to assess, if ageing continues at this pace, what sort of manpower do we need.&nbsp; And I suspect we need a huge pyramid with&nbsp;doctors sitting on top, but we need a large number of nurses and non-doctors and non-nurses in the supportive group providing this sort of care all round.&nbsp; I have been looking at the labour statistics from the US for many years, and we know that the top four or five jobs are all in this category of&nbsp;how to look after the elderly frail or semi-frail.&nbsp; Because we are still a very young society, we have somehow not paid sufficient attention, but it is never too late.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are good reasons why we have minimal exemptions for GST implementation.&nbsp; But for subsidised medical care, it is possible to arrange for an offset package, so that it makes no difference to the patient.<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for administrative charge for Medisave withdrawal,&nbsp;the administrative charge&nbsp;is just like the credit card charge.&nbsp; When&nbsp;one uses&nbsp;his credit card, the credit card company will charge a certain percentage for handling the particular transaction.&nbsp; So it is part and parcel of operating a business, because a person either&nbsp;pays cash or pays through&nbsp;his credit card.&nbsp; Every transaction costs money.&nbsp; So there is a need to impose a fee, and it has been imposed ever since Medisave was introduced 22 years ago.&nbsp;

But for a $30 bill, to impose $3.17, if I recall correctly, is a big percentage.&nbsp; We understand the need for some of these administrative charges.&nbsp; The request is to see whether&nbsp;the charge could be lowered.&nbsp;

I happen to be quite familiar&nbsp;with this topic because, years ago, when I helped Senior Minister Goh when he was my boss, the Health Minister, to design Medisave, we were very careful because every Medisave withdrawal&nbsp;transaction costs money. And that is why we discouraged outpatient usage for many years, because we know that outpatient transactions are low&nbsp; -&nbsp; $10, $20, $30.&nbsp; But the cost of handling that $10 or $20 transaction is indeed a couple of dollars.&nbsp; Percentage wise, it is big.&nbsp; Therefore, for that kind of transactions, it is far better for the patient to pay out of pocket in cash.&nbsp; That is the reason for having to impose the administrative fee.&nbsp; It is actually to discourage small Medisave&nbsp;claims.&nbsp; But if the hospital bill&nbsp;is $3,000, then, of course, a few dollars of&nbsp;administrative fee makes sense.&nbsp; That is the reason.&nbsp; But we have been negotiating with CPF to bring the rates down, because now&nbsp;the transactions are in&nbsp;such big numbers,&nbsp;and we are spreading the overheads.&nbsp; So the cost per transaction can be cheaper, but it cannot be zero.&nbsp; There is a cost to it.<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are ways around it, and that is why I allow for the Medisave diabetes package to include a package fee.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;a patient pays&nbsp;per year, say, $200 package fee which allows&nbsp;him maybe six or eight visits</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>in between to have all sorts of blood checks and so on.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if you were a refuge from Neverland on a boat with a radio, listening to the speeches from this Parliament over the last four days, you will not set your compass on your way to Singapore.&nbsp; You might turn back and go back to Neverland.&nbsp; Sir, that will be a shame, because who knows one day, you might be the real Speaker.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are problems in Singapore and this House has&nbsp;ventilated many of the problems here.&nbsp; But this is an active Government, with lots of resources committed to solving some of these problems.&nbsp; Singapore is a fair society, it is not a perfect society.&nbsp; In an imperfect world, Singapore could well be utopia because everybody is treated "equally" and "fairly".&nbsp; The two key words that I&nbsp;like to go back again and again are "equally" and "fairly".&nbsp; Our stations in lives do not depend on our race, language or religion, nor does it depend on our accent,&nbsp;dialect or breeding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those looking for a true utopia have to look elsewhere.&nbsp; Where will they find it?&nbsp; They will not find it in Communist China where everybody is supposed to be equal.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 839</p>Yet, in China, income gaps are widening much faster than in Singapore.&nbsp; Mr Mah and I travelled to China quite often to a place called Chengdu in Sichuan in the centre of China.&nbsp; It used to be a poor place.&nbsp; Today, it is&nbsp;a relatively rich place, not on the scale of Shanghai or Guangzhou but rich enough.&nbsp; But income gaps have grown apart enormously.&nbsp; Recently, I went to Chengdu and I spoke with a high official (<I>gao guan</I>) and I said, "Wah! Chengdu has become so beautiful!&nbsp; It has become so rich, with so many condominiums."&nbsp; And I said that the problem is that they are so expensive that the ordinary persons (<I>xiao shi min</I>) could not afford these flats.&nbsp; The official said, "<I>Bu shi xiao shi min</I>, <I>shi wo men gao guan ye mai bu qi zhe xie lou fang</I>."&nbsp; In others words, he said it was not just the small people, but high officials also could not afford the apartments that I saw around Chengdu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where will you find utopia?&nbsp; Certainly they will not find it in Europe where welfarism is supposed to be the heart of a compassionate society.&nbsp; Unemployment rate is extremely high all over Europe, ranging 10%-15% in the worst countries.&nbsp; Even in America, known as the land of the dreams, the American dream is elusive for many Americans, particularly blacks, Hispanics and many Asians.&nbsp; Martin Luther King said in the 1960s, "I have a dream."&nbsp; But many blacks in America, in the deep south, for example, will tell you that even Martin Luther King was merely saying it because he knew it was a dream, nothing more, just a dream!&nbsp; Clever Asian children in many parts of America suffer from reverse affirmative action, even though affirmative action was planned to protect the minority, and Asians are the absolute minorities in America.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in recent days, we have heard that Singapore has become a society divided by wealth (the rich and the poor), the <p align=left>Column: 840</p>talented (gifted and mainstream), and jobs (professionals and unskilled).&nbsp; The mere existence of Singaporeans with different jobs, talents and wealth does not point to a divided society.&nbsp; This existence does not point to a stratified society.&nbsp; In any society, wherever you may be, there will be the rich, there will be the poor, there will be the developmentally advanced&nbsp;and ordinary children, there will be professionals and unskilled workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the issue which we should look at is whether Singaporeans work and live in totally different universe oblivious to the existence of each other.&nbsp; The issue which we should look at is whether special privileges are extended to the rich and denied to the poor.&nbsp; The issue is whether we are schooled in separate systems where the rich can buy influence, power and positions.&nbsp; The issue is whether the system is fair, transparent and meritocratic.&nbsp; The real issue is whether there are formidable and permanent barriers to social mobility.&nbsp; The issue is whether the masses are given a fair go at the system.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you look at these issues separately, or together, we have to conclude that we are not a divided society.&nbsp; Because there are no impermeable barriers which permanently put us in separate class or caste.&nbsp; When you look at Singapore and compare it to many societies around the world, you will see two great social equalisers here, not found in many places.&nbsp; Together, I think they are unique.&nbsp; First, National Service; and second,&nbsp;our education and&nbsp;scholarship system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, National Service (NS). In Singapore, all 18-year old Singapore citizens and PRs do National Service, whether you are rich or poor, whether you are the Prime Minister's son or a rental flat's child, whether you are gifted or mainstream, all of us do two years of National Service.&nbsp; Next year, this <p align=left>Column: 841</p>institution will commemorate its 40th year of anniversary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does NS work? Because we treat everybody as equals.&nbsp; The rich and gifted cannot buy their way out of this system.&nbsp; The powerful cannot ask for special privileges.&nbsp; And no special groups can lobby for cushy postings.&nbsp; In fact, we find the best and the fittest&nbsp;to go to the best units - the commandos, the naval divers.&nbsp; Everybody in NS eats the same food, which is not bad I must say, wears the same army uniform, which is quite comfortable, sports the same four-by-two crew cut, which is shorter than mine, sleeps in the same bunks, does the same tasks and dreams the same Singapore dreams.&nbsp; National Service is a unique experience&nbsp;that unites and binds us.&nbsp; It unites across cultures, races, religions and social stratums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From National Service, strong bonds of friendship are forged.&nbsp; I did my NS in 1976 after I had come back from overseas.&nbsp; Today, my combat engineer buddies still hold regular get-togethers.&nbsp; They had one recently. &nbsp;I could not join them because I was involved in an official function.&nbsp; All of us have finished our tour of duties.&nbsp; Everyone of us has arrived at a different station in life, but none of us feels excluded in our combat engineer alumni.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the National Service experience is not just&nbsp;a rite of passage for our males, because that will divide us into males and females.&nbsp; Our males in Singapore do not travel alone.&nbsp; Our women folks are with them -&nbsp;behind them, supporting them.&nbsp; Our own folks share the same NS experience in a different way.&nbsp; Every time, I go to Pulau Tekong, which is the place where we train our recruits, we call it the&nbsp;Basic Military Training Camp (BMTC), I see mothers,&nbsp;sisters and girlfriends accompanying these anxious young boys.&nbsp; Always, there are more women than men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 842</p>Why?&nbsp; The fathers may not be there, but the mothers are always there.&nbsp; NS unites&nbsp;and brings the families closer together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second great social equaliser I want to talk about is education and scholarship.&nbsp; This underpins our whole society.&nbsp; This is a unique equaliser because it is inclusive; it is secular -&nbsp;secular means you are allowed to practise any religious faith you want; it is equal, not 100%, but very close to it and I will explain why; and it is very inexpensive -&nbsp;this is one time, the word "cheap" carries a special significance.&nbsp; I heard the Prime Minister yesterday in this House wanting to invest more in education, making it more open and&nbsp;accessible for the lower income group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, in Singapore, we take our education system&nbsp;for granted and do not realise that it offers the greatest social level playing field.&nbsp; This point is often lost on native Singaporeans.&nbsp; In America,&nbsp;Australia,&nbsp;Britain,&nbsp;New Zealand and Canada, education is not equal, and I say it again, it is not equal.&nbsp; The rich and the poor are schooled separately.&nbsp; For how long? For as long as 12 years of their formal schooling -&nbsp;12 long years.&nbsp; By which time, the boys and&nbsp;girls could have formed permanent prejudices against the other communities.&nbsp; The rich goes to private schools and the rest goes to&nbsp;public schools.&nbsp; In the UK, private schools carry a different name, euphemistically called public schools,&nbsp;to give the illusion, the grandeur that these schools are open to the public. Everybody is welcome, but only the rich need to apply.&nbsp; The typical average fees of a private school in the UK&nbsp;are around 20,000 sterling pounds. The last time I looked at&nbsp;the&nbsp;so-called "good ones" they carry a price tag several times higher than 20,000 pounds.&nbsp; And where do the poor go?&nbsp; They go to the poor inner sub-urban schools where facilities are lacking, teachers have low morale,&nbsp;because they are poorly paid.&nbsp; They live separate lives for as long as 12&nbsp;years.&nbsp; The rich go there <p align=left>Column: 843</p>because they come from a rich family background and&nbsp;are&nbsp;well-connected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, all of us - the rich and the poor, and there are rich people and there are poor people, private estate dwellers or HDB heartlanders - have access to good and very affordable public schools.&nbsp; While admission to primary schools&nbsp;is not screened for scholastic aptitudes, or special talent like sports, leadership, admission to&nbsp;secondary schools&nbsp;is determined on merit.&nbsp; And this is a very fair system.&nbsp; It gives everybody a fair go.&nbsp; It levels the playing field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many public secular schools like RGS, RI and RJC have gained enormous prestige and appeal for excellence and meritocracy.&nbsp; In an article on world talent about one month ago or so, <I>The Economist</I> &nbsp;magazine made special mention about RJC and singled it out as the college in the world that sends the most number of students to the Ivy League in the States.&nbsp; And this magazine does not even bother to mention that RJC sends too many students to the top five colleges in UK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So closely associated with the open access to public education system is the scholarship system.&nbsp; Thousands of sons and daughters of working parents have gone to universities locally and abroad on these state-funded scholarships.&nbsp; Mr Sam Tan told us last week that without the PA scholarship, he would not have been able to go to university.&nbsp; Ms Chua Mui Hoong chronicled her humble journey from a rental flat to a place in Cambridge University on a Government scholarship.&nbsp; Today, she lives in a condominium.&nbsp; There are many Sam Tans and Chua Mui Hoongs around in Singapore.&nbsp; There are so many of them around that their stories do not make compelling reading anymore.&nbsp; That is a shame because every story like Chua Mui Hoong and Sam Tan&nbsp;serves to <p align=left>Column: 844</p>remind us that this system works, this system levels the playing field.&nbsp;It can only work because the people support it&nbsp;and people know it.&nbsp; People like Sam Tan have come back to serve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, many lamented that the Gifted Education Programme (GEP) and the scholarship system breed elitism and entrench the power of the few over the lives of many.&nbsp; These perceptions are misleading and the accusations are wrong.&nbsp; If we remove these programmes, the people who suffer more are the poor, and not the rich.&nbsp; The rich have&nbsp;resources.&nbsp; They do not need these schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, examinations and scholarships are not the perfect solutions to finding the most able to govern a country or any corporation.&nbsp; Examinations are not even the second best method to find the most gifted.&nbsp; But they are one of the best available methods to bring out groups of talented people, not individually, but groups of talented people&nbsp;to an organisation or a country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is useful to look at examples elsewhere to seek some inspiration, some confirmation, to see whether our system is flawed.&nbsp; Western civilisation, as we know it today, is triumphant.&nbsp; But it is a relatively young civilisation, barely a few hundred years old,&nbsp;as&nbsp;we know it today, in its successful triumphant form.&nbsp; In this system, aristocrats ruled over the masses.&nbsp; In the words of Shakespeare, these are people "To the Manor Born".&nbsp; It was absolute in ancient Europe, it is still true&nbsp;in modern Europe and, to a large degree, the land of dreams -&nbsp;the USA.&nbsp; If you do not believe me, do a "Google" search of the profile of the Democratic and Republican party leaders in the House and Congress and the Labour and Conservative party leaders in Westminster.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a recent Oxbridge alumni meeting, ex-civil servant Ngiam Tong Dow spoke of different systems of selecting mandarins <p align=left>Column: 845</p>to govern a country.&nbsp; Clearly, there is no one single system which is perfect.&nbsp; But some systems lend good examples for us to learn.&nbsp; What system we choose, a system which is fair and wins the hearts and minds of the people will endure and produce results for the country.&nbsp; Sir, there is no examination and scholarship system that has endured longer than the Imperial Examinations of China.&nbsp; It survived for not 10 years, not 100 years, but a millennium.&nbsp; It survived for 1,300 years across dynasties, from the Sui Dynasty, 650 A.D. all the way to the Qing Dynasty, 1911.&nbsp; Please remember that each dynasty lasted about 250 years, and beyond -&nbsp;translated in election terms, it means more than 50 elections, something we should think about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we look at the Imperial Examinations, we will find useful and important examples - some good, some bad, some absolutely rubbish - which we can take away for a small and young country like Singapore which is barely 41 years old.&nbsp; It is a baby.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ancient China, a system of Imperial examinations (the Chinese call, <I>ke ju kao shi</I> ) served two important purposes.&nbsp; There are many others, but there are two important ones.&nbsp; First, it allowed the Emperor to recruit officials and Ministers, the best people, to serve him, to keep his vast empire from north to south, east to west.&nbsp; If you&nbsp;travel from north to south, it&nbsp;may take one or two years, east to west, it may take many more years.&nbsp; So he needed good people to keep the ground for him.&nbsp; Second, it determined social mobility for the masses.&nbsp; Most people are poor in China.&nbsp; They needed to make these people happy, otherwise there would be revolutions.&nbsp; This system is very different from the aristocrat-led system in the West where the King appointed his knights and&nbsp;bishops, all in a very closed fashion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody in ancient China who wished to be a civil servant or a Minister had to <p align=left>Column: 846</p>pass several standard examinations at different levels, because then, they would know relatively who was better,&nbsp;more determined or more diligent.&nbsp; Different examinations led to different posts.&nbsp; The harder the examinations, the bigger the prizes and the ranks.&nbsp; Is that fair?&nbsp; I think it is fair.&nbsp;The number of posts was distributed proportionally to districts, provinces and national levels so that everybody everywhere would get something.&nbsp; There were three classes of examinations: the <I>sheng yuan</I>, let us call it the&nbsp;Bachelor's level, just to benchmark it; the <I>ju ren</I>, let us say, the Master's level; and then the <I>jin</I> <I>shi</I>, let us say, the PhD.&nbsp; The most difficult examination being the <I>jin</I> <I>shi</I>.&nbsp; This examination was held every three years in the capital city.&nbsp; The top scholars became the <I>zhuang</I> <I>yuan</I>.&nbsp; The <I>zhuang</I> <I>yuan</I> became a Minister -&nbsp;but Ministership is only a side benefit - and he took a beautiful princess as his wife.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These examinations were tough and most failed.&nbsp; But what did it do?&nbsp; It gave hope to the masses because it was open to people from all stratums of society.&nbsp; It was very egalitarian and meritocratic.&nbsp; Poor peasants had a chance to become the gentry class.&nbsp;It was a fair system, never mind that the pass rate was dismal, less than 5% of the people passed.&nbsp; But what happened before the Imperial Examinations?&nbsp; The Chinese history lasted before 650 AD, way back 2000 years BC, 3000 BC.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the Imperial Examinations were introduced, appointments to the courts were determined by recommendations from prominent aristocrats, like the European system.&nbsp; Who did they recommend?&nbsp; They recommended each other's friends, their children, in-laws, etc.&nbsp; This system was totally corrupt.&nbsp; The Emperor could not avail himself of the best talent.&nbsp; Those who came before him were incompetent, corrupt, lazy and selfish, and they all undermined his prestige and influence.&nbsp; Worse, the system <p align=left>Column: 847</p>antagonised the masses who resented a closed and exclusive system.&nbsp; It was a totally closed system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is even more remarkable about the Imperial Examinations is the fact that even the Mongolians under the Yuan Dynasty and the Manchus under the Qing Dynasty decided to implement this essentially Han, ie, the Chinese system.&nbsp; The Mongolian empire stretched huge and far.&nbsp; It was bigger than the Roman Empire at one time.&nbsp; The Mongolians did not need the Chinese system but they decided that this system served them well too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Manchus came into power, they abolished the Imperial Examinations.&nbsp; But they soon found it impossible to get good, honest and clever men to keep the empire.&nbsp; So what did the Manchus do?&nbsp; They restarted the Imperial Examinations, but excluded the Han Chinese.&nbsp; But what happened?&nbsp; There were not enough talented Manchus to run the empire.&nbsp; They decided that they had no choice, so they reopened the Imperial Examinations to the Han Chinese.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herein lies an important lesson for us.&nbsp; A small country like Singapore will have a small talent pool.&nbsp; We can exceed the universal average, but no matter how we improve the education system, the talent pool will be small.&nbsp; This will not be enough for the kind of&nbsp;growing economy&nbsp;that we aspire to.&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp;we must do two things.&nbsp; First, we must seek out our own talent in every school, family and community and help them along. &nbsp;The rich can get along.&nbsp; The poor, we can and must&nbsp;help them.&nbsp; At the same time, we have to attract even more people from outside of Singapore to serve our goals.&nbsp; If we exclude foreigners from our education system and deprive them of scholarships, we will be the poorer for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is no coincidence that the Qing Dynasty lasted for a long time, ie,&nbsp;270 <p align=left>Column: 848</p>years, from 1644 AD to 1911 AD, one of the longest surviving dynasties in China, because towards the end, it went corrupt, as all dynasties do at some point.&nbsp; The Manchus came to power on the battlefield.&nbsp; They were the barbarians from the north east, but it could not rule over the Han Chinese with mere swords and spears.&nbsp; They needed good men - sorry, only men because in&nbsp;those days, no women - to help keep the empire against a restive population who resented the barbarians from the north.&nbsp; The Han Chinese were the majority, but the barbarians had come down and there were constant revolutions small and big, against them.&nbsp; The Manchus decided to work with their enemy, the Chinese.&nbsp; They opened the Imperial Examinations and gave the Hans jobs and opportunities.&nbsp; In other words, they practised what we call today an "inclusive system", a system that brings in talented people and let them see where the differences lie,&nbsp;reconcile them and work towards the benefit of the nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Imperial Examinations were not without faults, like all examination systems or any system.&nbsp; There were plenty of problems which we should avoid.&nbsp; First, it excluded women.&nbsp; It was a very sexist system.&nbsp; Our schools and scholarship systems include women and, increasingly, we find more and more women at all levels or strata.&nbsp; Perhaps, more can be done too in this direction.&nbsp; Even though the Imperial Examinations were fair, it was clear that the rich had more opportunities.&nbsp; Many Members in this House have said that our system is good but the poor needs extra help, and that is always correct.&nbsp; In Imperial China, books, brushes&nbsp;and private tuition - yes, they had private tuition in those days - cost lots of money.&nbsp; The journey to the capital was long, treacherous and arduous, and many could not even make it to the examination halls.&nbsp; That is the reason why there were fewer southern Chinese scholars than northern Chinese - <p align=left>Column: 849</p>giving the illusion that southern Chinese are stupid - because they could not cross the rivers and the mountains.&nbsp; But the rich did not have an absolute advantage.&nbsp; The rich could not cream it all and take all the good seats in the palace.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because talent runs deep in the heartlands.&nbsp; Many poor scholars overcame adversities and became <I>zhuang yuan.&nbsp;</I> There was a whole range of scholars, but <I>zhuang yuan</I> means those at the&nbsp;very top.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Qing period, up to one-third of top scholars came from remote villages and from families with no educational backgrounds.&nbsp; We may say that one-third is still a minority, but one-third was quite substantial.&nbsp; The provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu had the most number of scholars, even though they were very, very far from Beijing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our system, because education is very, very cheap, poor students are not at a severe disadvantage.&nbsp; As we are a small country and&nbsp;a close-knit community, it is easy to identify, find and help them.&nbsp; On top of that, our students are helped with a whole battery of schemes, eg, Edusave bursaries, Edusave Merit Scholarships, School Pocket Money Fund, transport vouchers, CCC scholarships and bursaries, and various MOE assistance schemes.&nbsp; And yesterday, the Prime Minister said he wants to do more for education.&nbsp; NTUC Fairprice also chips in with free old school textbooks, and many organisations, like the Tanjong Pagar Town Council, donate good second-hand used computers to poor families.&nbsp; Students here are not short of assistance.&nbsp; Our National Library membership is free.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why are some Singaporeans still angry at our system, suggesting that we are divided in two classes?&nbsp; I think, again, the Imperial Examinations can tell us something which we can learn and avoid.&nbsp; The Imperial Examinations were exhausting and challenging.&nbsp; It was so exhausting that it took years to prepare <p align=left>Column: 850</p>and many failed.&nbsp; Some of those who failed the examinations channelled their energies creatively and positively, while some channelled them destructively.&nbsp; But not all is lost.&nbsp; Some of the best classical talents in China came from people who failed the Imperial Examinations.&nbsp; Du Fu, for example, is one of the most famous poets of China.&nbsp; Some people call him the modern Shakespeare.&nbsp; He failed the Imperial Examinations.&nbsp; He abandoned dreams of becoming a scholar and became a wandering poet.&nbsp; Today, anybody who knows Chinese classics would have come across&nbsp; Du Fu and many of his poems.&nbsp; Another famous person who failed the examinations but channelled his energy creatively is the author of the Dream of the Red Chamber - Cao Yueqin.&nbsp; Many others had written beautiful poems because they failed.&nbsp; But this is a plus.&nbsp; It is like some Singaporeans who decided not to opt into the system and became top entrepreneurs and bankers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, however, channelled their energies destructively.&nbsp; The most famous failure and frustrated individual was Hong Xiuquan.&nbsp; He failed the Imperial Examinations four times, ie, a total of 12 years.&nbsp; He was a talented person who found himself marooned by a system which marginalised him.&nbsp; He channelled his energy into starting the Taiping Rebellion.&nbsp; This revolution supposedly cost the lives of 21 million Chinese.&nbsp; The take-away&nbsp;for me at least is that we must create space for the talented who failed the system, because the system is not perfect.&nbsp; A good system allows us to collect groups of talent, but individuals slip through the net and we must not forget the losers who tried.&nbsp; Those who failed but tried must be rewarded.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Imperial Examinations also tell us that examinations are not everything.&nbsp; It is worth mentioning that not many <I>zhuang yuan</I> made a mark in Chinese history, not <p align=left>Column: 851</p>many at all.&nbsp; The people who left big footprints in Chinese history are usually the <I>jinshi jidi</I>, ie, those who passed the examinations but who were not ranked in the top 10%-20%.&nbsp; Li Bai is an example.&nbsp; He was one of the top poets in China.&nbsp; Many Members would have heard of his poems.&nbsp; In fact, last year, when there was a calligraphy exhibition by some Ministers,&nbsp;Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam wrote this piece "<I>tian sheng wo cai bi you yong</I> ".&nbsp; That was Li Bai.&nbsp; One of the sentences in the poem is <I>jiang jin jiu</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lessons for me are clear.&nbsp; Our system, Sir, is fair.&nbsp; This system gives everybody a fair chance.&nbsp; It may not - and I think it does not - always identify the very, very best students.&nbsp; But, as a group, our&nbsp;scholarship system and the school system&nbsp;allow us to bring out the best in the population and give everybody a fair chance.&nbsp; But this does not mean that those who have succeeded from this system can lord over the people.&nbsp; They have no such right.&nbsp; They need to remember that they owe it to society to serve with humility and gratefulness.&nbsp; Our system should be a source of pride rather than envy and anger.&nbsp; We should celebrate rather than condemn it.&nbsp; This is a system which does not entrench old power.&nbsp; Instead, it provides a level playing field for the determined and the talented to reach the highest office, regardless of his or her breeding and background.&nbsp; It cleans up the old power and brings in people power.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.12 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (West Coast):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I would like to address some issues regarding transport.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has an excellent transport infrastructure.&nbsp; Our seaports and airports are truly world-class, thanks to the many people who work in these sectors&nbsp; - &nbsp;the <p align=left>Column: 852</p>stevedores, the gantry crane drivers at PSA, the staff at CAAS and the immigration officers at Changi Airport.&nbsp; They&nbsp;work with utmost dedication 24/7 to maintain Singapore's pole position as a major sea and air hub.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the President, in his Address, emphasised the importance of investing in infrastructure to meet future business needs.&nbsp; The Prime Minister has also spoken to that effect.&nbsp; Sir, I support these positions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why China is today the factory of the world while India is not can be largely explained by their different approaches to infrastructure development.&nbsp; In 2004,&nbsp; China invested 20% of its GDP in infrastructure and received US$60 billion in foreign direct investments (FDI).&nbsp; In contrast, India invested only 6% of its GDP in infrastructure and&nbsp;received only about US$5 billion in foreign direct investments, ie, less than one-tenth of what China received.&nbsp; This underscores the importance of infrastructure development in attracting FDI and jobs.&nbsp; With globalisation, supply chains are getting more complex.&nbsp; To remain relevant, we must continue to invest in infrastructure and be plugged in as a major node in the global supply chain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the maritime front, we are expanding the Pasir Panjang container berths.&nbsp; In the air sector, we will soon witness the opening of Changi Terminal 3 in 2008.&nbsp; These are all welcomed.&nbsp; In land transport, the Transport Minister has announced a major study this year and I welcome the study.&nbsp; Like my GPC colleague, Mdm Cynthia Phua, rather than working at the edges or making marginal changes, I would strongly encourage MOT to undertake a fundamental review of our land transport sector.&nbsp; The URA, in its Concept Plan 2001 has projected a resident population of 5.5 million people in Singapore in the long-term.&nbsp; That is a 40% increase.&nbsp; Last year, Singapore <p align=left>Column: 853</p>Tourism Board set for itself a target to double tourist arrivals to 17 million by 2015, up from eight million in 2004.&nbsp; That is more than a hundred percent increase.&nbsp; With the two IR projects and the IFC, I believe that these projections would be exceeded.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The future demand on our land transport will put considerable strain on the existing network.&nbsp; If we are to avoid the "congestion tax" that the Minister talked about, then we would do well to invest in advance of&nbsp;demand.&nbsp; Since 12% of our land area has been committed to roads, there is a limit to constructing more roads.&nbsp; One way is to consider the construction of underground roads.&nbsp; This is not a new idea.&nbsp; In fact, it was written in the Public Transport White Paper 1996.&nbsp; In that document, the LTA said that it is seriously studying the feasibility of the Singapore underground road system.&nbsp; It even had an acronym for it: SURS (Singapore Underground Road System).&nbsp;&nbsp;The SURS is said to be able to increase road capacity by 40%.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to update us on the findings of the feasibility study&nbsp;of the SURS.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another alternative&nbsp;to increase the use of our roads is "reversible lanes".&nbsp; For many in this House, if you are motorists, you would have noticed that in the morning rush hours, the ECP, for example, is jammed up&nbsp;for lanes towards the city and in the evening rush hours, jammed up again for lanes towards the east.&nbsp; Road congestion occurs mostly on one side whilst motorists on the "reverse commute lanes" whisk by.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp;lanes can be made more reversible to cater to peak traffic, then we&nbsp;could relieve road congestion&nbsp;without having to invest in&nbsp;more lanes.&nbsp; In fact, such a system has been done successfully in Canada and elsewhere. The George Massey Tunnel, the Lion's Gate Bridge and the Pitt River Bridge in Vancouver are <p align=left>Column: 854</p>some examples. I urge the Transport Minister to consider "reversible lanes" in the proposed study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another idea is water taxis like in Venice.&nbsp; But in our case, say, from the Kallang Basin to the city, that could also be an alternative mode to road transport. I think that is what the Environment Minister is also encouraging - active use of our water space.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with the Transport Minister that we should increase the share of public transport commuters. At 63%, Singapore trails behind Zurich which has 75% public commuters, Hong Kong, 72% and Tokyo, 80%.&nbsp; The Transport Minister has said that he is aiming for 70% by 2020, that is, some 14 years away.&nbsp; But&nbsp;in 1996, some 10 years ago, that White Paper I talked about had a target of 75%.&nbsp; I urge MOT to be more ambitious because in land scarce Singapore, the only way we can solve this problem is by increasing the share of public commuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the public transport mode is made more comprehensive with&nbsp;more stations, more convenient and also more accessible, then this target may yet be revised again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally on transport issues, we have two main public transport operators - SMRT and SBS Transit today.&nbsp; Their routes do not overlap and so effectively, they do not offer commuters with choices.&nbsp; It would&nbsp;also be very expensive if we were to operate two overlapping networks.&nbsp; For example, to lay two MRT tracks east and west; two MRT tracks north and south, and so forth -&nbsp;in a small island state like Singapore.&nbsp; If we cannot achieve 'true contestability', we should not rule out the possibility of a single operator.&nbsp; I know my GPC colleague, Mdm Cynthia Phua has asked the Minister to study whether we can have a more competitive system rather than have a system where there is a single operator.&nbsp;&nbsp;The GPC, even within itself, has many diverse views and we encourage that. We also have all the bases covered so whatever the Transport Minister may <p align=left>Column: 855</p>decide, it would be a suggestion of the GPC.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think a single transport operator has merits and we should consider it.&nbsp; It would enjoy economies of scale and there would be less inefficiency at the boundaries of the two operations.&nbsp; I understand that operating an MRT system is an expensive affair and it is a very specialised affair.&nbsp; So if you have two MRT operators keeping two sets of skilled technicians, keeping two sets of stock and so forth, I think it may not be the most efficient way to go. Also, for some years now, there have been talks of a bus arrival information system at our bus-stops.&nbsp; But&nbsp;this has remained just talks.&nbsp; I have been urging SMRT to follow in the steps of SBS Transit to offer seasonal passes so that commuters who buy these passes can use them not only for SBS Transit routes but also for SMRT routes and use them islandwide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, the two operators cannot come to terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, commuters are worse off. &nbsp;I hope that the Minister could help correct this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to move on now to discuss issues other than transport. We have heard that from many Members of this House over the last five days of debate.&nbsp; Members have spoken passionately about many issues close to their heart.&nbsp; The Prime Minister also spoke yesterday on the dos and don'ts when reviewing our safety net.&nbsp; I am in broad agreement with the PM and would illustrate some of his points from my own experience as a business executive.&nbsp; I see the problem this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is about Singapore making a choice -&nbsp;a choice between two different paths; each of them seemingly compelling and both promising a better Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us take a look at the first path.&nbsp; The first path begins with the premise that the State takes sole responsibility for the well-being of all citizens.&nbsp; Such a <p align=left>Column: 856</p>proposition sounds reasonable.&nbsp; And why not, since Singapore has built up a large reserve and if you add to that, funds held by the statutory boards and Temasek, there is&nbsp;plenty to go around?&nbsp; Along this argument, the State should also provide a permanent unconditional&nbsp;and needs-based welfare system.&nbsp; You have heard these famous five words many times.&nbsp; So that poverty in Singapore is eradicated once and for all.&nbsp; For good measure, this path also suggests that since globalisation results in off-shoring, we should reject it, stop our companies from venturing abroad, lest we lose jobs to China, India and elsewhere. And we should also be very careful when bringing in foreign workers or immigrants into Singapore because they will compete with&nbsp;Singaporeans for jobs, space and so forth.&nbsp;Also, to protect Singaporeans, let us impose a minimum wage and this will be really helpful to the lower strata of society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is the proposition?&nbsp; A&nbsp;country with no poor people and&nbsp;happiness all around?&nbsp; Quite an appealing proposition.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; If it can be done, I say we should do it.&nbsp; But let us pause. Can it be done?&nbsp; I think if we put such a proposition to the crucible of the realities in the marketplace, we will quickly realise, Sir, that there are many unintended consequences. Consider first just human motivation itself.&nbsp; If the State rushes in to provide, without even expecting an 'effort test', why would citizens work hard?&nbsp; And if more and more of them become dependent on the State, who would be left behind to pay the taxes needed to fund the many welfare schemes?&nbsp; So I say a permanent welfare system in Singapore is a myth because if our safety net is too wide and if it is too entrenched, we will lose competitiveness eventually and, at some point, the system will self-destruct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we were consistently reminded that we have a large reserve and here, I <p align=left>Column: 857</p>am more conservative than the Prime Minister.&nbsp; I think the reserve is similar in some ways to defence capability.&nbsp; When we have a strong reserve and a strong defence capability, if they are working well, they act as effective deterrents.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; Effective deterrents mean you wait, nothing happens, because the deterrents are effective,&nbsp;nothing happens.&nbsp; But&nbsp;over a long time, if nothing happens, then some people will start to question whether we are doing too much in terms of reserve or defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we yield to such questions and&nbsp;we allow either one of them to dwindle, then it will be way too late when something does happen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I was listening very carefully to the PM when he spoke about changing the formula as to what constitutes NII.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think his proposal is a reasonable one since 'capital' gains are&nbsp; normally recognised as investment returns in most funds. And also, the capital value of the reserves will remain largely intact because the other 50% of the NII would be under the President's care. Therefore, after adjusting for&nbsp;inflation, the real value of the reserve would be preserved.&nbsp; But I am sure that during the debate for the Constitutional amendment regarding the reserves and changing of the formula,&nbsp;the Prime Minister would enlighten us about the amount of funds available and the kind of checks and independence that the GIC would be put to in order that they make correct economic decisions about when to realise a capital gain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider next, Sir, the economic competition from other countries and Singapore's externally oriented economy.&nbsp; Singaporeans enjoy a high per capita income.&nbsp; We are the envy of the world.&nbsp; But in aggregate, our economy is actually quite small on the world stage. Singapore recorded a GDP of US$117 billion last year, ranked 41st in the world.&nbsp; Wal-Mart, a retail company in the US had an annual sales of US$285 billion last year - for a <p align=left>Column: 858</p>single company, compared to Singapore's entire economy of US$117 billion. Wal-Mart purchased more than a quarter trillion -&nbsp;I am not talking about millions or billions -&nbsp;more than US$250 billion worth of merchandise in a single year.&nbsp; If Wal-Mart were an economy, it would be China's eighth largest trading partner, just one company.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I chose Wal-Mart as an example because it is a company that was born in Bentonville, Arkansas.&nbsp;Bentonville, Arkansas&nbsp;is a small town without&nbsp;a large local market and&nbsp;not much resources. Actually, it is a little bit like Singapore.&nbsp; So it is not unlike us.&nbsp; Yet, Wal-Mart was one of the first company to embrace globalisation for competitiveness.&nbsp; Suddenly, with globalisation, the local factor inputs become unimportant, whether you have land, capital or labour.&nbsp; It does not really matter because the whole world is your oyster, as the PM puts it.&nbsp; For these reasons, I share PM's views that globalisation is also&nbsp;good for Singapore and it can be done because, if a company like Wal-Mart, which is similarly situated can do it, I think Singapore can do it.&nbsp; Because if Wal-Mart does not take advantage of outsourcing and off-shoring, then companies like Carrefour or Tesco would do so and over time, by trying&nbsp;to protect jobs in the US, there will be no jobs left at Wal-Mart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the smallness of our economy, it is not possible for Singapore to resist the forces of globalisation. As in the case of Wal-Mart, as a company without much resources in Bentonville, Arkansas, if&nbsp;they can do it,&nbsp;as a nation, we can do it just as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, our companies must venture abroad in search of better factors of production and larger markets.&nbsp; Indeed, foreign and local enterprises in Singapore must be given access to cheaper foreign labour.&nbsp; The more we distort market forces as a Government, the more violently these forces would come back; would boomerang to&nbsp;hit us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 859</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to talk a little bit about minimum wage.&nbsp; Last month, I visited a garment factory in Cambodia.&nbsp; It is a well-run factory, medium-sized, and employs about 8,000 workers.&nbsp; The Managing Director told me that although they were satisfied with the operations in Cambodia, they had recently opened up another factory across the border in Vietnam. The plan is initially for this factory&nbsp;to take over some of the load from Cambodia in the peak periods but they have actually prepared the Vietnam factory to be scaled up in a matter of weeks to totally replace the output of the Cambodian factory.&nbsp; When I was there, I watched the 8,000 workers working very hard and very diligently in the factory.&nbsp; So I was a bit concerned on the part of these workers.&nbsp; Why did the&nbsp;garment factory now wants to have a replacement factory in Vietnam?&nbsp; I am told that apparently, some international NGOs were lobbying the Cambodian Government to impose a minimum wage for all these workers in the Cambodian factory.&nbsp; The minimum wage proposed was US$50 per month per worker.&nbsp; And the garment&nbsp;factory owner told me that at that level, Cambodia would be priced out and be uncompetitive compared to Vietnam, especially when you adjust for the productivity levels in Vietnam, the higher political stability and the vast pool of workers that you can find in Vietnam.&nbsp;So if the NGOs do succeed, I would like to ask Mr Chiam, what would be the realised minimum wage of each of these 8,000 workers in the Cambodian factory? The answer must be zero.&nbsp; They would be out of jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the most important challenge for Singapore, in my opinion, is&nbsp;our shrinking and ageing population. In scenario planning, this is not a critical uncertainty. This is called a trend, this is something that will definitely happen. So for Singapore to continue on with its current trajectory of growth, we need a large <p align=left>Column: 860</p>base of economically-active citizens to support our ageing population. The preference, of course, is to have more Singaporeans born of Singaporean parents. That way, we preserve the values that would have made us successful -&nbsp;meritocracy, reward for productive work, corruption-free and so forth.&nbsp; But we all know the limits of such a strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next answer lies with immigration. Here, we must first realise that Singapore is not the only country that is resorting to immigration.&nbsp; For many years, the US has been using immigration policies to very good effect, including attracting Professor Linda Lim, who was cited by Ms Sylvia Lim some days ago in this Chamber.&nbsp; Professor Linda Lim is a Singaporean who now lives in the US and works for the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.&nbsp; So competition for talent is not new but&nbsp;now more than ever because of globalisation and our ageing population; it must be Singapore's top priority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a multi-racial country with a large number of foreigners working in our midst, with English as the working language, I think our people are adaptable so we are, often-times, a target for countries who are seeking talents.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time,&nbsp;because English&nbsp;is our&nbsp;working language and with the large number of foreigners in our midst, we also have a competitive edge in attracting talents. So we will do well&nbsp;to capitalise on this.&nbsp; I think Japan will find it a little&nbsp;more difficult to attract and assimilate foreign talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, so if this first path is not viable,&nbsp;what then is a viable path?&nbsp; I think the viable path begins with the premise that the State expects&nbsp;its citizens to be self-reliant, to uphold the highest work ethos</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

We are not starting off from a bad base.&nbsp; In fact, we are starting off from a good base.&nbsp; Yes, there&nbsp;are stresses and uncertainties.&nbsp; But in Singapore today, we do not find homeless people in our streets as compared to even the most successful economies.&nbsp; Hospitals do not deny anyone who needs healthcare.&nbsp; No child will go without schooling even if their parents could not afford it.&nbsp; It is not the case everywhere.&nbsp; I read in the <I>Herald Tribune,</I> for example, that a student in suburban China offered to sell his 'blood' to help his classmate enrol into college.&nbsp; We must not allow Singapore to become such a society.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is more that we could do and we should do to help the structurally unemployed, the disabled and children from disadvantaged families.&nbsp;

Sir, the 11th Parliament has inherited a stronger Singapore.&nbsp; Our foreign relations are warm all round.&nbsp; Our national defence has grown from strength to strength, and our economy is chugging along nicely.&nbsp; Jobs are abound, and we have every reason to be optimistic and, yes, even very happy,&nbsp;as Mr Chan Soo Sen has reminded us.&nbsp; So, by all means, send the cow to the vet, refine our welfare delivery systems but, most of all, ensure that the cow comes back fit, strong and competitive, so that&nbsp;the "milk of kindness", as Dr Vivian Balakrishnan puts it, will continue to flow for generations to come.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We also agree and are concerned that not all of us can enjoy the same level of success and&nbsp;that we&nbsp;need assistance.&nbsp; Members are concerned about the widening income gap and has asked the Government to review whether it needs to change how the assistance is currently being given out&nbsp;so that no one is left behind, just because they do not have the ability or the resources.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt;

Sir, I hope our Malay community has been following this discussion carefully because we also need to understand the problems of globalisation, what are the implications, what are the strategies that the Government has set out in facing challenges, such as the income gap, and how we, as a community, family and individuals, can play our&nbsp;part for a better future for ourselves and our children.&nbsp; I am confident that our community will also enjoy better benefits with changes in the Government policy to build a more inclusive society.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I> ):&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;over the last five days, many Members had taken part in the debate on the President's Address.&nbsp; The debate had been lively and engaging.&nbsp; Many spoke with great passion and conviction on many of the policies outlined in the Address of the President.&nbsp; A total of 53 MPs and three Ministers spoke.&nbsp; We also heard the Prime Minister's response yesterday to some of the points raised by Members.&nbsp; Now, Sir, I have the privilege to sum up the debate.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of Members' speeches over the last five days was largely on the two challenges raised by the President, which is the building of a competitive economy and an inclusive society.&nbsp; I know Members of this House will appreciate that it is extremely difficult to sum up after the Prime Minister had spoken and given such a comprehensive and substantial speech yesterday but, nevertheless, I will try to do so.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, building a competitive economy.&nbsp; MPs Mr Inderjit Singh, Ms Grace Fu, Mr <p align=left>Column: 864</p>Iswaran and Mr Liang Eng Hwa touched on the economic pressures facing Singapore as a result of globalisation and stressed on the need for Singaporeans to adapt quickly in order to remain employed and take advantage of new opportunities.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh also stressed on the importance of instilling greater confidence in Singapore's future among Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Prime Minister, who addressed Parliament yesterday, dwelt extensively on measures taken to invest in the future, and described the Government's plans to invest in education, R&amp;D, development of infrastructure and building of a first-class public service, leaving no doubt at all that this is a Government that knows where it is heading and what it is doing, and Singaporeans should have no doubt about our future prospects.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a number of MPs touched on immigration and the influx of foreign talents into Singapore.&nbsp; With an ageing population and low fertility, MPs like Mr Inderjit Singh, Ms Grace Fu, Mr Alvin Yeo, Mr Christopher De Souza and Ms Jessica Tan supported the need to attract foreign talents to grow the economy and create jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Mr Christopher De Souza and Mr Alvin Yeo also called for more to be done to integrate them into our society.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor stressed that even as we attract foreign talents, we should make more efforts to develop, grow and retain our own talents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng suggested dual citizenship as one way of retaining talents.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim,&nbsp;NCMP,&nbsp;asked for&nbsp;greater clarity in our population and immigration policy.&nbsp; Addressing the issue, Minister Vivian Balakrishnan explained that despite huge amounts expended to encourage procreation, we continue to face severe shortfalls in meeting our population targets, which have to be made up through immigration.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some Singaporeans have expressed concerns that foreign workers will take away their jobs and depress their wages.&nbsp; However, as Mr Ong Ah Heng <p align=left>Column: 865</p>had said yesterday, we know that the reality is that even if we stop the influx of foreign workers, Singaporeans will continue to face competition for jobs with foreigners, because we are competing in a global marketplace.&nbsp; This year alone, Sir, we have seen two big manufacturing companies&nbsp; -&nbsp; Maxtor Peripherals and National Semiconductor&nbsp; -&nbsp; retrench thousands of workers because of relocations.&nbsp; Even the services sector is not spared.&nbsp; I was speaking to our Singapore Banks' Employees Union last week and they were telling me that in the banking sector, billings in many banks today are now done overseas.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also know of cases where it is difficult to get local workers to fill up the vacancies, such as jobs in the wafer fabrication plants which are not popular with Singaporeans for various reasons&nbsp; -&nbsp; long hours, 12-hour shifts, bunny suits.&nbsp; I have tried some of these bunny suits, it is actually not that bad.&nbsp; I think we need to do a much more intensive campaign to get our workers to understand that it is not difficult to put on the clean suits.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For jobs which are not popular with Singaporeans, stopping the inflow of foreign workers may even be detrimental to our interests.&nbsp; In one article, one Prof Norbert Walter, who is the Chief Economist of the Deutsche Bank Group,&nbsp;estimated that the working-age population of Singapore is likely to decline by 16% by 2050, reducing the share of 15-64 year olds from 72% to 56%.&nbsp; All things being equal, according to him, this would lower Singapore's growth potential by half a percentage point.&nbsp; In addition, according to Prof Norbert, the quality of the labour supply could decline, as it is usually the young workers who are likely to generate technical expertise and they are also usually the most active in many countries in setting up their own businesses and start-ups.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Sir, the concerns of Singaporeans are not completely without <p align=left>Column: 866</p>basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a trade unionist, I have to say that as well, as there are fears that some employers may take the easy way out and employ foreigners when there are locals available to do the jobs.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to urge the Ministry of Manpower to continue to monitor the situation carefully to maintain a proper balance.&nbsp; We also have to make sure that Singaporeans are able to take on the better paying jobs that are created by our economy, which is the real challenge confronting us. It is not that the jobs are not available but that Singaporeans must be able to take on these jobs that are created by our economy.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, judging by the sentiments expressed in this House, I feel that Singapore also suffers from a paradox.&nbsp; In order to ensure that our people do not become complacent and understand the harsh realities that we face as a small country with no natural resources, we constantly remind Singaporeans of how vulnerable we are and the threats that we face in our economic survival.&nbsp; While this has helped Singaporeans to remain vigilant, nimble and prepared for change, it has also caused a certain amount of anxiety and insecurity over our future.&nbsp; Looking at how other small countries have succeeded, such as Finland and Denmark, I think&nbsp;the Prime Minister is right in that we too can have a secure future so long as we continue to have the right fundamentals.&nbsp; And looking back at how we had managed to overcome the last few economic crises, much better than our neighbours, be it the Asian financial crisis or SARS, we have good reasons to be optimistic about our future.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, is building an inclusive society and strengthening our social safety nets.&nbsp; Many MPs supported the President's call to build a more inclusive society and to strengthen our social safety nets to assist the low-income, elderly and needy.&nbsp; Many expressed <p align=left>Column: 867</p>concerns over the widening income gap and its impact on our equity and social cohesion.&nbsp; MPs like Mr Sin Boon Ann, Mr Zainudin Nordin, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and even our Opposition MPs, Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam See Tong, made various suggestions and asked for more to be done to help the needy and poor, although, of course, our Opposition MPs have&nbsp;suggested a different path as to how to help our needy and poor.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, MPs also recognise that the critical factor contributing to the widening income gap is globalisation, as there is a global demand for talented and skilled workers but a global over supply of unskilled workers, causing incomes at the bottom to decline.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPs acknowledge that the Government has done a lot, but stressed that&nbsp;more&nbsp;could be done. MPs&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Sam&nbsp;Tan, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Lee Yi Shyan and Mr Hawazi Daipi asked for more to be done to upgrade workers' skills, particularly our older workers and low-income workers and to tackle structural unemployment.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note from MOM's Addendum that it recognises the importance of having a good adult training infrastructure to help workers upgrade their skills and build careers or switch industries and change careers to adapt to economic restructuring.&nbsp; In fact, schemes like the ESF and WSQ are some of the schemes that are already in place to effect this.&nbsp; In my view, Sir, ensuring that there is greater mobility between low-paying to better-paying jobs is important if we want to have a flexible workforce.&nbsp; If job security is no longer possible, as we cannot stop economic restructuring and retrenchments, then we must help every <p align=left>Column: 868</p>worker to remain employable and move easily between occupations and sectors.&nbsp; Without this mobility, workers will resist change and we will have a rigid workforce.&nbsp; This can only happen if, as the President said, everyone changes their mindsets. Workers must see re-skilling and re-training as an investment and be prepared to change and learn new things all the time.&nbsp; Employers&nbsp; must be&nbsp;prepared to train their workers</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 911-912.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>and the Government should continue to invest heavily in education and skills upgrading. As Mdm Ho Geok Choo had said, mindset change is an important factor in ensuring employability.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MPs Ms Denise Phua, Dr Maliki Osman,&nbsp;Ms Ellen Lee and Dr Lam Pin Min stressed on the need to identify and plug the service gaps that currently exist in the delivery of social services to the poor, needy and disabled.&nbsp; MP Ms Denise Phua felt that the role of the State, VWOs and volunteers need to be redefined.&nbsp; Minister Vivian stressed the importance of preserving and strengthening the many helping hands approach while acknowledging that the existing system could be improved.&nbsp; Some initiatives that MCYS would be rolling out to improve service are the ComCare Local Network and ComCare Database System.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of MPs also touched on the importance of keeping our healthcare costs affordable and accessible. Dr Lily Neo and Mr Hri Kumar asked for better communication of the 3M scheme. Dr Fatimah Lateef wanted more help for persons with mental illness.&nbsp; Our healthcare system has undergone tremendous changes beneficial to Singaporeans, particularly the changes to the MediShield to help pay for a bigger portion of large bills and Medisave to help to allow outpatient use for four chronic illnesses.&nbsp; In the Addendum to the President&rsquo;s Address, the MOH has also sketched areas that it would be looking at to keep costs affordable.&nbsp; Minister Khaw <p align=left>Column: 869</p>has also earlier on today given a more detailed outline of the measures that the MOH will be taking over the course of his term. I also welcome MOH&rsquo;s announcement that expenditure on healthcare will be increased, although I accept the point that it is not a question of only expenditure increasing but cost effectiveness is also an important consideration.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, education is one of the issues raised by a few MPs (Mr Masagos, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Michael Palmer and Ms Indranee Rajah) in order to reduce the income gap and help poor families break out of the poverty cycle.&nbsp; Mr Masagos stressed on the importance of reducing the number of school dropouts and ensuring that all children go through pre-school education.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo and Mr Michael Palmer called for common standards and improvements in the quality of pre-school education.&nbsp; I feel that we need to pay more attention and allocate more resources in order to stop the leakages in our education system as there is a real danger that many of those who dropped out will end up as the future wave of low wage workers, thus perpetuating poverty and low income among segments of our population.&nbsp; Even if only 5% drop out every year, every dropout is one too many, particularly as people are our only asset.&nbsp; But I would also like to echo Mr Masagos&rsquo; sentiment when he said that community involvement and support are crucial in this effort to reduce the attrition rate and, if I may add, parents particularly have an important role to play in this effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many MPs, such as Mr Wee Siew Kim, Mr Arthur Fong and Mdm Cynthia Phua , also called for greater support for our elderly, as well as cheaper housing options for our needy.&nbsp; Addressing Parliament, Minister Mah announced last Friday that more rental flats would be made available to needy families.&nbsp; The Prime Minister had also explained that the <p align=left>Column: 870</p>Government is looking into measures to help our elderly monetise their flat and unlock the value of their asset so that they have enough cash to take care of their needs after retirement.</p><p><br><I>Strengthening the&nbsp;role of families<br></I> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of other issues were also raised by MPs.&nbsp; On strengthening the role of families, MPs Mr Seah Kian Peng and Dr Lim Wee Kiak called for more support for families. Mr Seah Kian Peng and Mr Liang Eng Hwa also asked for more part-time and flexible work options to be made available.&nbsp; I note that all those who spoke about the need for stronger families are our male MPs, and this is a refreshing change.&nbsp; It used to be the women in this House who were always calling for strengthening of the role of families.&nbsp; It also shows that roles are changing in our society and men too want a bigger say in parenting and shaping family values.&nbsp; I note that there are many initiatives in place to promote work life balance under the MOM&rsquo;s tripartite committee as well as under the MCYS&rsquo; National Family Council, but certainly much more can be done to get employers to support work life balance initiatives.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the MPs in this House, who are employers or corporate leaders, will set a good example by being more family-friendly to their employees.&nbsp; Of course, that applies to the Government as well as all the Frontbenchers, the Ministers, as&nbsp; well.&nbsp; I hope that they will also be family-friendly to their staff as well, ie, civil servants.&nbsp; I do not know the prognosis of the current state of our family, but judging from the rising divorce rate and declining birth rate, our families could do with a dose of vitamins.&nbsp; Maybe the Government could consider giving tax incentives to companies that are truly family-friendly, as we all know that the carrot and stick approach can work quite effectively in Singapore.<br><p align=left>Column: 871</p>&nbsp;<br><I>Strengthening values and engaging the people</I><br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a number of MPs spoke on the importance of strengthening our values.&nbsp; RAdm&nbsp;Lui Tuck Yew felt that our education system should not only focus on examinations but should be more value-based.&nbsp; But I think that can only happen if that is the basis upon which we also assess people, and that is not likely to change for a long time.&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo and also Mr Chan Soo Sen encouraged Singaporeans to be more positive in their outlook and to celebrate our achievements more.&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef supports a greater role for volunteerism and community involvement to ensure greater rootedness among Singaporeans.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On engaging the people, Ms Jessica Tan felt that people must be made comfortable that differing views are heard.&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad felt that there is a need for the Government to listen more.&nbsp; Mr Baey Yam Keng wants to harness the power of both new and old media to communicate more effectively.&nbsp; Both Mr Baey and Ms Irene Ng also spoke passionately about promotion of the arts, and, in the case of Mr Teo Ser Luck, it is sports, as a means to develop a greater sense of belonging and rootedness among Singaporeans.&nbsp; Many MPs, such as Dr Ong Seh Hong and Ms Penny Low, talked about building greater resilience among Singaporeans.&nbsp; Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed and Mr Hawazi Daipi also reminded us that the constant nurturing of strong multi-racial ties is important and should never be taken for granted.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Prime Minister announced yesterday that the GST will be increased to 7% in order to finance the increased cost of running more programmes for our low income workers and the needy.&nbsp; As a trade unionist, I have seen workers displaced due to restructuring, such as <p align=left>Column: 872</p>the 5,000 Maxtor workers who were retrenched throughout this year, and I was there at the factory where the workers were retrenched to catch them in the morning shift and to talk to them.&nbsp; So I am acutely aware that such workers need all the support that they can get to be retrained, as well as other assistance where necessary.&nbsp; I am certain that even with good economic and job growth, people will continue to be displaced as companies restructure, relocate or outsource.&nbsp; However, these additional programmes will obviously cost money and if we tax companies too much, then more may pack up and leave, which is detrimental to all the other workers.&nbsp; So, increasing the GST would appear to be an option that is difficult to avoid, painful though it may be.&nbsp; At the same time, I am glad to hear the Prime Minister saying yesterday that a comprehensive offset package will be put in place to help Singaporeans and that it will be tilted in favour of the low income.&nbsp; We do not know the details yet, but I certainly welcome the Prime Minister's reassurance and I would like to urge the Government to be generous towards the low income earners so that their cost of living will not increase because of the increased GST.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also welcome the Government's decision to redefine the net investment income to take into account the realised capital gains.&nbsp; This means that there will be more resources available for the Government to mobilise to help our low income and needy Singaporeans as we navigate the very choppy waters of globalisation.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this has indeed been a very important debate in a sense it is a debate about globalisation, how it has impacted us and what we need to do to move ahead. I am really glad that it has taken place in his august Chamber, as it should be.&nbsp; As their elected representatives, we owe a duty to Singaporeans to guide and lead them <p align=left>Column: 873</p>effectively in facing the challenges brought about by globalisation.&nbsp; We can do so only if we ourselves are clear of the issues and challenges that we face and the strategies that we will employ to progress forward.&nbsp; If we are unclear and confused, we will create greater confusion and alarm on the ground to the detriment of everyone.&nbsp; What we are clear about is that globalisation is beneficial to us for the reasons clearly explained by the Prime Minister yesterday.&nbsp; I am not quite sure I agree completely with Mr Cedric Foo's view about globalisation the way Wal-Mart has done it.&nbsp; As we know, that is not a very good example of globalisation or a global company of corporate social responsibility.&nbsp; But I subscribe to the vision and framework that our Government has put forward in our efforts to adapt to globalisation because I think in that agenda, the way the Government has outlined its framework, as&nbsp;defined by the Prime Minister yesterday, it at least gives us a clear idea that&nbsp;both economic and social development will be in tandem. There will be displacement, there will be difficulties, but people will not be left behind, and everyone will be given a helping hand and not just a promise on the part of the Government.&nbsp; Because listening to many debates in many conferences that I attended, governments are always long on promises but short on delivery.&nbsp; But I am quite confident that our Government, judging by our past records, will deliver its promises.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we are clear too is that it will cause our income gap to widen, as not all Singaporeans can run at the same speed.&nbsp; We also recognise that our population is ageing very rapidly, bringing about new needs and demands from our elderly which have to be addressed.&nbsp; Although we have many schemes and have spent billions of dollars to help needy Singaporeans, as Minister Vivian&nbsp;mentioned, over a period of between 2001 and 2005, our expenditure has gone <p align=left>Column: 874</p>up by 300%, which is an extremely significant amount.&nbsp; The Prime Minister himself mentioned yesterday that what we needed was a sustainable and holistic approach in providing assistance, a new social model to help our needy, and he had outlined some elements of this model.&nbsp; I welcome the Government's announcement that more workfare schemes will be implemented.&nbsp; I am sure that the other MPs in this House welcome it too.&nbsp; I am glad that the Government has come&nbsp;up with a comprehensive plan to help our low-income and needy, in recognition of the vastly changed situation, particularly after 1997, and I wish to applaud the Government for its efforts.&nbsp; We also agree with the Government that we should not blindly follow the system in other countries, particularly when they are also facing difficulties.&nbsp; We should&nbsp;shape our own model based on our own needs and context, ensuring that people are self-reliant and want to help themselves, key tenets which should&nbsp;not be undermined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, helping the low-income, the poor, the needy and disabled is not the responsibility of the Government alone.&nbsp; The labour movement, together with our social partners and working under the umbrella of a small strong tripartite relationship, will do our part to help the low-income workers.&nbsp; I would also like to take this opportunity to call upon all Singaporeans to also do their part to contribute towards building a more inclusive society.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me end by telling Members the story of three taxi drivers. Why taxi drivers?&nbsp; Because I take taxis a lot to move about and also because I always find taxi drivers a very interesting group of people because they provide a thermometer of the temperatures on the ground.&nbsp; So I spoke to one as I was taking a taxi to move from a meeting place to the office, and I asked him how were things, and he said, &ldquo;Not bad.&nbsp; If you work hard, as I do, you can earn $2,000 a month.&nbsp; Not too bad.&nbsp; All my colleagues <p align=left>Column: 875</p>complain a lot, but that is okay for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was a little bit sceptical about what he said because he recognised me.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;You are the MP Halimah.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; His name is Mr Lee, but I cannot remember his full name.&nbsp; He then gave me a piece of paper and said, &ldquo;Can you just autograph?&nbsp; My daughter is a teacher.&nbsp; I want to say that you took my taxi.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I did that.&nbsp; I thought he recognised me, so he expressed a lot of optimism.&nbsp; Then, over the Hari Raya holiday, I met a relative of mine who also drives a taxi, and I asked him the same question and he gave me the same answer.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;Well, if you work hard, you are able to earn $2,000.&rdquo;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So that is the caveat, you have to work hard.&nbsp; But&nbsp;whether you are a taxi driver,&nbsp;a manager,&nbsp;a CEO,&nbsp;or a production worker, everyone has to work hard, not only in Singapore, but in&nbsp;other parts of the world as well.&nbsp; The only difference is that when we work hard, at least in Singapore, we can see the rewards.&nbsp; So, that is the second taxi driver.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I remember most poignantly and&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;the third taxi driver whom I met some time ago.&nbsp; I took his taxi and, because it was a long journey from&nbsp;my office to home,&nbsp;we had a long nice conversation, and when I asked him about his family and so on,&nbsp;without prompting, he told me proudly that he has three children who are graduates, two of whom are scholars -&nbsp;one is doing a PhD overseas,&nbsp;one is doing his Masters and&nbsp;another is doing a local degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was very proud about it.&nbsp; To me, this is a very clear example of social mobility in Singapore that, if we put in our efforts, we do our best, there are rewards which the system provides.&nbsp; These rewards do not apply only to those who are&nbsp;at the very top, but those who are at the lower end also have&nbsp;the chance to move up.&nbsp; I think the dream and the hope for Singaporeans must be that, as we <p align=left>Column: 876</p>globalise and get plugged into this global economy, our Government will continue to provide that hope, will continue to help us to fulfil those dreams of our people.&nbsp; I think that is very important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I wish to thank all the speakers&nbsp;who have contributed to this debate, in particular the new MPs who are making their maiden speeches.&nbsp; I would, in particular, also like to thank the Prime Minister for his speech which, I am sure, has filled Singaporeans with a great deal of confidence in our future and in our efforts to build an inclusive society.&nbsp;

Prof. Ong Soh Khim. They spoke on a broad range of topics ranging from sports and casinos to competitiveness and entrepreneurship, from the environment to juvenile delinquency, to R&amp;D, to&nbsp;scholarships.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, they were critical of Government policies,&nbsp;at other times, they supported our policies.&nbsp; They added fresh perspectives to the debates in this Chamber, with their objective non-partisan views.&nbsp; They did not have to resort to political posturing.&nbsp; In summary, I believe that they have been a plus for our Parliament.&nbsp; I therefore commend Members to once again vote in favour of the motion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when the same motion was moved by the Leader of the House in 1992, 1997 and 2002, the Party Whip was lifted.&nbsp; For this motion, I wish to inform Members that the Whip would also be lifted, on an exceptional basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 880</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

They do not take sides.&nbsp; They are supposed to remain neutral.&nbsp; They are said to represent a third voice, if there is such a thing as a third voice.&nbsp; I personally do not think so.&nbsp; One is either for or against the issue.&nbsp; Sitting on&nbsp;the fence, according to one renowned American Secretary of State, is immoral.&nbsp; Therefore, I do not think that the NMPs of this House would want to sit on the fence.&nbsp; But this&nbsp;creates a dilemma for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, NMPs cannot be effective.&nbsp; They do not represent any constituents, but they are also barred from voting on certain important subjects, for example, any amendments to the Constitution or Bills relating to the provision of money, or grants to the Government, taxes and public funds.&nbsp; They also cannot vote on any motion of no confidence against the Government and a motion to remove the President from office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The appointment of NMPs to Parliament is a waste of taxpayers' money.&nbsp; Now that the PAP is having a massive renewal exercise after each election, the new PAP MPs recruited are <p align=left>Column: 881</p>touted to be the best and the brightest.&nbsp; Some have even been appointed to office before they have any experience as an MP.&nbsp; This move is to show the public that the PAP has the best crop of capable candidates to be their Members of Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if that is so, then the PAP has enough talent on its side to offer fresh and good ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, there is no need to appoint NMPs to further contribute&nbsp;fresh ideas in this House.&nbsp; Or is it that, inwardly, the PAP is not really that confident of its new MPs and need NMPs to bolster them up?&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to me, the appointment of NMPs is purely for political reasons.&nbsp; The thinking behind its formation, I believe, is something like this.&nbsp; The PAP perceives that Singaporeans generally want them to rule the country and, at the same time, the people of Singapore also want the Opposition's voice in Parliament.&nbsp; So, to comply with these wishes, the PAP introduced the idea of NMPs and they can serve as the voice of the Opposition in Parliament.&nbsp; I think that is the reason why NMPs are appointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP concept is definitely more useful to the PAP than to the people of Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not support the motion.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.17 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I, too, rise to speak against the motion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister has earlier referred us to the original aims of the NMP scheme as elucidated by the then-Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 1989.&nbsp; In addition to the rationale given by the Minister earlier, ie, to strengthen our system, provide more opportunities for participation and to have a more consensual style of government to allow dissenting voices to be heard, he also said <p align=left>Column: 882</p>that the NMP scheme would cater for&nbsp;"Singaporeans who can contribute but who for good reasons have no desire to go into politics or to look after a constituency to enter Parliament."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, firstly, has the NMP scheme really strengthened our political system?&nbsp; To be fair, this is hard to assess because the backdrop is one where the ruling party has continued to consolidate its power by other means.&nbsp; For example, since 1988 till now, the size of the electoral group representation constituencies has increased from three to six Members, and the GRC populations have also increased from about 50,000 to nearly 185,000 voters today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, should those without a desire to go into politics or to look after a constituency enter Parliament?&nbsp; While I do agree with the Minister that the NMPs can bring fresh ideas, the question is: for&nbsp;whom do they speak?&nbsp; They do not offer themselves for election by the public, do not have any mandate from the voters, nor do they answer to the people.&nbsp; Should they then be empowered to make laws affecting Singaporeans?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans must decide who should be in Parliament.&nbsp; The NMP scheme generates intellectual discourse without political pressure, as the NMPs do not take votes away from the ruling Party during the elections.&nbsp; And if this is what then-DPM Goh meant by "consensual style of government", then it sidelines ordinary Singaporeans from the process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, history has also shown that the ruling Party has attempted to use the NMP scheme to convince the voters that there is no need to vote for Opposition MPs.&nbsp; For example, in the 2001 election, literature circulated by a PAP candidate urged voters not to vote for the Workers' Party candidate as the NMPs were there to check on the Government.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 883</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Workers' Party does not support the NMP scheme and, for these reasons, I oppose the motion.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I listened very carefully to Mr Chiam.&nbsp; He made quite a number of points - seven points according to my notes - and every single one of those points has been made by him in the past debates in 1992 and 1997, and every single one of those points has also been explained and responded to in every one of those debates.&nbsp; So, I guess we could, of course, rehash and go through <I>Hansard</I>, which I have a copy here.&nbsp; It is about this thick and&nbsp;I could refer him to just the pages.&nbsp; But to be fair,&nbsp;these are important points that he has raised, and I think I should address them very briefly.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam has three main points, in my view.&nbsp; The first one is that it is not democratic.&nbsp; The question&nbsp;is:&nbsp; why is it not democratic?&nbsp; Is democracy only about elected Members of Parliament?&nbsp; If so, then why is it that they have nominated members in the House of Lords?&nbsp; They are not elected.&nbsp; Why is it that they have nominated members in the Malaysian Senate?&nbsp; They are not elected.&nbsp;Are they not democratic countries?&nbsp; Many countries have a two-chamber system.&nbsp; We have decided that we will have a single chamber.&nbsp; I do not think anybody can say that, with the NMPs in Parliament,&nbsp;we are not a democratic society.&nbsp; The central tenet of democracy is&nbsp;that the people are allowed to have a free and fair election for the government of their choice every few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that Singaporeans enjoy and would very dearly love&nbsp;to keep.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody&nbsp;can say that Singapore is not a democracy just because we have NMPs in Parliament.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first&nbsp;response I would like to make to Mr Chiam's point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 884</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the second point is that they are a neutral voice, they are non-partisan and,&nbsp;hence they are not considered to be&nbsp;as good as elected MPs or the Non-Constituency MP.&nbsp; We have never said that the Nominated MP is equal to the elected MP or indeed to the NCMP.&nbsp; What we are saying is that we would like to have a system whereby a group of&nbsp;individuals come to this Chamber who have something to say, who make&nbsp;a contribution in Parliament, non-partisan.&nbsp; They do not have to say something because they have to say something.&nbsp; Opposition MPs cannot play that role.&nbsp; They must oppose.&nbsp; When we say something, they find ways and means to trip us up, find fault, embarrass, to score points.&nbsp; And that is their job.&nbsp; When was the last time that an Opposition MP supported a Government policy?&nbsp; But what we want in this Chamber is not just views from PAP MPs and, of course, predictably, the opposing view from Opposition MPs, but we also want other voices, voices that look at it in an objective and non-partisan way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is like in a school debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the proposition and the opposition.&nbsp; If you are put into the proposing team, you have to say one thing; if you are put in the opposing team, you have to say the opposite, even though you do not believe it.&nbsp; So, I am sure, some Members of the Opposition may sometimes find themselves in a very difficult position.&nbsp; But that is their job.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the speakers from the floor.&nbsp; These are the people who contribute to the debate as well.&nbsp; They make their views heard.&nbsp; Sometimes they speak in favour of the motion, sometimes against the motion.&nbsp; And I believe that they also contribute to the debate.&nbsp; So, in the same way, the NMPs play a very useful role.&nbsp; They contribute to the debate in this House and, as I said, many of our NMPs in the past and in the recent&nbsp;Parliament have made significant contributions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 885</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point Mr Chiam made is that NMPs are appointed for political reasons.&nbsp; He believes that people want the PAP to form the Government to run the country but they also want some opposition voices in Parliament and, therefore, this is the PAP's way of providing for opposition voices in Parliament.&nbsp; That is not the case.&nbsp; Nominated Members of Parliament do not come to this Chamber to either support or oppose the Government.&nbsp; The then-Deputy Prime Minister made it very clear that what we are looking for are non-partisan voices, professionals, people who are knowledgeable in their field, have something to say and contribute.&nbsp; If they support the Government policies, it must be because they believe that that is the right thing to do.&nbsp; And if on certain issues they oppose, this is again something that they believe they have to oppose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not see why having NMPs in Parliament would in any way make people feel that&nbsp;our MPs are not doing a good job in Parliament.&nbsp; How the people view how we do our job in Parliament is dependent on us, on what we say and how we behave and how we contribute in this Chamber.&nbsp; The NMP scheme is not in lieu of the Opposition;&nbsp; it is in addition to both the Government as well as the Opposition MPs in this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I&nbsp;say this to the NCMP as well, because she made essentially the same point, that this is not to discourage people from voting for the Opposition.&nbsp; People will vote for the Opposition if they believe that they have a platform worth voting for, and they will reject the Opposition if they feel that the Opposition's platform is not workable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, on this basis, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend to Members once again that we should support the NMP scheme and&nbsp;continue to have NMPs in this Parliament because they are a plus to our House.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Members of the House of Lords are all appointed Members.&nbsp; I agree that they are not elected.&nbsp; But it has got a different function.&nbsp; They do&nbsp;not represent the people and&nbsp;do not purport to represent the power of the people.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;there just for purposes of reviewing whatever the House of Commons has done, in particular, Bills that need to be approved by the Queen.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we want a second chamber, then we should set up a second chamber.&nbsp; Why sneak in the Nominated MPs?&nbsp; As the Minister knows, in a democratic country, the sovereignty of the state rests with the people.&nbsp; Of course, all the people cannot speak on their behalf, so they elected MPs.&nbsp; Their power is handed to them to speak on their behalf.&nbsp; So we have this House of Representatives, which is what the Americans call their Lower Chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;So ours is like the House of Representatives.&nbsp; We are all representatives of the people.&nbsp; We take responsibility for them, and whatever they want us to say in Parliament, we say it for them on certain issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the purpose of the House of Commons - in our case, we have only a single chamber - is for elected representatives to be in Parliament to speak on behalf of the people.&nbsp; But in the case of Nominated MPs, they do not represent anyone.&nbsp; So how can you call them to be democratic?&nbsp; They are not democratic.&nbsp; They speak only on their own behalf and they do not speak for any constituency or part of constituencies.&nbsp; At least the NCMP has got some representation in Parliament and therefore they can be called democratic.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All I can say is that those are the exceptions that prove the rule because, generally speaking, the Opposition Members have not supported Government policies, not because they are not good policies but because they are in the Opposition. And that is really the essence of what I am trying to say.&nbsp;The Opposition's views&nbsp;are constrained. When they&nbsp;speak, they&nbsp;have to&nbsp;oppose the Government.&nbsp;With the NMP scheme, which I commend to the House, the NMPs who come to this House&nbsp;add value to the debate&nbsp;over and above what we are saying, over and above what the Opposition Members are saying.&nbsp; Here&nbsp;is a group of people who&nbsp;represent certain interests, who have certain specific views.&nbsp; They come to this House, with our blessings of course, because&nbsp;we decide whether we have them in this House.&nbsp;&nbsp;They come here and add value to the debates in this Chamber. And there is nothing undemocratic about it because, as I have explained, we are not the only ones who have Nominated Members in this House. The House of Lords may have a different function, according to the MP for Potong Pasir, but essentially, the crux of the matter is that they are not elected by the people, but appointed.&nbsp; And they are as democratic as any other Parliament.&nbsp; In fact, apart from the two examples I cited,&nbsp;in the debate to amend the Constitution, the Deputy Prime Minister at that time gave a long list of about 20 other countries which also have Nominated Members of Parliament in different variations.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> Last clarification, Mr Chiam.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> Sir, I do not think the Minister mentioned one point I brought up.&nbsp; I said that, nowadays, after every election, there seems to be a massive number of new PAP MPs.&nbsp; Is he admitting that with so many bright young fresh PAP MPs coming to Parliament,&nbsp;there are still not enough people&nbsp;to give <p align=left>Column: 889</p>ideas to the Government and they still need to have more Nominated MPs to supplement the ideas given by the PAP MPs?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, I do not think the Member of Parliament needs to worry about the PAP MPs.&nbsp; I think he knows that the PAP MPs are able to acquit themselves well.&nbsp; If he&nbsp;sits&nbsp;in the Chamber and listens to their maiden speeches, I think&nbsp;he will know that they are able, as the Prime Minister said, to not just find their voice, but also their feet.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, having said that, what is wrong with having more views, more people in this Chamber, debating, giving us the benefit of their views and their wisdom?

For the first and second child, while employers continue to pay for 8 weeks of maternity leave, the Government pays for the additional 4 weeks of maternity leave, up to a cap of $10,000.&nbsp; And for the third and fourth child, Government pays for the entire 12 weeks of leave, subject to a cap of $30,000.&nbsp;

In general, the external-oriented industries catering to the global market, such <p align=left>Column: 893</p>as electronics, biomedical sciences and chemicals, tend to have higher and more volatile growth.&nbsp; In comparison, the growth of industries like retail and restaurants which are more focused on our much smaller domestic market is slower.<p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That export-oriented industries often enjoy much faster growth than domestic industries is not a new phenomenon.&nbsp; Since independence, we have been attracting externally-oriented industries to Singapore.&nbsp; Beyond the new activities and capabilities brought by these industries, we also benefit from their growth permeating to the rest of the economy.&nbsp; The pace at which the economic benefits of each export-oriented industry filter to other industries will vary from case to case. The more flexible our labour markets and versatile our manpower skills are, the faster the rate of transmission will be. For instance, the growth of our electronics sector generates activity in our supporting precision engineering sector, which employs over a quarter of all local workers in manufacturing.&nbsp; The jobs created in turn benefit our retail and restaurant sectors, among others.&nbsp; In the past few years, the strong performance of the export oriented industries has brought growth to the whole economy.&nbsp; The retail sector provides an illustration.&nbsp; Reflecting the health of the sector, retail sales have been growing strongly for the past three and a half years.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, it is not meaningful to box up businesses in these&nbsp;two groups as they are not static.&nbsp; Businesses can start off serving the domestic market and later expand to cater to the global market. A recent example would be our businesses in water technologies which are beginning to take off and expand their business beyond Singapore.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of how one chooses to &lsquo;slice and dice&rsquo; the economy, one certainty is that it will continue to undergo restructuring as we move up the value chain in a globalised economy.&nbsp; Currently, our economy is doing well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now have a strong labour market with low unemployment.&nbsp; Last year, more than 110,000 (113,300) jobs were created, the strongest gain in&nbsp;eight years.&nbsp; This year, within the first&nbsp;nine months, more than 120,000 (123,100) jobs have already been generated.&nbsp; We are able to enjoy these because we have been prepared to undertake the necessary restructuring and allow the economy to ride the uplift in a favourable global economy.&nbsp; Going ahead, we will continue to help Singaporeans to acquire the skills required by new economic activities, with the ongoing retraining and job redesigning efforts.&nbsp; We will then remain in a strong position to take advantage of the tide of opportunities presented by globalisation. More Singaporeans, including those in more domestically-oriented industries, will be able to enjoy the fruits from these opportunities.<br></p></p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:HDB FLATS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:HDB FLATS:::896--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"></B><p align=left>Column: 893</p><B><P>HDB FLATS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Unsold flats--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Unsold flats)</B></span><div><BR>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim </B>asked the Minister for National Development in view of the recent months' strong interest in new HDB flat launches at Tampines and Geylang Serai (a) if the Ministry could update the House on the progress of the sale of unsold flats in estates like Jurong West; and (b) what actions have been taken to market them.</P></span>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>Column: 895</p><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB currently has about 6,000 unsold flats available for sale.
