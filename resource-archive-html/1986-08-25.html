   <b>PARKING OF MOTORCYCLES IN HDB VOID DECKS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) how widespread is the problem of indiscriminate parking by motorcyclists at Housing and Development Board apartments' void decks; and (b) whether the HDB has any plan to deal with the problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is a point of order. This question refers to indiscriminate parking of motorcycles in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Housing and Development Board apartments' void decks. May I say that I have got no complaints in respect of the constituency of Potong Pasir with regard to this problem. I think the Member ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a very unusual statement, Mr Chiam. You can ask a supplementary question if you want.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Before the Minister gives his answer?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are pre-empting the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Teh Cheang Wan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a recent sample survey of 189 apartment blocks in Serangoon Central, Tampines West and Hougang Central Estates, it was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> found that, on the average, two motorcycles were found parking in the void decks, per block, during the night.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB has served warning notices on motorcycles found parked in the void decks. Although this has resulted in getting some of the owners to park their motorcycles in authorized lots in the car parks, it has not eliminated the problem. Where the parking of motorcycles in the void decks has resulted in the staining of floors by oil leaks, the HDB has taken offenders to Court under the Environmental Public Health (Public Cleansing) Regulations 1970.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal with the problem more effectively, the HDB is currently formulating rules to prohibit the parking of motorcycles in the void decks of apartment blocks. Offenders can then be fined under such rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, supplementary question for the Minister, and that is: will he tell us whether adequate parking places for motorcyclists are provided in every housing estate, adjacent to the blocks where the residents are living? Is he aware that a number of residents, who hold season parking tickets for motorcycles, return at night to find all the parking spaces taken up and they are then forced to park outside the parking lots?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB has provided adequate motorcycle parking lots in the housing estates. Perhaps I can give the Member for Anson some figures. HDB manages a total of 103,118 motorcycle lots as at 30th June 1986, that is, up to middle of this year. Only 46,000 season tickets are sold for motorcycle parking, that is 45% In other words, out of 103,118 lots, we only managed to sell less than 50,000 season tickets, which shows that there are ample motorcycle parking lots available.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that there have been complaints by residents who hold season parking tickets that when they come back at night, at 1 am or 2 am, after their work, they find all the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> parking lots taken up, maybe not by the season parking ticket holders but by others who park there without holding any season parking tickets?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Those people who park their motorcycles without either season tickets or daily tickets are fined by HDB for taking up motorcycle lots which they are not supposed to. I do not think availability of parking lots is a problem. In most cases these motorcyclists just want to park their motorcycles in the void decks because it is more convenient or because they do not like to park their motorcycles some distance away from their block.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What steps has the HDB taken to publicize this problem or to educate the residents of housing estates not to park their motorcycles in void decks because of oil spills and other problems?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think periodically the HDB has publicized in the Home magazine the problem of parking motorcycles in the void decks, such as oil spills. And, as I have said earlier in answering the Member for Braddell Heights, HDB will be formulating rules to discourage parking of motorcycles in the void decks. These rules will be widely publicized and residents will be advised not to park their motorcycles in the void decks because they should park their motorcylces in proper parking lots. As I have said earlier, there are ample parking lots available in all the housing estates.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Since the HDB knew of this problem, in what housing estates have they publicized and carried out a programme of education in regard to this problem?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> I said it is publicized in our HDB Home magazine, which means that since all HDB residents receive a copy of the Home magazine, so all HDB residents in every estate are told of this problem.

   <b>HDB FLATS FOR ELDERLY SINGLES AND COUPLES</b>
  </div>

  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the Housing and Development Board will consider incorporating into
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> future HDB flats a hostel-like design to cater for elderly singles and/or couples who may need food and lodging while continuing to work after retirement age or for those elderly persons who may find their present flats too big and difficult to maintain.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Teh Cheang Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Teh Cheang Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the HDB is aware that over the next 10 to 20 years the proportion of the aged in the population will increase. To meet the housing needs of elderly persons, the Board is looking into the possibility of building studio apartments together with larger flat-types, such as the 4- and 5-room flats. This would enable the elderly persons to stay with their married children in separate, but adjacent, apartments. This also avoids isolating the elderly from the community at large which hostel-like arrangements tend to promote.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elderly couples who find their present flats too big and difficult to maintain can apply for smaller flats. They can sell their present flats upon allocation of the smaller flats. If the existing flat is occupied for more than five years, they can sell it in the open market.

   <b>UN SOLUTION TO THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what is the assessment of his Ministry on the pivotal role of the United Nations in the search for a solution to the Cambodian problem.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in July 1981 the United Nations convened an International Conference on Kampuchea (commonly known as the ICK) which proposed the principles for a comprehensive political settlement. The UN General Assembly has also repeatedly called for a negotiated solution in its resolutions on Cambodia since 1979. Vietnam has so far rejected the United Nations as a forum for a political settlement. However, the United Nations continues to be available for Vietnam to negotiate a settlement. The Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General and the ICK's Ad Hoc Com-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> mittee are in regular contact with Vietnam. The permanent members of the UN Security Council, which include China and the Soviet Union, also have a role to play in promoting and guaranteeing a negotiated political solution.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Bin Hj Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri (Kampong Ubi):</b> Sir, would the Foreign Minister clarify the actual position of Vietnam in respect of two conflicting reports that I have with me? Number one is a report on the 15th August. It is reported that the Thai Foreign Minister said, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He detected a new Vietnamese readiness to negotiate for an end to the conflict.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days after that, on the 17th August, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, was quoted as saying, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'He remained pessimistic about the Cambodian problem being solved during his lifetime.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Foreign Minister will enlighten on the actual or the true position of the Vietnamese readiness to negotiate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if one looks at the Kampuchean problem from the day Kampuchea was invaded, that was in December 1978, one can see that there has been a steady progression. Vietnam, which originally denied that it was in Kampuchea and which originally denied that there was such a thing as a Kampuchean problem, now admits that there is a problem and now admits that one ought to seek a solution to the problem. In that sense, I think the Vietnamese are becoming more realistic. They have also become more realistic. In their various denials that they will never negotiate with the Khmer Rouge, they are now focussing their objection on certain personalities rather than on the Khmer Rouge as a whole or on the national resistance groups. So there is a steady, slow recognition on the part of Vietnam that this problem in Kampuchea cannot be wished away. It cannot be swept under the carpet. Since the international community continues to focus on the problem, therefore, they ought to heed the views of the international community.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time there is an element of truth in Prince Sihanouk's view that the

  <br> Vietnamese have not changed their objectives or their ambitions. The Vietnamese will still like to occupy Kampuchea, digest Kampuchea, and make it part of a greater Vietnam or an Indo-Chinese federation under the domination of Vietnam. I think it is too early to say that a solution is in sight. But certainly we have moved a long way from what the position was in 1978.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Would the Minister outline to this House whether ASEAN as a body, or Singapore on its own, has taken up this readiness, whether it is genuine or not, on the part of the Vietnamese to negotiate, whether any initiative has been taken either by ASEAN or by the Singapore Government?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I must clarify that ASEAN cannot negotiate a solution with Vietnam because ASEAN is not a direct party to the conflict. It is the Kampucheans who have to negotiate with Vietnam. ASEAN can only assist by creating the right conditions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members study the various ASEAN communiques over the years, Members will note that from time to time ASEAN has made specific proposals containing some of the key elements that will be required to find a solution to this problem. We are not in direct negotiation with Vietnam but ASEAN has agreed that one of its members, ie, Indonesia, should be the interlocutor, and Indonesia is in touch with Vietnam. But I am sorry to say that there has not been much progress so far.

   <b>SAFETY MEASURES ON SCHOOL BUSES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether the safety measures imposed on school buses are adequate; and, if not, whether he will introduce other measures to ensure maximum safety to school children using these buses.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information (Mr Ho Kah Leong) (for the Minister for Communications and Information):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> asked by my Minister to reply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety measures that have been imposed on school buses are presently adequate. New safety measures will be introduced as and when they are found to be necessary and practical. The Registry of Vehicles and the Traffic Police constantly monitor the safety of school buses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, safety measures are imposed on school buses to ensure safe operations of the school bus and safe boarding and alighting for the school children. A speed limit of 50 km per hour is applied on school buses. All school buses registered on or after 1st July 1980 are required to have a split braking system which prevents total brake failure. School buses are also subjected to an annual inspection and those above 10 years are checked bi-annually. Besides checks for road worthiness, checks are also made on safety features. To ensure safe boarding and alighting, all school buses are required to have rear warning lights which warn motorists that boarding and alighting is taking place. There is also a compulsory door warning buzzer which informs the driver that the door is not closed properly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one important factor in school bus safety is passenger education. The Traffic Police will be incorporating this aspect of road safety education into their visits to schools to talk to school children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that Members of this House are concerned with safety of school buses because they carry our young school children. My Ministry shares this concern too. Continual upgrading of safety measure will be enforced to make travel on school buses as safe as humanly possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Wan Hussin Bin Hj Zoohri -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Wan Hussin bin Hj Zoohri:</b> Sir, would the Ministry of Communications consider incorporating seat belts for school children in school buses and also consider the presence of a school bus attendant in all school buses?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Sir, my Ministry is of the view that the installation of seat belts in large passenger vehicles such as school buses is not practical as it may impede mass evacuation in the event of an emergency.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font>

   <b>EDUCATION OF THE ELDERLY ON DEALING WITH CONFIDENCE TRICKSTERS</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in view of the recent spate of confidence-trickster cases on the elderly, whether his Ministry will study ways and means to educate and assist the elderly to deal with such encounters.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Boon Yang) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall answer on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 65 reported cases of cheating including attempted cheating by male confidence tricksters during the period July 1985 to July 1986. In all these cases, the victims were mostly elderly women who were tricked through the telephone. One of the culprits responsible for 34 of the 65 reported cases was recently arrested and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1982 when such cases were first reported, the Police have been taking various measures to educate the public, especially the elderly who form the most vulnerable group. This includes:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Advice on preventive measures to potential victims through the press, TV and radio and crime prevention exhibitions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Production of a 10-part short drama series on common cheating cases and preventive measures which was screened during the popular Family Hour programme last year. This programme has been videotaped and is regularly shown by the Police during the crime prevention exhibitions held at housing estates and schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Neighbourhood Police Post officers also advise residents to be wary of the latest conman tactics during their house-to-house visits.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the efforts of the Police to alert the public and to educate them against confidence tricksters will continue.

  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.
  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong</b> asked the Minister for Health, in view of a larger population of the elderly by the year 2000 and beyond, whether provisions can be made to cater for medical care and/or treatment for the less mobile elderly to be carried out in their homes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong)(for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will answer on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has already begun to provide community-based health care services for the elderly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been working closely since 1976 with the Home Nursing Foundation (HNF) to provide home nursing care for the elderly. The Ministry has been providing nurses for the HNF to visit the home-bound elderly, and to provide medical and nursing care and rehabilitation. The nurses also teach family members how to care for the elderly in their homes. This will be stepped up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HNF will also work with other organizations to increase the range of services provided so that nursing care for the elderly and the chronic sick may be increasingly provided in the home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to home nursing services, the HNF is working with grassroots organizations to set up Senior Citizens' Health Care Centres to provide day-care, rehabilitation, health education and health screening for the elderly who are mobile and semi-mobile. Two centres have already been set up in the constituencies of Kuo Chuan and Kampong Ubi. Within the next five years, 10 more centres will be established.

   <b>CPF MINIMUM SUM SCHEME FOR RETIREMENT NEEDS AFTER AGE 60</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Statement by the Acting Minister for Labour)</b>
  </div>
  <br>11.20 am
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has decided to maintain the present CPF withdrawal age of 55. Raising the CPF withdrawal age would pose problems to those who, for reasons beyond their control, are unable to work beyond 55. Instead, the Government has decided to introduce a scheme to be called the "Minimum Sum Scheme". It will provide for a minimum sum to be set aside for retirement needs after age 60.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a Singaporean aged 55 can on the average expect to live for another 20 years. If he stops work at 55, and lives only on his CPF, he will need to have sufficient savings to last him for 20 years on average. He needs to invest his savings securely to assure him of a source of income for as long as he lives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A CPF member who withdraws his savings at age 55 therefore needs to plan an average of 20 years into the future for his financial needs. Unfortunately, the best of such long-term financial plans can and do fail. If that happens, the old age security of the member would be at risk. It is against this risk that CPF members should be protected.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minimum Sum Scheme will protect a portion of the savings of CPF members, so that they will at least have a minimum income to fall back on after age 60. Under this Scheme, all CPF members can withdraw their entire CPF savings from the CPF Board at age 55 if they wish, provided certain arrangements are made, as I will explain later.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>The Minimum Sum Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum to be set aside to provide a minimum income will be based on the balance in each member's CPF account at age 55 (excluding the amount to be retained in Medisave). The sum will not be more than $30,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member who owns a property need not set aside the minimum sum if the property has a market value of at least $30,000. If the need arises, he has the value of the property to fall back upon. However, if he decides to sell or transfer his property, then the minimum sum must be set aside to ensure that he has a minimum income to live on after age 60. If he is above 60 years old at the time of the transaction, the sum to be set aside will be reduced accordingly. The legal arrangements for this are being worked out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the market value of the property is less than the Minimum Sum, the difference will be set aside from the member's CPF savings. As the market value of a 3-room HDB flat today is generally above $30,000, most CPF members who own homes need not set aside further CPF savings in cash.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those without properties, the following will apply. Those with balances of $10,000 or less need not set aside any amount under the Scheme as they may need to live on their low CPF balances after age 55. Those with balances between $10,000 and $20,000 can withdraw $10,000 at age 55 and set aside the rest to live on after age 60. For those with balances of $20,000 or more, the sum to be set aside will be half the CPF balance (excluding Medisave) up to a maximum of $30,000. Thus no member will have to set aside more than half his CPF balance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a married couple are both CPF members, their CPF accounts will be
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> considered separately. If either account is less than $10,000, it can be withdrawn completely, and so on, as I have explained. Neither of them will have to set aside more than half his or her CPF balance. If the husband has already set aside $30,000, the wife needs only set aside at most $15,000. A couple would need to set aside at most $45,000 together, instead of $30,000 each. This is because the couple can share certain living expenses. However, if only one spouse is a CPF member, he or she need only set aside, at most, $30,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a member owns property of at least $45,000 in value, both he and his wife will not be required to set aside any savings provided they retain their investments in the property. However, should they decide to sell or transfer the property, $45,000 of the proceeds or a pro-rated portion of it depending on their ages will have to be set aside.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Implementation</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Scheme will come into effect on 1st January 1987 after the Central Provident Fund Act has been amended.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Minimum Income</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $30,000 is arrived at after careful study. This amount, set aside by a member at age 55 plus interest earned, will provide him with a regular income of about $230 per month from age 60. The income will be available for about 20 years depending on the interest rate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As inflation and rising standard of living will inevitably force up the cost of living, in time to come the $230 per month will have to be adjusted so that it continues to provide sufficient income for subsistence living. The minimum sum of $30,000 will also have to be adjusted accordingly. This figure will be reviewed every three to five years to ensure that the real value of $30,000 is retained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case where both the husband and the wife are drawing monthly instalments from their respective sums set aside, their instalments will total $345 per month. This is calculated based on $45,000 set aside.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Investment Options for the Minimum Sum</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum sum to be set aside need not be kept with the CPF Board. It can be withdrawn at age 55 and invested in an approved bank deposit which will pay the member a monthly income of $230 per month from age 60 until the sum, together with normal commercial interest earned, is exhausted. If he dies before the entire amount is exhausted, the balance will be paid to his nominees or, if there are no nominees, to his estate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, a member can use the Minimum Sum to purchase an approved annuity plan from an insurance company which will pay him a monthly income from age 60 for about 20 years or until he dies. Depending on the annuity plan, his dependants may also receive some money if he dies before a specified age.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member chooses to, he can keep the sum with the CPF Board earning tax-free CPF interest. The Board will act like a bank and similarly pay out $230 per month until the sum and interest are exhausted.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Protection for the Minimum Sum</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minimum Sum will be protected by law from seizure by creditors. This will apply regardless of whether the Minimum Sum is deposited with a bank, left with the CPF Board, used to purchase an annuity policy from an insurance company or invested in a property. Thus, if a member loses all his other savings, he will at least have the Minimum Sum to fall back upon for subsistence living.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Other Exclusions from the Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member who is already assured of a retirement income no less than that provided for in the Scheme will not be required to set aside the Minimum Sum. Thus, a member who is provided with a sufficient sum of retirement income under the Government Pension Scheme, an approved company pension scheme, or an annuity scheme will be excluded from the Minimum Sum Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-citizens and non-permanent residents will also be excluded unless they continue to work or reside in Singapore after age 55.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who are above the age of 55 on the commencement date of the Scheme will be excluded from the Scheme even though they may have savings in their CPF accounts. They may, however, opt to participate in the Scheme to protect their minimum savings if they wish.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Members covered by the Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first few years of operation of the Scheme, only about 3,000 members each year will need to set aside part of their CPF savings in cash under the Minimum Sum Scheme. Eventually, as we approach the target of 100% home ownership, almost all CPF members and/or their spouses will have invested at least the Minimum Sum in properties and need not set aside additional CPF savings in cash under the Scheme. Their Minimum Sums will be protected by law such that they will at least have these sums to fall back upon as a last resort to ensure their financial security after retirement.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Improvement to the CPF Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minimum Sum Scheme improves on the existing CPF Scheme by making it more complete. The objective is to allow CPF members maximum discretion in managing their CPF savings both before and after age 55, whilst ensuring that most members would have at least the minimum sum to live on after retirement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have prepared three annexes to illustrate the main points of the Scheme. I would like to ask the Clerk of Parliament now to distribute them. They are marked Annexes (Cols. 631 - 634) A, B. and C. [Copies of documents distributed to Members.]
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1986/19860825/19860825-HA-0480631.htm">Annexes - MAIN FEATURES OF THE MINIMUM SUM SCHEME (Cols. 631 - 634)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annex A lists out the main points of the Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The withdrawal age remains at 55.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Minimum Sum to be set aside at age 55 is $30,000 for subsistence living after age 60.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Members who own properties worth at least $30,000 need not set aside any minimum sum in cash.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) CPF members with low balances need only set aside smaller amounts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At age 55, if a member has (excluding Medisave): -
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) $10,000 or less CPF savings, he can take out all the savings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) If he has between $10,000 and $20,000, he can take out $10,000 and set aside the remainder. For example, if he has $16,000, he will set aside $6,000 and take out $10,000. The $6,000 can be put in a bank or with an insurance company, or with the CPF Board.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) If he has between $20,000 and $60,000, he can take out half of the savings and set aside the remainder.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) If he has more than $60,000, then the maximum he has to put aside is only $30,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The amount set aside need not be kept with the CPF Board. It can be (a) deposited in an approved bank account which pays $230 per month from age 60, or (b) used to purchase an approved annuity with an insurance company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any residual value upon death will be paid to the member's nominees or, if there are no nominees, to his estate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) A husband and a wife who are both CPF members need to set aside separately or together at most only $45,000 in total instead of $30,000 each.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) The Scheme will come into effect on 1st January, 1987, after the CPF Act has been amended.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The Minimum Sum will be protected by law from creditors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annexes B and C are two examples to show how the Scheme will be applied. Annex B is for the case of a member without property and Annex C is for a member with property.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek some clarification from the Acting Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the Acting Minister because it is a gem of a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> scheme. It maintains the withdrawal age at the age of 55 and yet still leaves room for our citizens to who have at least some funds for their twilight years. Sir, the Acting Minister did say that the sum of $30,000 for subsistence living has been carefully worked out. I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether he could perhaps at a later date show how this sum was derived.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. According to the Scheme, it appears that the retained sum at age 55 would not be touched until the member is 60 years old. Does this mean that the interest earned during this five-year period could be withdrawn as a lump sum at the age of 60 or even earlier, between 55 and 60? Or does this mean that the accumulated interest is to be treated as part of the sum set aside?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, is that if a member decides to place the fund in a bank or to buy an annuity from a insurance company, would the interest earned either from the deposit or the annuity be subjected to income tax? On this point, Sir, I would like to say that I have some interest in it because I am working in a bank.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point, Sir. I realize that the Scheme provides much flexibility. However, would the Acting Minister consider other schemes which are in line with the spirit of this new CPF proposal? For example, would the Minister consider another method which could be a type that permits deductions to be put into an account which at age 55 will automatically be converted into an annuity, and the deductions to be made from the current CPF contribution?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to ask, what happens when the sum is exhausted by the member? He could be 75 or 80 or even 85 years old. Has the Government any financial plans to take care of these people?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join in asking clarifications from the Minister. I have two points. First, perhaps the Minister would like to let this House know as to the number of CPF contributors who have less than $30,000 in savings.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annuity scheme proposed is yet another safeguard to ensure that the retirees would not end up destitute. If properly pro-rated, the Scheme would provide the retirees with sufficient means for the rest of their lives. There is a need to explain, especially to the lower income group or to the less educated retirees, how this Scheme works and how they could benefit from such a Scheme. Would the Minister enlighten whether an advisory committee will be formed to explain the Scheme and how to reach this group of people, so that they will really understand and participate actively in such a scheme should it be implemented?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to make some clarifications and make some comments on the Ministerial Statement?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, what is the rationale? Why is it necessary at age 55 for the Government to retain $30,000? The last Minister for Health has already given some idea of what the Government's thinking was at that time. He said that if the people of Singapore take out their CPF savings when they reach 55, they will squander their money. Does this rationale still stand from the Government's point of view? I see no rationale at all. The Government has promised to pay back to the members their money at age 55 and now they say they are going to retain part of it. I say this is definitely a breach of promise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum sum suggested at present is $30,000. But can the Minister guarantee this House that this amount will not be raised out of proportion, out of step, with inflation? Perhaps the Minister could give us a categorical answer to this question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noted here that when a member dies, his money will be given to the nominee or to the estate. I cannot understand this point. A man works hard and when he reaches 55 he still continues to save until, let us say, at the age of 57. Then he dies and his nominee will get all the money, a big lump sum. What happens then? Is there a situation like this? He is not protected. I am talking about his nominee. What happens if he dies at age 57?

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The member dies at age 57. No, not the nominee. It looks like the Government seems to take the CPF members' money very lightly. I think we show more concern than the Government in regard to the workers' savings. As you say, they are the workers' money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of 3,000 has been mentioned as the number involved in this retention of $30,000. Perhaps the Minister could clarify because, as I see from last year's withdrawal from CPF - section 12 covers all the cases - perhaps he could tell us how much money has been withdrawn by members at age 55. Under section 12, the amount was over $500 million and, according to Government statistics, those members who have got a balance of less than $30,000 comprise about 85-86%. In other words, the $30,000 will, in fact, catch all the members. Perhaps the Minister could clarify this point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I also ask the Minister whether or not the need to retain this CPF money which is, in fact, the workers' money, is because the Government is worried about the falling rate of contribution as reported the last time because of the cut in the employer's portion of the CPF? The Government, of course, always boasts that it has got no external debt but may I say that the CPF money and moneys which have been used comprise the Government's debt to the people of Singapore. This is a debt to the people of Singapore and, of course, as you know, in other countries if they cannot repay their external debts they have got a scheme called rescheduling. Is this a scheme of Government, rescheduling their own debts? Please explain. Are you afraid that in time to come, in the year 2000 when there is a declining rate of our population, there are not enough young people working to contribute to the CPF and when there are too many withdrawals? Let us hear it. Up to date, the Government has not come out with a specific answer, clearly, to say that it has enough money to pay back the CPF money in 20 or 25 years' time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Rubbish!

  <br>
  <br> Government has always been accusing others of not being able to justify. We have justified it in our figures. Let us see yours - whether the Government has the means to finance the repayment of CPF. Surely, the reason given by the Government through the last Minister for Health cannot be the reason. In fact, if it is, then it is a slap on the Government's face. After 25 years, you bring up a whole generation and at age 55 they cannot look after their own financial interest? What is this Government trying to say? Is it because you cannot trust our own people with money at age 55? If you can, then pay them back the money, the whole lot. After all, it is their money. Why should you retain this sum of $30,000? The more worrying point is: are you going to stick to $30,000? I can lay a bet on my last dollar that, if this Government stays in power, it will be raised.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a few questions for the Minister. First of all, may I ask whether the Government has considered the situation of persons who, being obliged to leave the greater part of their savings behind with the CPF Board at the age of 55, may probably find themselves out of employment before they reach the age of 60 because the sum to be paid only begins at the age of 60, as I understand it? Has the Government considered the situation of these people who may be out of a job and not be in receipt of any income until they reach the age of 60?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: will the CPF publish - as it is we are not getting proper accounts from the CPF about their investments - will the CPF publish full accounts of where the moneys are invested when they are left with the CPF Board? What interest is earned on these moneys that are left behind, and what proportion of it is paid to the contributors, the persons who left their moneys.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. I see the intention is to try and make the CPF Scheme partially a pension scheme. Would the Ministry consider now, quite seriously, converting the whole of it into a pension or annuity scheme for our residents so that they start contributing towards this pension from the time they commence employment, and which will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> then afford them security in their old age? It will not then be necessary for them to put away a quarter of their earnings every month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question is this. In view of the complete change in the Government's stand, which was that the contributor would be able to withdraw all his savings at the age of 55 and now that he is not allowed to withdraw all his savings, would the Ministry consider appointing a committee to seek the views of the contributors on this plan or scheme announced by the Minister? I think it is only right that they should be heard, what they think about it, and whether they can come up with something better than the Ministry.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Radin Mas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Ministerial Statement has come as a relief to all Singaporeans. In view of the complex nature of the Scheme, the Ministry of Labour or the CPF Board, or both, should make every effort and utilize all available communication channels to explain the complexities of the Scheme. CPF officials should also be well-versed in the Scheme when attending to any queries from contributors to prevent any misunderstanding. I hope the Minister will give us this assurance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I have now is on the $30,000 minimum sum. Is it meant to be a net sum after the bank loan or mortgage, or is it just the value of the house? In other words, you can buy a house for $100,000 but you are actually borrowing $80,000. You have only paid a down payment of $20,000. So does the $30,000 refer to the value of the house, or is the minimum sum the net sum after the bank loan?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I have is on the $10,000 limit. It does appear that actually this Scheme, for all intents and purposes, will affect very few CPF contributors because I think the majority of members at the moment have less than $10,000 each. Will the Minister explain why is this sum set, and does it mean that this group of people require less protection than those who have more than $10,000 in their CPF?
  <br>

  <br> will the Minister clarify as to who will decide on the value of the property? Secondly, after the minimum sum has been established, based on the property, will there be a periodical revaluation to adjust the minimum sum required?

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a question for the Minister. My question concerns couples and let us suppose the breadwinner has more than $60,000 in his CPF account. Let us consider the case of two couples. In one case, the spouse is not a CPF member but in another case the spouse is a CPF member, and for argument's sake, let us say the spouse has a very small sum of $1,000 in the CPF account. Is it true that the minimum sum retained will be $45,000 in both cases or is it $30,000 in one case and $45,000 in the other case? Is it not strange that in one case where the spouse is not a CPF member, the minimum sum is only $30,000 whereas in the other case, if the spouse during his or her lifetime only works for a very short period of time, then the minimum sum has to be increased to $45,000?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek one clarification. May I ask the Minister whether after an amount has been set aside by CPF contribution by a member, and he has occasion to need to use his money as a lump sum, would any allowance be given to him to use this money as a lump sum? For example, he might want to use the money to purchase an HDB flat or for some very urgent personal expenses?

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members for their questions. I am sure, as I explain the rationale and give my answers, it will become clearer to the public how the scheme is worked out. It would help my explanation, Sir, if I could now be allowed to distribute some additional tables (Cols. 635 - 650) which I have prepared. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tables will provide data on some of the points that have been raised.
  <br>
  <a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1986/19860825/19860825-HA-0480635.htm">tables - POPULATION (PER THOUSAND) LIVING AT VARIOUS AGES, 1980, DEPENDENCY RATIOS, PERSONS 55 YEARS &amp; ABOVE, PROPORTION OF POPULATION 55 YEARS OR ABOVE, Impact of Minimum Sum Scheme in 1st Five Years of Implementation (Cols. 635 - 650)</a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to answer the questions in the order they have been raised, dealing first with the question from the Member for Jalan Kayu. He asked how the sum of $30,000 is derived. The answer is very simple. The CPF member puts aside $30,000 at age 55, say, he puts it in a bank. The capital plus interest that he will earn from this deposit is worked out into the form of an annuity. He will be able to withdraw from age 60 $230 per month for a period of about 20 years. The period depends on the interest rate. At present the interest rate on bank deposits is about 4¦%. At that rate, if you check the calculations, you will find that the sum will last just about 20 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question is: what is the tax position on the interest earned or the annuities? I am glad to inform Members that the Ministry of Finance has agreed in principle to exempt tax on the interest derived from bank deposits earned by this minimum sum in the hands of the CPF member. The same position will apply also to annuities. In the event the member buys an annuity scheme, where he uses the minimum sum to buy a stream of income, a regular stream, until he dies or over a certain period, the Ministry of Finance has agreed in principle to exempt tax on these annuity payments, provided the minimum sum is the ceiling on the capital amount. The details are still being worked out and we will announce further details later on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked whether we would consider other schemes. I take it that he has in mind some kind of an endowment plan where a member from a young age contributes monthly from his CPF into a plan which will buy a capital sum which at age 55 is converted into an annuity to earn a stream of income for as long as he lives or over a certain period. The answer to that is, yes, we can consider it in principle provided the plan is for the Minimum Sum. We must realize that endowment plans involve two elements. The first element is an insurance element. The other element is an investment element. In the case of the insurance
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> element, it is good for a young member to have this protection. In other words, after contributing a few instalments, he dies and his dependants will get the sum insured. This is good. On the other hand, if he does not die before age 55, which is the most likely situation fortunately, then the premiums paid would have been spent. It is really a form of consumption of CPF savings to buy protection for the member's dependants. Therefore, we have to make sure that the amounts spent are not excessive because the CPF savings are basically for the member's old age requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the investment element is concerned, it is a question of comparing the returns from this endowment plan with other forms of investment. It might be better for the CPF member, say, to put it in some other form, say, shares, or even leave it with the CPF Board if the interest earned on the CPF deposit is higher than what can be earned from the insurance plan. But in principle there is no objection to an endowment policy so long as it is limited to the minimum sum. There is one further condition. The endowment plan and the subsequent annuities cannot be terminated because, in a commercial arrangement, you can surrender the policy. But for the purpose of the Scheme, the endowment policy cannot be surrendered because the intention is to protect the member as long as he lives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has asked one other question, and that is: when the Minimum Sum is exhausted when the member reaches the age of 70 or 75, what happens then? The answer is that we have based the Minimum Sum Scheme for 20 years on the average. This is the average life expectancy of a person at age 60. If you look at the Table that I have given you, Annex 1 shows the life expectancy of male Singaporeans as at 1980, and Annex 2 is for females. For females, the life expectancy is generally a few years longer than for males. If you look down the column marked "60 years of age", you will see that if there are 1,000 persons aged 60, then on average about half will live beyond 75.3 years. The number shows how many males will survive at different ages. After 75, there will still be another 306 males
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> who will live to the age of 80 and beyond, and another 145 males will live beyond 85.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best plan for the individual really is to buy an annuity scheme for life. In this scheme, what happens is that the members contribute their funds to an insurance pool. Those who live shorter or who die earlier will subsidize those who live longer. The point is that nobody knows how long he is going to live. Death will come for certain but when, nobody knows for sure. How do you plan? So if you contribute to this kind of a pool and if it so happens that you live longer, and there is a 50-50 chance you will live beyond 75, then the money from the other members will be used to subsidize you.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In buying annuity plans, there are three kinds of plans. One is a straightforward plan which is called annuity certain, where you put the money with the insurance company and they pay you the full sum back after a period of time. It is just like a bank deposit. That is a financial arrangement. The other arrangement is a life annuity where you pay a capital sum to the insurance company and the company guarantees you a fixed amount every month until you die. But if the member dies, then nothing is left. The third plan is a combination of the two. It is called a guaranteed life annuity where you get a sum of money for life. But if you die before a certain age, then the balance of the amount will be paid to your dependants. We have done the calculations and found that $30,000 roughly, will be enough for each of these three schemes. It appears to us that the guaranteed life annuity scheme is, in fact, the most advantageous.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may want to consider structuring their financial plans after 55 somewhat along those lines, in other words, using the amount of money to buy a sum guaranteed for life. It may be two times the minimum sum, three times the minimum sum. It is up to them; their own option. What we have here is only the minimum scheme. Members who have higher CPF savings may want to use this as an example and set aside part of their money for as long as they live through an annuity plan. As for the balance, he can be more flexible about using the money.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if a person does not have enough savings and if he does not also have family support and so on, and his money is used up, then he will have to depend on support by the society at large and by the Government. I think nobody is running away from that role. What we are trying to do is to minimize the number of people who will fall into that position. But it is no joy to be in an old age home. The thinking of the Government is that the best way to help a person is to make it possible for him to help himself. So the CPF scheme is arranged in such a manner that every member will have sufficient savings for his old age. He is asked to save from the time he works until he retires. Having done so, he must also ensure that his savings are properly invested to last him over his retirement years. So every member should plan for himself. What we have done really is the minimum for everybody on the premise that the people want to manage their own savings - which is good. But there should be a minimum safety net for all CPF members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving now to the questions from the Member for Pasir Panjang. He wanted to know how many members have less than $30,000. I think if you look at Annex 8 that I have given out, there is a Table there showing how many CPF members will reach 55 in the next five years; and of those numbers how many will be home owners and therefore they need not set aside any cash; how many pensionable officers will be excluded, and so on. For example, in the first year, there will be a total of about 18,000 CPF members who will reach 55 in 1987. In that group, about 3,400 are non-Singaporeans or non-permanent residents. So they are not covered. 600 are pensionable officers. Another 5,700 have used their CPF for properties, so they need not set aside cash if the value of the property is sufficient. Then there are 5,600 members who have less than $10,000 each. We have to release whatever money they have because they need the money to live on between the ages of 55 and 60. If they have stopped work, they need to have this money to live on. If we ask them to stretch this money over a longer period, the sum would be so small that it is not meaningful. So the problem for this group is that they do not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have enough savings. As for the others, a total of 2,800 members in the first year will have to set aside various sums of money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must make it clear that the money does not have to be kept withe the CPF Board. Members can withdraw the whole amount. I think this point was missed by the Opposition Members when they said that we are trying to retain the money. We are saying that you can take out all the money at age 55, every cent, excluding Medisave which is a different scheme. Every cent in your Ordinary Account, every cent in your Special Account can be withdrawn at age 55. But we have worked out a scheme for you such that if you have not got a house, then it is better for you to initially live on half the amount and set aside the balance under a scheme which will ensure there is financial security for the rest of your life, and that means stretching out the money in monthly instalments. So the money still belongs to the member. And if he has not used up all his money before he dies, it goes to his family.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Pasir Panjang also asked how do we plan to explain this to the lower income group. I think this is a problem because we are trying to do it through television, the press and so on. My Ministry is thinking of mailing out a simple question and answer leaflet to every CPF member so that they will at least have the facts straight and not be confused by distorted stories. I hope that the hon. Members here will help us in this task of explaining to their constituents as well as others, for example, the unionists; I think a lot of them will want to know how the scheme affects them. So this is something in which all of us have to play a part.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the questions from the Member for Potong Pasir. He asked what is the rationale for this scheme. I think the rationale is very clear to all the other Members. I do not know why it was not clear to him. I have already explained in full in the Statement as well as in answering some of the questions the basic thinking behind the scheme. We are not saying that Singaporeans are spendthrift, that they will squander their money. Far
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from it. We think that the majority can manage but there are some who may be struck by misfortune, who may be too generous with their families, and some who may be caught by confidence tricksters. We have heard of how some confidence tricksters cheated over the telephone. In future there will be more and more old people with substantial CPF savings. So something must be done to help them preserve their savings. They may not realize that they may live up to 75 years or beyond. So what we have done is to design a scheme which is no more than what a reasonable person would do in planning his financial resources after 55. If you remember, in last Friday's Straits Times, there were three vivid examples of people who, although they were fairly educated, met misfortunes in various ways. This goes to illustrate what can happen to your money. I am not saying that it is a very common occurrence, but it is sufficiently common for mony of us to have come across such instances personally.

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> What about success stories?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes, success stories too. Of the two success stories published on Saturday, the first one clarified that it was a big risk for him to go into business. He invested not only his CPF savings but also his house and everything else. I do not know how many people want to take that kind of risk with their life savings. The second case is just backing up the story saying, "You must plan carefully." But it is true that the majority can manage and that is why, in designing the scheme, I have tried to make it such that it causes minimum inconvenience to the members. If a member owns a property of sufficient value, all he has to do when he withdraws his money at age 55 is to sign a form saying, "I nominate this property to be the asset in which I owe the Minimum Sum," and deposit it with the CPF Board. So long as he does not sell the house, his position has not changed. He can withdraw all his CPF savings and still have the house. And he will need a house to live in for as long as he lives. So the position has not changed for him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the members with low balances, we have designed a scheme to help them, really. At first, they may feel that we are trying to impose on them but really the scheme is such that we have considered what a person might need at age 55. They might have already made certain plans to use that money. So we allow them to withdraw as much of the money, front-end at age 55, as possible. If he has less than $10,000, everything is withdrawn. If he has between $10,000 and $20,000, he withdraws $10,000 and only sets aside the balance, and so on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done a little bit of research and we were able to dig up quite a few cases of people who have been hit by misfortune. Maybe for Members' information, I can read out one or two cases, just to make the point that people do, for whatever reasons, lose their personal savings. There was one person who had $40,000 in his CPF in 1984. He withdrew the whole sum. He was a very kind-hearted person, very caring for his family. So he gave out the whole sum to his five sons and one daughter. Son A comes along and says, "I want to do renovation. How about giving me some money?" Son B wants to run some business, and he says, "How about giving me some money?" After all, the old man has got a big fortune now, $40,000. Eventually, the whole sum was exhausted. He became ill in 1985 and retired. Now he has to depend entirely on his children for support. And when we asked him, he said that he regretted having done what he did, and if only we had the minimum sum scheme then, he would not be in this position.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case is a member who had $29,000 in his CPF in 1981. He withdrew the money at age 55 and, since he was still working, he spent his money on entertainment and on helping out friends with financial problems. His friends never paid him back. He spent the whole sum of $29,000 in two years. On retirement in 1984, he collected $13,000 as retirement benefits and took out another $12,000 from his CPF. In the same way, he spent all the money in two years. Fortunately for him, he has a filial son who is supporting him. And fortunately for us now, I think most children are still filial but we do not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> know about the future. Right now, you may have five or six children to support the aged couple. But in future there will be one, maybe two or at the most three children. The burden on them will be that much heavier and we are not sure whether they will support us. So let us all be careful and plan for our future. Let us not be a burden on our children. There are other examples but I need not go through all of them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir also asked whether I could give an assurance that the Minimum Sum of $30,000 would not be raised. If he had listened carefully to my speech, he would have heard me saying that the $30,000 is based on the current value of money. So it is inevitable that, in money terms, we have to make adjustments for inflation. If not, then very soon the sum of $30,000 will be quite meaningless. In terms of its purchasing power, say over a period of 20 years or 30 years, the value would have dropped to maybe one-half or one-third. I therefore said in my statement quite clearly that my Ministry would review the sum every three to five years. And if there is a need, then we will have to adjust the sum to compensate for inflation. I have also said that we are confining it to the $30,000 in real value, the intention being to leave the member with maximum discretion to manage his own savings. The intention is not to widen the Scheme so that more and more money is taken up. The intention is to provide a minimum safety net but because there is inflation, it is inevitable that we must adjust the sum. But for a person who has $30,000 now and it is earning interest at, say, 5% or 6% which is higher than the inflation rate, then even if you adjust the $30,000 for inflation, it gets to be a smaller and smaller portion of his savings as the years go by. So the CPF members need not be worried about this point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member asked a rather unusual and amusing question. "What happens if the member dies at 57? Why do we give the money to his nominees?" I do not know how to answer him! Can he take the money with him? Of course, he has to leave it with his family, and that is what most members would do. Is the Member advocating that every CPF member, as
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> soon as he receives the money, should spend all of it just in case he dies the next day? Of course, not. He must plan, as a sensible person, to have enough money to last him for as long as he lives. A cautious person would just put the money in the bank and live on the interest. That is fine. But the interest might not be enough. In fact, if he lives on the interest alone, it is a bit too conservative. You can afford to eat a little bit into the capital, and we have planned it such that if you follow the scheme, there will be enough money to last you for the rest of your life. Of course, if the member dies, the money then goes to the family or to his nominees, probably his wife or his children. If there are no nominees, then it goes to his estate and the laws of intestacy will follow. So we have not changed the rules. And nobody is trying to deprive any member of his CPF savings. The savings are his money. He is entitled to use it. And if he does not use it in his lifetime and he cannot carry it with him when he dies, it goes to his family.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, may I just finish my speech because I have so many questions to answer?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please carry on.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I was not trying to make fun of the Member. Maybe I have misunderstood him. But it sounded so funny that all of us could not help laughing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member wanted to know how come there are 3,000 cases. I have given him the full figures. He can look at them. Those are the full data.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, he raises this question, this bogey of whether the CPF Board is able to pay. I have tried to answer him so many times. As I said before, I have managed to convince the Member for Anson who understands, but not the Member for Potong Pasir. He comes up again and again with the same story based on some misconception that his supporters may have given him. I have stated categorically that every member can withdraw all his CPF savings, every cent of it. So where is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the mechanism to hold back the money? If the Government has no money to pay, will we promise the CPF members that they can withdraw everything? If they choose to leave the money with the CPF Board, well, welcome, they can leave it there. But they are free to take out all their money. In the case where they have property, they can take out the whole sum. They need not set aside any sum. In the case where they do not have property, they can take out the whole sum but they have to invest part of it in some investment plan. So there is no withholding of the money. I have given figures before to show that our financial resources are very strong and there need not be any worry about this point. This is a very prudent Government. We manage the State's resources very carefully. So there will be money to pay every CPF member.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asks whether we are concerned about the declining ratio of contributors to the aged. There are also some data given in the Annexes. If you turn to Annex 5, you will find that in 1985, there were about 290,000 people aged 55 and above. In the year 2030, that number will be more than 1 million persons. In 1985, there were 5.7 young persons to 1 aged person. By "young person", I mean somebody between 15 years old and 55 years old. So in 1985 there were be 5.7 such young persons to 1 person above the age of 55. But in the year 2030, there will be only 1.4 young persons to 1 aged person. So if there is no CPF plan and there is no Minimum Sum Scheme, the burden on the young people in future will increase four-fold from what it is now. But because we have this CPF scheme where everybody saves up something for himself, I think we need not face this problem with so much concern. That is the real story behind all this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the questions of the Member for Anson. His first question was that the minimum sum set aside can only be withdrawn from age 60. What happens before that? Before that, at age 55, the member can withdraw at least half of his savings. If he has $10,000 or less, he withdraws the whole lot. If he has between $10,000 and $20,000, he withdraws $10,000 and leaves the rest and so on. So the intention of this front-end money is for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> him to live on between 55 and 60 years. If he lives frugally, he can live through those five years with maybe less than $10,000. The balance, he should really plan and set it aside for his future years. But if he does not want to and he has other commitments, he can use it to meet them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For members with very low savings, their basic problem is that they have insufficient savings. We are not able to design a scheme that will stretch their savings out too much. What has to be done really is for these members to continue working for as long as they can, maybe to age 60 or 65. The Government will still like to encourage people to work for as long as they can because that is the way to stay healthy and financially independent and live longer perhaps.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those with very low savings, we are also considering a scheme where the children can take out part of their CPF savings and transfer it to the Minimum Sum Scheme account of the parent. This is being considered and details will be announced later. The amount transferred must be limited only to the Minimum Sum and provided the son himself has enough for his own needs. This will help to top up the CPF accounts of the aged persons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also allow the son to contribute cash to the aged person's CPF account. We are talking to the Ministry of Finance to have this cash contribution exempt from tax, so long as it is limited only to $30,000. If the old man dies any balance must go back to the contributor's CPF account. Otherwise it becomes a tax loophole.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wants to know how the CPF Board has invested the CPF members' money. The report of the CPF Board shows this very clearly. The CPF Board collects on the one hand from CPF members and on the other hand lends out the bulk of this money to the Government which then invests it in secure assets, overseas or through other arrangements. The net result is that all these CPF savings have been salted away, invested. So if the Member wants to look at the accounts, it is really very simple. The liabilities are the CPF members' savings; the assets are mostly Government bonds. The money has been placed with the Government,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> with GIC and MAS, for management. So when the time comes to pay out the CPF members, the assets will, if necessary, be sold and used to pay CPF members; and there will be enough assets to pay everybody.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asks why we do not convert the full CPF scheme to a pension scheme. I do not know how many members of the public would support him on this point. It is a valid point, but it is a very drastic change because most people want to collect their CPF in one lump sum and be able to do what they want with it. Most people are able to manage. So we need not impose on them to the extent of converting all their CPF money into a pension scheme. What we have done is to convert a minimum portion of it at the end, and this portion can even be in the form of a property. So there is no need to set aside other sums.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Member is thinking of an alternative scheme where we contribute lower amounts and it becomes a pension. Then it is a question of how much is sufficient for a pension scheme. The CPF scheme is designed such that it should be sufficient to pay for a home commensurate with the member's income, pay for hospitalization through Medisave and so on. And we are still studying this point - how much would he need at the end after retirement? What level of a monthly income would he need to live on after retirement? Is it 30%? Is it 40%? We have to cater the CPF scheme in that manner. But there is perhaps no need to take the drastic step of converting everybody's savings into a pension scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asks why we have changed our position and are not allowing people to withdraw all their money at 55? My answer is they can withdraw all their money at 55. So the question does not arise. We have not changed our position. We have not imposed on anybody. The majority will have homes. Eventually when all have homes, 100% home ownership, the scheme is reduced to just this Minimum Sum, which is protected by law in the value of the property. If it is a private property, the member can still use the property to raise funds. He is also not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hindered if he wants to transact his property. He can sell it, buy another one and say, "Look, CPF Board, I want to nominate this new property." And so it goes. Just a very simple process. So there will be minimum inconvenience to CPF members. We are, of course, working out the legal mechanism for this and it will be announced in due course. But our intention is to make this legal protection and the legal hold for the member's security as simple as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming next to the questions from the Member for Radin Mas. He says we have to explain to the public. This is very true. We will do our best to try and explain it and I hope Members will help me out in this respect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's second question is whether the $30,000 is the full value of the property or net of bank loans. The answer is net of bank loans. We are looking really at how much of the property belongs to the member. If he has only paid out $100, his worth is only $100, not the whole value of the property. If there are joint properties with several owners, we will look at the share of each owner. Of course, with joint properties there will be further complications of having to get the consent of the other members and so on. We will have to study that in more detail. What I have covered are just properties owned by spouses, singly or jointly. If one member, say, a husband, has a property worth $45,000, he can use it to cover both husband and wife. It does not have to be a joint property.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's third question is that we seem to be letting go those people with low balances, and so they are not protected by the scheme. The problem is that they have so little savings that we have to let them have the money to live on in case they have stopped work. But we hope they will realize that this is all the savings they have, that they will continue working, save more and manage the sum carefully. If they need our help to plan how to manage the sum, we will be happy to help them do so. They can put it in a bank or buy an annuity. But since the sum is so little, there is not much we can really do. These people
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are really the interim case; the older people who have had a lower income and lower CPF rates. Their sums are small. As the years pass by, there will be fewer and fewer such people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar wants to know who decides on the value of the property. The value of the property will be based on the market value. For example, if it is an HDB flat, then we will look at the list of actual transactions of HDB flats, say, over the last year and use that as a gauge. In the case of private properties we may have to use a valuer or some other basis. We have to work out the details in due course, but the basic concept is market value.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minimum Sum be adjusted? I think I have answered the point. We will have to take care of inflation and rising standards of living. But we are going to confine it to the minimum for subsistence living.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah asks about the case of a couple. This is slightly complicated. Maybe I should explain again. Let us take the case of a husband and wife where the husband has $60,000 and the wife $1,000. The husband sets aside $30,000, the wife sets aside nothing. We look at each account on its own and apply the rules on each account. But it is only when we look at the ceiling that we have actually made a concession. Instead of $30,000 each, we say the total need only be $45,000. But it does not mean that every husband must set aside $45,000 for both. It depends on how much the husband has in his own CPF savings. For example, if the husband has $60,000 and the wife has $60,000. If they were singles, we will have to ask them to set aside $30,000 in one case and $30,000 in the other case. But because they are living together and they are able to share expenses, we say, "Look, only one member needs to set aside $30,000; the other one only needs to set aside $15,000, to make a total of $45,000." So it is actually lower than what it would be if both of them were single members and treated separately. But if only one of them is a member, then to be fair to him, we only look at his account. We cannot insist that he must put aside $45,000 because he may not have enough money.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> So he will only be required to set aside $30,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson wanted to know what happens after, say, age 60 and the member has put aside this minimum sum, and he then needs to have a lump sum of money for expenses. The point here is that we have planned out a stream of income so that it will last him throughout his life until he dies. If he has some other means of support, he need not live on this minimum sum. If his family is still supporting him, or he has other savings, or he is working, he can keep the money with the bank and allow it to accumulate. So instead of withdrawing the money every month, he can withdraw it, say, every year. In that case he can withdraw about $3,000 every year to go on a trip or whatever. So it need not be exactly $230 per month. $230 per month is what he will get to spend if he wants it to last. So he can either withdraw monthly or quarterly or yearly, as he wishes. But he should only spend whatever he has accumulated, not more than what he has accumulated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Chong Boon asks whether it is necessary to have the pledge on the property. Here there is some public misunderstanding over the mechanism. We are not saying that there will be a charge on the property. It will be some kind of a legal hold on the property for his own protection, to protect him from creditors and also the hold is to retain the minimum sum for his own benefit. If a bank imposes a charge on the property it is for the benefit of the bank as a lender. But in this case we will have some kind of legal mechanism which is to safeguard that value of $30,000 for the member's own benefit. And we intend to make the mechanism as simple as possible. Maybe just signing a form and saying, "This is the property." If he is does not sell the property that is the end of the story. If he sells he renominates another property or he puts aside the minimum sum. So the mechanism will be as simple as possible. [Applause].
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just seek clarification from the Minister following his reply to my questions. I am afraid he does not quite understand the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> problem I posed to him about the persons who have reached 55 and who have left behind a sum with the CPF and then find themselves out of employment. The Minister says the answer is to encourage everyone to stay on working till the age of 60. Does he realize that it is virtually impossible now for a person to find employment in Singapore after the age of 50 or 55? Does he know that employers are terminating the employment of people when they reach the age of 50 or 55? I know of this myself in many cases. So it is their situation to which my question was directed and I do not think it can simply be answered by saying the Government wants to encourage everyone to work till the age of 60.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is about the accounts. Of course, I am aware that CPF lends the money to the Government or purchases Government bonds. But what we are not told is what the GIC or the Government does with these moneys and how much is earned on them? I think it is only fair that if contributors have left their moneys to be invested for the interest to be paid out to them, then they should be told fully how much is earned by the Government by way of interest upon the moneys left behind by the CPF contributors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister perhaps skirted my last request, ie, whether the Ministry would consider appointing a committee to inquire into the whole problem now and invite views from the contributors? Because it is a serious departure, I still maintain that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, coming to the first point about those who have put aside some money at 55 and who would need some money before they reach 60. I have explained that we have planned the scheme such that he has as much front-end money as possible. The intention is that he should try and use that for his living expenses between 55 and 60. For example, if he has withdrawn $20,000 and he needs to go on a Haj, in the case of Muslims. He should consider whether he could afford the trip; out of the $20,000 how much would he need to live between 55 and 60, and set aside a sum. The rest can be spent more freely. But he must realize that what we have planned for him
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> after age 60 based on the minimum sum is only enough for subsistence living. If he is contented with that standard of living, he can be more free with the money in the front-end. The data I have given you also shows how we derived the $230. It is a very frugal amount.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for people not being able to find jobs after 55, this is a temporary problem. If you study the data of those aged 55 and above and even above 60 for males, you will find that the majority are still working. According to actual statistics, I think it is more than 60% in the case of males aged 55 and above, ie, more than 60% of males above that age are still working. The unions and the Ministry of Labour would like to encourage employers to offer employment to their workers beyond the age of 55. I think quite a few companies already have this scheme where their employees can opt to retire at 55 or carry on working as long as possible. There are various kinds of jobs still available for people who are older. My Ministry can also help those who are above that age if they want to find jobs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is difficult for us to say, "Look. Take out this money at age 55 and we set aside this sum for you from age 60. If it so happens you need some more, you can come and take some more." Then the whole scheme is defeated, is it not? For the scheme to work, we have to have certain basic requirements and the member must try and plan within those requirements. As I said, the scheme is meant to help him plan for his financial security.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson asks for details of investments by GIC. This is something that the Minister for Finance has already answered. To the extent that it is common to release such details, and they have been released. It is not a secret that we have plenty of reserves with GIC earning adequate returns. As far as the CPF members are concerned, they are assured of getting their money back with CPF interest. The CPF Board is paid the same interest that the CPF member gets from the CPF Board.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants to know whether we would appoint a committee to find out public views and so on. This Minimum Sum Scheme is not a new idea. It was mentioned in the last general elections by the Prime Minister. I have mentioned it a few times in Parliament. Recently, before we decided on the scheme, my Ministry has also done a spot survey of quite a big sample. The majority, even based on the information that has been given out so far, are in favour of the scheme. A lot of these people who were not sure will be in favour once they know the details. For example, we will allow them to take out the whole sum and put it in a bank so that nothing is held back. We believe that more than 80% will be in favour of the scheme. So there is really no need for us to do another survey or have a committee for this purpose.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Just one final question, with your indulgence, Sir. At age 55, if he needs more than the $10,000 which will be paid out to him for his children's education - this point has been brought up before - especially for university education, will he be given some kind of leeway to take out money for his children's tertiary education?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the figure of $10,000 only relates to a certain group of CPF members. Those who have less than $10,000 in their Ordinary and Special Accounts are allowed to withdraw the whole sum. They can do what they want with it. We are telling them that they should plan for their own old age. If they need to spend it on their children's education, nobody is stopping them. In the case where they have between $10,000 and $20, 000, they are allowed to take out $10,000 and keep the rest. Again, I think, the $10,000, in most cases, will be adequate. It will not be enough to send the child to UK for studies but it will be more than enough to pay the fees at NUS which only amount to about $1,100 per year for most courses. For those with larger sums and with no property, say, he has $40, 000 in his account, he is allowed to withdraw half, not $10, 000. He is allowed to withdraw $20,000. If he has $50,000, he is allowed to withdraw $25,000. If he has $60,000, he is allowed to withdraw
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> $30,000. In fact, he is allowed to withdraw the whole lot, but we ask him to put part of it in a bank or buy annuities or whatever to stretch it out for the rest of his life, if possible.

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are copies of the Bill available for the use of Members?

  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Yes, Sir, printed copies of the Bill are with hon. Members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act was passed by the Legislative Assembly in 1962. The existing Act was therefore passed when Singapore was not an independent nation. Certain powers that the UK House of Commons has, such as the power to commit a person to prison or expel a Member from Parliament, were
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> excluded in the Ordinance of 1962. It therefore deprives Parliament of powers that a Parliament of an independent sovereign state should have. This Bill seeks to rectify this inadequacy by amending the present Act to confer on our Parliament the same powers, privileges and immunities as those enjoyed by the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as at the date of our independence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Parliament is the supreme legislative body in our nation. It is obvious that our deliberations, the laws that we, the elected representatives, enact and the decisions we make here, establish the framework for every activity of our people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is less obvious that the manner in which this Parliament conducts itself is equally important. Parliament is more than a legislative body. It is the key institution in our political process. It is the centre of the democratic system that we have chosen for ourselves. The kind of people who become Members of this House, how they conduct themselves in the business of the House, what they say, are all as important as the laws that are passed by Parliament. The proceedings in this House, the dignity and decorum maintained by Members in debates and discussions, the arguments they advance in support of their point of view, will all have a perceptible impact on the tone and the orderliness of our political processes. They even help shape the values and tenor of our society as a whole because every Singaporean can now see for himself or herself the proceedings in Parliament through television. The visual images and the actual sound have a far greater impact than the cold print in the newspapers or in the official reports of Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1961 to 1981, for 14 years, the PAP occupied every seat in this House. We shaped Parliament into an institution which approached the task of nation building in a serious and sober manner. There were, of course, differences of views and sharp exchanges. But in all the proceedings, Members always conducted themselves in a manner that did not bring Parliamentary proceedings into disrepute. We did not lose sight of the importance of maintaining the prestige and respect for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> key institutions, such as Parliament and the Judiciary. Parliament is not a circus or theatre to provide entertainment to the population although we have television here. Nor is it a safe refuge for Members to undermine the confidence in key institutions in our society by making defamatory statements or unsubstantiated allegations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conduct of business in Parliament in some countries has degenerated into a raucous, rowdy, disgraceful process. In fact, some Parliaments are deliberately keeping out television coverage of their sittings because they do not want their people to see the disgraceful manner in which they conduct their business. Shouting, ranting, jeering, tripping Members who are walking past, many Members speaking at the same time and the constant shouts of "Order" from the Chair are the norm. Even physical violence is not unknown. Lately, in this House, we have seen some examples of the abuse of Parliamentary privilege and a tendency towards rowdiness. We must not allow our Parliament to degenerate into what it has become in some other countries. This Government has no intention to allow such degeneration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present laws allow complete freedom of speech in Parliament. It is a rare privilege. Where there is wrongdoing in government or society, Members must have the freedom to bring it to the attention of the nation through Parliament and they should enjoy protection and immunity from civil proceedings. But rights and privileges must be accompanied by responsibility and duty. Members have a duty not to abuse such privileges or to commit contempt of Parliament. Should we allow Members to abuse this special immunity by defaming the character of innocent third parties who are not only unable to defend themselves but have no redress? Should Members be allowed to abuse the privilege by making totally unfounded allegations which they are not prepared to substantiate? If we allow this, our Parliament will degenerate into a disreputable institution. If we are not to allow this, Parliament must have the full panoply of powers to deal with delinquent

  <br>
  <br> Members. This is one of the objects of the Bill before us today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By bringing our laws in line with that of the United Kingdom, Parliament will have powers to impose the following penalties:-
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Committal to prison (new power);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Expulsion (new power);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Suspension (existing power);
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Fine (existing power); and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Reprimand (existing power).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this Bill seeks to introduce ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is 1.00 pm. I suspend this Sitting and will take the Chair again at 2.30 pm.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the recess for lunch, I listed the powers that this Parliament will have as a result of bringing our laws in line with that of the United Kngdom.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, this Bill seeks to introduce a new punitive measure that is less severe than suspension but more heavy than a fine or reprimand. Under this new measure, Parliament may allow a Member found guilty of abuse of privilege to continue to sit in the House and participate in all the business of Parliament but the Member's immunity from civil proceedings under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act may be suspended for a specified period. Parliament can, by resolution, thus deal with any Member who is wantonly given to reckless and defamatory statements in Parliament against the Government, against other Members of the House or against members of the public. The defamatory statement that leads Parliament to taking action under
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> this provision will itself be immune from civil proceedings. But if a Member makes such statements during the period that his privilege is suspended, the aggrieved parties can seek redress through civil proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Member's right to bring any issue before Parliament will not be restricted but a Member who is punished under this section will naturally have to take care during the specified period that he does not say anything that will cause civil proceedings to be taken against him. In this respect, he will be no different from any responsible member of the public or a politician who comments on national issues or even a Member who speaks outside Parliament on such issues.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is being taken through on a Certificate of Urgency in order to ensure immediately that the debates and proceedings in Parliament and the Committees maintain principles of truth, dignity and decorum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the Committee of Privileges will be meeting soon to consider a complaint of abuse of privilege against the Member for Anson for making very serious allegations of executive interference in the Judiciary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be the task of the Committee of Privileges to ascertain the truth in a sober and dignified manner and not allow it to become a forum for another debate, an opportunity for more smears or a platform for histrionics. Decorum must be preserved and proper procedures followed in the hearings of the Committee of Privileges. The Speaker, as Chairman, must be given full powers to ensure that dignity and orderliness are maintained at all times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to give the Speaker summary powers so that all who appear before the Committee will know that they will face severe penalties if they do or say anything that debases the image of Parliament or its proceedings. Parliament has had to consider more instances of abuse of privilege in the last 1(r) years than in the previous 20-odd years. We must put matters right immediately and not allow any further deterioration of standards.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various new punitive powers of Parliament will not apply to any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt committed before the coming into operation of this Act. It will only apply to conduct in Parliament and Committees after the date on which this Act comes into operation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now take the main provisions in the Bill. Clause 2 gives the base line of this Parliament's powers, privileges and immunities. It is that of the UK House of Commons as it was on the day Singapore became independent, ie, 9th August 1965. This is the logical date as it is the date when our Parliament became a sovereign legislature like the House of Commons in the UK. The cut-off date is to ensure that, as a sovereign legislature, we are not bound by subsequent changes in the United Kingdom. It is also in conformity with similar provisions in the Commonwealth, like those in Australia and India.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3. This clause makes it clear that the powers conferred by the other provisions of the Act are in addition to the powers conferred by following the UK model.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4. Section 11 of the principal Act, that is the Act now in force, states that Parliament shall have no power to commit any person to prison nor to expel any Member from Parliament. This section is now repealed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers to commit or expel a Member are well recognized powers possessed by the UK House of Commons and other independent legislatures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5. This clause sets out the punitive powers of Parliament for any dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt on the part of a Member or stranger.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present sections 20 and 21 are repealed and the sections are re-enacted with new provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-enacted section 20(1)(a) will give Parliament the power to commit a Member to prison for a term not exceeding the current session of Parliament. In subsection 1(b), the maximum fine is increased from the present $1,000 to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> $50,000 to bring the maximum fine in line with current incomes and value of money, and to ensure that it is an adequate deterrent. The other subsections of 20(1) are the same as in the existing Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 20(2) introduces the new punitive power which I described earlier. A new provision, which is less drastic than suspension, is made to deal with a Member who abuses privilege in respect of what he says in Parliament by making, for example, defamatory statements and unsubstantiated allegations. In certain cases of such abuse of privilege, committal to prison, expulsion or suspension may be too harsh, while a fine or reprimand may be too lenient. Therefore, this new provision is introduced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 20(3) covers Parliament's powers to deal with contempt on the part of strangers. The power to commit to prison is included and the maximum fine that can be imposed is increased to $50,000. The other powers remain the same.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections 21(1) and 21(2) are in substance the same as the present provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new section 21(1)(a), any person who commits any offence mentioned in section 20, ie, dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt, in the view of Parliament whether in the precincts or when Parliament is sitting or in any committee, can be dealt with summarily. This is the same as in the present law except that the punitive measures taken against such a person are covered by the expanded provisions of the re-enacted section 20.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections 21(1)(b) and (c) are the same as the existing provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 21(2)(a) makes clear that a Member found guilty can also be expelled from the House in addition to the punishments described in section 20. This power derives from the repeal of section 11 and the re-enactment of section 3 giving Parliament the powers of the UK House of Commons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 21(2)(b) is the same as the present provision.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21(3) provides new powers to the Speaker or Chairman of any Committee of Parliament. It gives powers to the Speaker or Chairman to deal summarily with any Member or stranger who commits contempt while Parliament or a Committee is meeting. The Speaker or Chairman can inflict any of the punishments listed in section 20. Such decisions by the Speaker or Chairman will take immediate effect but Parliament can annul or vary the decision by resolution. These powers of the Speaker or Chairman are necessary to ensure that all Parliamentary or Committee meetings are conducted with due dignity, order and solemnity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21(4) enables Parliament or the Speaker to take into account previous contempt by a Member which Parliament or the Speaker may have chosen to overlook in the expectation that it would not be repeated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill deals with the procedures of issue of warrant for arrest and imprisonment initiated by Parliament or by the Speaker.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I want to state that there is a need to do a thorough review of the whole of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act. If such a review shows that further amendments are required, they will be introduced in due course.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was waiting for Government Ministers to speak. Obviously, they do not propose to speak in support of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when I got the notice of Parliament sitting on the 18th of this month, giving the exact number of days required for the notice that Parliament would sit on the 25th of this month, I wondered what was afoot because it had been my experience that there was always an interval of two months or even more after every sitting of Parliament. But here, Parliament was summoned within three weeks of the previous sitting. So I wondered and, of course, the mystery came to light when I received at my office the Bill that the Government proposes to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> take through all stages on a Certificate of Urgency. So that was why Parliament was being summoned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that I shall not be accused of trying to impugn the President or trying to bring down the President when I question the Certificate of Urgency. It is signed by the President, of course. But the President acts on the advice of the Cabinet.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned in the report in the Straits Times, a Certificate of Urgency is usually given for money Bills where Government is in need to immediately raise a tax or for some other fiscal measure. It is also, of course, given in cases of a national crisis or emergency, quite apart from money Bills. But here we have the Government coming to this Parliament with a Certificate of Urgency on a Bill which proposes simply to discipline, it says, Members of Parliament. May I ask: what is the crisis? What is the urgency that requires that this Bill be debated and taken through all stages?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that the Minister spent about 20 minutes on this Bill. This is a very momentous Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, and it shows the sort of understanding that has been given to what is involved in this Bill by this Government, that the Minister spends only 20 minutes introducing the Bill and half of it is taken up with pedantically pointing out to the Members of the House the changes in the Bill. May I say - and I hope the Minister does not think this an insult and move a motion for committal of me to the Committee of Privileges again - may I say that the Minister shows a complete inability to comprehend what is involved in this Bill. May I say this, again without insulting the other Members of the House. There is one man who does understand what is involved in this Bill, the one man who knows all about parliamentary government, because he was involved in the setting up of parliamentary government way back in 1959. And I see he is not here. Should he not be here? Should he not move this Bill? Or may I ask: is he a trifle ashamed of this Bill that he has decided that it would be better if he stayed away from any discussion on this Bill?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question is: what is the great urgency in this Bill without giving Members an opportunity to ponder over
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> its consequences, over its implications. And for the public at large - let us not forget the public at large - to consider and to state their views. It would appear from what has fallen from the lips of the Leader of the House that the great urgency is that it should be made to apply to the proceedings of the Committee of Privileges when it considers the complaints against me. Am I to understand then that the intention is that I should be severely limited when I appear before the Committee of Privileges? Is that the sole intention so that I may not be allowed to make my full defence and to state what I wish to state? But that I should be hedged in by these powers and threatened with expulsion or imprisonment or fined if I dared say anything. Is that the intention? Is that why this Bill is being rushed through on a Certificate of Urgency through all stages? May we have an answer to that question? Because one would have thought, Mr Speaker, Sir, that we could have waited until the Committee of Privileges had reported on these various complaints and then considered whether there was any justification or not. And then to bring in, if necessary, a Bill to remedy the state of affairs where a Member brings in unjustified allegations. That is not to be the case. It would appear that it is taken without question that all allegations were unsubstantiated, that all statements made were defamatory, that there can be no question about that they are and we have got to bring in this Bill now.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister in his press briefing and in his speech this afternoon tried to give the impression that the whole purpose of this Bill is to maintain and uphold the decorum of the House. That is what the Government would like to convey through their Government media to the public so that the public may be lulled, may be led into thinking that all that the Government is concerned with is decorum of the House. But may I assure the Leader of the House that the public do not need any more representations. They already know what the purpose of the Bill is. Ever since it came out in the Straits Times or the press on Friday, people in coffee shops, in market places, have stated quite clearly what they thought was the whole purpose of the Bill. And therefore they do not need
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> any more representations by the Government media or the Government-controlled press and the Government TV as to the need.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I only have about 60 minutes. But it is necessary that I, within the time limited to me, strip the Bill of the hypocrisy that surrounds it. And I say it is sheer hypocrisy to say that this Bill is brought in to maintain the dignity and the decorum of the House. It is brought in, as I shall try and show, for one purpose and one purpose alone. It is brought in and rushed through on a Certificate of Urgency to silence the criticism of the Government because the criticism is beginning to hurt. It is beginning to hurt and it must be silenced somehow at whatever cost it may be to the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was not in 1962 that we first had a law enacting the privileges and powers of the Legislature. Of course, the PAP thinks that the history of Singapore only began in 1959. Well, they may think that. One has to sympathize with their delusion. But there was in 1955, Mr Speaker, Sir, Ordinance No. 30 of 1955 which dealt with the powers, privileges and immunities of the then Legislative Assembly of Singapore. And from 1955 to 1959, Mr Speaker, Sir, our Prime Minister was then in the Opposition Benches. It was the Labour Front government, first under Mr David Marshall and then under Mr Lim Yew Hock, which held the reins of government. And our Prime Minister was then in the Opposition Bench. And may I assure Members who may not have read the reports of what took place in the Legislative Assembly from 1955 to 1959 that they were by no means tame proceedings. They were not, as I shall say, family tea parties. The Prime Minister who was then standing where I am now standing and heading the Opposition in Singapore, took the government to task at every turn and corner. And proceedings in the Legislative Assembly then were characterized by sharp criticisms from the present Prime Minister speaking from the Opposition. They were by no means sedate tea party gatherings of the Members of the Legislative Assembly. He needled them, he
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> probed them, he challenged them. And quite rightly, because he knew what was expected of an Opposition Member in Parliament. And he did his work very well with the result that in 1959 he was able to bring his Party to power. So let us not forget that period, 1955 to 1959, what the Prime Minister was doing when he was in the Opposition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did the colonial government then consider bringing in a Bill to expel him, to send him to prison or to fine him? Whatever one might say about the British, they have a sense of fair play, and they decided that he must be allowed to have his full say. Because they were all brought up on the whole question of parliamentary tradition. And we were learning in those days the British parliamentary tradition, and so he was allowed full rein in the 1955 to 1959 Legislative Assembly. And then, of course, after the PAP took over the government of this country, except for a short period when Members of the Barisan Sosialis occupied the Opposition Benches, the House was dominated by the People's Action Party. And for 15 years, was it, the House consisted entirely of Members of one political party.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1962, the Government introduced a new Bill, which we are now seeking to amend. That was introduced by the PAP Government and that Bill sought to apply in Singapore the privileges, immunities and powers of the Commons House of the United Kingdom Parliament "for the time being"; in other words, this Parliament, Members, were to enjoy the same privileges and powers and immunities that are enjoyed by the British Commons House of Parliament at the relevant time. So I think it was to continue the same powers, privileges and immunities that were enjoyed by the UK Parliament. The operative words were "shall be the same as those for the time being held." So there was a continuous investing in this Parliament of the same privileges and immunities and powers as the British Parliament enjoyed. Why did the Prime Minister then agree to that? Because that brought it into line with the current British practice. But I shall again show very shortly that it is a myth, a fallacy to say that we are now bringing it into line with current British practice. We
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> have not been told why, having introduced that in 1962, it now becomes necessary to drastically change all that, and to limit our powers, privileges and immunities to those enjoyed by the British House of Commons in 1962.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite plain why after 27 years the Government has decided that they must change. For 27 years they were quite content to follow the UK Parliament. As I said, between 1963 (certainly after 1963) and until 1981, meetings of the Legislative Assembly and Parliament after that (from 1965 onwards) were sedate. They were the PAP family tea parties. And Parliament served the purpose of the Government admirably. Of course, there were Members who questioned Papa about one or two little things. But if Papa said, "No, it is not good for you, children" everybody said, "Yes, Papa, we agree. We will go out and tell the people." So that was what Parliament was - dominated in its entirety by one party without any place for criticism on behalf of those who dared to disagree with what the Government planned. So there was no need for any change.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in 1981, something happened. The people of Singapore decided that Parliament should no longer be just the PAP family tea parties but that Parliament should begin to serve its true function and purpose that is expected in a parliamentary democracy. So they elected a Member from outside the People's Action Party into Parliament. Then, of course, we immediately saw what our Prime Minister and our leading Ministers thought about all this. They, who had been paying lip service to the idea of parliamentary democracy, immediately decried the presence of an Opposition Member in Parliament. That is the hypocrisy that we have got in this place, and I see the Leader of the House uses the same words as the Prime Minister used, "that Parliament is not a place for theatrics. Parliament is not a place for drama." So the Government, for the first time after 15 years, came up with having to face criticism in Parliament. Of course, they could not take it. Of course, during those 23 years there was perfect decorum in the House, as I said, because everybody bowed and walked out. After
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1981 it no longer was a family tea party. There was a stranger in the House who was not a Member of the PAP family, and he was being a bit troublesome, forgetting quite deliberately that Parliament is not a family tea party of one political party but that Parliament is the chamber in which the government is taken to account, that Parliament is the Chamber in which searching questions are asked of the government, of the executive. And so we saw attempts, even before the 1984 Elections, to try and shut me up. Then came the
  <br>
  <br>1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections and the Government got a jolt, a setback, because the public had decided to reduce the percentage of votes that the Government had had enjoyed; and for good measure they sent another Opposition Member into Parliament. Government became more and more embarrassed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir - I am sorry to have to say this because we will have to strip the hypocrisy that surrounds it - is introduced solely and only for one reason, and that is, because I had come to this House and said that there was public disquiet about transfers of the Subordinate Court Judiciary after they had given decisions unacceptable to the Government. I ask the Government, the Ministers, to be honest about this and say what other reason is there? I will not go into the question about my allegations because they are before the Committee of Privileges. But there we have it, the Government unable to accept the charge. A government that is committed to parliamentary democracy will not do this, introduce a Bill to shut the Member up. It will lay open the whole machinery to satisfy Parliament and the public that there can be no room for disquiet. But not this Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement that it brings us into line with British practice and with other Commonwealth countries - I have already said that it does not, not with the current UK practice, because after this we shall not be able to look at anything of the changes that have taken place in the UK Parliament after 1962. Of course, the UK Parliament has powers to imprison. Of course, the UK Parliament has powers to expel, but they are not contained in an Act.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> These powers have been won by Parliament in its struggle with the Executive over 200 years, 300 years. And Parliament was asserting itself as the supreme body. Parliament was denying to the Courts, to everybody else, any power to question Parliament and of it being the only judge of what was said in Parliament, and therefore, Parliament had to have these powers in those days. But, if one looks at Erskine May, one will find that these powers were exercised in the last century and the century before that. I wonder whether the Leader of the House has made any study of the powers of punishment by the UK Parliament now, whether it has sent anyone to prison and whether it has expelled anybody over the last so many years. Parliament is not a static body. Parliament has to move along with the times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is, has this Government made a study of the nature of the abuses of privilege that the UK Parliament has sought to punish? Is it an abuse of privilege - I know this is coming up before the Committee of Privileges, but is it an abuse of privilege to question the Government, to question the independence of the Subordinate Court Judiciary? These are the basic questions that we have got to answer. What amounts to an abuse of privilege? What amounts to contempt? What amounts to dishonourable conduct? If you are going to label everything - the Leader of the House says "he makes defamatory statements about the Government". He forgets that the Opposition are there, if necessary at times, to make defamatory statements about the Government, to challenge any Government action and to ridicule it. What is the Opposition in Parliament for? Simply to say "Aye, Aye" to whatever the Government says? Is the Opposition here in Parliament simply to accept whatever the Government says? It shows a complete ignorance of what parliamentary government is all about. So I think it is a fallacy to say that we are bringing it into line with the practice in the British Parliament. This is a retrograde step, and while other Parliaments are moving forward we intend to go back and pitch our camp way back in 1962 and say, "That is going to be our position although
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> this happens to be 1986." Opinions have changed, and people have moved on in their thinking about Parliament and what it should do and should not do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is an attack, a deliberate attack by this Government at the very foundation of parliamentary democracy. We said, in a press statement that we issued the day after the Bill was published in the papers - and this was not published by the gutter press - we said that the irony is that Parliament itself is made to put the axe to this foundation. We said that this was possible because the PAP has an overwhelming tyrannical majority in Parliament. Because the Government enjoys this tyrannical majority, democracy can, Members, become, if one is not careful, the tyranny of the majority. That can be a sort of sham democracy. Because Government enjoys this tyrannical majority, it is able now through this Bill to cut at the very foundation, to strike down the very foundation of Parliament, through its own institution. The institution is used against its own foundation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament, of all the democratic institutions, the Courts, the trade union movement, the press and Parliament itself, is the one institution that is calculated or is designed to safeguard the liberties of the people. And this Government soon after it came to power in 1959 went for all these institutions. It went for the trade unions. It did what Hitler did, turned the trade unions upside down, made them stand on their heads. It went for the press. It took over the press completely. But it left Parliament alone because, as I said, there wasn't any need; Parliament was serving the purpose of the Government, an emasculated Parliament. And they were quite happy to let it be, as it was, because it was all Members of the PAP family. But now things have changed for the PAP and they have decided, it would appear, that Parliament itself should be attacked; the foremost of the free institutions, of free people everywhere, should be attacked.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in today's papers an article in Petir about me wanting to attack the institutions. I suppose the PAP and the Government, like Goebbels, the German Minister for Propaganda, think that if you repeat
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> something, times without number, some people may come to believe it. Who is destroying our institutions?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> You!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Who is destroying our institutions? Why is the trade union movement what it is today - completely emasculated, serving the Government? Why is it? Why is the press what it is today - not serving its true role in a democratic society? It is all because this Government has deliberately gone about attacking these institutions and pretending, pretending that we still have these institutions. We do not have them. What we have are sham institutions. The trade unions are a sham. The press is a complete sham. And now since 1981, because one Member of Parliament has tried to assert the authority of Parliament, Parliament itself must now be attacked. That is the tragedy of this Bill, of a Government that has paid lip service to parliamentary democracy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may go through some of these amendments. As I said, clause 2 of the Bill alters the position drastically and takes it away from the current UK practice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to the provision in this Bill which seeks to remove the immunity from a Member of Parliament for anything said in Parliament, and this is the new subsection (2) of section 20 in clause 5. I have said this several times and this is something that has been fought for and won by Parliaments of all free peoples that there must be absolute freedom of speech in Parliament and that there should be no questioning of it outside Parliament. Parliament itself can discipline but there can be no questioning of it outside Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one reads British parliamentary history, one will find the struggle Parliament has had with the courts in trying to keep the courts out of questioning any parliamentary proceedings. This Bill intends to allow somebody outside to intimidate a Member of Parliament from discharging his duty by threatening him with civil proceedings or criminal proceedings. That strikes immediately at the very heart of parliamentary freedom.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this Bill introduced? Is it because I have refused or I did not repeat what the Prime Minister said the Chief Justice wanted me to repeat outside? May I say this? When the Prime Minister mentioned that, I asked him, "Tell me what is it you want me to repeat? Tell me what statement it is that you want me to repeat?" I did not get any satisfactory answer from him. May I also say that I consider it very unfortunate that the Chief Justice has been drawn into all this. But I am sure, on sober reflection, the Chief Justice must regret that he allowed himself to be drawn into it. First of all, he sent a note to the Prime Minister. That, by the way, was a personal note and I do not know how the Prime Minister could make it public, in Parliament, when it was a personal note. The Member for Potong Pasir at the last sitting mentioned about the remark of a QC who was asked what the Chief Justice of England would have done if Mrs Thatcher had asked for a note. According to the Member for Potong Pasir, the QC said he would have told Mrs Thatcher to go and jump in the lake. So it is unfortunate that the Chief Justice allowed himself to be drawn into these proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say this. Regardless of that, if the Chief Justice, because the Prime Minister apparently is very anxious, if the Chief Justice wants me to repeat, let him write to me and tell me exactly what is it in the parliamentary proceedings that he wants me to repeat. I will repeat them if he writes to me and tells me exactly what is it that he wants me to repeat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, this is a very serious, momentous, Bill. Before I sit down, I want to make an appeal to the Prime Minister. He is not here, and I am very sorry that he is not here because, as I said, he realizes the implications of this. It is my appeal here that this matter should not just be decided in this House but should be passed for a decision by the people from whom we draw our authority. The people must be asked to decide whether it is outrageous conduct, whether it is contempt for any Member of Parliament to come here and question the Government and even to make allegations against the Government and to ask for an inquiry into these things.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposal to the Prime Minister is this. I hope it will be conveyed to him and that he will come and try and answer this, because this is not a small matter, a trifling matter. This is a matter of great importance to parliamentary government. I am proposing to the Prime Minister that I resign from Anson and that he resigns from Tanjong Pagar, resigns his seat, and that writs be issued immediately - I must insist on that - that writs be issued immediately for a by-election in these two constituencies. Then he can offer himself for re-election in Tanjong Pagar, and I certainly will offer myself for re-election in Anson. He can send someone, he can send the whole Cabinet, to Anson to try and persuade the Anson voters that I have been a very naughty boy and that they should not send me back. Likewise, we shall send our member into Tanjong Pagar, and why not wait and see what the results of the decision of the people are on this question, because this is not something that we ourselves should decide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, as I have said before, an institution essentially of the people. We are here because of the people, and we are here to serve them. So is it not right that they should decide this rather than that we should decide whether an Opposition Member of Parliament is wrong when he comes and makes statements which question the Government's sincerity, which question the Government's decisions, in a manner which seems to challenge the entire Executive functioning? As I said, my crime would appear to be that I had said that there was disquiet in the public about the transfers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope my proposal will be conveyed to the Prime Minister, and that the further progress of this Bill be delayed until the Prime Minister considers my request, so that the decision of the people may be obtained on this. Of course, the best thing would be for a referendum or for general elections, but I will be told that will be too costly. But the cost should be no object because we are now trying to tinker with our democratic institution of Parliament. And the people must have their say in this. If the Prime Minister thinks that it will not be safe for him to resign his seat in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Tanjong Pagar, we will understand that. Let him then nominate any other constituency. I am sure the Minister for Home Affairs will only be too anxious to fight the battle for the Government in his constituency. But let it be any constituency and let the issue be taken from this House, be taken from this House to the people where it belongs. The issue belongs to them, not just to this House. It is for them to say what matters can be raised in Parliament and should be raised in Parliament. Will the Prime Minister accept this challenge? I hope he does, and I hope he is here before we pass this Bill because, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have adopted the parliamentary system of government. We chose this deliberately when, in 1958, it was decided that we should get our self-government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the system, the parliamentary democracy, that was accepted, as I said, not by me but by the Prime Minister when he was in the Opposition. He fought for it. When I mentioned about his performances in the Legislative Assembly - I hope the Prime Minister's speeches in Parliament in the Legislative Assembly between 1955 and 1959 is compulsory reading for all PAP backbenchers - I am not saying something new. He said it then, in 1955 to 1959. He was the champion of parliamentary democracy. And so he persuaded the citizens, our people, to accept parliamentary democracy. But the tragedy is that after he persuaded them to accept parliamentary democracy, he began dismantling them one by one, as I said, the trade unions, the press, and even undermining the independence of our courts. I have mentioned this because the Constitution was amended to enable the Prime Minister to appoint judges for a fixed period. He began undermining the whole system when he abolished the jury trial, because the jury trial is again part of the whole democratic institution of government. As Devlin said, "The jury is a miniature parliament." So now this is the last assault, as it were, by the Government on the remaining institution. And it is too precious for us to let go, and it is too precious for the people to let go. I think the people should be asked to decide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I appeal to the Prime Minister. I am sorry to have to say this: he is the one man who will understand what is involved in all
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> this, the momentous nature of this Bill and the violence it is doing to the whole idea of parliamentary democracy. I still hope we will see him and that he will accept my challenge. And may I say this before I sit down: that it is not a private feud between me and the Prime Minister. I am not bringing this because of any private feud or vendetta, as he seemed to imply in his letter to me and I mentioned it. I bear him no ill-will. But I am concerned, and I am sure he is concerned - I must give him credit - I am sure he is concerned with democratic institutions. He must be concerned with the democratic way of life. I hope he is still because he was when he was in the Opposition from 1955 to 1959. Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.

  <div align="center">
   <h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, you were going to speak?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am much obliged to you, Mr Speaker, Sir. I would like to join in this debate on a very serious matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has described it as a momentous event. I would add more by saying that, if this Bill were to be passed today, then it would go down as a day of shame in the history of Singapore. The reason is that we are attacking the very foundation of parliamentary democracy. Parliament must have absolute privilege, otherwise how can Members of Parliament do their duty to their constituent
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> without fear? This element of absolute privilege is well-founded in all Western democratic parliaments, in particular, the Parliament of UK. The Parliament of UK, as the Member for Anson has pointed out, has fought jealously for its independence. It has fought and managed to keep itself free from the examination by the courts. And this is the very thing today that we are going to undo.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new section 21(2), this privilege and immunity of Members of Parliament can be lifted and subject them to the scrutiny of the courts. Today what we are doing is destroying the very pillar of parliamentary democracy. And each one of you who votes against this, of course your names will be recorded for posterity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the rush? Why all three Readings in one afternoon? What is the need? What is the urgency for this Bill to be passed so quickly? Is there a national danger? Or is money quickly needed? I cannot see any. Then why the need to rush through such a very important Bill which deals with the very foundation of our concept of parliamentary democracy?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has pointed out correctly - the people of Singapore must be consulted on this matter, and they are the people who should decide whether we want to dismantle one of the pillars of our system. This Bill purportedly is to uphold dignity and decorum in this House. If this Bill should be passed, I think the damage done to this House is far, far greater than whatever indignities or alleged unsubstantiated allegations made in this House. If there is going to be any punishment, I think those who vote for this Bill should be punished for bringing down one of the pillars of our system. Of course, as the Member for Anson has pointed out, it is obvious. This Bill has got nothing to do with preserving the solemnity or dignity of this House but it is, in fact, just to silence criticisms of the Government. This Government is like a bad tooth, very shaky. No one is allowed to touch that tooth for fear it might fall off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of Parliament here are representatives of their constituencies. If they are going to be punished, then they should be punished in relation to their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> status as a representative. I think the principle here is that we should not punish the Member personally as a representative of the constituency. It would appear that increasing this fine from $1,000 to $50,000 appears to be in that direction. There is a 50,000 times increase in the fine! [Laughter] 50 times. Well, you can laugh. I do not know whether this is against the dignity and decorum of the House. I think if we are going to pass this Bill, we better have a list of all the so-called indignities that can be committed in this House. And laughing at others I wonder if it is one of them. [Laughter.]
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at yourselves. Where is the solemnity of this House? It would appear to me that the $50,000 fine is to punish the MP personally and I think this principle should not be allowed. And also, lifting the privilege and immunity means to say that he is liable to be punished in the courts for defamation, if it happens. Of course, the Leader of the House says that this is in between, but sometimes the punishment for defamation, which of course affects the Member personally, can even be higher than this $50,000. I think the Leader of the House should explain as regards the period whereby privilege and immunity is lifted. Is there a minimum or a maximum period? Or is it just at the discretion of the House? I think he should give an idea.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that this Bill is being rushed through, the urgency is that it would be in time for the hearings of the Committee of Privileges in regard to one of the Members of the House. If that is so, then all the trouble, time, money spent on the Commission of Inquiry was a failure. Obviously, it has not served its purpose. So it only shows that this Government does not really know what it is doing. It is just muddling through, have a Commission, and now we have this Bill rushed through so as to be in time for the hearings of the Committee of Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment would appear to have threats on would-be Members of Parliament, with all the heavy fines and the lifting of privilege and immunity. But I will tell Members of the Government that the attitude of the people of Singapore has
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> changed. They have no more fear in their hearts as before. That has been proven at the last general elections. They dared to vote in two Members of the Opposition despite the fact that the Prime Minister himself had come forward to canvass for two of their PAP members against the Opposition. So if there is any thought at all behind the minds of the Government to deter or put fear into future MPs from the Opposition, I do not think it will succeed at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point brought up by the Member for Anson about bringing our law to be in line with the UK is definitely not true. I have to say that because ours is only up to 1965 when Singapore became independent. After that, under this Bill, we are not obliged to follow the laws of Parliament in the Commons House in the United Kingdom.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that we have got punishment for dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt. And the House can deal with a Member summarily. Mr Speaker, Sir, a vote on the Bill should be taken in the House. I think it is only fair to all the Members of the House here that the Leader should give an indication as to what sort of conduct is classed as "dishonourable". Or what is abuse of privilege or a contempt? I think he should, in his answer later on, give us some examples because I can say that in my short experience in this House, I do not think many of the Members, both from the Backbenches and from the Government side, have behaved honourably. I have often been accused of lying and others have called a Member of the Opposition a snake. Are all these dishonourable conduct? I am sure they are. And who is to say that if a Member of the Government or a Backbencher speaks out in this fashion he is going to be punished? When a vote is taken, it is obvious how it will go. Otherwise, the Whip will come into the picture. Whenever there is a vote, we know that the Opposition will be out voted. And so the Government will be the arbiter. They will decide what is dishonourable and what is honourable and I hope you do not have two standards. So I think it is useful perhaps for the Leader of the House to give a guide to Members. If the House is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> going to take action, it would appear that it is the House which will initiate the prosecution and they will also be the prosecutor and the judge at the same time. There is of course no chance of appeal. At least in the courts, there is this element of appeal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you look at it objectively, this amendment is completely one-sided against the Opposition. Because everytime when there is a vote, there is no chance for the Opposition to win in that voting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just be allowed to make short commentaries on this amendment. We see that the punishment for a stranger is the same as the punishment for a Member. When a Member commits a dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege or contempt, he is fined up to $50,000. Of course, in the former Act it was $1,000. And for a stranger, in the former Act it was $3,000 and the present amendment is $50,000. So under this amendment, the Government thinks that the status of a Member of Parliament is the same as a stranger.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Raise the fine!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am not asking them to raise the fine. But I think there must be a difference between Members of Parliament and strangers. A Member of Parliament is a representative of the people. I think this Bill shows no respect for representatives of the people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I just ask the Leader of the House to tell us exactly how this new section 20(2) will work? Will it have a retroactive effect? Let us assume that a Member makes an allegation which the House thinks that it is dishonourable, say, at 3.00 o'clock today. Is it possible for the House to specify the period if there is a summary action taken against him and he is found guilty at 4.00 o'clock? Is it possible for the House to suspend the privilege and immunity of that Member, say, from 3.00 o'clock onwards? I think it is useful not only to myself but to other Members of the House to know exactly how this provision works.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am much obliged to you, Sir.
  <br>3.57 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, both Members of the Opposition seem
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to have asked the same question of the Hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House, ie, what is the urgency for this Bill? If only both had listened carefully to the Leader of the House when he presented the Certificate of Urgency and laid it on the Table and moved on to make the necessary explanations in detail on the various clauses of this amendment Bill, they would have got all the answers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Member for Potong Pasir just now, I am surprised that he has forgotten what he said only on the 30th of July. He said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Does he not realize that Parliament has the power of suspension, of expulsion and even committal?' Sir, at that time, Parliament could not do this. And he said that Parliament had the right and the power. This is section 11 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act, Chapter 49, and this is to be repealed. I think he did not realize that he had anticipated this. In fact, what I am trying to say is that he did not realize what he was talking.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the debate proper on this amendment. This amendment Bill heralds a significant change in parliamentary practice and procedure. It recognizes that the Singapore Parliament is a fully sovereign legislature by according to it all the powers the UK House of Commons has without any qualifications. It also confers additional powers to Parliament, and to the Speaker, which powers are peculiar to us, and of which there are no corresponding powers in the UK House of Commons, and not Commons House. Sir, I therefore welcome the amendment as a timely step in the right direction. It is time for us to evolve our own code of conduct in Parliament to suit the needs and sensitivities of our local climate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Parliament is a place where the elected Representatives of the people debate and discuss serious matters. Proceedings must be conducted with decorum and due sobriety. Mr Speaker, Sir, I must reiterate what the Leader of the House just now said. Parliament is not a theatre. It is not a source of entertainment; neither is it just another ordinary television programme to watch. Parliament is the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> most public of public forums. The public has access to the gallery and also access to the proceedings via the radio, the television and the newspapers. Because of wide media coverage, unscrupulous people can make use of Parliament as a means of manipulating the people to cast aspersions on the integrity of persons, for example, those in public service, and to sow seeds of dissension by twisting words to mislead others and the listeners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a few well-placed malicious rumours can cripple a thriving business and inflict irreparable damage to its goodwill, so the same can be done in Parliament. And what better place than Parliament, the proceedings of which are a favourite conversational topic in the coffee shops, in taxis, at the office, at the dinner table, at private parties, and, Sir, I would not be at all surprised, in schools as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irresponsible remarks, unsubstantiated allegations, half-truths or, worse still, untruths, dressed up so as to sound like truths, can cause harm and damage to innocent parties, and on a more serious scale, Sir, because they are made in the course of Parliamentary proceedings, can even undermine the political stability and economy of the nation by causing undue and unnecessary alarm to our neighbours, to our trade partners and would-be investors observing and listening to our proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the all-important difference between making such allegations or statements in Parliament and outside Parliament is that the maker can be taken to task in respect of what is said outside Parliament. And may I elaborate, Sir. People who suffer damage as a result of such allegations and statements have legal redress against the maker, and if the allegations and statements amount to an offence, the maker may even be charged in the appropriate court of law. But, and this is a crucial "but", when such allegations and statements are made in Parliament, the maker of such allegations and statements is protected from liability in every respect because he is accorded Parliamentary privilege and immunity. This privilege gives complete freedom of speech to a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Member of Parliament speaking in Parliament, so that he can utter anything under the sun and whatever that comes into his head and no matter who or what he hurts or causes damage to, to whatever extent, he is completely immune to any criminal and civil proceedings that could be brought against him if he had spoken them outside Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? The word "why" is the natural question to ask. Why is an MP given freedom of speech and is immune from criminal and civil liability? The rationale for this is simply a protection to MPs to enable them to conduct themselves in the affairs of their constituents, their constituencies and the nation without the fear of criminal and civil actions being brought against them hanging like the Sword of Damocles over their heads.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat. It is a protection; a privilege accorded to Members speaking in Parliament. It is not a right to which a Member is entitled. A right cannot be withdrawn. A privilege can. And because it is a privilege it is not to be used as a shield under which to make allegations and statements according to a Member's whims and fancies nor to take pot-shots at persons which could not have been done outside Parliament without the Member having to answer for it in the Courts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when such a privilege is accorded, it is expected, it goes without saying, that an MP conducts himself in a manner befitting and worthy of it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Just as you are doing.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, of course.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is it worthy?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes. Listen. When I give you my ear. Why else, Sir, is an MP given the title "Honourable Member of Parliament"? In accordance with the sobriety and import of the proceedings in Parliament, in recognition of the privilege accorded to him, an MP is expected to conduct himself or herself with decorum, with distinction, honour and integrity. He owes it to the people who elected him to that seat, to be responsible for what he says in Parliament, and to ensure that what he says is credible and can be substantiated.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all the years that I have been part of this august House, some 23 years, Sir, come this September, the proceedings have always been conducted with decorum.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, family tea parties.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Aren't you jealous? Not to say that they have been uneventful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The early and mid-sixties was a tumultuous period, with vigorous and often boisterous opposition from the Barisan Sosialis and the United People's Party. Of course, the political climate was different then. The Opposition were a hard hitting and bare-knuckled lot. Parliamentary sessions were often stormy, with both sides standing up for what they believed in. But there was not one occasion to give the then Legislative Assembly, and later Parliament, cause to set up its Committee of Privileges to deal with a complaint of breach of privilege. Why? Because decorum prevailed as the Speaker was always heard in silence and with great respect.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the late 60s and 70s when Parliament was dominated by the PAP, the Backbenchers had to double-up as the Opposition by making constructive and positive criticisms in and outside Parliament. This was in addition to their role as PAP MPs which was to explain Government policies to the people and to help them adjust to the policies. Sometimes Ministers were even taken to task on certain issues. There was no want of debate on any issue. At times some of us were even branded as being too oppositionistic in our debates and in putting across our views. This dual role was not an easy one. Yet, Sir, for all our enthusiasm in providing the voice of an Opposition, there was always decorum in the House. The Speaker was always and will be accorded due respect by us in the PAP.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope Members will excuse my little excursion into the past. It is to illustrate how disturbed I am at the change in the proceedings in this House since December 1981, with the entry of the Member for Anson. Never before has a Member of this House made so many allegations as he did or uttered defamatory words against
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> persons who were unable to seek redress in a Court of law agaianst him.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker, Sir. Would the Member refer now the House to all the statements uttered by me which amount to defamation of persons outside this House? Would he please refer the House to all the statements before he makes that statement?
  <br>

How does that amount to defamatory remarks about Mr Howe Yoon Chong? It is a complete non sequiter and an inability to understand what defamatory matter is.

  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir. I beg your pardon. I was coming to this point on breach of privilege and abuse. Privilege is the protection and not for abuse. Yes, Sir, the privilege is there but for protection and not for abuse. If there is any integrity and sincerity at all in making such allegations, surely it would not be asking too much of the Member to repeat them outside Parliament. This is all I am asking. When challenged without the immunity afforded by Parliamentary privilege, the parties concerned then would at least have the opportunity to defend themselves or to seek redress if such allegations were totally unsubstantiated and untrue. It is only fair, isn't it?

  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am not giving way, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Because he is talking nonsense.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Yes, when the pain hurts. I am therefore with the Hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House when he explained the need for this Bill to be taken on a Certificate of Urgency. This House must continue to uphold its integrity, dignity and honour. The Amendment Bill will have a sobering effect and I am beginning to feel right down deep in my bones that it has on all present and future Members of Parliament and also on those wishing to offer themselves as candidates in the elections. Members of this House ought to bear in mind that their conduct, both inside and outside Parliament, must be honourable and exemplary. It must be that what they say in this House, they are prepared to repeat outside when challenged to do so or else at least have the courtesy to extend an apology if circumstances are such that it is not possible or unwise to repeat them outside.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to point out that, notwithstanding the additional powers that Parliament will have upon the passage of this Bill, there will be no curtailment or restriction whatsoever on the freedom of speech in Parliament. But this freedom must be tempered with responsibility. Innocent parties must not be dragged in and made to suffer. Their rights must be considered as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Parliament is now under public scrutiny because, at the flick of a switch, Singaporeans can turn on their television sets and watch what their elected representatives say and do on their behalf in Parliament. They can see their MPs talking, whether they are talking sense or no-sense. But words when twisted can mislead and only upon reflection will the truth be unravelled from the tangle of untruths. The initial impact will stay and, for people who are unable to perceive the truth, they will remain misled.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this House should give its fullest support to the Bill. The amendments proposed by the Bill are, as I said earlier, extremely necessary and very
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> timely. They were not needed earlier because there was always decorum in the House. They are needed now because we have seen several instances of blatant abuse of privilege of late. I am at a loss as to understand how an "honourable" Member can make allegations and then cast the onus of proving those allegations untrue on those against whom they are made. He certainly cannot get away with it in a court of law. In a court, as I understand it, the onus of proof is on the person making the allegations. What he alleges, he must prove that it is true.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, an enormous amount of time and effort, not to mention money and manpower, was wasted in setting up the Commission of Inquiry to investigate alleged Executive interference in the Subordinate Courts and the Judiciary. As it turned out, the person who made the allegations refused to substantiate them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that enough is enough. Abuse of Parliamentary privilege is a serious matter. I applaud the powers given to Parliament to suspend the privilege in such a case. It is a right step. If MPs cannot conduct themselves in a manner worthy of the special privilege accorded to them, then I say that Parliament collectively has a right to intervene. After all, Parliament has the right to regulate how its proceedings are to be conducted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I give my wholehearted support to this Amendment Bill, I have one last point and question. May I ask of the Hon. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House whether he has any proposals to deal with a recalcitrant Member who chooses to defy the Speaker and the House and continues with his unscrupulous abuse of privilege in the House? What I would like to know, Sir, is what can be done, what remedies the House has in such a case?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Member who has just spoken, by way of clarification, since he seems to agree that Parliament is under scrutiny by the public, and very rightly too he has pointed that out, would he support my proposal that the matter should be referred to the public and to the constituents of Anson and Tanjong Pagar to decide?

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to join the debate along with the Member for Punggol in supporting this motion standing in the name of the Leader of the House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, privilege in Parliament is something we, as Members of this House, cherish. It allows us to speak without fear, to engage in free and open debate on matters of public interest. It should not be used as a passport to cast aspersions on people or systems, especially if such aspersions could not be substantiated. There must therefore be some degree of fairness and responsibility in our utterances, and to ensure this, Mr Speaker, Sir, we must be guided by some rules. Individual Members of this House cannot make up their own rules for debate. We must follow the House rules and if we do not abide by these rules we must answer for it. There must, as the Leader of the House has pointed out, some decorum and dignity in the way we conduct ourselves in this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect our citizens to follow the rule of law in this country so that others do not suffer from the consequences of bad behaviour. If this be so, surely Members of this House must not be allowed to get away with unsubstantiated utterances that may be injurious to people within this House or outside. The Leader of the House has pointed out that the present ruling in this House is inadequate to deal with this and it is precisely our inadequacy to deal with this that we are debating on this amendment. The degree of punishment for our citizens varies from a fine to a hanging. In other words, it varies with the nature of the offence. Likewise, the degree of penalties in this House must vary with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the severity of the offence and this amendment seeks to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present this House can only reprimand, suspend or impose a fine of up to $1,000 on errant MPs. This is a very light form of penalty and will not deter certain Members of this House from continuing to abuse the privilege accorded. There have to be very compelling reasons for Parliaments in the United Kingdom, Malaysia and other Commonwealth countries to impose more severe penalties. We are just keeping up with standard practice in the Commonwealth.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is not the standard practice.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Point of order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the point of order, Mr Chiam?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I think what the Member is saying is not true. We are not keeping up with the Commonwealth Parliaments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Allow me to continue, Mr Speaker. The United Kingdom and Commonwealth option, namely, to suspend, to expel, to commit to prison and/or a fine, has been effective in checking the behaviour of its Members. We have an added option, and that is, the withdrawal of immunity and privilege for a certain period. I think this is a fair move. It gives the recalcitrant MP a chance to remain in this House. He may also speak, though he has to learn to speak with reason and decorum, no more wild allegations and half-truths.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our citizens will react very unfavourably to this amendment. It will be interpreted as Government's action to silence the Opposition in Parliament. It is the wider implications of this amendment that they should think of. We can conduct ourselves in an orderly, fair and responsible way to get things done. Members of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Parliament should be able to conduct themselves well, with dignity and decorum. There is no need to yell, cast aspersions, fabricate stories in this House to prove that we are serving the people. People outside this House, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Punggol, addressed us hon. Members as "Honourable". So let us live up to that. There can be no honour, Mr Speaker, Sir, without responsibility. Therefore, I am prepared to go along with this amendment Bill even if privilege, so vital in the conduct of debates, has to be withdrawn temporarily from a Member.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is fear expressed that this Government may be too quick to refer MPs, especially Opposition MPs, to the Committee of Privileges for sanction. I am sure this will not happen. If this Government or majority party does that without valid reasons, we will be in trouble because we are on television and people are watching us. Moreover, Mr Speaker, Sir, one need not fear to speak out unless the motive is wrong or suspect. Some Singaporeans outside this House sympathize with the Opposition Members because we PAP Members of this House, by our sheer numbers, are perceived to be bullying them. But this Government has a responsibility to the majority of Singaporeans who voted the PAP and this Government has a responsibility to let Singaporeans know the truth. This amendment is to ensure that, to seek the truth, there must be fair and responsible debate, and if an allegation is proved false, the Member must apologize or face censure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Encik Sidek bin Saniff)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the House because I feel that in the interest of the integrity of this House and the honour of our citizens as a whole, we need to make this amendment as it encompasses matters that cover our social life and the administration of our country. It also encompasses the life of an individual in this country. I am sure that, as a former colony, we have inherited many things from the colonialists, not only the bad
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> things but also some good things which are suitable to us. One of them is the democratic system, that is, the parliamentary system, the legislative system. And we should be thankful. And I am thankful that the Government has decided that matters that cannot be resolved in our Court can be referred to the privy council. This should be maintained. We also know that modification should be made to suit the needs of the country. In fact, in Africa itself we have heard that some countries have not succeeded because they have inherited a system that is alien to their cultures. Perhaps there is this one party system, poverty, tribal enmity, maybe corruption. But we also know that there are some African countries which, after making modifications, come to realize that political stability is vital for the prosperity of the country. Therefore, countries like Ivory Coast, Botswana, Senegal, Cameroon, Kenya could defend the system that they have inherited and achieved political stability through a strong central government, pragmatic leadership and so on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that after these powers have been invested in the Committee of Privileges, an individual like yourself, an individual like Dr Tony Tan, and those who sit on the Committee will make an arbitrary decision because their decision will be studied, will be scrutinized by everyone of us here, by lawyers, judges and the whole of the Singapore community. I say it is impossible to make judgment haphazardly, just like somebody stealing epok epok or curry puff, he should be punished like someone who has robbed a bank. You must have heard that in an Islamic country, even somebody who steals will have his hands cut off. It does not mean that somebody who steals epok-epok will also have his hands cut off. And I am sure that the system that we have inherited, the laws that we have inherited, including laws in Britain today, are being observed especially by judges and lawyers themselves. In present day Britain there exists two viewpoints. We have two kinds of thinking. One feels that any legislation passed can be changed by the judges. Because many still maintain that legislation made here, made by the legislators, tabled or delivered by somebody who is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> not a lawyer since not all Ministers are lawyers, must come back to this Chamber to be amended or defended by the Government. To do otherwise would be "a naked usurpation of legislative function." But we also know, especially those who are lawyers, that every piece of legislation that we bring up in this august Chamber usually has different interpretations to different persons. However, there is one man, who, I think commands the respect of many lawyers, a Maverick, like Lord Denning. He says that if we wish to give the meaning of a law or rule in a Bill, choose the meaning that accords two important elements, ie, reason and justice. And I quote what he says in his book, The Discipline of Law: "If you have to make a choice, choose the meaning that accords reason and justice." I am confident that every one of our Ministers who tables a Bill in this House bears in mind these two important factors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also be aware that when we argue on something, we must include two or the twin-pillars of justice, and that is, impartiality and the element of fairness. So if there are attempts to strip, to tinker with these two aspects, such people must bring forth cogent reasons. We cannot resort to innuendoes, indulge in jabberings only because if right-minded people attending a court of law go away thinking and saying, "The judge is biased", I think that is the beginning of the end of law and order and of confidence. This is what I have discovered of late, attempts to fault a Bill without advancing valid arguments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think no one should fear this Bill because I am sure that Singaporeans, after 25 years, have become more articulated and they are aware of the happenings and, in fact, they fully understand now the pretensions put forth by the Opposition. What needs to be said, I think, is the truth. Do not tell tales. I remember of a freedom fighter who, when asked by journalists what he wanted inserted in the newspapers in order to disseminate his struggles, his objectives, replied, "The truth will do." However, we find that people find it hard to tell the truth. Untruths abound us. I think much glib talks have been flung around. I know of an English saying, "Hell hath no fury like a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> woman scorned." What I fear is that "woman" here refers to a widow or widower. It means that a person had at one time been a member of a certain association, subsequently he left the association. Maybe at one time he had worked for the government and is no longer working now. A widow or widower who backchats about her husband or wife, however untrue, there are some people, and here I emphasize "some people" and not all the people, who believe in the story because at one time they had been living together. It is for this reason, I think, that such widows or widowers say more untruths than truths. Like the Chinese say, Pofu ma jie - a woman scolding somebody in the street. So, I think we cannot adopt such a stance because this august House has no room for such talk. We need to be brave to face it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the Opposition need fear if they are true leaders, possessing true leadership spirit, because leaders place truth above everything else. If we think that we are right, we need not fear the jail, nor the fines; we need not even fear about our own lives. That then are the qualities of leadership. My dad gave me a simple example. He says, "Sidek, if you want to uphold truth ---

On the contrary, if you are wrong, you take the word "wrong" and ambulate a temple, a church or a mosque, the word "wrong" will not change to read "right".

  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first deal with some general points that have been raised, especially by the two Members of the Opposition, before I deal
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> with some of the particular arguments that they have put forward.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, on clause 2 which now freezes the UK model as it was on the day that Singapore became independent - yes, this is intentional. It is deliberate and it is in line, as I pointed out, with what other Commonwealth countries such as India and Australia have in their constitutions or in their laws applying to Parliament. I think it is quite logical that we should have some model as a starting point. And it is quite logical that we should take the model existing in the UK on the day that we became independent as our starting point. But I think it would be absurd, having become independent and having become a Legislature of an independent sovereign country, to subject ourselves to changes in the UK which may have been caused or prompted by situations, circumstances and reasons, which have nothing to do with Singapore. Why should we be tied to continuing changes in the UK? We are a sovereign nation. We have to use something as a starting point and thereafter we should make our own rules and regulations to govern parliamentary privileges. Surely it cannot be suggested that we here, the elected Members of Parliament, are not capable of making our own rules over time. Yes, as the Member for Anson said, our rules must change with time. But the rules must also take into account the place where the rules apply, the particular conditions of the society. Therefore, I think it is eminently logical and desirable that we should not subject ourselves to changes in the UK after our date of independence. We are quite capable of looking after ourselves.

  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> We do follow the UK pattern. But what is made clear now in the Bill before the House is that we freeze, as I said, the UK model as it existed on the day that we became independent. I think we should not deny ourselves the right to do what we want. After all, we represent the people of Singapore, not the UK Parliament. So it is quite logical, as I said, that after independence, we should not subject ourselves to changes in the UK.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power to commit Members or strangers to prison, the power to expel, were excluded in the 1962 Ordinance and now, as I said, with section 11 being repealed, in that respect we are brought in line with what the practice in the UK today is. But I never said, and I would make this very clear, I never said that in every respect we are the same as the UK. In fact, there are two provisions that I specifically drew attention to which are different. One is the suspension of privilege and the other the powers of the Speaker or Chairman of a Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question has been asked, why on a Certificate of Urgency? Why is this Bill being taken through Parliament with all three Readings in one day? I thought I made this clear and I have not tried to hide what the reasons are. I said that the Committee of Privileges will be meeting soon and we want to give the Chairman of the Committee of Privileges all the powers that are needed to ensure that proceedings in the Committee, when they hear the complaint against the Member for Anson, are conducted in such a way that dignity, decorum, orderliness are preserved. It is not intended to limit the Member for Anson. If the Member thinks that the only way he can prove his point or his allegations in the Committee of Privileges is to make further defamatory statements, then obviously he will be restricted. If he does not confine himself to statements that are not defamatory, he will have to face the full penalties set out in the Bill before the House today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made it clear that we want to get at the truth. We have nothing to hide on this matter. We want to get to the bottom. We want the full truth to come out without any distraction so that the people of Singapore will know what is behind all these
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> allegations. We will not allow - and this is the intention of giving the powers to the Chairman - a smokescreen of further smears, innuendoes, insinuations, to distract from arriving at the truth. There will be a very thorough investigation by the Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has already said that, as head of the Executive, he will give evidence himself and he is prepared to subject himself to cross-examination. The Member for Anson will also have to give evidence and he will also be cross-examined. We want to arrive at the truth and that is the purpose of rushing this Bill through Parliament so that the conduct of the hearing will be such that nothing will distract us from the process of arriving at the truth. And that, I have made it clear, is the main reason why we presented this Bill on a Certificate of Urgency.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provisions of the Bill on the suspension of privilege are not meant to silence criticism. By all means, take the Government to task. By all means, examine the Government's actions thoroughly, closely. But this does not mean that Members have to resort to defamatory statements or serious allegations which undermine our key institutions which they are not able to prove.

  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> But you yourself mentioned the case too. You mentioned it yourself just now.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I said I did not want to go into that. I said they were before the Committee of Privileges. But the Leader is now saying, unless he says he has not said it, that these allegations are unfounded.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I made a general point. I specifically referred to that clause in the Bill which speaks of the suspension of privileges. I said it is not meant to silence criticism, and I said by all means take the Government to task, examine Government's actions closely, scrutinize Government's actions. But that does not mean that Members have to resort to defamatory statements and allegations which they cannot prove. I think that is a general statement, Sir. I was not referring to any particular occasion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has compared his role in this House with that of the Prime Minister when he was in the Opposition. Mr Speaker, Sir, I leave the Members of this House to come to their own conclusion whether such a comparison is a fair comparison. But, Sir, one point I must stress, yes, the Prime Minister when he was in the Opposition hounded the government. He put every action of theirs under close scrutiny but he never made any statement that defamed anybody. He never committed any breach of privilege. He was never referred to a Committee of Privileges. And neither was he unprepared to repeat anything he said in this House outside this House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, we have nothing to hide. This Government has always conducted itself in such a manner that it is open to examination. We have nothing to hide. And that is why we are most anxious that the Committee of Privileges hearing this particular complaint should come to the truth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that apart from the Certificate of Urgency, the provisions of the Bill are also partly prompted by the Member for Anson's conduct in Parliament thus far. But while they have been prompted by his conduct, I must hasten to clarify that the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> real purpose of this Bill is a wider and more important one. The question that we ought to ask ourselves is: what kind of rules ought we to draw for ourselves that will encourage the right type of people to enter politics, seek to enter Parliament and what kind of political processes should we encourage and support in Singapore? Should we have a system of rules, a code of conduct, that attracts men with ideas, with alternatives? Or should we conduct ourselves in such a way and give the impression to the people at large that the only thing required to run for office or to run for Parliament is to come here and make vague statements insinuating wrongdoing, undermine key institutions in the Government and society? And that this is all that is required to make an appeal to the people of Singapore. The Member for Anson, I must say a little bit to my surprise, just now said that it is the function of the Opposition to make defamatory statements.

We reject this approach completely. We reject it completely. If this is the function of the Opposition ---

We have to draw for ourselves what will work in Singapore. We reject his proposition completely. Of course, the Member has conducted himself in the House so far by following this principle - that the Opposition is here to defame the Government by making insinuations, innuendoes, allegations which chip away and erode the main pillars of our society, which chip away and erode what we have taken so long and at such great cost to build up. This statement

  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Leader have the whole of my speech with him? Does he have it? Because I was responding, Mr Speaker, Sir, to a letter that appeared in the Straits Times that day. I said that "we are determined to change the way things

  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Sir, when the Member for Anson first came to this House, he started by raising questions casting doubt on the integrity and honesty of the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is well-known not only in Singapore but throughout the world that this is one of the few, if not the only government, that is incorruptible, honest. And he knew that this was the strength of the PAP Government and he decided that doubts had to be created about the character of this Government. That was his first line of attack. Then he raised questions which were aimed at casting doubt on the impartiality of law enforcement officers, the Police Force. His theme is that we are a Police State and that various actions that the Police take are politically motivated, that this is a State that is oppressed by law enforcement officers. So bring law and law enforcement into disrepute. Thirdly, he questioned the independence of our Judiciary, starting first with the Subordinate Judiciary, then making remarks about the Chief Justice, and which are matters before the Committee of Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is all before the Committee of Privileges.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Will you stop there.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have to remind the Leader.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Just now, Sir, again he made another statement, which I have not referred to the Committee of Privileges. He made a statement that the Prime Minister has undermined the independence of the Judiciary.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Refer that to the Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> I am afraid I missed the part where I think he mentioned about the Jury and that the fact that the Prime Minister could appoint Justices to a fixed term amounts to undermining the independence of the Judicial system.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, I maintain that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is quite clear, even if the Member had not stated it so baldly just now, what the Member is up to.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is all wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> And if those who are interested in entering the political process in Singapore (and we want people to participate in politics) if they get the impression, if the idea is pervade to them, that this is what the political process in Opposition is all about, then we will attract people who can only destroy, and not people who can build. What kind of Parliament will we have? What kind of politicians will we have? Sir, there are countries where there is such a significant number of politicians who are charlatans and crooks that public opinion about politicians as a whole is very, very bad. In fact, in a number of opinion polls, politicians ranked among the lowest in terms of trustworthiness. Surely in these countries, the majority of politicians cannot be unworthy of trust, but because they have such a significant number, minority though they may be, who are not trustworthy, all politicians are branded. This makes it even less attractive for good people to come into politics, because they do not want to get involved in an activity, in a profession, which is considered by people as being among the lowest as far as trustworthiness is concerned. Do we want this to happen in Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy is a very new experience for us. We have to chart our own way. We cannot keep quoting what happened in the United Kingdom. We must chart our own way; we must evolve our own system; we must evolve our own rules. Even older societies which have had more experience than us in democracy have found the process of democracy derailed when the wrong type of people got into politics. We must not allow this to happen in Singapore. The purpose of this Bill is not to stifle democracy, but to enable it to work under our particular circumstance. Both the Member for Potong Pasir and the Member for Anson say that this Bill is a blow to democracy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not uncommon in other countries, and even in Singapore in the 60's, perhaps even today, for those who abuse the democratic process to be the first to cry "Foul" when steps are taken to check them. The Communists, for example, are always in the forefront in the battles in democratic countries when anything is done to curb freedom of speech or action. They want full freedom of speech, full freedom of action. Because they need these freedoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> What have you done?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> They need these freedoms to undermine the very society in which they operate. They need the freedoms in order to create chaos, they need the freedom to create disorder, so that the ground will be fertile for them to appeal to the masses. But once they take over, the people can kiss freedoms good-bye. The only democracy that you will find will be the word "democratic" in the name of the country. And we know of many Communist countries that call themselves democratic and the only democracy that they have is in the name.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to change our democratic system. We only want to ensure that the kind of changes necessary to make it work in our society, in our situation, would be taken. We must not shy from taking such measures. And we have. We have introduced over the years provisions in our law which are quite different from what they are in other countries. And now other countries are beginning to see the wisdom of such laws. Let me just quote one example. We were the first to make the rule that if a Member is elected on a Party ticket and if he resigns from the Party, he vacates his seat in the House. It is something that the British never liked because it was something unheard of for them. I think because of that rule, Singapore has had stable Government. Others have watched this and they are trying to introduce the same rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Who?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Thailand, Sabah, and India would love to introduce it.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the particular amendment relating to the suspension of privileges has been
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> commented upon in some detail. I really do not know what all the hand-wringing is about. We already have the right to suspend Members. If the Committee of Privileges or any other Committee which has been established to look into the abuse of privilege comes to the conclusion that there has been a serious abuse of privilege, it can, under our existing rules, suspend the Member from Parliament, which means that the Member cannot be found anywhere in the precincts of Parliament. He will have no right to be here. He will have no right to speak.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have introduced is admittedly something new, but something that suits our particular circumstance - that a Member who has been found guilty after a certain process, which I will explain, can participate in all the debates in this House. He can vote on proceedings, but he has to watch what he says. What is so wrong with that? Is anybody here claiming that the only way he can make his point and advance his cause is by making defamatory statements? Surely Members can always advance arguments without having to resort to defamatory statements. In fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, we seriously considered whether we should not suspend privileges for all Members in this House, because we were very confident that in any situation we would be able to make our point to Parliament and to the people without the protection of this provision in the law. But after serious consideration, we thought that that would be a very drastic step because we want to aim this law only on Members who abuse this privilege.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension of privilege as provided for in the Bill is a lesser punishment than total suspension from Parliament. Only those who find that they cannot debate in this House without making defamatory statements will find this a hindrance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the defamatory statement made in this House must first be considered by a Committee. And as was pointed out by the hon. Member for Kolam Ayer, (Encik Sidek Saniff) the Members of the Committee of Privileges are Members with responsibility. They are Members who are known to be men of integrity, who have their own mind about matters. They are not going
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to arrive at a conclusion that, just because a statement has been made by an Opposition Member, therefore it is defamatory unless after examination, after hearing evidence, they come to the conclusion that there was no evidence to back the allegation or statement. Then, having come to the conclusion, they will again have to examine whether the particular misdemeanour requires the punishment of suspension of privilege. This is not something that will be done lightly. But Members of the House must know that if they abuse this privilege, there will be a price to pay. Insofar as the Members of the PAP are concerned, they know that if they abuse this privilege they will have more to pay than just mere suspension of privilege because our own Party rules of conduct in this matter are extremely rigorous.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken note, Mr Speaker, Sir, of the Member for Anson's offer to repeat his statement about the Chief Justice outside this House. I would also like to know whether he will repeat every statement that he has made in this House that we list as being defamatory. We, on this side, are prepared to repeat outside everything that we said.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Point of clarification. I think what the Leader of the House omits is that I said if the Chief Justice will write to me, because I do not know what is it that he wants me to repeat, and point out exactly what he wants me to repeat outside, I will repeat it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said I have taken note of his offer. I have asked a question whether he is also prepared to repeat every other statement that we consider as defamatory. Would he like to answer that?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Leader forgets that it is the person aggrieved by the defamatory statement. If the Chief Justice, according to the Prime Minister, wants me to repeat it, let him write to me, I said, and I will then repeat the statement if he points exactly to the statement that I made.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he is just trying to wriggle out. He has also made the point that the people should be asked to decide on this matter because it is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> such a momentous change in our laws that it is something that Parliament should not take upon itself to decide. I ask the Member: what are we elected for? This is a law that affects the conduct of Members of Parliament in this House. Surely, we are qualified to make the rules that should govern the way we conduct our proceedings in this House. We are elected Members. We do not have to go back to the people for everything. His idea of a by-election ---

  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, he has come out with his dramatic idea that he will resign from his constituency and the Prime Minister will resign from his constituency and that they will contest to prove whether there is support for this Bill. Sir, we know what the issues are before the House. We know that the Member would love dearly to distract the attention of Singapore and this House from what is ahead. The Prime Minister is quite capable of taking care of his interests. He has full confidence in the Members of this House who belong to the PAP to take care of the interests of this House. But if the Member for Anson is so exercised and so keen and anxious to prove that he has the support of the people to oppose this Bill, by all means, resign from Anson. I can give him the assurance that there will be an early by-election and he can prove his point.
  <br>

  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister does not have to prove anything. He is not anxious to prove that he has the support of the people of Singapore. That has been proved again and again. But if the Member for Anson is keen and anxious to show that he still has the support of the people of Singapore, by all means proceed with his proposal and I can assure him that there will be an early by-election. We will not deny him by postponing the by-election. We will have an early by-election and he can prove his point.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir asked me to give examples of dishonourable conduct, abuse of privilege and contempt. These are matters that the Committee of Privileges will decide from time to time. But if he wants to have examples, I am sure if he looks up Erskine May in the library there are ample examples for him to look into.

  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Well, practice before 1965. Certainly, Sir, as I said, there will be no double standards. The standards that we apply will apply to all the Members of this House. As I have made it very clear, Members of the PAP know that they are under a much more rigorous standard than is required under this Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has asked the question of the magnitude of the fine. Why is it that strangers have the same maximum fine as Members?

  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> The Member for Potong Pasir has also asked for clarification on section 20(2), whether it has a retroactive effect. I think I have made that very clear. If a Member were to commit contempt now or make a defamatory statement which is referred to the Committee of Privileges now, ie, before this Bill is passed, then when the Committee of Privileges meets and hears the complaint and, if the Committee of Privileges comes to the conclusion that the Member is guilty, then he will be subject to the punishment as it stands in the law today, which is the Act as it stands today, ie, without this Bill, because the offence was committed before the Bill was passed. But, of course, if in the course of the hearing of the Committee of Privileges he commits further contempt or makes a defamatory statement then he will come under the new law. So that should be clear enough.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Not what he has spoken?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Anything that any Member says before this law comes into operation would be subject to the old Bill. Anything that he says after this Bill comes into operation will be subject to the new Act. That is simple.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have a clarification, Mr Speaker? What has been spoken, if he comes before the Committee of Privileges, the same subject matter will be brought up, isn't it? So, in effect, it is retroactive. If it were a different complaint
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from before the law was passed, then it will be a different subject matter.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, the Committee of Privileges will be considering a complaint made on an offence committed before the new law comes into operation. But if, in the course of giving evidence, or if in the course of a hearing of the Committee of Privileges, he makes further statements and further smears, then of course it must come under the new Act. But the particular statement or offence committed before the new Act will be subject to the punitive powers in the Act as it stands today.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol asked whether there is any proposal to deal with recalcitrant Members who continually abuse privilege or commit contempt of Parliament. I think the provisions in the Bill are sufficient to deal with the case. I mentioned in my closing remarks during the Second Reading that we are going to do a thorough review of the Act and compare our provisions with those existing in other countries, especially Commonwealth countries and if, after the study we find that further amendments are needed, we will introduce them in this House.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I by way of clarification ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Some more clarifications? Through the whole day you have been wanting to ask for clarifications. All right, make your point of clarification.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> This concerns the proceedings before the Committee of Privileges. I asked the Leader whether the whole purpose, as I said it would appear to be, was to try and seal my mouth before the Committee of Privileges and he said, "No. That is not the intention. But if he makes further statements about other things, then of course this will apply." Does he or does he not accept that that would amount to limiting my defence, putting limitations on my defence? It is like telling an accused person in court, "You may not say anything else. You cannot speak except on this very charge. You cannot bring in anything else." Does he or does he not accept that, and is that the intention so that I can be sealed?

  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no intention to seal the Member's lips in any way. Unless he claims that the only way he can defend himself is by making more smears and more insinuations and more defamatory statements. He can say what he likes in the Committee of Privileges but if he makes new statements which are defamatory he should be very clear in his own mind that he has evidence to substantiate those statements. That is all that is required.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr S. Dhanabalan].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.
  <br>5.35 pm
  <div align="center">
   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Chairman, may I seek a direction from you first, and that is this. I understood from the Leader of the House that, since this Bill is being taken through a Certificate of Urgency, the question of giving notice of amendments will be dispensed with and that any Member may move any amendment at the Committee stage without giving notice. If that is so, I propose to move a number of amendments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> You are quite right, Mr Jeyaretnam. Under Standing Order 71(3), you are allowed to move amendmentswithout notice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I give notice that I will be moving amendments to clause 2 and clause 5.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> All right.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> You are moving an amendment, Mr Jeyaretnam?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes. Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, lines 8 and 9, to leave out the words "at the establishment of the Republic of Singapore"
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of the amendment will become clear if I explain that this clause tries to define what the powers, privileges and immunities of Parliament will be. It does not attempt to interfere with the punishment for any abuse of privilege. This clause merely tries to define what the powers, privileges and immunities of the House shall be. And the Leader in moving the Bill said, (I hope I have got him correctly) that we are still at the elementary stage of democracy and it would useful for us to have regard to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the usages of the UK Parliament, just as in our judicial system we have recourse to how the law is applied in England. And although they are not binding on us, they are, as the Judges will tell you, of great persuasive authority.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my plea is that we are not going to suffer anything if we take guidance on the question of what amounts to an abuse of privilege, what amounts to contempt, from the usages, conventions and customs of the UK Parliament. If, after taking such guidance, we find that the Member has committed an abuse of privilege, then the punishments are there and the punishment may be more drastic than the UK Parliament because in the UK Parliament there is no punishment of a fine. But it is important that we should have some guidance as to what amounts to an abuse of privilege.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer, Mr Speaker, to Article 104 of the Standing Orders by which we are guided. It says,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In cases of doubt the Standing Orders of Parliament shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant practice of the Commons House of Parliament of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.' So it is the practice that is relevant at the time that we are seeking to interpret any orders in our Standing Orders. So my amendment will bring this clause into line with the Standing Order 104(1). Otherwise there is a conflict between Standing Order 104(1) and the amendment proposed in the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this, Mr Speaker, Sir, without referring to matters before the Privileges Committee now. I have, in a submission, referred to a change that has come about in the United Kingdom Parliament and the Privileges Committee has got that in front of them. It is that sort of situations on which we should be guided. And I ask the Minister to consider accepting my amendment because it does not do any violence to the question of punishment which is what the Leader of the House and the Government are mostly concerned with - anyone who abuses privilege should be adequately punished. This does not. This amendment simply seeks to give guidance to everyone as to what constitutes abuse
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> of privilege. The Leader himself told my colleague, the Member for Potong Pasir, "You can look it up in Erskine May." Well, Erskine May does not stop in 1962. Erskine May continues up to the present. And so we should know what the present usage of Parliament is. So I ask that the amendment be accepted.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really do not have much more to add to what I have already stated just now. We go on a simple principle - what is the pattern or model that we should follow? We think that it is logical to follow the pattern and model of the UK, as it was, on the date when we became independent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that this necessarily conflicts with Standing Order 104, "In cases of doubt the Standing Orders of Parliament shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant practice...". Yes, whatever the particular subject that is in doubt ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Relevant today.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Relevant practice. It does not say "today".
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Of course, it is today.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Well, it will then have to be governed by the law. The law will supersede the Standing Orders. I think it is quite clear that the law takes precedence over the Standing Orders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be left out, be left out."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask for a Division on this?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>An hon. Member:</b> You are wasting time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> On the earlier motion, you already had a Division and you know the results.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I ask for a Division on this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> Again? All right. You want to have a Division, have a Division then. Ring the Division bells.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment accordingly negatived.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 36 to line 9 in page 3, to leave out subsection (2). There is a consequential amendment. The figure "(2)" should be substituted for the "(3)" in subsection (3), so that the whole of subsection (2) is deleted and subsection (3) becomes subsection (2).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my reasons for moving the amendment are that, as has been explained or pointed out by the Leader of the House, this is something completely new and is a departure from the law in the United Kingdom. As I said, there the United Kingdom Parliament has jealously fought to prevent any other tribunal outside it from inquiring into anything said in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> its Houses of Parliament. It has arrogated to itself the sole authority to decide on any matter said within it. And there was a good reason for it and the reason is that Members of Parliament may speak without any worry, without any fear, that they may be made subject to civil proceedings or criminal proceedings outside Parliament in respect of anything said by them in Parliament. This is fundamental and it is vital to the whole question of parliamentary government that Parliament alone is the supreme body, and every other institution in the land is subject to Parliament. Parliament is the supreme institution and no other tribunal may question anything said in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also point out, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the proposed subsection (2) will run counter to section 4 of the present Act. The Bill does not propose to make any amendment to section 4. I should perhaps not be pointing this out but raising it later outside if necessary. But I would be failing in my duty if I do not point out that the draftsman seemed to have overlooked completely section 4 of this Act. Because if you look at section 4 of the present Act, it says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There shall be freedom of speech and debate and proceedings in Parliament, and such freedom of speech and debate and proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court, commission of inquiry, tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament.' So there you have a section, very clear in its terms, that anything said in Parliament "shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court, commission of inquiry, tribunal or any other place whatsoever out of Parliament." And this Bill now proposes to provide that it shall be questioned where Parliament itself proposes to remove the immunity. But section 4 does not talk about the removal of such immunity by Parliament, by a resolution. So it is clearly, in my view, contrary to section 4 of the Act and is in conflict. And for this reason, I ask that the Minister consider now whether the proposed clause is in conflict; and secondly, for the more important reason, whether he thinks it necessary that we should subject proceedings in Parliament to an institution which, as I said, should be subordinate to Parliament. It derogates from the whole
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> idea of the supremacy of Parliament and proceedings in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this particular provision in the Bill has been the subject of considerable comment by Members as well as by me during the Second Reading. I know that the Member for Anson is against this provision. He has given his reasons; I have given my reasons.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really do not have anything more to add except to say this. I am not a lawyer, Mr Speaker, Sir, but as I read it, section 4 of the Act, which the Member for Anson quoted, is not so absolute that you can say anything in Parliament without being liable for what you say. For example, section 30 says, "No person shall ...", and there is a whole list of offences. It is quite clear there, for example, that if in Parliament, or in a Committee of Parliament, false evidence is given, or something false is said, then they are subject to penalties. So obviously section 4 must be modified by other specific exclusions in the Act, and the proposed Bill makes this specific provision that under certain circumstances the privileges accorded by sections 3, 4 and 5 can be suspended.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I just reply to that briefly, Mr Speaker, Sir. I am afraid the Leader of the House has misconstrued section 30 of the present Act completely. Section 30 does not refer to anything said in Parliament. It talks about a number of other things, "wilfully failing or refusing to obey any rule or order of Parliament" and "failing to comply with any summons". And so it goes on. Whereas section 4 talks about statements made in Parliament, in the House or in any Committee of the House. So section 30 does not concern itself with statements made by a Member in Parliament, ie, "wilfully make a false answer to any question material to the subject of inquiry". That is something quite different from making a statement in Parliament on a Bill or in a debate on any matter. It is quite different, in my view. You cannot try and bring it within that.

  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> supplement the point made by the Leader of the House. First of all, the Leader is quite correct in pointing out that section 30, paragraph (q) already envisages that certain proceedings in Parliament or a Committee thereof may be subject to proceedings in a court. And I quote the whole of paragraph (q):
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'whether or not he has been sworn or has made an affirmation, [it is an offence] wilfully to make a false answer to any question material to the subject of inquiry put during examination before Parliament or a committee.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, Mr Speaker, Sir, to make in response to the Member for Anson when he says there is a possible conflict between section 4 and the proposed clause 2 of section 20, is that there is no conflict. There is no conflict because section 4 of the Act is expressly referred to in the new subsection (2). The new proposed subsection (2) expressly refers to section 4 of the existing Act. So there is no conflict. There might be an argument for conflict if the proposed amendment showed a lapse, shall we say, in terms of drafting. But there is no lapse. It is covered. There is express reference to section 4.
  <br>

  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just be allowed to join in. Before I begin, I would just like to make an observation. At the last amendment, I notice that many Members were out, probably drinking their tea, without hearing the argument as to whether ---
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> What has that got to do with this particular clause?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is the same thing here.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Chairman:</b> Come to the point, Mr Chiam. It is getting late, you know?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, all right. If you look at section 17, it also says:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Without prejudice to the provisions of section 16 of this Act and subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section, no person who gives evidence before Parliament or any committee shall be liable to any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages by reason of anything which he may have said in such evidence.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I think this provision will be in conflict if section 20 (2) is not deleted.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Because subsection (2) says that it gives powers for Parliament to suspend privilege and immunity of a Member. In that case, how does section 17 come in? It is again in conflict.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir is getting himself all confused. If what he says is true, then even without this Bill, there is already a conflict between section 17 and section 30, which obviously cannot be so.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> In what section you say it cannot be?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> The point that you bring up has nothing to do with the Bill that we have before the House. It is something quite different. Of course, the point that he has made about section 17 is that there is certain protection, but that protection does not extend to the point of somebody making a false declaration. So there is always a limitation on the protection in Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the second point that my colleague made is quite conclusive because the amendment in clause 5, as my colleague has pointed out, quite specifically refers to section 4 of the Act. In other words, it recognizes that section 4 of the Act gives complete freedom but this particular clause that is in the Bill overrides, under certain circumstances, section 4. I think there is no lapse or oversight. It is quite clear.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I just reply to the Minister for Home Affairs an his clarification? He relies on the words in the new subsection (2) in clause 5, that it says "conferred by sections 3, 4 and 5". Of course, it must refer to the immunity conferred by section 5, by section 4 and by section 3. But where does section 4 say that the immunity is subject to Parliament waiving, or that section 4 shall not apply where Parliament has waived the immunity? Where does section 4 say that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is so absurd that really one ought not to reply. Of course, section 4 of the Act does not refer because this is an amendment which we are asking Parliament to adopt,
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br> and that is precisely the answer to his question.

   <b>ARBITRATION (FOREIGN AWARDS) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>6.42 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arbitration (Foreign Awards) Bill is to enable Singapore to ratify the New York Convention on the Recognition of Foreign Arbitral Awards concluded on 10th June 1958.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arbitration, rather than court proceedings, is the favoured means of resolving international commercial disputes. It is therefore important to the international business community that arbitral agreements and awards are recognized and easily enforced in as many countries as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our present law there are two ways in which an arbitral award obtained in another country may be enforced in Singapore. The successful party may commence fresh legal proceedings for the purpose, or, where the arbitral award was made in a Commonwealth country to which the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Chapter 24) applies, register the award in the High Court. The first method is cumbersome and the second is available only in respect of awards made in a handful of Commonwealth countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the New York Convention provides a more convenient means of enforcing arbitral agreements and awards by simplifying the conditions and procedures governing the recognition of such agreements and awards at the international level. Briefly, the Convention
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provides for the recognition of arbitration agreements with an international element and the consequent staying of court proceedings concerning disputes which should be arbitrated. Secondly, provision is made for the recognition and enforcement in a contracting state of arbitral awards made in another country without the need to commence fresh legal proceedings. The successful party merely has to produce the duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy of it. It will then be up to the other party to prove that the enforcement should not be granted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable for Singapore to accede to the Convention. To do so will be in keeping with our position as an international commercial and financial centre. It will encourage the development of Singapore as an international commercial arbitration centre and provide a boost to the service sector of our economy. The local business community will also benefit in that an award made in Singapore may be enforced in other countries which are parties to the Convention. As of 1st January 1986, 69 states were members of the New York Convention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Bill are modelled upon legislation prepared by the Commonwealth Secretariat for giving effect to the Convention. The Bill will not bar persons from enforcing arbitral awards under any other existing laws, and enforcement under the new law will not be less disadvantageous than enforcement under such other existing law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered desirable that Singapore makes a reservation to the effect that the Convention will apply to "awards made only in the territory of another Contracting State". This is because the principle of universality has not been widely accepted among the member states of the New York Convention and most of them have entered such a reservation upon their accession. Hence, the Arbitration (Foreign Awards) Bill will apply only to arbitral awards made in countries which are parties to the Convention.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides that the new law will be confined only to foreign awards made on or after the commencement of the new law. To permit the enforcement of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> awards made many years ago and not enforced for one reason or another might cause great trouble and expense to the parties concerned. Foreign awards made before the commencement of the proposed legislation will therefore be governed by the current law on the enforcement of arbitral awards.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

   <b>PORT OF SINGAPORE AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>6.50 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to update the Act last amended in 1975 to meet current needs and practices. I shall outline briefly the background to enable a clear understanding for the amendments to the Bill, explanations of which are already given in the Explanatory Statement to the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, published data showed that in 1984 the Port of Singapore was the busiest port in the world with the largest amount of shipping tonnage calling at the Port of Singapore. That year, 264 million GRT (gross registered tons) of ships called at Singapore compared with 256 million GRT at Rotterdam, the second busiest port. Each year, more than 30,000 ships above 75 GRT called at Singapore, giving an average of about 100 ships per day. Ships from over 500 lines, flying the flags of some 80 countries converge here, and in turn provide Singapore with links to over 300 ports around the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy is to ensure that our port remains an attractive port of call to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> shipping lines serving the Asia-Pacific countries and Japan on the one hand, and the Middle East, Europe and the United States on the other. We must also attract more new lines to call here. This we can do by maintaining the highest levels of service at the most competitive prices. Since 1984, the PSA has given several reductions in fees and concessions. These reductions have now amounted to approximately $110 million a year. Such large reductions are only possible as a result of increased productivity and efficiency. These are clearly demonstrated by our very short turnround time for ships calling at Singapore which is among the lowest in the region. Our port charges are also among the lowest in the region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, large numbers of ships call at Singapore. So freight rates have been kept low. This has benefited our local businessmen, manufacturers, importers, exporters and, of course, the population at large. The end result makes for a more buoyant economy. Our position at the top of the league has to be fought for strenuously through maintaining our international competitiveness. Ease of movement and safety in our port, rapid responsiveness to market demands and high productivity, these must be maintained and upgraded continuously to achieve the above objective. This Bill helps us to do just that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to amend the Act to include agents together with owners and masters of ships to be responsible for paying port, pilotage and other dues, providing correct information relating to the vessels and their cargo and obtaining the necessary port clearance. The amendments reflect the current practice in Singapore where the shipping agent arranges for berths, pilotage and port clearance for the vessel. This is also the practice in most major ports in the world, including London and Rotterdam.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides updating the Port of Singapore Authority Act, the Bill seeks to incorporate into the Act provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act which relates to port clearance and control of harbour craft and shipping in Singapore waters. PSA currently administers these provisions while the other provisions in the Merchant
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Shipping Act are administered by the Marine Department.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the tragic accident involving the collision of the Eniwetok with the Sentosa cableway three years ago, the PSA has introduced several measures to prevent a similar occurrence and to increase safety in our port. These include the requirement for vessels to give accurate information regarding their heights, and the declaration of the area in the vicinity of the cableway as a Height Restricted Area. Vessels entering or manoeuvring in the Height Restricted Area are required to comply with stringent safety regulations. Vessels with heights exceeding 52m are prohibited from this Area.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sentosa Cableway Accident, the penalties under sections 64(4), 66(1) and 107(1) of the Act have been enhanced to ensure scrupulous compliance with these safety measures. Most of the other penalties under the PSA Act have not been changed over the last 20 years. These penalties have now been enhanced to maintain their effectiveness in encouraging compliance with port safety measures. This will help ensure safe, efficient and orderly shipping in our port and help us maintain our reputation and international competitiveness, thus contributing to the overall development of our economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

   <b>PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1986, seeks to amend the Pensions Act for two
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reasons. The amendment is to provide for an option to be given to pensionable officers to either remain on the Pensions Scheme or switch over to the full CPF Scheme on such terms and conditions as may be prescribed. Secondly, it is to defer the pension-drawing age of officers who are granted early retirement or are retired in the public interest.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Option to Convert to the Full CPF Scheme</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain the option to be given to allow officers in certain Services to convert to the full CPF Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to December 1972, the Pensions Scheme was the common superannuation scheme for almost all civil servants. However, since then all new Division III and IV officers (except the Police and Narcotics Officers) have been appointed on the full CPF Scheme, and in mid-1973 serving Division III and IV officers (except the Police and Narcotics Officers) were allowed to opt for the full CPF Scheme. The Pensions Scheme has been retained for the Division I and II appointments and the Division III Police and Narcotics appointments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full CPF Scheme has been found to work well for the Division III and IV officers. It is neater than the Pensions Scheme as Government's financial liability to its officers is entirely discharged on their retirement. For the officers, being on the full CPF Scheme means more CPF savings could be utilized for approved purposes like home ownership. Moreover, since the CPF benefits are not contingent upon the officers remaining in the Civil Service until their retirement, it facilitates their movement from the Civil Service to the statutory boards or private sector.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has hence decided to also phase out the Pensions Scheme for most Division I and II officers. However, there are a few key Services where continuity of national policies is vital and wherein officers are encouraged to pursue a life-long career. These key Services are the Administrative, SAF (Senior), Police (Senior), Intelligence and the Administrative Service (Foreign Service Branch). These Services have to remain on the Pensions Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, with effect from 1st April 1986, all new Division I and II officers in the non-key Services and the Division III Police and Narcotics Officers are appointed on the full CPF scheme. Serving officers in these Services will remain on the pensions scheme. However, since some of these officers may wish to convert to the full CPF scheme, I am pleased to say that Government has agreed to allow all serving Division I and II pensionable officers (other than those in the key Services) and the pensionable Division III Police and Narcotics Officers an option to convert to the full CPF scheme or remain on the pensions scheme. The choice will be entirely theirs.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Timing</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government realizes that, in view of the recent cut in the rate of employer's CPF contribution, this may not be considered an opportune time to offer the option. However, since the decision to phase out the pensions scheme is basically sound, it should be implemented earlier rather than later. In retrospect, it seems fortunate that the option was not timed before the CPF cut, for otherwise civil servants who would have opted for the full CPF scheme might feel short-changed, though the effect was not foreseen.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Terms of Option</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to briefly describe the terms of the option. If a pensionable officer opts to convert to the full CPF scheme, he will be placed exclusively under the full CPF scheme from the date of conversion. But the pension benefits which he has accrued in respect of his past pensionable service will be frozen. The accrued pension benefits will be paid upon the officer's eventual retirement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an officer dies in harness on or after the date of conversion, his dependants will be paid a death gratuity for his past pensionable service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An officer who opts for the full CPF scheme will enjoy medical benefits after retirement only if he has at least 10 years' pensionable service. Similarly, an officer
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> who remains on the pensions scheme will also enjoy post-retirement medical benefits if he has at least 10 years' pensionable service. This is an established practice.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Deferment of Pension Drawing Age</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second purpose of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill is to defer the age for drawing pension in the case of an officer who retires early or in the public interest. I would like to explain this move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, an officer could be retired by the Public Service Commission in the public interest on disciplinary grounds with or without reduction in his pension benefits. Presently, these benefits are paid immediately upon his retirement. If the officer is young, he will be receiving pension for many years until his death and the total superannuation benefits he gets may be more than another officer who has records of good conduct and work until normal retirement age. This is, obviously, an anomaly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove the anomaly highlighted, Government proposes that an officer retired in the public interest should only start to draw pension at the same age as an officer granted early retirement under section 7(2)(j) of the Pensions Act. Presently, an officer with at least 15 years' service may request and be allowed early retirement under section 7(2)(j) of the Pensions Act. In such a case, he will receive his pension from the minimum age of 50 years or 45 years in the case of some Police and Prisons Officers. The minimum age for drawing pension for officers retired in the public interest or under section 7(2)(j) should now be changed to their optional retirement age. The optional retirement age is 55 years for officers with compulsory retirement age of 60. It is 50 for officers with compulsory retirement age of 55. This change is to ensure that an officer retired earlier than his normal retirement age either in the public interest or under section 7(2)(j) does not benefit much more than one who serves until his normal retirement age. This change in pension-drawing age will, however, apply only to officers appointed on or after the effective date of the proposed legislative amendment because Article 112 of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Constitution protects the pension rights of serving officers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Legislative Amendments</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect the proposals I have explained, it is necessary to amend the Pensions legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1986, will empower the President to make regulations for an option to be given to any pensionable officer or class of pensionable officers to convert to the full CPF scheme. The terms and conditions of the option will be spelt out in the regulations to be made by the President and will be on the lines I have indicated earlier.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill re-defines the minimum age so that new recruits will only receive their pensions at their optional retirement age when they are retired in the public interest or under section 7(2)(j) of the Pensions Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill clarifies that where the Public Service Commission has ordered an officer to be retired in the public interest, the officer's service shall be deemed to have been terminated under subsection 8(1) of the Pensions Act for the purpose of granting any pension or gratuity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 5 of the Bill provides for the payment of death gratuity to the dependants of an officer who converts to the full CPF scheme should he die in harness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise really by way of seeking clarification from the Minister on this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he has pointed out, the major change that is brought about by this Bill is that all officers appointed on or after the 1st April 1986 to the public service shall not be pensionable, except such schemes of service as may be designated by the President. And the Minister has said that this pension scheme would apply, or intended to apply, to key Services and key officers, and the intention is that they should be encouraged to make the public
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> service their life-long career. I hope I have understood the Minister correctly. By implication, the Minister is saying that the pension scheme must be more advantageous to the public service officer than if he were put onto the CPF scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to know from the Minister is: since we are now making a drastic change from pensionable public service to non-pensionable public service for the majority of our civil servants, has there been any consultation with the public service? When I say "consultation with the public service", I mean the associations representing the public service and the unions. Have their views been sought at all as to what they feel about the change and whether it will have any detrimental effect on the public service making this conversion?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> In answer to the question of the Member for Anson, the Public Service Division of my Ministry carried out a sample survey of 30,000 serving pensionable officers who might be eligible for the option. A stratified random sample of 5,000 officers for the survey was conducted in March 1986 in which the officers were asked to indicate if they would like to opt for the full CPF scheme, reasons for their decision as well as their views on whether offer of the option would be opportune at this time. Just over 3,000 officers responded to the survey and I would just like to recount the main findings briefly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31% of the respondents indicated that they would choose to convert to the full CPF scheme while 69% chose to remain on the pensions scheme. 44% felt the option was opportune; 56% felt otherwise. The majority of those who chose the full CPF scheme gave, as their main reason, flexibility in their career choice. The majority of those who chose the pensions scheme cited greater longer-term benefits under the pensions scheme. As expected, the younger an officer, the more likely he would opt for the full CPF scheme. In fact, 51% of those less than 35 years old chose the full CPF scheme, whilst only 26% of those who are between 35 and 45 years old chose to remain on the full CPF scheme. Although, on balance, it does appear that it might be that the majority
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> prefer to remain on the pensions scheme, I think the important point to remember is: this is an option. A serving officer has every right to remain on the existing pensions scheme. As to the issue of whether new officers should or should not be on the pensions scheme, I think this is a decision which Government is entitled to make on the terms and conditions of service for new officers entering the service.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Do I then understand from the Minister that there was no consultation whatsoever with the officers about bringing in a rule that from 1st April 1986 there would be no more pensionable service with the Government?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the issue of a specific consultation is considered unnecessary since the change, in fact, had been introduced some years ago for the Division III and IV officers. And as I indicated earlier, the conditions under which Government elects to determine terms of service for new officers is an option which the Government has the right to decide.

  </div>

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>7.15 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Acting Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Jurong Town Corporation Act to enable JTC to operate more flexibly in three main ways.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the existing Act limits JTC's functions to within Singapore. JTC has developed valuable expertise in the planning and development of industrial estates, the management of marine bases and industrial ports for bulk cargo, and the construction of specialized facilities, such as clean rooms. It has therefore much to offer local entrepreneurs and professionals in their efforts to seek and secure jobs overseas. The Bill seeks to remove this restriction on JTC and enable it to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present JTC Act does not contain any provision regarding the appointment and duties of its Chief Executive Officer. This is unlike the Acts incorporating the other Statutory Boards. This came about because when the Act was first enacted, the intention was to vest the administrative control of JTC in a full-time Chairman. With the appointment of a non-executive Chairman, the day-to-day administration and management of the affairs of the Corporation falls upon its general manager, who should now be the Chief Executive Officer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in the present Act, the power of JTC to grant loans to companies in which JTC holds shares is implicit. It is implied by the express authority the Act gives JTC to invest in shares of subsidiary companies. It is desirable to make this authority to grant loans explicit. This the Bill seeks to do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong.]

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament takes note of the Special Report of the Committee of Privileges contained in Paper Parl. 4 of 1986 and resolves that, in relation to the complaints made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House, Mr S. Dhanabalan, on 19th March, 1986 and on 30th July, 1986 against the Member for Anson, Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, (1) a Law Officer of the Legal Service do attend the Committee of Privileges and assist the Committee in the examination of witnesses; (2) Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam have leave to be heard by himself as counsel or by counsel if he thinks fit; and (3) the Committee have leave to hear counsel to such extent as they think fit on behalf of any other persons.
  <hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to the complaints made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Leader of the House on the 19th March and 30th July this year against the Member for Anson for breach of privilege, the Committee of Privileges met on Monday, the 18th August 1986, and came to certain resolutions which they have agreed to report to Parliament. These resolutions are set out in the Special Report of the Committee in Paper Parl 4 of 1986 and are as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(1) That the Committee desire the assistance of a Law Officer of the Legal Service in the examination of witnesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam have leave to be heard by himself as counsel or by counsel as he thinks fit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the Committee have leave to hear counsel to such extent as they think fit on behalf of any other persons.' Sir, the Report of the Committee was agreed to unanimously.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, again I am seeking clarification from the Minister for Law. I see that this motion purely relates to counsel, enabling counsel to appear before the Committee of Privileges. It is silent on the question of witnesses. I had during the proceedings in Parliament when the matters were referred to the Committee of Privileges sought an assurance that all the witnesses that I wanted called would be made available to me for cross-examination. I would like to know whether the Committee of Privileges has taken note of that and has made a resolution to make available all these witnesses for cross-examination by me. I pointed out five persons which I had mentioned before the Commissioner of the Inquiry and then I said there was Mr Glenn Knight and then there were, of course, also the two Magistrates or District
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Judges whose names I have mentioned. May I ask the Minister for Law if these witnesses and any others that I may ask will be made available to me for cross-examination?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I cannot speak on behalf of the Committee of Privileges of which I am just one Member. There is a Committee headed by the Speaker as Chairman. There are others, including the Member for Potong Pasir. I am just one Member. But it really depends on the evidence that the Member himself would like to give. If the witnesses are relevant to what is heard, they will be called. We are not afraid of calling witnesses. But if there is no evidence, then no witnesses will be called. But the Member will not be allowed to go on a fishing expedition. I am speaking for myself. I cannot bind the Committee.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware of the assurance given by the Leader after he moved his motion, and when I sought clarification. I thought he said that these witnesses would be made available. And now I see that the Minister for Law seeks to say that it may be qualified and the question is completely left open. I think it is important because I have sought an assurance in this House that all these witnesses will be available to me for cross-examination, and we must have an answer to that.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Once again, Sir, I am not the Committee of Privileges. I am just one Member. To be fair to the Member for Anson, we have got the Member for Potong Pasir in the Committee. These matters will be discussed in Committee and the Committee will decide after hearing evidence what witnesses are relevant, what witnesses should be called. But it is not for me to bind the hands of any Committee of Privileges of which I am only a Member. Let us come to the Committee stage where the Member can make his

  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Second Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Second Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament resolves that, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, at proceedings of the Committee of Privileges (other than the deliberations of the Committee) in relation to the complaints made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House, Mr S Dhanabalan, on 19th March, 1986 and on 30th July, 1986 against the Member for Anson, Mr J B Jeyaretnam, admission of strangers for the purpose of

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> television and other media coverage of the proceedings be allowed, subject to any directions of the Speaker or Chairman of the Committee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can be brief. There are two reasons for this motion. First, the matter to be dealt with by the Committee of Privileges is an important matter of public interest and it is a matter which has attracted considerable public attention. It is therefore right and proper for the proceedings to be covered by the media.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I am informed that the Committee of Privileges will not, because of the constraints of space, be able to permit members of the public to attend. Therefore, it is important that press coverage be permitted in respect of its proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament resolves that, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, at proceedings of the Committee of Privileges (other than the deliberations of the Committee) in relation to the complaints made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Leader of the House, Mr S Dhanabalan, on 19th March, 1986 and on 30th July, 1986 against the Member for Anson, Mr J B Jeyaretnam, admission of strangers for the purpose of television and other media coverage of the proceedings be allowed, subject to any directions of the Speaker or Chairman of the Committee.
