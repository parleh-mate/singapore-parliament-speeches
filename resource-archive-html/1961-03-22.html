<div align="center"><b>INDONESIAN RHIO WATERS CLOSED TO SINGAPORE COASTAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>VESSELS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Effect on Singapore Seamen and Singapore's economy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Thio Chan Bee</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  to  state whether, and  why  Indonesian

Rhio  waters  are now closed to Singapore  coastal

vessels,  to  what  extent this has  affected  the

employment  of  Singapore seamen  and  Singapore's

economy, and what the Government proposes to do to

assist the people adversely affected.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> As far as the Singapore

Government  is  aware, Indonesian waters  are  not

closed  to Singapore coastal vessels. We have  not

received any indication that there is any such ban

on non-Indonesian vessels.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Deputy   Prime   Minister  aware  that   the   new

conditions  imposed are such that they practically

make it difficult for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  seamen  to  be  employed  on  Singapore

vessels going to Indonesian waters?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What is the Member for Tanglin

talking  about? I have just said that  we  do  not

know  for  a fact that non-Indonesian vessels  are

being prohibited from entering Rhio waters.  I  do

not  understand  what conditions  the  Member  for

Tanglin is referring to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to be a different question

anyway.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Is the Deputy Prime Minister

aware  that  such a report appeared in  the  local

Press?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The trouble with the Members

of  the  Opposition is this; that they follow  the

footsteps  of the Member for Tanglin  and  believe

that  every  printed word is the gospel  truth.  I

would,  however, recommend him to  read  the  less

sensational parts of the newspapers.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, I have not yet got

an answer to my question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What the local Press publishes

is not my business. I have given an answer.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No Ministerial responsibility. Tun

Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is because of the report in

the  local  Press that there has been disquiet  in

the  minds  of  the people concerned.  Surely,  if

there  has been no such knowledge on the  part  of

the  Government that there is such a  restriction,

then  it would be advisable for the Government  to

set  at  rest  the minds of those people  who  are

misled by the Press?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The answer is very simple.

Supposing  the local Press reports  that  a  space

ship  from Mars has landed at Bukit Timah  Heights

in  Singapore. I suppose Members of the Opposition

will also ask questions in the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The landing in Singapore of a

space  ship  from Mars does not affect  the

rice-bowls of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



people  of Singapore, but the banning of ships  in

Indonesian waters does.- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think we are entering into

a debate. Inche Mohamed Ali.

<div align="center"><b>MOBILE CLINICS IN CITY AND RURAL AREAS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Health  what is the number of mobile  clinics

operating in the City Area and in the Rural Areas;

and whether the treatment given by such clinics is

free of charge.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to

reply. It is presumed that the question refers  to

travelling   dispensaries   and   not   travelling

clinics.  In  which case, the answer  is  that  no

mobile or travelling dispensaries are operating at

present in the City area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, four travelling dispensaries

operating  in  the rural areas, and the  treatment

given in these travelling dispensaries is free.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, is it

the  intention of the Government to  increase  the

number of travelling dispensaries?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Can the Member please repeat

the question?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, is it

the  intention of the Government to  increase  the

figure mentioned?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I

please  ask the Member whether he is referring  to

these  travelling dispensaries in the City or  the

rural areas?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Concerning the four

travelling  dispensaries operating  in  the  rural

areas, I wish to know whether the number mentioned

will be increased.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not

envisaged  that the number will be increased,  but

the  Government  will build more  clinics  in  the

rural areas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



to  serve the people. It is felt that a travelling

dispensary is only a very temporary provision  for

the medical services compared to a rural clinic.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, according

to the information supplied, the medical treatment

given  is  free. But to the best of my  knowledge,

some  time  ago  50  cents was  charged  for  each

treatment. When will such fees be waived?



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> As I mentioned previously,

there  were  two types of travelling dispensaries.

One  was  the city travelling dispensary  and  the

other  was  the  rural travelling dispensary.  The

city   travelling  dispensaries  were   previously

controlled  by  the  City  Council,  and  it   was

necessary   for  those  who  attended   the   city

travelling  dispensaries  to  pay  50  cents   for

treatment. Since 1959, however, because of  better

services being provided in the City, it was deemed

unnecessary  to carry on with the city  travelling

dispensaries.    Hence    all    the    travelling

dispensaries  were  shifted to  the  rural  areas.

Therefore, no payment was asked for.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT QUARTERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Thio Chan Bee</b> asked the Minister for

Finance to state the number of Government quarters

(a)  occupied by Government employees, (b)  rented

out  to  non-Government employees, and  (c)  still

vacant; whether the renting out of vacant quarters

to  non-Government employees has been stopped  and

the reasons for this decision.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number

of  Government  quarters  occupied  by  Government

employees  is  6,280.  The  number  of  Government

quarters rented out to non-Government employees is

47.  The  number of Government quarters  currently

vacant is also 47.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The renting out of quarters to non-Government

employees  other  than  the Polytechnic  employees

recruited  from  overseas has stopped  since  July

1960.  The  reason is that the remaining  quarters

are  being  reserved for officers and  experts  in

various  technical lines now being recruited  from

overseas.

<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Minister  for  Finance  to  state  the  number  of

serving  Malay officers who were promoted  to  the

Executive Service in February 1961.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No serving Malay officers were

appointed  to the grade of Executive  Officers  in

February  1961.  But two Malay Executive  Officers

were promoted as Higher Executive Officers in that

month.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Could the Minister confirm,

Sir,  that  in  February 1961,  33  officers  were

promoted to the Executive Service with effect from

1st January, 1961, and that none of these officers

were Malay officers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I confirm.

Minister  for  Finance  to  state  the  number  of

serving  Malay officers who have been promoted  to

Divisions I and II of the Public Service since May

1960.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since May

1960,  the  numbers of serving Malay officers  who

have been promoted are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Two officers from Division I Timescale to

Division I Superscale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Two officers from Division I Lower Grade to

Division I Higher Grade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the following numbers of Malay

serving officers have been approved for promotion.

As   soon  as  formalities  are  completed,  these

officers will be notified of their promotions:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) One officer from Division II to Division I.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) One officer from Division II Lower Grade to

<div align="center"><b>MALAY GOVERNMENT OFFICERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number recruited to General Clerical Service)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Minister for Finance to state the number of Malays

recruited  to  the General Clerical Service  since

November 1960.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, this question

refers  to the number of Malays recruited  to  the

General Clerical Service since November 1960.  The

answer  is that no recruitment of any officer  has

been  made  in the General Clerical Service  since

November     1960.     Advertisements     inviting

applications for the General Clerical Service were

published on 29th December, 1960. Selection is now

in  the hands of the Public Service Commission who

will   make   the   necessary   arrangements   for

interviews and so forth.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Would the Minister indicate if

some  of  the new applicants would come  from  the

Malay community?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not

seen  the forms of application, so I can  give  no

indication.  But  I would say it is  quite  likely

that they would include a number of young men  and

women of the Malay race.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL LANGUAGE WEEK OR MONTH</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Culture  whether  he  will  hold  a  National

Language Week or Month.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a

number  of  schemes to popularise  and  teach  the

National  Language, and the holding of a  Language

Week  is one of them. The Head of the Dewan Bahasa

dan  Kebudayaan Kebangsaan is working on a  scheme

to make people more conscious of the need to learn

the National Language. In the middle of this year,

we will be introducing Suara Singapura, which will

be held to stimulate interest in the understanding

of   the  National  Language.  However,  I  cannot

indicate at the moment what form the Language Week

will take, because we must take into consideration

the special conditions in Singapore. Singapore  is

largely  a non-Malay speaking territory and  so  a

campaign  of  this  kind,  while  stimulating  the

people  to  use the national language, should  not

cause  undue  inconvenience to administration  and

business.  Furthermore,  the  campaign   must   be

planned  in  such  a way as to make  it  easy  and

practical for non-Malay speaking citizens as  well

to  participate in it effectively.  In  fact,  the

effectiveness  and usefulness of such  a  campaign

would be lost if it is of so ambitious and complex

a  nature  that the majority of the people  cannot

participate in it, not because they do not want to

but   because  it  demands  things  beyond   their

capacity.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

could the Minister concerned state definitely when

a  National  Language Week or Month will  be  held

this year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said

earlier that I cannot indicate at the moment  when

and  in what form the National Language Week would

take, but we are working on it and as soon as  the

necessary arrangements are made, we will publicise

the fact.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Could the Minister

not even give a slight indication as to whether it

is  possible  to hold the National  Language  Week

some time this year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when this

Government makes a promise, it keeps its  promise.

Therefore, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



would  not like to give any specific date, but  we

shall  certainly try to do something  along  these

lines during the course of this year.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT SCHOOL IN MALAY FARM AREA OF ALSAGOFF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for Education whether he has any plan for building

a  Government  school in the Malay  Farm  area  of

Alsagoff Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Malay Farm area is very

congested and it had not been possible in the past

to  get  unencumbered  land  suitable  for  school

development here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is, however, building a

24-classroom primary school at Jalan Kaki Bukit. This

new  school is expected to be completed in  August

this  year, and it will serve the children in  the

Malay  Farm  area as well. We hope to purchase  in

the very near future another site for the erection

of  two  Government schools which  will  not  only

cater for the children in the Malay Farm area  but

also for those in the Geylang Serai area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site has recently been acquired in Jalan

Kembangan for a 24-classroom primary school  which

is  expected to be ready by early 1962. It  should

be explained that each 24-classroom primary school

will  be  able  to  accommodate  more  than  2,000

students in both sessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this Bill and the  following  Bill

which  I will be moving for Second Reading concern

certain   esoteric   points   in   the   law    of

conveyancing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Land Titles Ordinance, I would

like  to remind the House that it was first passed

in  1956  and  it  was not brought into  operation

until 1st December, 1960. As from that date, under

section 8 of the Ordinance, all land alienated  by

the Crown will be brought under the provisions  of

the  Ordinance and certificates of title  will  be

issued  in  lieu  of  Crown instruments.  However,

since 1956, there have been a number of surrenders

by  land developers under section 11 of the  Crown

Lands  Ordinance  for the purpose of  sub-dividing

their   land   into  smaller  lots  for   building

purposes.  Some  1,200 lots in  the  case  of  the

Sembawang Hill Estate and another 1,000  odd  lots

in  the  case of the Serangoon Garden Estate  have

already  been  sub-divided. In both  these  cases,

Crown  grants  have not yet been issued  for  each

subdivided lot as time is taken for the survey  of

the   land  to  be  completed.  However,  in   the

meantime, buildings which have been erected on the

lots  have  been sold and most of these properties

are  under mortgage. Under section 8 of  the  Land

Titles  Ordinance, there is no provision  for  the

registration  of  mortgages or other  encumbrances

created before the issue of the Crown grants.  The

purpose  of  the  present Bill is to  provide  the

machinery   whereby  these  mortgages   or   other

encumbrances  can be protected by notification  on

the   land  register  kept  in  the  Land   Titles

Registry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 8A. (b) [clause 2] of the Bill

puts the responsibility of informing the Registrar

of   the  existence  of  any  mortgage  or   other

encumbrance   on   the  person   interested,   and

paragraph  (c)  enables  the  purchaser   of   the

mortgaged  property to be registered as proprietor

without  an order of the Court. This provision  is

similar to section 13 (6) of the Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Sir, I beg

to  move,  "That  the Bill be now  read  a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8 of the Land Titles Ordinance States

that  after the commencement of the Ordinance  any

person  who  has  become  entitled  to  land  upon

alienation  by  the Crown for  an  estate  in  fee

simple  or for an estate in perpetuity  or  for  a

leasehold  term  of not less than  21  years,  can

require  the Collector of Land Revenue to  furnish

to  the Registrar of Titles a certificate to  that

effect.  The Registrar shall thereupon  bring  the

land  under  the  provisions of the  Ordinance  as

therein directed, and shall deliver the triplicate

certificate  of  title  to  the  person   entitled

thereto.  This complicated provision really  means

that the Collector of Land Revenue is under a duty

to  give  a certificate to the Registrar  of  Land

Titles who then registers it. But in the case of a

statutory land grant issued under section 4 (1) of

the  Crown Lands Ordinance, the Collector of  Land

Revenue will be faced with this difficulty.  Under

section 2 of the Ordinance, a statutory land grant

is  defined  as  a  grant in  perpetuity,  but  in

Schedule A, the Form provides for an estate in fee

simple by virtue of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



words of limitation on "his heirs and assigns  for

ever".  This  means, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that  the

Collector will either have to follow the words  of

the  Form,  in which case it will be  contrary  to

section  2; or if he goes according to section  2,

he  will not be going in accordance with the  Form

and Schedule A. This anomaly has existed since the

original Crown Lands Ordinance was passed in 1886.

I do not wish now, Mr Speaker, Sir, to labour the

House  with  the  intricacies  of  the  difference

between  a  grant and a fee simple and "his  heirs

and  assigns for ever". But I can assure the House

that  there  is a conveyancing difference  in  the

terminology  used.  For  the  peace  of  mind   of

conveyancers and the Registrar of Land Titles,  it

is now proposed to remove this anomaly so that the

Collector   of  Land  Revenue  can  certify   with

certainty  that the person to whom Crown  land  is

being   alienated  is  entitled  to  a  grant   in

perpetuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committeed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His

Excellency    the    Yang   di-Pertuan    Negara's

recommendation to proceed with this motion*.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, in appreciation of their work to preserve peace,

and prevent civil war and foreign intervention in the Congo, resolves

that a sum of $10,000 be donated to the cheer of troops of the Federation

of Malaya serving under United Nations command in the Congo.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last Assembly sitting, when my colleagues

the Minister for Culture was moving his motion for

a  sum of $10,000 for the Aid to Algeria Fund, the

Member for Cairnhill remarked in the course of the

debate that, whilst we were ready



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



to  make  a  gesture to the people of Algeria,  we

appeared  unwilling  to make any  gesture  to  the

troops of the Federation of Malaya serving in  the

Congo. I had on that occasion, Sir, stated that we

would be happy to contribute to the Cheer Fund for

the  Federation  troops in  the  Congo,  and  this

motion  of  $10,000  is  to  ask  the  House   for

authority to make that contribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we last met, the situation in the Congo has

been  contained  by the determined  stand  of  the

uncommitted  nations not to  allow  the  Congo  to

become  a  cold war arena. Members will  now  know

that  since then the Indian Government has decided

to  send  several thousand combat troops to  serve

under  the  United Nations Command in  the  Congo.

This step has put a brake on the trend to withdraw

troops  under the United Nations Command from  the

Congo.  Had the trend continued, a grave situation

of  civil  war  plus foreign intervention  on  all

sides  of the civil war could well have led  to  a

dangerous world situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this token of $10,000 is our

appreciation for the efforts made by  all  in  the

cause of peace in Africa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to welcome the motion before the House,  and

the  welcome is the greater because  it  is  as  a

result of what the Opposition had suggested during

the debate on the motion on Algeria at the sitting

on  22nd  February, and not at the  last  but  one

sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has said that in the

course  of the debate on the motion on Algeria,  I

remarked  that  the  Government  appeared  to   be

unwilling  to contribute towards this Congo  Cheer

Fund. I did not say so. I just suggested that  the

Government   perhaps  could  favourably   consider

donating  a  contribution towards the Congo  Cheer

Fund.  The  Prime Minister in his reply that  day,

Sir,  while welcoming the suggestion, did  try  to

suggest something which I did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



suggest. He suggested that I suggested that  money

should  be  contributed to the Berita Harian  Congo

Cheer  Fund.  Surely, Sir, as the  Prime  Minister

should  know,  when a government  contributes  any

money  towards anything, it is for that government

to  write  to  the  government  of  the  recipient

country   and  send  the  donation  through   that

channel, it  does  not have to employ  any  other

channel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are very happy that the Government, in

this   instance,  has  acted  so  promptly  on   a

suggestion from the Opposition, and we  thank  the

Government for that.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I have nothing to add to the

rather  intricate explanation that the  Member  of

the Opposition has given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, in appreciation of their work to

preserve peace, and prevent civil war and  foreign

intervention in the Congo, resolves that a sum  of

$10,000 be donated to the cheer of troops  of  the

Federation of Malaya serving under United  Nations

command in the Congo.

<div align="center"><b>DIPHTHERIA IMMUNISATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Sheng Nam Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will a Minister signify the

recommendation of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> I so signify.



<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diphtheria is a serious health problem in

Singapore and some 600 cases of the disease  occur

annually  with  over  50 to 60  deaths.  Both  the

occurence   of   the  disease   and   deaths   are

preventable by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



immunisation, and this Bill is designed to improve

preventive   measures   by   making   immunisation

compulsory for infants and children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1938 in the City area and after the Second

World  War  in  the rural area, it  has  been  the

policy  to encourage parents to accept inoculation

against   diphtheria   on   a   voluntary   basis.

Unfortunately,  the  response  has  not  been   as

encouraging as expected. Only approximately 50 per

cent   of   the   new-born  every  year   obtained

immunisation  by  the voluntary  method.  For  the

effective  eradication or reduction of diphtheria,

it  is  necessary that 90 per cent of the children

should be immunised. Thus, it is considered to  be

appropriate  at  his  stage to require  compulsory

immunisation  of  all  infants  and  children   by

primary  and  booster  diphtheria  inoculation  as

defined in clause 2 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory immunisation by legislation is neither

new  nor unorthodox. Children are required  to  be

immunised against diphtheria in such countries  as

Japan,  Canada, Germany, France, the U.S.S.R. and

Yugoslavia,  and  it has been  the  experience  of

these  countries that such compulsory immunisation

sharply decreases the incidence of the disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the main immunisation will be effected by

requiring  every  child to  be  administered  with

primary diphtheria inoculation within 12 months of

birth.  Alternatively,  every  child  resident  in

Singapore, who is under the age of seven years and

who  has  not  been immunised against  diphtheria,

will  be required to do so under clause 5  of  the

Bill.  Booster diphtheria inoculation, which means

a  further  inoculation against diphtheria  for  a

person  who  has received a previous  inoculation,

will  be  made compulsory for every child residing

in  Singapore on attaining the age of four  years.

Provision  is also made for a child  to  obtain  a

second  booster inoculation upon entry to  Primary

School. Clause 6 refers to booster inoculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill are to ensure that

inoculation  and intra-dermal test  (to  test  the

susceptibility  of  a  person against  diphtheria)

shall  be  carried out by qualified persons.  Also

notification of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



such  inoculation and tests must be  made  to  the

health authority in a prescribed manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 will enable the postponement of

diphtheria  inoculation if the child is  unfit  or

has acquired immunity or has been shown not liable

to diphtheria by means of the intra-dermal test.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 makes it clear that a guardian, which is

defined as the person having custody of the child,

must present the child for inoculation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diphtheria immunisation will be given free of

charge at all Government Maternal and Child Health

Centres, but provision is made in clause 9 of  the

Bill for intra-dermal tests and inoculations to be

administered  by private medical practitioners  at

the expense of parents or guardians who choose  to

obtain inoculation through private doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure success, some means is required to

inform parents of new-born children that they must

obtain  immunisation under the Bill. Hence, clause

11  provides  that  the Registrar  of  Births  and

Deaths  shall issue, after registering a birth,  a

notice to the guardian directing his attention  to

his responsibilities. I may say that the Registrar

goes  through  the same procedure  in  respect  of

compulsory small-pox vaccination under section  48

of   the  Quarantine  and  Prevention  of  Disease

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 provides for penalties for persons who

refuse or fail without reasonable excuse to submit

to  the  provisions of the Bill.  There  are  also

penalties  for  obtaining false certificates.  You

will  note,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that no prosecution

in  respect  of  any offence shall  be  instituted

without  the  written sanction of the Director  of

Medical Services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to modern medical practice, it is

desirable to cease inoculation in the event of  an

outbreak  of  other  infectious  disease  such  as

poliomyelitis. That is why clause 13 provides  for

the suspension of any or all the provisions of the

Bill as a public health measure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise clause 14 provides the Minister with

power  to  declare any area as an area of outbreak

of diphtheria, and thereupon to require compulsory

inoculation of all children under 12 years of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



age   residing  therein.  In  such  an  emergency,

immunisation shall be free of charge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 provides for the making of regulations

generally for carrying out the provisions  of  the

Bill, and includes any fees or charges that it may

be  necessary to levy for the purpose of  carrying

out  the  provisions  of  the  Bill.  Among  other

things, the Minister is also enabled, under clause

15, to regulate the preparation or preparations to

be  used, the number of occasions they are  to  be

administered,  the mode of administration  and  so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for the Minister to prescribe a

maximum  fee  to  be charged by practitioners  who

administer  any intra-dermal test or  inoculation.

This   is  to  ensure  that  there  shall   be   a

standardisation of fee and that, in any emergency,

no  variation of fees shall be allowed. Of course,

such prescription of fees would not be made unless

a situation to warrant it should arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would say that this Bill

represents an important step in the fight  against

diphtheria, towards eradication of this disease in

Singapore   by  the  compulsory  immunisation   of

infants and children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Sheng Nam Chin].

<div align="center"><b>WOMEN'S CHARTER BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I have His Excellency

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation  for

this  Bill; and I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the principles set out in the Bill follow

those  of  the  Women's  Charter  Bill  which  was

introduced  in the last Session of the Legislative

Assembly.  That Bill was referred to a Select  Com

mittee,  but  before  the  Report  of  the  Select

Committee   could  be  adopted,  the   Legislative

Assembly  was  prorogued and the Bill,  therefore,

lapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to reconsider the

details   of   the   Bill   in   the   light    of

representations  made before the Select  Committee

on  the former Women's Charter Bill. The result is

that  a  number of detailed amendments  have  been

made  to  the Bill. As I propose to move that  the

Bill  be referred to a Select Committee, I do  not

want, at this stage, to do more than summarise the

main changes that have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to make provision for the

appointment  of Assistant Registrars who  will  be

public officers and who will assist the Registrar,

and who will be able to exercise all the powers of

the  Registrar. The definition of "Registrar"  has

been  amended to include Assistant Registrar,  and

clause 25 of the Bill provides for the appointment

of Assistant Registrars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of prohibited degrees of marriage is now

set  out  in the First Schedule to the Bill.  This

follows  the provisions in the Federation's  Civil

Marriage  Ordinance,  and  makes  it  clear  which

parties are prohibited from marriage. In order  to

enable  marriages  in extremis to  be  solemnized,

power  is  given to the Minister to  delegate  the

power  to  issue licences to marry. It is proposed

that  this  power  be delegated to  the  heads  of

religious  denominations to enable  them  to  give

power to solemnize marriages in extremis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is also made for a religious ceremony

to  be  performed in addition to a civil marriage.

The  provision to enable the Minister to  delegate

the power to issue licences is contained in clause

20,  sub-clause (4), and provision  for  religious

ceremonies in marriage is made in clause 23.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision relating to the rights and duties

of  husband and wife have been modified,  and  the

reference to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



equal  rights and the ownership and management  of

the family properties in clause 45 of the Bill has

been  omitted, as it was suggested that this might

be  inconsistent with the provisions  relating  to

the property rights of married women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original proposal to register all marriages

not  previously registered has been abandoned.  It

is  now  proposed  to  provide  that  the  Women's

Charter shall not affect the validity of marriages

solemnized before the 2nd day of March, 1961.  The

Bill also provides that those marriages which  are

valid  under  the law, religion, custom  or  usage

under  which they were solemnized shall be  deemed

to  be valid under the provisions of the Ordinance

for  the purposes of Part IX of the Ordinance,  so

that  the provisions relating to divorce shall  be

applicable to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  we  are  workers  preparing  to   reform

society.  I,  representing thousands of  women  in

Singapore, wish to express my support of the  Bill

and   to  thank  the  Government,  especially   my

colleague,  the Minister for Labour and  Law,  who

has re-introduced the Women's Charter today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter fully indicates that the

P.A.P.  Government  is firm  in  trying  to  solve

women's  problems. We are a socialist  Government.

For  the  past  22 months of government,  we  have

tried  our  best  to  reform the  backwardness  of

women.  Today, in this Assembly here, we  want  to

express  the attitude of the Party towards  women,

and also to express the views and the attitude  of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1959 general election, the P.A.P.

Government  said women's problems are problems  to

be  resolved after the general election.  We  have

clearly  expressed  out attitude  towards  women's

problems in our Party's Manual. We realise that we

have  to  wait  until a true and just  society  is

established   before   we  can   resolve   women's

problems.  In  a non-socialist government,  it  is

very difficult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



to  find any equality. The difference between  men

and  women  presents  a problem.  In  a  socialist

society, women will not be exploited. This is  the

kind  of  society  that  we  the  P.A.P. want  to

establish. In a just and equal society, the P.A.P.

is  determined to try its best to organise all the

people  to fight for a common aim. It is indeed  a

very  difficult  and long-term task  to  establish

this   happy  society.  For  example,  at  present

women's  problems are difficult to  solve  because

women  have  been  oppressed  in  the  past.  Take

Singapore  for  instance. At present  there  exist

feudalistic  ideas and systems. Many colonialistic

ideas still exist. Therefore, women's problems are

still  very difficult to solve because  women  are

faced   with   these  hardships.   Nowadays,   the

opportunities for the education of women are  very

rare  and greatly curtailed. This is because  many

people  still  regard women as only  suitable  for

work  in  the  home  and not outside  in  society.

Therefore, women's opportunities to participate in

society  are  very little. Their lot  in  life  is

simply  to work very hard in exchange for  a  bare

meal.  Under these circumstances, they  have  been

oppressed and exploited by the capitalists.  Women

live  in  ignorance,  and do  not  see  their  own

future.   Many   women  waste   their   money   in

superstitious  beliefs  and  gambling.  They   are

oppressed  without  realising  it.  In  the  rural

areas,  women's  conditions are even  worse.  Many

women   villagers   do   not   know   what   their

relationship with society is. After more than  one

hundred years of colonialistic control, they still

do  not know their difficulties. Education to  the

village  women  means nothing to them.  They  base

their  hopes on gambling like chap-ji-ki and other

games and superstitious beliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see the women in the city area. Except the

labourers,  women  in other walks  of  life  still

suffer  oppression.  Their opportunities  are  not

equal.  For  example, career women are treated  as

flowers  in a vase. They are not treated  equally.

Many    employers   treat   women   as   beautiful

decorations.  Because  of society's  inequalities,

women  regard themselves as decorations  and  only

suitable for work in the home.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many men marry more than one wife. Therefore,

women do not enjoy full equality in the home. They

do  not  enjoy political equality. When  they  are

helpless, they are abandoned by their husbands and

deprived of their basic rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the above-mentioned facts, women's

problems  will  have to be solved. However,  there

still  exist  some  different  conditions  in  our

society.  It is very important to solve all  these

problems. We have here many races- Chinese, Malay,

Indian  and  so  on.  Since  every  race  has  its

peculiarities, traditions and customs, there exist

different  forms  of women's problems.  We  cannot

solve all these problems with one method. We  have

to  solve  them  with a common method.  Take,  for

example,  religious problems. We  should  be  very

careful   in   solving  them.   We,   the   P.A.P.

Government, fully respect the religions and rights

to  all  races.  So we must be very careful,  when

trying  to solve the religious problems of  women,

not to go against their religious beliefs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has re-introduced the Women's

Charter.  What  are its effects upon  the  women's

movement?   Firstly,  the  Women's  Charter   will

prevent husbands from abandoning their wives.  The

Bill  will not allow a man to marry more than  one

wife.  If a husband abandons his wife as he likes,

then  he  will  be punished, because abandoning  a

wife  will  have adverse effects on the family  as

well  as  on  society as a whole. We must  make  a

united  effort to build a good family and  a  good

society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will arouse the emotions of all the

women in Singapore who are suffering and make them

realise the fact. We must fight for equality among

men and women. This Bill will also enhance women's

position  in  society. It will  give  the  women's

movement  a very flat and level road on  which  to

travel. It will strengthen the confidence of women

in building a good society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also rectifies the many mistakes made

in  the  past. Although this Bill will not provide

for  equal  pay  among  men and  women,  it  will,

however, make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



them  fully  realise their political, educational,

cultural,  and economic equality in society.  This

must  be made possible if a good society is to  be

established. Until all this is realised, we cannot

find another society in which all these conditions

can  be  fulfilled. This Bill acts as a lighthouse

on  the  road to building a good society. It  will

make us work harder to attain a better society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must clearly point out here that when the Bill

becomes law, many of the women's problems will  be

finally  resolved.  This shows  that  the  women's

movement  has  a  very good beginning.  Therefore,

thousands   of  women  must,  under   these   good

conditions, arouse other women, who are suffering,

to work together and partake in the building of  a

society  which will be for the welfare of all  the

people, and to unite with all the other people  in

building  a  happy Malaya, it is  only  with  this

object in view that we could build a good society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the P.A.P. have suffered hardship and have

tried  our best to fulfil our Five-Year  Plan.  We

introduce this Bill in order to uphold the  rights

of  women,  so  that all their  problems  will  be

easily  resolved. At the same time, we have  tried

our  best to discover the inequalities of men  and

women in the civil service. We pay great attention

to  women's  problems.  These  problems  were  not

looked after by the previous governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us, all the sisters in Singapore,

try  our  best and make use of our lives  to  work

hard  for the emancipation of women so as to build

a just and equal socialistic society.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am glad the Minister for Labour  and  Law

seems to take an interest in the welfare of women.

I  must congratulate him. What a really wise  step

he  has  taken,  by incorporating in  the  Women's

Charter   the  advice  of  the  Members   of   the

Opposition. You will remember, Sir, that when  the

Women's  Charter came up for debate  in  the  last

Session  here, the Minister called me names,  such

as "a chameleon", when I pointed out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



the   inadvisability  of  having  the   compulsory

registration  clause.  I  was  ridiculed  when   I

pointed  out that this clause would cause hardship

to  the  poor.  I  am, therefore, extremely  happy

today, Sir, to see that the Minister now seems  to

have changed his views and has begun to see eye to

eye  with  the  Opposition. Instead of  compulsory

registration, we now see in the new  Charter,  for

want  of a better phrase, "automatic registration"

for  all marriages which took place before the 2nd

of  March,  1961.  In view of the  fact  that  the

Government in the past has been very much inclined

to  adopt the attitude that Sir Ivor Jennings  and

Lord Hailsham have always warned us against, i.e.,

the  attitude  that the Opposition  can  never  be

right  and  the Government can never be  wrong,  I

feel that the Minister for Labour and Law deserves

special  commendation for having  the  courage  to

incorporate  the advice of the Opposition  in  the

Women's   Charter,  when  he   thinks   that   the

Opposition is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also happy, Sir, to note that the Prime

Minister  himself has acted on the  suggestion  of

the  Member  for  Cairnhill  regarding  the  Congo

donation.  We hope, Sir, that this is a sign  that

Government  is  at last beginning to  realise  the

importance of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would however, Sir, like to make a few

observations regarding the other sections  of  the

Women's Charter and to draw the attention  of  the

Minister for Labour and Law, who I sincerely  hope

is  genuinely interested in the welfare  of  women

and  children,  that the mere  passing  of  a  law

protecting  the  rights of women  is  not  at  all

sufficient. While it is true, Sir, that  statutory

law  is essential, it is the implementation of the

law  that matters. In this connection, Sir, I hope

you  will  permit me to quote Miss Dorothy  Moses,

Regional  Social Services Officer  of  the  United

Nations  Economic Commission for Asia and the  Far

East,  when  she  said  this  two  months  ago  in

Australia. She said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In many countries, such rights exist only on

paper  and  remain  more  in  the  form  of   good

intentions, since there is often a very large  gap

between legal provisions for such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



opportunities  and actual practice. In  actuality,

women  in many countries, especially in the

South-east  Asia region, are still ignorant and backward

and,  therefore, remain deprived of  their  proper

rights.   They   are  also   an   easy   prey   to

exploitation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what exploitation she means, Sir;

probably-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An Hon. Member:</b> Husband!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> -it even includes

political exploitation-



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> To do the washing!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> She went on to say, Sir,

that  this situation, if left unremedied, forms  a

vicious  circle. [Laughter] I am sorry to  see  so

much  fun made of this statement of an expert from

the United Nations, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`where the circumstances that force women to live

under   these  down-trodden  conditions   continue

unchanged,  since women are unable to change  them

unless they are helped to do so.'



<br><br>So  if  the Government of Singapore were requested

to  produce a report or paper on the legal  status

of   women,   political   franchise   for   women,

eligibility  of  women  for public  office,  their

access  into  administrative careers, their  civil

liberties, their economic rights, their  right  to

retain  their  nationality  after  marriage - I  can

envisage  the  glowing report that  the  Singapore

Government is able to produce. While statutory law

in  Singapore - contrary to what the Lady Member  on

the  Government Bench has said - gives  women  their

full rights, there is not a single clause on paper

that  prevents women from exercising these rights;

but  (and  a very big but at that, Sir) are  these

rights  being  exercised?  Are  women  given   the

opportunity to exercise these rights? I  say  they

are  not. Far from helping women to exercise these

rights,  there is actually discrimination  by  the

Government   against  women.  For  example,   Sir,

policewomen   who  have  served   faithfully   and

efficiently  for  12 years are  still  serving  as

Inspectors  only  while their  men  contemporaries

have  reached at least the rank of A.S.P.  When  I

drew the attention of the Government at a previous

sitting  to  women not getting equal treatment  in

Government service, what was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



the  reply from the Minister for Finance? He  said

he believed that while all men are all equal, some

men  are  more equal than others. Sir, I ask  you,

what  is  the use of passing grand statutory  laws

that  give  women their rights when, in  practice,

every   effort  is  made  to  prevent  them   from

exercising them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the hon. Lady on the Government Bench

did  agree  that  women can be  exploited  without

their  realising it. I hope the Government is  not

taking  advantage of this. May I again quote  Miss

Dorothy Moses? She said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Women have a resignation to their lot and also

feelings  of dependency and insecurity which  they

have  developed  over a period of  suppression  of

their true selves. It thus becomes evident that if

changes are considered desirable, women are to  be

helped to overcome their resistance to them.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been universally accepted, Sir, that the

economic  independence of the woman of  today  has

been to a very great extent responsible for giving

her  a  self-sufficient sense of security to  come

forward  and  shoulder her share of responsibility

as  a  good citizen of the State. If this is true,

Sir,  then  the deprivation of equal  remuneration

for  equal work is certainly not only an  obstacle

which prevents the woman from utilising the rights

granted  to her by the statutory law of the  State

but  also deprives her of the opportunity to  play

her  true  role as an associate to her husband  in

the keeping of her home as required by the Women's

Charter,  and  also in the building of  a  Malayan

nation as promised in "The Tasks Ahead". One would

expect  to  find in a Women's Charter  machineries

which  will help the woman to exercise her  rights

fully  as  a  human  being and  to  give  her  the

opportunity to play her true role as a good  wife,

a mother and a citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support wholeheartedly the idea of one

man  one wife. But I am afraid, Sir, that I do not

see  how  this Charter gives political  rights  to

women when they already exist, otherwise the  hon.

Lady  on the Government Bench and I would  not  be

standing  up here talking. She also says that  the

Charter  educates women. I am afraid I cannot  see

how this Charter educates women.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



And  she says the Charter makes women work harder.

I thought this is not the reason why Government is

putting  in  this Charter - only to make women  work

harder - instead of giving them a rest!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I must say this Charter falls

very short of what one might expect from a Women's

Charter,  and I do hope the Select Committee  will

see its way to making it worthy of its name.



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing

two  charming  ladies  on opposite  sides  arguing

against  each other, it is only a foolish man  who

dares to step in between!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a Charter meant for women, and it is

significant  the Minister did not  say  much  when

moving the Second Reading of the Bill. It was left

to  the Lady Member for Delta who stood up and her

very  first  words were, "We thank the  Government

for  doing this." And she ended up by saying, "We,

the P.A.P. Government, are doing this." Therefore,

may  I suggest that she need not thank herself for

what  she thinks she is doing, because self-thanks

are no thanks at all? Self-praise is no praise  at

all.  I  felt  that I had to step in  because  she

said, "The previous Government did nothing for the

women."  I  think it was because of  the  previous

Government that there are so many women sitting in

this  Assembly.  She  said  that  there  were   no

political rights for women. Does she not know that

these  political rights have been given  to  women

even  before the P.A.P. came into existence?  Even

before the P.A.P. came into existence, there  were

these  rights going as far back as 1948  when  the

first  elections  were held.  She  said  that  not

enough education rights were given to women. May I

point  out that there are so many women, including

the  ladies  on the opposite side, who  have  been

educated  under  administrations  that  were   not

P.A.P.'s?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, she was trying to point out that women have

been  suffering  a  lot of things  under  previous

administrations, and that therefore it  is  up  to

the P.A.P. Government to do what it can to protect

the rights of women. We agreed last



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



year that it is right that one man should have one

wife. That is all the Charter seeks to do - one  man

one  wife. The Charter goes further, no doubt.  It

protects the property rights of women. Other  than

that,  there  is  nothing  in  the  Charter   that

readjusts the inequalities and injustices that the

Lady Member for Delta would have us believe are in

existence.   Although  the  property  rights   are

supposed  to  be protected under this Charter,  it

does  not give full protection at all. Although  a

wife under this Women's Charter can claim that she

has  a legal right to the property of her husband,

yet  there  is nothing in this Charter to  prevent

the  man  to will his property before he  dies  to

another  woman who is not his wife. Where then  is

the protection to the legal wife of the man? Where

then is this protection which the hon. Lady Member

for Delta says the P.A.P. is giving to the married

women of Singapore? The Government says, "One  man

should  have  one  wife." We know,  Sir,  in  this

present  world which man dares to have  more  than

one wife, but there is nothing in this Charter  to

say  that a man cannot have mistresses. The Deputy

Prime Minister has pointed that out. What is there

in  this  Charter to prevent a man from  having  a

legal   wife  and  having  three  charming  ladies

outside   as   mistresses?  Where  then   is   the

protection?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> When did I say that?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister asks

when  he  said it. May I refer him to  Hansard?  I

have  it  here, but I would not want to waste  the

time  of this Assembly by quoting what he has said

and what he has now forgotten what he has said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support the Bill. But there is one more

thing  in  this Charter - the divorce  laws.  A  man

married  under some ancient custom does  not  have

the  right to seek divorce in a court of law other

than  a  separation by agreement.  But  with  this

Women's charter, it will be made easier for a  man

or  a  woman to be divorced. I do not know whether

it  is  a  good or a bad thing. But the hon.  Lady

Member  for  Delta says it is a  good  thing,  and

perhaps it is a good thing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to refer to clause 32 of

the Bill which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing in this Ordinance or rules made

thereunder shall be construed to render  valid  or

invalid merely by reason of its having been or not

having   been   registered  any   marriage   which

otherwise is invalid or valid.'



<br><br>A  question was asked during the debate last year,

and  it  was  pointed  out that  that  clause  was

necessary  because of the compulsory  registration

of  marriages which took place before  2nd  March,

1960.   Now,   there  is  to  be   no   compulsory

registration. Under the new clause 166, it is only

valid  marriages  which  shall  be  deemed  to  be

registered  under  this law.  Where  then  is  the

necessity  for  clause  32?  It  makes   it   more

confusing.  It  says  that  although  you  may  be

properly married and properly registered, yet that

registration  can be valid. It had substance  last

year  when  there was the intention of  compulsory

registration.  Now that there is no  intention  of

compulsory registration, I hope the Minister  will

consider this in the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of all that a man may want to say,

there  is  one thing I would like to  say  to  the

ladies  in this House and elsewhere; and that  is,

that  it  is  the hand that rocks the cradle  that

rules the world, and not the man.



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I did not intend to make  a  speech

because  I  did  not  know the Opposition  Members

would make any criticism. But I want to stress the

point  that  I  must  take part  in  this  debate,

instead  of just listening to speeches, since  the

Member   for   Cairnhill  and  the   Member   for

Mountbatten  have said certain things with  regard

to  the Women's Charter and they have caused  some

laughter.  I  do not understand why,  on  the  one

hand,  the Opposition Members support the  Women's

Charter  and,  on  the other hand,  they  are  not

satisfied  with it. I do not understand  why  they

are averse to and so critical of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already stated that this Bill is

re-introduced  to  suit  existing circumstances,  and

that it will have a great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



effect  on  the  rights of women and  so  on.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in this debate, I have  a  certain

feeling  which  it is difficult to describe.  This

Charter  has been under consideration for  a  very

long  time.  We have re-introduced it  and  it  is

having its Second Reading today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Women's Charter because it is a

very healthy and progressive Bill. No matter how a

person  views  it,  he will see  that  it  is  not

detrimental  to the people of Singapore.  We  must

recognise this fact. Why is it a progressive Bill?

It  is  because it can remove all the maladies  in

regard   to  women's  problems  under  the  Rendel

Constitution and under the old administration. But

now  the  re-introduction of  this  Bill  in  this

Assembly is a fact that we cannot deny. Therefore,

it  is a progressive Bill. Although we cannot  say

that  this Women's Charter has any concrete effect

on  our sisters, yet we understand clearly that we

must  support  this  Bill as long  as  it  is  not

detrimental to the people but is beneficial to the

people.   But  here  I  feel  that  I   have   the

responsibility to-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I trust the hon. Lady will

not  think I am rude if I ask her to modulate  her

voice. I am getting rather deaf!



<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Although this

Women's  Charter Bill is very grand  in  name,  we

must  recognise  the benefits it  can  provide.  I

think it is necessary to elucidate a few points in

regard to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do some people think that the Women's Charter

cannot  have  a very great effect on our  sisters?

Because under the present circumstances we  cannot

achieve  very great results by this Bill,  because

in  the  present political situation in Singapore,

democracy  is  still affected by the colonialists,

and  our aims and long-term policies have not been

realised.  Therefore,  how  could  we  deal   with

women's   problems?  Because  all  these   women's

problems  are  related to our  circumstances,  the

history  of  our present age, we therefore  cannot

have  very  great  assistance in  respect  of  the

carrying  into  effect  of this  Women's  Charter,

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



we   are  limited  by  our  constitution  and  our

prevailing circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all people could understand our viewpoint,

i.e., they should not misunderstand our intentions

regarding  the  re-introduction  of  this  Women's

Charter.  They  must not think that  we  have  not

given  consideration  to it before  re-introducing

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I must second the decision of all our

sisters   in   casting  away  doubts   and   other

misgivings  in relation to this Bill  and  women's

rights.  I must also stress that we must not  have

very rosy dreams. We must not hope too much beyond

reasonable  logic,  because  we  women  are  under

oppression by two sides. Therefore, we cannot  see

an  immediate  practical improvement  by  the

re-introduction of this Bill. Anyway, I can see  this

Bill  is  a progressive one and it will contribute

to the welfare of our sisters so as to enable them

to  carry  on their struggle. I fully support  the

hon.  Member  for  Delta  who  has  said  the

re-introduction of this Bill will enable us to  carry

on  our duty in respect of women's contribution to

society.  For  this reason, I feel  very  honoured

that  our P.A.P. Government has re-introduced this

Women's Charter.



<br><br>4.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we are re-introducing this

Women's  Charter.  We have been  attacked  by  the

Opposition  Members, but we the  P.A.P. base  our

efforts  on  reality. Their unsatisfied criticisms

do  not merit our attention. The problems of women

have  been  neglected in the past.  In  Singapore,

after 140 years under colonial rule and under  the

former Lim Yew Hock Government, they had not  paid

much  attention to the problems of women. Did they

feel  sorry  for  it, especially  our  Member  for

Mountbatten,   when  they  were   governing   this

country?  Had  they done anything  beneficial  for

women?  That is why today they are still  shouting

criticisms  at  us.  These  criticisms  will   not

contribute  anything constructive  to  this  Bill.

They  had  let us down. They had disappointed  us.

And  in  regard to the stand adopted by the P.A.P.

to  solve women's problems, we would like to carry

out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



this  job in stages. Only we the P.A.P. Government

has  the  courage to attempt a solution. Is  there

any  other  Party  which dares  to  take  up  this

problem?  We  are  proud of  our  stand.  We  have

clearly written down and declared in our Five-Year

Plan what we will do for the welfare of women.  We

want true equality between men and women, just  as

what  our  colleagues have said: that the solution

to  the  problems of women will have to await  the

coming of a true socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to explain these points to the Opposition

Members.  We  have said before that under  a  more

just  society, there are no women's problems.  But

we  have not come to a socialist society. That  is

why  we  have women's problems. If we  reach  that

stage, then we believe we shall improve the lot of

women.  According  to the principle  of  a  social

evolution, people are equal, irrespective of their

religion,  creed  or sex. There will  not  be  any

exploitation  of  man by man.  All  this  will  be

abolished. This will be so only under a more  just

society.  If  you want to raise the  economic  and

social  standing of women, then we  have  to  work

hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is a long-term one, and I will only

point  out  one thing. We do not say that  we  can

solve all the women's problems at this stage. What

we  say,  we  mean.  But  regarding  this  Women's

Charter,  the  Opposition Members have  said  that

they  cannot recognise that our intention is good.

In dealing with the details of the Charter, we may

have  made some mistakes, but any good thing  will

have  to  be considered so many times. As for  the

criticisms on clause 166, they cannot say that our

intention is a bad one. One who has been liberated

from   double  oppression  knows  full  well   the

problems of women. Therefore, we are proud that we

are re-introducing this Bill.



<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I had not intended to  enter  into

this  controversy  and  pronounce  an  opinion  on

matters  on  which I am not fully an expert.  But,

nevertheless, since the Member for Mountbatten has

quoted me somewhat erroneously, I am afraid I feel

obliged to stand up and say a few words.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not recollect quoting in this Assembly that

famous  passage  from  George  Orwell  about   the

equality   of  men.  But  I  did  remember,   when

discussing pay differentials between men and women

teachers, that I did say that while we agree  that

women   workers  are  equal  to  men,  there   are

occupations when men are more equal. I  think  the

Member  for Mountbatten, in taking up the  example

of  women Inspectors, merely brings out the  point

which  I am trying to develop. She says that women

Inspectors  remain in the ranks for  12  years  or

more, while many men Inspectors have been promoted

to  higher  grades. But surely that  is  just  the

point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us suppose a Member of the Assembly is in a

difficult position. Let us say he is about  to  be

assaulted by some tough gangsters. Would he prefer

then, in that situation, Mr Speaker, Sir, to have

by  his side a very robust man police officer,  or

one  of the women Inspectors? I have no doubt that-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Let us have a robust woman

Inspector!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I have no doubt at all where

my  choice  would  lie in the  extremity  of  that

situation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That depends on the locality!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The equality of women has been

pursued so far that you do find even women members

of  secret societies. But I think that is not  the

equality  that we are trying to encourage  in  the

Women's  Charter. Therefore, in the conditions  of

service,  there  must  be regard  to  differential

ability, and, therefore, different terms  of  pay.

But what has always struck me as rather curious is

the  regulation  about retirement  which  requires

women to retire at an earlier age than men. I  did

raise  this  point once in this Assembly.  I  said

that  the vital statistics of all countries  prove

beyond all doubt that women live longer than  men,

by  at  least  five or ten years; and,  therefore,

they should retire five years later than men,  not

earlier.  We would not want to have large  numbers

of  our  population living on Government  pensions

for decades. So the Member for Mountbatten will be

delighted to know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



that  I brought up this matter with my colleagues,

and  although I could not gain my point that women

should  retire  at  a  later  age,  we  reached  a

compromise  and agreed that women and  men  should

retire at the same age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to be more serious, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I

can  go  back  to the theme, and it is  a  serious

theme.  I  do not think Members of the  Opposition

were  justified in making remarks about the  women

Members on the Government side so lightly, and  on

occasions  so  derisively.  We  agree  that   this

Women's   Charter,  like  any   other   piece   of

legislation, gives only the protective  framework.

In  itself,  it  cannot establish any  new  social

codes  of  behaviour. But the  difference  between

women  Members on the Government side and  Members

of  the  Opposition is that our  Members,  in  the

course  of their work and in the course  of  their

lives,  have  come  across  so  many  examples  of

inequality and oppression of women. These  phrases

are not the catch phrases of politicians or people

who   go  abroad  to  attend  conferences  on  the

equality of women. They see this as part of  their

common experience, and, therefore, to them this is

a  real  problem, a genuine problem, and one  that

requires  immediate  and determined  action.  This

piece  of  legislation is only the beginning.  But

the  more  basic work - and this is the  point  that

women  Members on the Government bench  have  been

stressing - the  more urgent need is to  arouse  the

consciousness  of  women in our society,  so  that

they  can  more  effectively stand  up  for  their

rights,  and it is only the women who can  do  so.

However  well disposed a man is, you can  be  sure

that there is in his unconscious mind some lurking

dread whether or not the Government, with the best

of intentions, might not have gone too far. But  I

would say that both the women Members and the  men

Members on the Government benches treat this as  a

very  real  and  genuine problem. When  they  talk

about  women, they do not think in terms of  women

who play mahjong, or who give charity balls or who

do  occasional  social work in  order  to  justify

their existence. We are thinking of women in  poor

families



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



in the slums, in families where the sons are given

education  in preference to daughters,  where  the

old force of the patriarchal family still remains,

and  it is for this reason that the P.A.P.,  as  a

political Party, has developed a conscious  policy

in  regard to women. It is not, as I have said, an

academic  problem,  but it  is  a  real  one,  and

Members  on the Government Front Bench  are  fully

aware  of  it  and treat it as a real and  genuine

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Minister please wait for

one  second?  I  do not know whether  anyone  else

wishes  to speak. No other Member wishes to speak?

Mr Byrne, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from what the

Member for Mountbatten has said this afternoon,  I

note she has receded from the former position that

she  took up in this House when the former Women's

Charter Bill was introduced. On that occasion, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, she said in this Assembly that  the

Women's  Charter Bill was a fraud on the women  of

Singapore; that, in fact, there was nothing new in

the  proposal that there should be monogamy in our

community; that it was a shame for the Charter  to

be  introduced  in this form, in  the  sense  that

provisions  for the suppression of  brothels  were

included  in  the  Bill which purported  to  be  a

Women's Charter. Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill, as I

have   pointed  out  before,  is  worthy  of   the

description  of being a Women's Charter.  For  the

first  time, if it is approved by this Legislative

Assembly, there will be monogamy in our community.

Hitherto,  the practice of a man being  restricted

to  one wife has been restricted only to those who

are Christians. The greater bulk of our population

are  not Christians. If this Bill becomes law, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  it  will,  for  the  first   time,

introduce  this  new principle in  our  community.

There  is no point in our talking about the rights

of  women  and  so on unless the  woman  is  first

regarded as the mistress in her own home.  If  she

has  to  share  her home with somebody  else,  you

cannot  say that that is an ideal community,  that

that  is a community where the interests of  women

are well served.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, right through this law, if it

is  looked  into carefully, I have  no  doubt  all

these  points could not have escaped the attention

of  the  Member for Farrer Park. He has been  very

silent  this  afternoon.  He  knows  this  Charter

better  than  any other Member of the  Opposition,

because he spent quite long hours with us  in  the

Select  Committee proceedings which  went  to  250

pages.  He  will realise, and I have no  doubt  he

does  realise,  that this Bill is  worthy  of  the

description  which  we, as  the  Government,  have

applied to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Opposition have now said

that  they are glad to know that we have  profited

by  the advice they have given us. They have  said

it  is  a  good  thing  we have  now  dropped  the

provisions  with regard to the re-registration  of

former  marriages. Mr Speaker, Sir, we had  every

intention of referring the former Bill to a Select

Committee from the very beginning, and we  did  do

so.  We  wanted to invite comments not  only  from

Members of the Opposition on the provisions of the

Bill,   but  also  comments  from  all  interested

parties.   We  did  receive  quite  a  number   of

representations from members of the general public

and,   as   a  result  of  those  representations,

Government  has  decided to  drop  the  provisions

regarding re-registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill has

said  just now that this is not the document  that

it claims to be, in the sense that whether we have

this  Charter or not, a man is always free to will

his  property to any person he wants. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  for the first time, a similar right is given

to  a  married woman under the provisions of  this

Bill.  I  would refer the Member for Cairnhill  to

clause  47 (1) of the Bill in which it is provided

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A married woman shall, in accordance with this

Part  of  this Ordinance, be capable of acquiring,

holding and disposing by will or otherwise of  any

movable  or  immovable property  as  her  separate

property, in the same manner as if she were a feme

sole, without the intervention of any trustee.'



<br><br>The position of a married woman then is equated in

all  respects with that of her husband  under  the

provisions of this law. Mr Speaker, there  are  a

large number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



provisions in this law which protect the interests

of  women and children. I need only refer to  Part

VII  of the Bill which deals with the question  of

maintenance of wife and children; Part VIII  which

deals  with the enforcement of maintenance orders;

Part  IX  which deals with divorce; and  the  last

sections   of  the  Bill  which  deal   with   the

protection of women and girls generally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may refer again to what

the Member for Cairnhill said just now. He thought

that clause 32 is unnecessary. I would submit, Mr

Speaker, Sir, with respect, that clause 32 is very

necessary, because although registration gives one

the  right to regard a marriage as being  a  valid

marriage, there might be circumstances which  have

occured  which,  if  proved,  would  be  able   to

establish that though registered, the marriage  is

not  a  valid  marriage  and  that  provision  is,

therefore, necessary in a Bill of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I call the attention of the

House  to the fact that the operative date of  the

Bill  has been put forward to the 2nd March, 1961,

and   that  has  been  done  to  regularise  those

marriages  which have taken place under  customary

law  between 2nd March, 1960, (when this Bill  was

first introduced) and the time when this Bill will

be passed into law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to inform the

House that since the original Bill was introduced,

there  have been more marriages solemnized in  the

Registry of Marriages than there have been in  the

last  six  years.  So from that  alone,  it  would

indicate  that  this Bill is, by and  large,  well

supported by the whole of our community, and  that

they  have now accepted the position that monogamy

is to be their rightful lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr

Speaker as Chairman and seven other Members to  be

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion

standing in my name*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter Bill, 1960, was referred to a

Select  Committee  in  the last  Session  of  this

House. The Select Committee in its Report stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Your Committee are of the opinion that, at this

late period of the Session, it is not possible  to

bring  their  consideration  of  the  Bill  to   a

satisfactory   conclusion.  They  have   therefore

agreed    to   present   this   report   of    the

representations  received  and  the   Minutes   of

Evidence  taken before them and to recommend  that

should  a  similar Bill be introduced in the  next

Session  and  should the Bill be  committed  to  a

Select Committee, this report be referred to  that

Select Committee for consideration.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter Bill has been redrafted in

the  light of the representations made, and it has

been  introduced in this Session. As the  Bill  is

being referred to a Select Committee, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Women's Charter Bill presented to the Assembly  in

the  previous session and contained in Paper  L.A.

16  of 1960 be referred to the Select Committee on

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT LOAN BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,    Sir,    I   have   His    Excellency's

recommendation to proceed with the Bill. I beg  to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that on 15th August last

year,  this  Assembly passed the Development  Loan

(Local) Ordinance, No. 50 of 1959, which was to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



enable  the Government to raise locally loans  not

exceeding the value of $100 million to finance  in

part  the  cost of projects under the  Development

Estimates.  You  will be glad to know  that  under

this  Ordinance, three loans totalling $70 million

were successfully floated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our development planning, loan capital is

expected  to  be  a major source  of  finance.  As

Members  would  have noted from  the  Government's

financial talks with the United Kingdom Government

in 1960, it is the intention to raise loan capital

both  locally  as  well as from external  sources.

Members  would  know, that in  this  context,  the

United Kingdom Government agreed to provide to the

Singapore Government Exchequer loans of up  to  �5

million  or  $42.5  million to meet  part  of  our

capital expenditure under the Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Plan itself was prepared last

year  and completed before my departure in  August

to  the  United Kingdom for financial  talks.  The

original   Plan   covered  a   five-year   period,

1959/1964. As a result of further discussions with

the  World Bank Mission who visited Singapore last

September, and taking into account the  result  of

our    financial   discussions   with   the   U.K.

Government, it was necessary to revise  in  detail

some  aspects  of  the Plan. I  referred  to  this

matter  in  my  last Budget Speech.  The  work  of

revision was an intricate operation. However,  the

exercise  was completed by the end of  January  of

this  year and the Plan is now with the Government

Printers. I intend to present the Development Plan

at  the  next  sitting  of the  Assembly  for  its

approval  on  the 12th of April.  Because  of  the

lapse   of  time  since  the  original  Plan   was

prepared,  it  is necessary to restrict  the  Plan

period  to  four years, i.e., 1960/64. To  finance

the  Plan  expenditure, loans will be raised  both

locally  and  overseas. The  original  Development

Loan (Local) Ordinance, 1959, does not provide for

loans  raised externally. The Bill now before  the

House  provides, in section 3, for the raising  of

loans in the London money market and for Exchequer

loans negotiated with the Secretary of State.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have occasion to raise loans from other

external  sources, such as the World Bank  or  the

Import and Export Bank, it may be necessary either

to  pass amending legislation or to introduce  new

legislation. These matters are being  examined  in

my  Ministry. But it is best to leave  that  as  a

separate exercise and deal with it as and when the

occasion arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us, in addition to providing for

loans  raised in the United Kingdom,  also  raises

the ceiling from $100 million to $400 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a substantial sum. But the amount is well

within  the  borrowing capacity of  the  Singapore

Government  provided the yield from  our  revenues

continues  to expand, as it had done  in  previous

years,  and  provided also that strict control  is

maintained over annually recurrent expenditure  to

avoid waste.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Plan provides for a total

expenditure of $871 million in the years  1960/64.

I  do  not wish to enter into a discourse  on  the

development plan as this is properly a subject for

the  next  sitting  of  the Assembly.  But  I  may

perhaps  be  permitted to say a few words  on  the

urgency  of  the  problem.  The  main  outline  is

familiar  enough  to all thinking  persons.  I  am

talking  about the outline of the problem and  not

the  outline of the plan. Here we are in the small

island  State  with  no  natural  resources.   Our

population  is  expanding at  a  prodigious  rate.

Unless  something is done immediately,  and  on  a

scale  unprecedented in our history, a decline  in

standards of living in Singapore is inevitable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No country in the world owes Singapore a

livelihood. They have even less responsibility  to

assure our prosperity. Our standard of living, one

of the highest in Asia, is due to the exertions of

our   own  people,  their  thrift,  industry   and

ingenuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today Singapore faces a problem that she has

never had to face before. In the past, when things

were  really bad, large numbers of the  population

returned to their homeland, for the great majority

of  the population in pre-war years, for instance,

was  of  immigrant origin. So we saw in the  great

depression



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



of   the  1930's  the  spectacle  of  hundreds  of

thousands of people returning to China and  India.

But  today our population is a settled one.  There

is  no place for us to escape to, should things go

bad.  Hence  it  is  the  responsibility  of   the

Government to ensure that everything will be  done

within  the limits of its capability to build  for

the   future.  The  Bill  before  us  enables  the

Government to build up the sinews of the  economic

strength of the State. The effort that has  to  be

mounted is an immense one for there is no easy way

out, faced as we are in a very tight situation  in

which   the   population   is   outstripping   our

resources. I shall deal with this theme in greater

length at the next sitting of the Assembly when  I

present the Development Plan. In the meantime, all

I  need say is that this Bill is intended to  make

possible   the   mobilisation  of  our   financial

resources to make this Development Plan effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Hon. the  Finance Minister,  in  moving  the

Second  Reading  of the Bill, informed  the  House

that  the  intention of this Bill was to  increase

the  ceiling  which had been set for the  previous

Development  Loan  (Local) Ordinance,  No.  50  of

1959,  from $100 million to $400 million. He  also

informed   the  House  that  under  the   previous

Ordinance,  $70 million had already  been  raised,

leaving  $30  million still to be raised.  Sir,  I

wonder  if  the Finance Minister could inform  the

House   whether  it  is  the  intention   of   the

Government  to  raise  $400  million  under   this

Ordinance, and to raise another $30 million  under

the  previous Ordinance; or what the intention  of

Government  is.  Under  this  Bill,  although  the

explanatory  statement says that it  replaces  the

Development Loan (Local) Ordinance, 1959, it  does

not  repeal  that Ordinance. Therefore,  it  could

well  be  that the Government, if it chose,  could

raise  the  full $400 million under this Ordinance

and  go  for the balance of the $30 million  under

the Development Loan (Local)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance,  1959.  The Schedule is  not  concerned

with  any  repealing  section.  It  is  merely   a

Schedule  concerned  with the  definition  of  the

expression "local stock". So that if this Bill  is

passed,  the Government will, in effect,  have  at

its disposal two Ordinances under which they could

raise  loans up to $430 million, if they  felt  so

disposed.  I  am not saying that they  should  not

raise  that  loan  but, if the ceiling  which  the

Government propose for the development  loan  over

the  next  four  years is $400  million,  then  it

appears  that  the  Government  could,  under  the

statutory provisions, if this Bill is passed, draw

on  another $30 million. That is the first  point,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is a matter of detail on clauses

3  and 4 which I will raise in Committee when  the

Bill is moved into Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to

clarify the point raised by the Member for  Farrer

Park. It is not the intention of the Government to

make  use of any surplus arising from the previous

Development Loan Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 4 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On a point of information, Sir, Clause

4 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The principal moneys and interest represented by

stock issued...'-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



the  words "represented by stock issued",  I  take

it, would refer to the stock issued under clause 3

(2)  (a) -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...or by a loan raised in the United

Kingdom,  under the provisions of this  Ordinance,

are  hereby charged upon and shall be payable  out

of the Consolidated Fund and assets of Singapore.'



<br><br>This  clause 4 takes in clause 3 (2) (a) and  (b),

omits  (c),  and says that anything in  connection

with  clause 3 (2) (a) and (b) "are hereby charged

upon  and shall be payable out of the Consolidated

Fund and assets of Singapore." But clause 4 leaves

out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`by means of loans made at the request of the

Minister  by  the Secretary of State  under  the

provisions   of  section  2  of   the   Colonial

Development and Welfare Act, 1959.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will be good enough to

look  at  clause  6, you will see  that  it  deals

specifically with loans raised under clause 3  (2)

(c). Clause 6 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any, loan raised under paragraph (c) of

subsection  (2)  of  section 3 of  this  Ordinance

shall  be  on such terms as may be agreed  between

the  Minister and the Secretary of State and shall

be  repaid by equal annual instalments of  capital

and  interest combined so that such loan shall  be

repaid  within the period for which the  same  was

granted.'



<br><br>Sir,  clause 4, as it now stands, does  not  state

whether  or not moneys raised under clause  3  (2)

(c) become payable out of the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question I ask the Minister for Finance is

this. If it is not payable out of the Consolidated

Fund,  then  out of what fund would he propose  to

repay any loans incurred under clause 3 (2) (c)?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I do not think I can accept

the  interpretation of the Member for Farrer Park.

Clause  4  will  not have any relevance  to  loans

raised  under clause 3 (2) (c) - that is,  Exchequer

loans.  I would have thought that Exchequer  loans

would  have  come within the definition  of  loans

raised  in the United Kingdom under the provisions

of  the Bill, and therefore would be chargeable to

the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> If the interpretation of the Minister

for  Finance is correct, then that is so. What  he

said would be correct.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



But it does look as if a loan raised in the United

Kingdom under the provisions of this Bill, as

drafted, refers to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The loan hereby authorised or any part of it may

be raised either-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in London by the Crown Agents in accordance

with the provisions of the General Loan and

Inscribed Stock Ordinance;'.



<br><br>Now  any loans negotiated between the Minister and

the  Secretary of State appear to  me  not  to  be

covered  by the phrase in clause 4 "or by  a  loan

raised  in the United Kingdom". It appears  to  me

that that phrase could only refer to clause 3  (2)

(b).  But  if the Minister is satisfied  that  the

phrase   "or  by  a  loan  raised  in  the  United

Kingdom",  in fact, covers clause 3  (2)  (b)  and

(c),  then,  of course, I have nothing further  to

say.  But  if it does not, then the question  will

arise:  out of which fund would he pay  any  loans

which he negotiates with the Secretary of State?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I can assure the Member for

Farrer Park that unless the cost of servicing  and

interest payments on loans are chargeable  to  the

Consolidated Fund, we are not likely  to  get  any

money from that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 to 17 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third

time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->7nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Standing Order No. 93 be amended by adding

at  the end of paragraph (6) thereof the following

paragraph:-



<br><br><div align="center">'Committee of Privileges</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) (a) There shall be a Committee to be known

as  the Committee of Privileges to consist of the

Speaker  as  Chairman  and seven  Members  to  be

nominated by the Committee of Selection, as  soon

as  may  be after its appointment, in such manner

as  shall ensure that, so far as is possible, the

balance  between the Government benches  and  the

Opposition  benches in the Assembly is  reflected

in the Committee. There shall be referred to this

Committee any complaint of breach of privilege or

any matter which appears to affect the powers and

privileges of the Assembly. It shall be the  duty

of the Committee to consider any such matters to

them  referred,  and to report  on  them  to  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Whenever the Assembly is not sitting a

Member  may bring an alleged breach of  privilege

to  the notice of Mr Speaker who may, if  he  is

satisfied  that a prima facie breach of privilege

has  been  committed, refer such  matter  to  the

Committee  which  shall  report  thereon  to  the

Assembly.'.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members are no doubt aware of

sub-paragraph  (b) of paragraph  (4)  of  Standing

Order No. 93 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If a notice of motion involves any proposal for

the amendment of Standing Orders, the notice shall

be   accompanied  by  a  draft  of  the   proposed

amendments  and  the  motion when  proposed  shall

stand referred without any question being proposed

thereon  to the Standing Orders Committee  and  no

further  proceedings shall be taken  on  any  such

motion  until  the Standing Orders  Committee  has

reported thereon.'



<br><br>Accordingly,   in  accordance   with   that

sub-paragraph, the motion now stands referred  to  the

Standing Orders Committee.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>ADJOURNMENT TO A LATER DAY MOTION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That this Assembly do now adjourn to

12th April, 1961."- [Dr Toh Chin Chye.]
