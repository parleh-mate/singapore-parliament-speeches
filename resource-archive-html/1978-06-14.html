  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I desire, on behalf of Parliament, to express to you and members of your family, with great regret and with deep sympathy, our expression of the sense of loss Parliament has sustained at the sad passing of your husband."

   <b>OBITUARY ON THE LATE HON. MEMBER MR P. GOVINDASWAMY</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, when Encik Baharuddin bin Mohamed Ariff died in April 1961, the People's Action Party lost the constituency of Anson to David Marshall. In 1963, when the general elections were held, Anson was a bitterly contested constituency in a six-corner fight. On the surface, it was a fight between
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1546</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> P. Govindaswamy and David Marshall. In style, character and background, P. Govindaswamy was the very opposite of the lawyer and ex-Chief Minister. But as the election results showed, it was not a contest between P. Govindaswamy and David Marshall. It was a fight between the PAP and the Barisan Sosialis which represented the Communist United Front. P. Govindaswamy won 46.5% of the votes cast and Barisan Sosialis 39.7% while David Marshall had only 4.8%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P. Govindaswamy truly represented the working class in his outlook to life. He came a long way from being a retired postman to becoming a Member of Parliament. But his elevation did not inflate his ego nor did he change his lifestyle. Neither did he alter his view of politics in the service of the ordinary man and he had held Anson in successive elections in 1968, 1972 and 1976.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P. Govindaswamy, in Parliament, was what I would call a qualitative man. He had a political instinct of what he deemed was good or bad administration or legislation, partly because of his experience in trade union work and partly because he was in constant touch with his grassroots. He was not equipped with 'O' level or 'A' level certificates, much less a University degree. But he had courage. He had courage to speak out his mind. Members of Parliament will recollect the heat that was generated when increases in road tax, vehicle registration fees and area licensing fees were imposed on New Year's Day in 1976. While others were merely vociferous, P. Govindaswamy had the courage to sign his name together with a few other Backbenchers a letter of protest to the Prime Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P. Govindaswamy proved that age was not a handicap to learning and trying. He spoke indeed, fluent Tamil in this Chamber but he knew that the emphasis and the nuances of his Tamil speech were lost in the process of translation. He switched to speaking in English. To be true, it was not even Singapore English, but he drove his points forcibly home. So he found his feet in Parliament and grew to become an endearing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1547</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> figure as he heaped ridicule on the Government Benches in his inimitable English. I believe he generated more laughter in this House than any other Member.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With P. Govindaswamy's death, Anson has lost a good spokesman and Parliament will miss his earthy humour during Question time and debate.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> As a mark of respect to the late hon. Member, I propose that the House observe a two-minute silence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House rose and paid respect

   <b>(Withholding of staff salaries)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Prime Minister (a) whether the withholding of salary is a penalty the People's Association imposes on its staff and, if so, whether this contravenes the Employment Act: (b) from how many of its employees the Association has withheld salary for more than three days during the last three financial years; and (c) how many of them are married and if he is aware that the withholding of salary from such employees will lead them to borrow money to support their families.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I assure the Member for Thomson that although the People's Association, like all statutory boards, is not bound by the Employment Act, its practices are in keeping with the principles of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last three years, there were only three employees whose salaries were withheld. All three were facing disciplinary action for gross misconduct leading to the loss of public fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the hardship suffered by them. However, staff committing offences of this nature should expect to suffer the consequences. They cannot rely on their marital status to plead for leniency.

   <b>(Legislation)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Health, in connection with the proposed National Campaign against smoking next year, if he will consider introducing legislation to make it compulsory for health warning statements to be printed on cigarette packs in order to more effectively discourage Singaporeans from smoking.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> A Morbidity Survey carried out by the Health Ministry in 1977 showed that 23% of the population aged 15 years and above were smokers. Inserting warning statements on the risks of smoking on cigarette packs alone has not been found to reduce the number of smokers in the United States or the United Kingdom. More stringent measures are required to control the smoking habit. They are taxation and prohibition of advertising. At present we already have two Acts, one which prohibits smoking in certain places and the other which prohibits advertising. In addition, periodical TV spots discouraging smoking are broadcast to the public.

  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. What is the Hon. Minister's reaction to a report in the Straits Times on Friday, 9th June, concerning the Singapore Tobacco Company's parent company in Britain, the British American Tobacco, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"STC's parent company in Britain, the British American Tobacco (BAT), the world's largest tobacco manufacturer, is producing cigarettes of higher tar content for the developing countries than those under the same brand name sold for domestic consumption."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1549</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> How adversely would this, if true, affect the health of the Singaporean smoker, and what does the Ministry of Health propose to do about it?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I am not a member of the Consumers' Association, nor do I smoke. I therefore cannot distinguish whether cigarettes have more tar content or less tar content. The answer to the question raised by the Member for Potong Pasir is that it is a very timely piece of news and all cigarette smokers should take heed that we are becoming a dumping ground for poisonous cigarettes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, does the Ministry of Health have facilities to do tests to determine the level of tar content?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Ministry of Health does not have the facilities to determine or assay the contents of cigarettes but we can submit samples to the Department of Scientific Services to do the necessary assay.
  <br>
  <br>

   <b>(Scheme for Skilled Workers)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon</b> asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider introducing a more favourable work permit scheme for those who have special skills or good qualifications so as to meet the manpower requirement for skilled workers.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members may recall that my Ministry has a 3-year Work Permit Scheme for foreign workers who have acceptable training qualifications or have been certified as skilled by the Industrial Training Board. Under this Scheme a 3-year work permit holder will be eligible for permanent residence if he has completed at least two years of employment in Singapore relevant to his skill. He may eventually also
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1550</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> be granted citizenship after satisfying the 10-year residential qualification.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further enhance the 3-year Work Permit Scheme, the Ministry of Labour has taken steps to increase the range of benefits to be offered to 3-year work permit holders. The current Scheme will also be liberalised and extended to non-industrial workers with good academic qualifications.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the benefits the present 3-year work permit holder enjoys, he will, after he has obtained his permanent residence, be eligible to rent a HDB/JTC flat or purchase a HDB/JTC flat at non-subsidised rates. Subsidised medical treatment at Government outpatient clinics and hospitals will also be offered as a privilege to these workers and their immediate families. Their children can also receive education in Singapore at old rates of school fees. In addition, their immediate families will be granted Dependant Passes. Social Visit Passes of sufficiently long duration will also be given to their parents.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is anticipated that the granting of these benefits would encourage more persons to take advantage of the 3-year Work Permit Scheme and hence contribute significantly to meet our skilled manpower requirements.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Work Permit Scheme, work permits have been granted to industrial workers with the necessary skills. Under the new scheme just announced by the Acting Minister non-industrial workers will also qualify. In his reply, the Acting Minister mentioned "non-industrial workers with good academic qualifications." Will the Acting Minister elaborate further what he means by "good academic qualifications"?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this moment I am not able to spell out the details because they are being worked out and an announcement will be made as soon as they are ready.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, is the Acting Minister not aware that there are already those permanent residents who possess the skills and qualifications he has just

  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1551</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> mentioned? Is he also not aware that some of these people have been here for ten years or more but have not received their citizenship and have so far not been able to apply for HDB flats?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the new benefits he has just outlined will no doubt encourage more people to come and take advantage of our work permit scheme, will he not impress upon his colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, of the need to extend the privileges more liberally than has been done in the past? In particular, he should stress on citizenship to those who are already permanent residents with the skills and qualifications he has just mentioned and who, in fact, have already been contributing positively to our economy for more than ten years.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Those who want bigger premises can have more than one unit to meet their needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I must qualify this by saying that a resettlement case is entitled to rental concession for the number of shops owned or occupied prior to clearance, i.e. if a resettled case owns two shops previously, he will be entitled to rental concession for two shops upon clearance. However, market rental will be charged for additional units over and above what his entitlement is.

Not only are the costs prohibitive, but it may also be difficult to recruit the manpower in view of the tight labour situation. However, there is nothing like helping yourselves. "God will help those who help themselves." In some estates such as Sims Drive, Toa Payoh East and Farrer Road, residents have on their own initiative engaged lift attendants and have obtained HDB's assistance in training them.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March 1974, we had to allow school buses to operate during peak hours under the Supplementary Public Transport Service Scheme because SBS was unable to cope with the increasing demand for public transport.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of issuing one-fare tickets or transfer tickets for commuters using feeder services as well as external services is being looked into by SBS (1978) Limited. In the meantime, a $5 monthly season pass for feeder service has been introduced since 1st June 1978. This season pass entitles the holder to unlimited travel on any one designated feeder service.

  <b>Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for National Development and Communications if he will request the Singapore Bus Service (1978) Limited to re-site the bus depot at Bedok South Road at some other place because of the nuisance caused to residents of Neighbourhood 11 by noise from the present depot, especially in the early hours of the morning.

The other reason is that Lorong Engku Aman has become a busy link road with the conversion of Geylang Road and Sims Avenue into one-way roads. Resiting the hawkers back to Lorong Engku Aman will cause obstruction to traffic.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will be providing anti-pollution facilities for hawkers resited at the back- lane between Guillemard Road and Lorong 42.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Senior Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Finance (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Customs Act is amended principally to strengthen the legislation for effective enforcement and to improve administration as well as bring the provisions of the Act in consonance with the changes or requirements in other legislations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 3(1) of the Act, the term "manufacturer" is re-defined and a definition for the term "bottling" is included in order to remove the ambiguity and contradiction between sections 58(1), 58(4) and 61 (1) of the Act. The contradiction exists because the existing definition of "manufacture" includes blending, compounding and varying of any intoxicating liquor. However, section 58(1) excludes from the licence to manufacture intoxicating liquor, the blending, compounding and varying of intoxicating liquors. Again, section 61(1) requires a licence to be taken out for the blending, compounding and varying of any intoxicating liquor. The new definition of "manufacture" includes the process of distillation, fermentation and any process of converting raw materials into intoxicating liquor but does not include blending, compounding and varying of the intoxicating liquor. The term "bottling" is defined to include blending, compounding and varying of intoxicating liquors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment to section 3(1) changes the titles of Comptroller, Deputy Comptroller, Senior Assistant Comptroller and Assistant Comptroller to Director-General, Deputy Director-General, Senior Director and Director respectively, to conform with international practice and recent changes in departmental titles which
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1567</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> were effected to enable the public to identify the hierarchy in the Service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21 (1) is amended to provide for the value of any imported goods to be determined at the time when duty is payable, and not their value at the time of importation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 25(2) provides for the import of "manufacturers' samples" without payment of duty in the same manner as "trade samples" and the import without duty of "samples for the purpose of soliciting orders from local manufacturers". Under existing provisions, only "trade samples" are allowed to be imported without duty for the purpose of being demonstrated in Singapore for the soliciting of orders from abroad. The amendments will facilitate trade.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended section 29(a) provides that no permit shall be required if a person brings into Singapore dutiable goods, the duty of which does not exceed $300. This amendment will again facilitate trade and administration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 34 of the Act requires the Director-General to be supplied with a full manifest of goods in transit. The amendment to the section makes it mandatory for the Director-General to be supplied with a statement only when the goods in transit are temporarily discharged in Singapore. The requirement is to enable the Customs Department to keep track of all goods which are temporarily landed and ensure that they are eventually shipped out of Singapore. The amendment also allows the Director-General, if he considers it necessary, to ask for a manifest of all goods, notwithstanding that the goods are not landed and are only in transit through Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 61A provides that no person, unless he is licensed, shall knowingly keep or have in his possession any utensil, apparatus or material for bottling, blending, compounding or varying any intoxicating liquor and section 123 provides for penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 18 months or to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to both such imprisonment and fine for an offence under the new section 61A. Another
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1568</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> new section 61B provides the exempting provision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new subsection 68(1)(c) requires owners of licensed premises to display notices stating that no person under the age of 18 years is allowed to buy or consume intoxicating liquor in the premises. This is consonant with requirements under the Liquor Licensing Regulations, 1974.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 75 makes it an offence for any person, other than those authorised to sell duty-free goods, to advertise that he is selling duty-free goods in his premises.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to sections 94, 96 and 98 widen the powers of Customs officers conducting investigations or arrests of person(s) connected with any offence under the Customs Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendment to section 106, a Magistrate's Court can now impose a sentence of imprisonment for any offence for a term not exceeding two years, instead of 12 months as at present. This is in line with the enhanced powers of a Magistrate to impose sentence as provided for in the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1976.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 121 is amended by making the possession of uncustomed goods an offence. A new section 121A provides for the imposition of penalties for offences connected with the addition of deleterious substances to intoxicating liquors for consumption or for sale.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments in the Bill are either, again, to tighten Customs administration or consequential in nature.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to raise a small point here. I note that, under clause 2 of the Bill, the title of "Comptroller" is being changed to "Director-General". The Hon. Senior Minister of State mentioned that this is to conform with international practice. I am just
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1569</b></font>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two reasons have been offered for a change in the name. One is that it is to conform with our own internal departmental terminology. The other reason offered is to fit in with international requirement, in the sense that if we do attend international conferences other countries do have such names. Maybe some other countries do not have such names but that is only one of the two reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> If that is the case, presumably the Comptroller of Inland Revenue will be known as Director-General of Inland Revenue and so on, to ensure consistency.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is aware that recently departmental officers have been given titles or designations to reflect better the nature of their work.

  <b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment to section 75, by clause 16 (c), still poses problems for consumers, both local and overseas.

  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as from the 1st of June, 1978, the Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd, introduced a bus interchange scheme in Jurong Town. In the initial stages of its implementation, it caused great confusion and inconvenience to the commuters in Jurong Town resulting in a lot of complaints from all concerned. As a Member of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1571</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Parliament for that area, I have to raise this matter in this House, or I would be failing in my duty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to newspaper reports before the implementation of this interchange scheme, the SBS had engaged experts to study and to make a research into statistics over a period of years before coming up with the so-called bus rationalisation scheme. I am not knowledgeable in this matter and, therefore, I cannot claim whether or not this is a reasonable scheme. But I can say that in this matter of a major readjustment and changes in a public communication system, I as the MP for that area, and even the Citizens' Consultative Committee and the people of Jurong were not informed of the proposed scheme in advance. As a representative of the people I do not seem to have a say in a proposal that affects the livelihood of my constituents. How contemptuous of public opinion and how arbitrary the SBS has been.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the first few days of the implementation of this new rationalisation scheme, the press reported on the confusion at the bus interchange together with the many complaints made by the residents. I myself visited the place on different occasions. I observed that during non-peak hours, the interchange appeared to be able to cope with the situation. Of course, there is still room for improvement. But no one is able to realise how bad the confusion and the crowd is during peak hours at the interchange unless he is there to experience it himself. Under the circumstances in the rush for a bus, the old, the weak, the women and children, and those who were courteous found it very difficult to squeeze their way into the bus. If the SBS wanted the passengers to queue up, they had not put up any railings to guide them. One could only see SBS staff clad in white yelling at the crowd through loud hailers and gesticulating or driving the commuters away like cattle. At times when commuters squeezed into the wrong queue through ignorance, they were discourteously pulled away and even scolded by the staff. Commuters are mainly citizens in the lower income groups. Their only means of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> communication is the bus. So they had to stomach this scolding and rough handling by the staff, much to their discomfiture. Along certain isolated routes leading to some factories, commuters had to wait for a very long time because SBS officials would send a bus to such routes only when there were enough commuters waiting. The original schedules had not been adhered to. I am just quoting these instances to show how the scheme has brought about inconvenience to the commuters right from the very start.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already described the situation inside the interchange. The situation outside the interchange was no better because the exit and entry points are situated close to each other. Both points are sited on one same road and they are also very close to Corporation Circus, thus restricting the smooth flow of vehicular traffic. During peak hours, the congestion along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim was even worse. Some of the staff of the bus company therefore acted as "traffic police", regulating the traffic at random, without actually knowing what they were doing. I wonder why the experts when planning the scheme had not thought of these defects that would arise. Perhaps their calculations had been wrong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even up to today, I am receiving complaints from the residents. They complain that to reach the factory or to go downtown, they have to spend double the amount of time waiting for buses and also the inconvenience of changing buses, not to talk about spending more money on bus fares. Factory operators have also complained that since the implementation of the scheme on 1st June, many of their workers could not arrive for work on time, thus affecting their production schedule in the long run. I have also heard that some companies are considering buying their own buses to transport their workers in order to solve this problem for good. Furthermore, executives and other road-users have also complained that during peak hours traffic congestion is even worse, thus much of their valuable time is wasted. Shopkeepers and hawkers in Jurong Town have also complained that because of the inconvenience of transport in Jurong Town,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> there are fewer and fewer customers. So their business has declined very badly. All in all, the introduction of the new bus interchange has brought about complaints by the people from all quarters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the rationalisation of Jurong Town bus services was originally intended to improve the transport system in Jurong Town, thereby enabling the residents to reach their destinations faster. However, we have seen only the weaknesses of the scheme so far, even before we can think of any benefits to the commuters. During peak hours, if the residents should take a feeder bus to the interchange, they have to board a bus heading for Boon Lay Gardens, which takes a big loop back to Jurong Town before reaching the interchange. Commuters who fail to board a bus after a long wait simply walk to the interchange. Previously, one needed to take only one bus to town or the factory. Now one has to spend more bus fares and more time and even to walk a distance to reach one's destination. May I ask the Minister whether this so-called rationalisation of the Jurong Town bus services has brought any improved service to the people, or has it caused more inconvenience to them?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bus is a means of transport for the lower income groups. It affects their livelihood to a great extent. The Government has sent a team of senior officials to the bus company. They should perform their supervisory task earnestly and not to try to relate their performance merely to the criterion of whether or not the company is making money. What is more important is that bus services should be improved in accordance with the wishes of the people. As the SBS has declared, it would provide an enhanced level of service at the lowest possible cost. I am not an expert but a layman on bus and transportation. However, I would like to reflect the views of my constituents and to make certain observations which are based on what I have actually seen on various occasions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, yesterday, from what I have read in an English newspaper, in order to relieve the pressure at the interchange, the SBS intends to introduce a new Service 249A during the peak hours to link up the residential areas in Jurong with the industrial areas. This shows that the bus interchange scheme may not be suitable to residents of Jurong Town and Boon Lay housing estate. However, the residents in Jurong area welcome this new bus service, and they believe that such link service should be increased to service the residents between their homes and the huge industrial areas. With this direct bus communication, transport will be more convenient and faster.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, before the full implementation of this scheme, the frequency of Services 240, 242, 244, 246 should be increased during peak hours and the buses should observe fixed schedules in order to shorten the waiting time of commuters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the extraneous Service 209 has been a heavily used service. It should not have been abolished. The frequency of Services 197 and 198 should be increased so as to provide residents travelling out of or into Jurong Town with adequate bus services.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the traffic conditions at Corporation Circus should immediately be improved so as to alleviate the serious congestion there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, at exchange sections in the interchange railings should be erected to enable commuters to queue up for their buses. SBS employees should politely render assistance and guidance to those commuters who do not know what buses to take.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, at route-terminals in the interchange buses should punctually leave according to schedule so that commuters at some routes need not have to wait for an unduly long time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, bus services such as Nos. 183 and 197 which come from areas outside Jurong Town should stop at the interchange to allow commuters wishing to change buses to alight and then proceed to Jurong Town and Boon Lay housing estates and finally
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> going back to the interchange. This will minimise the inconvenience to commuters in Jurong Town and Boon Lay Gardens of having to change buses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since there is such confusion at the present time when the schools are closed for the holidays, you can imagine the confusion and chaos at the interchange if conditions are not improved by the 26th June when the schools reopen - students and workers will be scrambling for buses. Sir, I hope the Minister will see to it that senior Government officials posted to the SBS make a real effort to improve the rationalisation scheme before the next semester begins, so that it will meet the demand of the broad masses. Sir, whether such a major scheme will be successful or not, I reserve my views for the time being. However, this bus interchange scheme that has been implemented for the last two weeks most surely needs urgent and positive improvement.
  <br>3.45 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ngeow Pack Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ngeow Pack Hua (Boon Lay)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Member for Boon Lay, a neighbouring constituency of Jurong, I am always faced with similar problems. Therefore, I must support the views expressed by the Member for Jurong. Though the new rationalisation scheme in Jurong Town has good intentions, it appears that the task has not been given close scrutiny and careful planning. The SBS has not actually given careful consideration to preparatory work or to the actual needs of the commuters. The original plan was to facilitate communication and to shorten travelling time. But on implementation, in fact, the commuters are subjected to more inconvenience, having to wait longer and to change buses and to pay more. According to what I understand, before the feeder service was put into effect, commuters in Jurong and Boon Lay needed only 10 minutes to reach their destination. But now they have to take one hour to reach their destination.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the Department concerned and the SBS not only have not consulted the residents in these particular constituencies but they also have not given due considera-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> tion to the views of the Members of Parliament of these two constituencies. I feel that we have been neglected. So I hope the Government and the Minister concerned would look into this matter immediately and take remedial measures to improve the bus service in question and the situation there. This calls for immediate action, so that workers will not be inconvenienced and will not be late for work and there will be no more complaints from the people concerned, particularly from the Minister for Finance who has said that the workers' productivity has dropped.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SBS has become a public company now. I believe many commuters have acquired shares in this company through their CPF funds. Since it is a public company, it should provide better services, and this is what the Minister has promised. However, as soon as the shares were subscribed, the first move it has taken was to implement a feeder service in Jurong Town. From the results that we can see the SBS has failed. According to my understanding this feeder service is an experiment, and the Government intends to introduce it in the other housing estates. In that case, I feel the Minister should take immediate remedial action about the matter and I hope he can now give us a satisfactory explanation of the whole situation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Acting Minister for Culture and Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Culture and Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Sir, the rationalisation scheme in Jurong is the first of its kind to be implemented in the Republic and also in the region; I am not too sure if it is the first in the world. Being the first, some teething problems are to be expected. However, I understand the concern expressed by the Members for Jurong and Boon Lay. I wish to assure them that the main objective of the rationalisation scheme is to improve the level of bus service to commuters.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the rationalisation scheme, Jurong had eight feeder services and 14 external services, with a total of 285 buses operating. With the introduction of the rationalisation scheme, there are now 14 feeder services
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and 12 external services, with a total of 322 buses operating.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of 1st June this year, i.e. the first day of operation of the Jurong interchange, there was confusion among commuters. Buses were overloaded and schedules were not adhered to. Many workers had to wait up to about one hour for feeder services and were, therefore, late for work. The causes of these problems were, firstly, that many people were unaware of the new feeder services they had to take to their destination. This was so, despite the many announcements and press conferences made by SBS. This had therefore disrupted the smooth flow of passengers transferring to new feeder services at the interchange.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the commuter demand at the interchange and its surging effect during the peak hours was greater than expected. However, steps were immediately taken then to overcome the confusion and to ease congestion. Over the last two weeks there have been improvements at the Jurong interchange. External services are now found to be adequate to meet passenger demand throughout the day, and many commuters have found the new scheme to be more efficient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we recognise that feeder services are still unable to cope with the large number of commuters travelling within Jurong. Inconveniences have been caused to commuters living in Taman Jurong and Boon Lay Garden Housing Estates. On the other hand, the introduction of more buses to carry commuters living in Taman Jurong and Boon
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Lay Garden to the Jurong interchange during the peak period, for example, as the Member for Jurong suggested, Services 240, 242 and 244, may not necessarily solve the problem. It may create greater congestion at the interchange. The solution would be to provide direct internal services between residential estates and industrial estates so that those living in Jurong and working in another part of Jurong need not have to go to the interchange to catch another feeder service to their place of work. This problem has been carefully looked into, and the Members for Jurong and Boon Lay no doubt would have noted that the SBS has announced in the press yesterday that a few such internal services linking residential estates to the industrial estates will soon be introduced. SBS has been told to see to it that these additional services are introduced before the new school term starts on 26th June this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the additional internal services, Jurong residents will be able to commute to their places of work without having to pass through the interchange. This will also ease the demand for feeder buses at the interchange. It is hoped that this would solve the problems faced by commuters presently. We will continue to monitor the situation and make adjustments to improve the service whenever necessary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

  <!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education (a) how many applications for Singapore citizenship are still outstanding as at the latest convenient date; (b) how many of the applicants have been residing in Singapore since childhood and had attended Singapore primary schools; and (c) whether the rules for the granting of citizenship could be relaxed for applicants who have been residing in Singapore continuously for ten years or more, and, if not, what are the reasons.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen (Acting Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Bernard Chen):</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The number of applications for Singapore citizenship outstanding as at 30th April, 1978, was 23,852.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Registry of Citizenship does not keep statistics of citizenship applicants according to when they started to reside in Singapore or the schools they attended. However, to answer this question, the Registry has taken a 20% sample of the outstanding applications and found that 11.3% of the applicants have been residing in Singapore since childhood and had attended Singapore primary schools. If this sample is representative, then approximately 2,700 of the 23,852 outstanding applicants would have resided in Singapore since childhood and had attended Singapore primary schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It is stipulated under Article 57(1) of the Constitution of Singapore that an applicant for Singapore citizenship must have an aggregate of not less than ten years' residence during the 12 years immediately preceding the date of his application. This is but one of the requirements for the grant of citizenship. The Constitution also requires every citizenship applicant to satisfy the Government that he:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) is of good character;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) has resided in Singapore throughout the 12 months
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately preceding the date of his application;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) intends to reside permanently in Singapore; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) has an elementary knowledge of the national language
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if he is less than 45 years of age and is not deaf or
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dumb. These constitutional requirements must be met in full.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grant of citizenship is a privilege and not as of right. Thus, apart from satisfying the constitutional requirements, an applicant for Singapore citizenship should be able to make a positive contribution towards the economic well-being of the Republic and not become a liability. This policy is basic and should not be changed. However, in pursuing this policy, account is taken of the prevailing social and economic conditions in the Republic and the family roots of the applicant.

   <b>MUSLIM EDUCATION FOUNDATION</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Haji Sha'ari bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for Social Affairs whether the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura has any plans to use the accumulated money in the Fitrah Fund, which is currently kept in fixed deposit, for any specific project, and, if not, whether the MUIS will consider establishing a Muslim Education Foundation to assist deserving Muslims to further their tertiary education.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> As at 30th May 1978, the amount in the Fitrah Fund kept by the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) stood at $1,852,594.42 with $1,826,000.00 in fixed deposits. The yearly Fitrah collection (Muslim tithes) paid by Muslims in cash representing the price of 2.26 kilograms of rice per Muslim, is allocated according to Muslim law to the 8 "Asnafs". Funds allocated to the "Asnafs" which are not utilised at the end of the year are kept in the Fitrah Fund, the accounts of which are audited yearly by qualified accountants appointed by me in consultation with the Auditor-General.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money in the Fitrah Fund is invested as fixed deposits with accredited banks. Since the inception of the MUIS, the yearly interest earned from the fixed deposits are used to pay the salaries of staff employed by the MUIS to attend to Fitrah collections. Their annual salaries, including CPF contributions amount to approximately $91,000. These staff, consisting of a Financial Officer and clerks, attend to the registration of "Amils" (Fitrah collectors), "fakir" and "miskin" (poor and needy), collection of Fitrah, distribution of Fitrah, etc. Besides attending to matters relating to Fitrah collection and distribution, these officers oversee the day-to-day administration of the Wakaff (endowment) accounts, Mosque Building Fund accounts, "Zakat harta" (Muslim property tax) accounts and the "Bait-ul-mal" (General Endowment Fund) accounts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUIS has plans to use part of the money in the Fitrah Fund for 2 major projects for the benefit of Muslims. The 2 projects are -
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>(a) Mosque Building Programme</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUIS, in consultation with the Ministry and the Housing and Development Board, feel that it is necessary to speed up the mosque building programme to cater for the religious needs of Muslims who are resettled in new towns. It has, therefore, decided to advance the completion dates of the mosques to be built in Woodlands and Bedok/Chai Chee from 1981 to 1979 or early 1980. It has also decided that it is necessary to build a mosque in Ang Mo Kio New Town by 1980 under Phase I of the Mosque Building Fund Scheme since a large number of Muslims would be living in this New Town. To ensure the availability of funds for the accelerated mosque building programme, the MUIS has agreed in principle to advance a sum of $1.3 million, interest- free, from its Fitrah and Baitul-mal Accounts for the Mosque Building Fund Scheme. The advance will be repaid from subsequent collections made under the Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>(b) Multi-purpose Muslim Religious Centre</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MUIS has proposed the building of a Multi-purpose Muslim Religious Centre for the benefit of Muslims. The Centre will be built on a 1,999 sq metre (21,518 sq ft) site behind Masjid Muhajirin at Toa Payoh. The MUIS is consulting the Housing and Development Board architects regarding the design of the Centre. The Centre will have a multi-purpose hall with seating capacity for at least 500 persons, dormitories, including a hostel for foreign visitors, a library, office space and caretaker's quarters. The MUIS Council has agreed to spend $500,000- $600,000 on the construction of the Centre. This sum excludes cost of land and professional fees. The cost of this Centre will be met from funds in the Fitrah and Baitul-mal Accounts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to establish a Muslim Education Fund is not necessary because, yearly, the MUIS has been allocating part of the Fitrah collections as bursaries for deserving Muslim students. Although the quantum of each bursary varies according to the awardee's financial background and whether he is receiving financial assistance from other sources, the recommended quantum per bursary for university undergraduates is $1,000 per annum, and for post-graduate students, the quantum per bursary is $1,500 per annum.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may wish to know that during the years 1975-1977, the MUIS distributed $110,300, $93,250 and $98,480 respectively as bursaries for deserving Muslim students. Of this, $65,100 (59%) in 1975, $58,600 (62.8%) in 1976 and $58,000 (58.9%) in 1977 were given to deserving Muslims for their tertiary education. This year, the MUIS has set aside $100,000 for bursaries. Of this, the MUIS has earmarked $54,500 (54.5%) for deserving Muslims pursuing tertiary education. The $54,500 is for 50 bursaries at $1,000 per bursary for undergraduate students and 3 bursaries at $1,500 for post-graduate students.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the substantial annual allocation of funds by the MUIS to assist deserving Muslims in their tertiary education, it is not necessary to establish a Muslim Education Foundation as proposed. It will be a duplication of the bursary scheme implemented by the MUIS since 1969.
