<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Passenger traffic and fares)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Communications (a) what was the average monthly  number

of  bus  commuters prior to the recent increase in  bus

fares;  (b)  what was the number of commuters  for  the

first  month  after  the increase;  (c)  what  was  the

increased  net  profit  of the  Singapore  Bus  Service

(Private)  Limited for that month; and  (d)  basing  on

this  figure  of net profit as an average  monthly  net

profit,  if  the  company  will  meet  its  budget,  as

assessed  prior to the implementation of the  increased

fares,  to replace old buses, to provide other benefits

for its workers, etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I regret to inform the hon. Member for

Anson that neither the Singapore Bus Service Ltd., the

Registry of Vehicles nor the Mass Transit Study Unit

maintain statistics on the actual number of bus

commuters at any one time. The closest estimate

regarding passenger traffic handled would be through

the number of tickets sold and daily collections made.

As many as 1.75 million tickets may be sold per day,

ROV is at present collecting statistics on the

breakdown of fares collected by the SBS, but due to the

large amount of data involved it will take some time

before the figures are available. I am glad to announce

however, that the Mass Transit Study Unit is at present

engaged in a Bus Passenger Count Survey to supplement

the data collected by ROV. It is estimated that the

survey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



which began in January this year will be completed by

end of May.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the basis of unaudited figures

submitted by SBS of the fares collected for the period

15th January to 9th February, 1974 (26 days) before the

increase in fares, the average daily fare takings

arrived at was $268,187. Between 10th February up to

7th March, 1974, for a similar period of 26 days after

the bus fare increase became effective, the average

daily fare takings rose to $349,140 or an increase of

30 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of just one month's operations after the

increase in bus fares, it is somewhat early to talk of

profits. One may, however, venture to say that with the

increased takings SBS should be able to cope with its

increasing expenditure for 1974-75 and to carry out its

programme to replace its old buses in accordance with

the requirements of the Ministry, provide for better

benefits for workers and generally to improve the

standard of its services, hereafter.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, can the Minister

promise that there will be no further increase of

fares?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with all the best

possible will in the world, that promise cannot be made

because the bus company runs on oil fuel and that is

not within our control. As everybody knows, the whole

world waits to hear whether the oil prices will be

increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I want to know whether the

profits of the bus company by that time will be reduced

or increased.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I cannot proceed further on

that matter. If there are any details which the Member

would like to ask, I will be pleased to supply.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if

it is too early to talk about profits, then I would

like to talk about losses. Will the Hon. Minister for

Communications authorise bus fare



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



increases each time the bus owners put their hands up

in horror and say that they have made losses? And since

the bus owners know that the Government is most

unwilling to operate the bus service lest it has to

subsidise the operations, will the Hon. Minister assure

us that he will not be taken for a ride? How do we know

that he has not been taken for a ride by the SBS? This

is a test question, as further questions have yet to

come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Hon. Minister inform us whether the SBS is the

only business concern, most unfortunately a private

monopoly controlling a public service under its wing,

which is privileged by Government intervention to wipe

off operating losses and to raise capital at the

public's expense? Profits, virtually, guaranteed quite

a risk-free business, is this not fortunate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, that is a long-winded statement

rather than a question because most of the questions

posed have already been answered. The Member is just

repeating himself.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I

develop on the question raised by the Member for Anson?

I am not happy with the reply given by the Minister

when he said that further rises in fares would depend

on a subsequent rise in oil prices. I think he must

have read the newspaper report -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your supplementary question, Dr

Ong?



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> My question is this. I do not think

that bus fares should be dependent so much upon

international oil prices. There are other

considerations besides the price of oil, and I maintain

that we should not just use the price of oil as a

reason for any further hikes in bus fares. Will the

Minister please comment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, apparently the Member did not

follow my oral answers. It has already been indicated

that the Government is not going to allow a bus fare

revision without making



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



sure that the management of the company is able to

account for its revenue and expenditure to the

satisfaction of the Government. So it does not

necessarily follow that the company is allowed to

revise the bus fares by just putting hands up, as

alleged by the Member for Kallang. They `have to

justify it. It is too early now to talk of further bus

fare increases when the new fares have just operated

for only one month.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, will the Minister be

able to say whether there has been any effect on the

takings of the SBS because of the operation of the

supplementary transport service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I think there has been some effect

on the takings of the SBS as a result of the

inauguration of the supplementary bus transport

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in that case, does the

Minister not think that such competition will spur the

SBS into making a better provision for its service? And

the result should be that the Minister might consider

giving more encouragement to this supplementary

transport service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> When we launched the supplementary

public transport service, we did say that we would

issue as many as 1,000 licences, of which 600 would be

for school buses and 400 for lorries. The number of

applications that have been received and approved was

about 300. So another 700 licences could still he

issued, provided the applicants would send in their

applications.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Prosecutions for smoky buses)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  the number of prosecutions  during  the

four   months  from  November  1973  to  February  1974

inclusive  against the Singapore Bus Service  (Private)

Limited



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



for  using  buses emitting smoke beyond the permissible

limit on public roads; and the combined figures for the

component  companies  of  the  Singapore  Bus   Service

(Private) Limited for the corresponding periods  during

the five years before the amalgamation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

mention that statistics on the number of cases of buses

emitting  excessive  smoke  are  kept  by  the  Traffic

Police,  of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and  not  the

Registry of Vehicles. Unfortunately, as statistics  for

such  cases  prior to April 1970 (i.e.,  start  of  the

three-year  White Paper plan for the reorganisation  of

the Motor Transport Service of Singapore) were not kept

separately,  it  would  be necessary  for  the  Traffic

Police  to manually run through their records of  every

case  of  all traffic offences to obtain the statistics

prior  to April 1970. I therefore regret I am not  able

to   provide  statistics  for  five  years   prior   to

amalgamation, as requested by the Member for Kallang at

present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, from the statistics made available by the

Traffic Police the number of SBS buses booked for smoky

exhausts  for the four months since it began operations

in  November  last year, as compared to the  number  of

buses of the three former bus companies booked for  the

same offence between April 1970 and October 1973, is as

follows:-



<pre>

 Number of Buses Booked:



                                    3 Former

 Period                                Bus         SBS

 (4th months)                       Companies



 November 1973 - February 1974                    1,247

 July 1973 - October 1973             1,500

 March 1973 - June 1973               1,029

 November 1972 - February 1973          585

 July 1972 - October 1972               672

 March 1972 - June 1972               1,119

 November 1971 - February 1972          984

 July 1971 - October 1971               853

 March 1971 - June 1971                 527

 November 1970 - February 1971          454

 July 1970 - October 1970               470

 April 1970 - June 1970                 961

   (3 months only)

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are statistics of the number of buses booked,

which include those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



cases  where action is pending, those where composition

has  been  offered  but not yet accepted,  those  where

composition  has been offered and accepted,  and  those

which  have been prosecuted. I believe the Member wants

the  number  of  prosecutions. The Traffic  Police  are

unable  to  give the figures of those cases which  have

been prosecuted only. However, SBS itself has on record

that,  from  November last year to February this  year,

they  were  prosecuted on six occasions  and  paid  out

$54,465 in composition for smoky exhausts.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Sir, my question is on policy, and

policy  is  normally the same over a  period  of  time.

Therefore, I wish to take the Minister back  to  memory

lane,  a little way back in time. With your permission,

Sir,  may  I  just quote a little from  the  Government

White Paper (Cmd. 21 of 1970) to assist the Minister in

his reply to my question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On 31st March, 1970, the Prime Minister launched an

all-out  Anti-pollution  Campaign,  which  inter  alia,

aimed  at  eradication of the smoky exhausts  of  motor

vehicles.  As  this  drive will have  many  significant

repercussions,  including the jacking-up  not  only  of

standards  of performance and maintenance  of  vehicles

but a general overhaul of the public transport services

now existing, this Anti-pollution drive can be regarded

as   being  the  starting  point  for  the  first  ever

comprehensive  reorganisation of  the  motor  transport

service of Singapore.'



<br><br>So I would like to know what has gone foul. The air has

gone foul, I know. Bus service has also gone foul. When

will the second campaign begin in earnest?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The answer, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

the first campaign is still on.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> But who could believe that the

campaign is still on?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Encik Aziz, next question.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUS SERVICE LIMITED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Unroadworthy buses)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  how  many buses of  the  Singapore  Bus

Service  (Private)  Limited  were  certified   as   not

roadworthy  and their use considered dangerous  to  the

general  public,  the passengers, the drivers  and  the

conductors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all public service

vehicles,  including  buses, are  required  to  undergo

inspection by the Registry of Vehicles (ROV) once every

six  months.  They  are summoned  for  such  inspection

according to a schedule drawn up by the ROV.  At  these

half-yearly  inspections, the following  are  the  main

items checked: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Steering;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Brakes;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Lighting;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Tyres;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Exhaust;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Chassis, Body and Suspension

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Engine and Transmission

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Accessories - e.g, rear view mirror, windscreen wiper, horn, speedometer;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) General - e.g, impending failure of the vehicle or

any of its equipment or fittings, condition of seating,

paint work, bodywork and general condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any bus which does not meet the minimum standards at

these  inspections  is required  to  have  the  defects

rectified  and  be  presented again for  re-inspection.

There  have  been  instances  of  buses  having  to  be

presented several times for re-inspection before  being

certified  fit  for use on the road.  Sometimes,  buses

with serious defects are ordered to be scrapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Singapore Bus Service Ltd, began operations

in November last year and is a carry-over of operations

from  the three bus companies, a total of 1,047 of  its

buses  were  scheduled by the ROV for  the  half-yearly

inspections



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



up  to  the end of last month, February. Of these,  778

buses passed the inspections and were certified fit. Of

the other 269, about 215 did not appear for inspection.

This  sometimes happens when a bus is undergoing repair

or overhaul. In such cases, the ROV usually summons the

bus  for inspection again after one month. About 7  per

cent  of  these buses which were summoned and  appeared

for  inspection did not pass for a variety of  defects.

The  owners were required to have the defects rectified

and  to  present them again for reinspection.  None  of

SBS's  buses  has, since 1st November last  year,  been

found   by  the  ROV  at  the  inspections  to  be   so

unroadworthy that they had to be scrapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated, however, that 107 buses out of a

total  registered fleet of 2,081 under the name of  SBS

are officially laid-up, i.e, these 107 buses or 5.1 per

cent  are  taken off the roads because they are  either

unroadworthy  due to being badly damaged beyond  repair

or  have exceeded the permissible age limit for  public

buses.  They  will  be replaced under  the  replacement

programme  of  400 buses within three  years  from  1st

November, 1973.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, if I am to rely on

statistics,  there  will  be hardly  any  supplementary

questions.  Anyway,  what is the  explanation  for  the

frequency of buses falling apart and condemned  to  the

yard?  Will  the Minister for Communications  bear  the

consequences  of  allowing  unroadworthy  vehicles   on

public roads, or will it be the ROV?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, explanation has already been

given  as to the reasons why SBS would appear to be  in

difficulties and the efforts that are being made to put

them right. It is no use for the Member for Kallang  to

repeat this matter over and over again.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Sir, one last supplementary

question,  as public safety is of great importance.  Is

there  a list of authorised private motor workshops  or

repairers which the SBS can patronise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



for  mechanical inspections of its buses,  in  lieu  of

inspection   by   the  ROV?  And  is  this   the   most

satisfactory arrangement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Once again, Mr Speaker, Sir, oral

answers have been given to the hon. Member in which  it

has  been  indicated  that SBS  invited  private  motor

repairers to deal with the buses. So I think  I  should

leave it to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, may I make this

point  for  the benefit of hon. Members? The Government

does  not  wish to be a protector of the Singapore  Bus

Service  Ltd.  It is put to the task of explaining  the

difficulties  of  SBS, because we have  afforded  it  a

licence.  And because we have afforded it a licence,  a

certain rise in the rates of bus fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members feel that the matter should be more

thoroughly debated because they are not satisfied  with

just answers to supplementary questions, then I suggest

that  they  put  down a formal motion  for  a  thorough

debate  on  the problems of public transport.  I  would

urge  this  course because this obviously is a  subject

which not only concerns hon. Members of this House  but

also  the people who buy 11 million tickets every  day.

It may be 500,000 or 700,000 people who travel on these

buses.  Perhaps that may be a more satisfactory way  of

dealing with the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to give the Member for Kallang this

advice.  If  he  thinks that SBS is  such  a  good  buy

because   it   is  guaranteed  8  per  cent   with   no

entrepreneurial risk, I suggest he buys into  SBS.  The

Government  is  unwilling. The Member for  Kallang  can

raise the funds and buy into SBS.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, in due course of time, I

shall   move   a  motion.  I  am  now  only   gathering

information  on  how  the SBS is  run  and  how  it  is

supervised by the ROV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me inform this House that I am an

ordinary worker, and there is no question of my  buying

the SBS,

and also my financial status.

<div align="center"><b>(Reasons for delay)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Communications the reasons that account  for  the  long

delay  in the licensing of goods-carrying vehicles  for

road  use, and whether he will direct the Registrar  of

Vehicles   to   speed   up  the  processing   of   such

applications  in  order  to  avoid  shortage  of   such

vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there should be no

delay  on  the  part  of the Registry  of  Vehicles  in

licensing goods vehicles, if the proper document,  i.e.

the  weight  certificate  of  the  goods  vehicle,   is

available  to  determine its maximum laden  weight  for

purpose  of  registration. Unfortunately,  such  proper

documents  are  not  available for a  large  number  of

imported  used  or re-conditioned goods  vehicles.  For

such  cases, the ROV has requested the local  agent  to

check   these  vehicles  against  their  manufacturers'

specifications  and  to issue a  certificate  which  is

acceptable   for   registration.   For   the   services

performed, a fee of $100 for each vehicle inspected  is

levied by the agent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since March, 1973, the agent has issued 987 such

certificates for goods vehicles inspected by  them.  In

addition,  ROV  has, since August, 1973,  accepted  152

goods vehicles for registration based on the submission

of  an  extract of registration particulars or  plating

certificate  from  the country of  origin.  The  latter

measure  was  undertaken to expedite  the  registration

process.  As at 9th March, 1974, the number of vehicles

on  the  waiting list for issue of maximum laden weight

certificate by the agent is 227. It has been  estimated

that  the  agent  could issue up to 20  certificates  a

week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated that on 28th March last year, the

Registrar  of  Vehicles did inform  representatives  of

leading  importers of used goods vehicles of  the  need

for  proper  documents to support the registration  and

licensing of such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



vehicles.  Having  these  proper  documents  means  the

importers need not depend on the certificate issued  by

the  agent  and  the  registration process  could  then

proceed without any delay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

first supplementary question is: should we not let  the

importers  know in all such cases that they should  try

to  get  the  weight  certificate from  the  suppliers?

Secondly,  if  the checking is being  done  by  private

firms,  how do we ensure that there is no irregularity,

and that all applications are processed on the basis of

first  come first served? Because I have heard of cases

where  people  who  apply  later  have  yet  got  their

certificates earlier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I have already explained, Mr

Speaker, Sir, that importers have been told to get  the

proper documents. If they fail to, whoever buys  it  is

just  asking  for  delay  and  trouble.  If  there  are

instances where the applications were delayed, although

they  were  put in much earlier but were not  certified

till  much  later, I would appreciate it if the  Member

would  report  such  known cases to  the  Registrar  of

Vehicles for an investigation to be made.

and  how  many of them have been resited; (b) how  many

cases  are still under consideration; and (c) if  those

hawkers  affected at development sites will be  granted

are completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister for the Environment):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  there are a total of 32,141  registered

hawkers. Of this number, 25,915 hawkers are licensed by

the  Ministry of the Environment, 6,001 are  under  the

register of the Housing and Development Board, and  the

rest  by  PSA, JTC, and others. Of the 32,000  hawkers,

about 14,800 are in markets,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



hawker  centres  and other premises. The  rest  are  in

pitches at roadsides, backlanes and vacant lots.  Since

the  construction of new hawker centres by the Ministry

of  the  Environment,  470  street  hawkers  have  been

resited by the Ministry and more will be resited in due

course as new hawker centres are ready.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent licensing exercise of bona fide hawkers,

8,264 applications were considered, of which 7,457 were

issued  with  new licences and 807 were rejected,  i.e.

less  than 10 per cent were rejected as they  were  not

bona  fide  hawkers. There are still  17  appeal  cases

under consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of hawkers affected by development,

our  policy  and that of 1-1DB is to give  priority  to

those   bona   fide   hawkers  who  are   affected   by

development. They are either resited temporarily on  an

alternative site or moved into another hawker centre if

there is vacancy.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question is

this:  will  the  hawkers affected  by  development  be

granted alternative site or not? That is what I want to

know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last part of

my  answer, I have clearly stated that they are  either

resited  temporarily on an alternative  site  or  moved

into another hawker centre if there is vacancy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government  is  doing a wonderful job in  resiting  the

hawkers  into various hawker centres. I wonder  if  the

Minister realises that the hawkers at Alkaff Avenue  in

Potong  Pasir  should  be  resited,  because  they  are

selling  their goods at reasonable prices and they  are

well supported by members of the community.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the Member's question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> The question is, will these hawkers be put

into hawker centres, or whether a hawker centre will be

built at Alkaff Avenue in Potong Pasir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know what

is  the intention of the hon. Member. But as far as the

Hawker's Department is concerned, the position has been

regularised by now, i.e, most of the hawkers have  been

issued  with licences to hawk at allocated  places.  In

the  case  of the place which the Member has  mentioned

unless   the  hawkers  are  affected  by  redevelopment

projects,  I do not think the Hawkers' Department  will

disturb  them,  unless there is a good reason  for  the

Member to suggest resiting them to any other place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, most certainly, because

hawking  does  affect the environment  in  the  present

place in which the hawkers are situated.

<div align="center"><b>(Construction costs)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Encik Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development (a) what is the total cost  to

date for the construction of bus shelters and bus bays;

(b) what is the current value of the lands on which bus

shelters and bus bays have been constructed; and (c) if

in  future expenditure of public funds for the  purpose

of  constructing bus shelters and bus bays will only be

incurred  when  the Government has direct  or  indirect

rights and interests in the bus services.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total cost of the

construction of bus shelters and bus bays for the seven

years  from  1967 to 1973 was $2,312,000. I  am  afraid

that records prior to 1967 are not available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current values of lands vary considerably between

urban, sub-urban and rural areas, and also from site to

site. It is, therefore, not easy to calculate the  land

values  for  the  420 bus bays and 1,480  bus  shelters

which  now exist. Bus bays are provided to prevent  the

traffic  flow from being disrupted by buses waiting  at

bus  stops, whilst bus shelters are constructed for the

convenience and protection of bus commuters. These  are

services which Government will continue to provide.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the Hon.

Minister for Law and National Development consider such

expenditure of public funds as a subsidy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I do not think so, unless the Member

himself  thinks so. It is not only the buses  that  use

the  roads but also other vehicles like taxis,  private

vehicles  and lorries. As for bus bays, if  there  were

none,  there will be more traffic jams, and  passengers

waiting to board the bus, particularly school children,

are  in fact better protected when there is a bus  bay.

And  as for bus shelters, surely the Member for Kallang

does not want his constituents or my constituents to be

exposed to the sun and rain?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the suggestion is that we should charge the bus

company  the  cost of bus bays and bus  shelters,  this

might  get them into further trouble and, as  it  were,

perhaps  lead to their bankruptcy. But it has not  been

the  policy  of Government to charge the  bus  company.

There is a little history behind it because there  were

so  many bus companies before, but now there is one. In

the  same way, we do not charge taxis for parking at  a

taxi stand.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is it not common

practice for a profit-making enterprise to provide,  at

its  own expense, the necessary infrastructure for  its

business operations?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, but in their own premises and for

their  own  equipment. However, these bus shelters  are

not  necessarily  used only by persons  who  board  the

buses.  There is nothing to prevent any of the  Members

here  taking shelter at a bus shelter. But, of  course,

if  anyone  parks  at a bus bay, then  he  will  be  in

trouble.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

impressed  with  the reply given by  the  Minister  for

National Development. However, will he agree with me if

I say that we are, in fact, not constructing enough bus

shelters  and  bus  bays  for the  convenience  of  the

public? Will he, therefore, give an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



assurance   that  this  Government  will  continue   to

construct more bus bays and bus shelters?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I can assure the Member that more and

more bus shelters and bus bays will be built. As I have

pointed out, in the last seven or eight years more than

$2  million have been spent on them. More will be spent

this  year  and in the coming years. But as the  Member

realises, there are priorities for other projects,  and

if he can impress on the Minister for Finance that more

money  should be provided for this purpose, I  will  be

happy to build more bus shelters and bus bays.



<br><br><!-- Encik Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Abdul Aziz:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must congratulate

the  Hon.  Minister  for Law and National  Development.

That  is the best answer I have received so far. If  it

is just for the SBS -objection. Otherwise he is free to

build  as  many  bus shelters as he wants  to  for  the

convenience of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Kent):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

speaking  of  subsidy,  I  was  wondering  whether  the

Minister  would  consider requiring  statutory  bodies,

such  as the Housing and Development Board, the  Jurong

Town Corporation, as well as private estate developers,

to  erect bus shelters within their respective  estates

at  their  own  expense  in the same  manner  as  these

developers  are required to construct roads  which  are

subsequently taken over by the Public Works Department.

Does  the Minister not agree that his Ministry will  be

able  to  assist in improving the level of services  of

public transport by requiring these developers, which I

have  included the statutory bodies as well, to provide

the supporting facilities for public transport?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is certainly a matter that will be

considered  at  least  by the Housing  and  Development

Board; I do not know about the Jurong Town Corporation.

But  at  the  moment the Housing and Development  Board

itself is providing termini for buses, and it pays  for

them. This suggestion is only taking the matter a  step

further.

them  when they retire front service. This priority  is

not  accorded to employees of the institutes of  higher

them.   Apart   from  the  University   of   Singapore,

institutes of higher learning also include the  Nanyang

University,   Ngee  Ann  Technical  College   and   the

Singapore  Polytechnic. It would not  be  advisable  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir (a) For the four-year

period  from 20th March, 1970 (when the law  came  into

effect)  to  30th June, 1973 (when the most  up-to-date

figures  are  available), a total of  10,795  abortions

10 per cent of births envisaged at the time the Act was

passed. The breakdown figures are:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,237 were married women; and 558 were unmarried women.

<div align="center"><b>(Action for violation of traffic regulations)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Health

and  Home  Affairs how action is taken against vehicles

displaying non-Singapore licence plates which are found

breaking traffic regulations; and what course of action

is  taken when a report from a member of the public  is

received against such vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, action by the

Traffic   Police   against  vehicles  displaying   non-Singapore   licence   plates  which   violate   traffic

regulations depends on the following circumstances:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Whether the driver is stopped on the spot by a

Police Officer;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Whether the driver of the vehicle is a Singapore

resident; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Whether the offence is compoundable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the driver's identity is established on the spot

and he is not a Singapore resident, then he will:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) be brought to either the Traffic Police Station in

Maxwell  Road  or  the  Bukit  Panjang  Police  Station

depending on where the offence is committed. He will be

brought  to the nearest of these two stations  to  have

the  offence or offences compounded provided  they  are

compoundable offences;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) if the offence or offences are non-compoundable,

then  he will be arrested and charged in Court  at  the

earliest opportunity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the driver of the vehicle is a Singapore resident

he will be reported and prosecuted in the usual way for

the  offence committed. However, under section 6(2)  of

the Road Traffic Act:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person who is a resident of Singapore shall

possess  or use a motor vehicle in respect of  which  a

licence  authorising  its use is first  issued  outside

Singapore  after the 30th day of May, 1966, until  such

fees   as  are  prescribed  have  been  paid   to   the

Registrar.'



<br><br>A  Singapore  resident  caught  using  a  non-Singapore

registered  vehicle  therefore will,  in  addition,  be

prosecuted under section 6(2) as aforementioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a report is made by a member of the public of

traffic infringements against vehicles displaying  non-Singapore licence plates, such reports will be referred

to  the  officer-in-charge of the Bukit Panjang  Police

Station. He will have the numbers of the vehicle put on

a  "Stop  List" at the Woodlands Checkpoint.  When  the

vehicle is stopped at this Checkpoint, the driver would

be  referred  to the Bukit Panjang Police Station.  The

procedure  would be the same as though the  driver  was

stopped on the spot by a Police Officer. However, there

are  occasions when a warning would suffice for drivers

who have committed minor traffic infringements. This is

left  solely  to  the discretion of  the  reporting  or

compounding officer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong is assured that action is always

taken against vehicles displaying non-Singapore licence

plates  which  violate traffic regulations irrespective

of whether the driver is a Singapore resident or a non-Singapore resident.

the Working committee on the Metric Daching, the Office

together  with  representatives of  the  various  other

relevant departments have been studying the feasibility

of  introducing  a  metric daching. Similarly,  on  the

Packaging  Committee, the Office is  assisting  in  the

study  of  the  rationalisation and standardisation  of

prepacked  commodities. Thus, the Office is principally

responsible  for  protecting  the  consumers  from  any

cheating  in weights and measures that the  traders  or

the industry may resort to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Weights and Measures Office re-verified

some  35,000 weights, measures and instruments used  in

the  retail trade. It was also directly involved in the

metrication  exercise  of some 1,400  units  of  petrol

dispensing pumps at retail outlets. The Office had also

stepped  up,  towards the end of last year, inspections

on  sales  of food items to check profiteering  through

short  weight.  The present campaign  of  regular  spot

checks  on bakeries, for example, is being carried  out

by  officers from the Weights and Measures Office. Last

year   a   total  of  89  summonses  were  issued   for

contravention of the Weights and Measures Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be mentioned that the Department of Trade is at

present   also  reviewing  the  Act  with  a  view   to

introducing   more   effective  legislation   for   the

protection of consumers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, can the Minister inform the House

whether  he  has  enough staff to man the  Weights  and

Measures Unit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I believe the Weights and

Measures  Office  has  the  staff  necessary  for   the

functions that I have already described. But  if  there

should be need for additional staff, then they will  be

considered in the usual way.

<div align="center"><b>ANTI-INFLATIONARY COMMITTEE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Powers and functions)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b>: asked the Minister for

Finance  who  are  the members of the anti-inflationary

committee  formed  within his Ministry;  what  are  the

powers  and functions of this committee; what  sums  of

money  have  been  set aside for this committee's  use;

what  this committee has done since its inception;  and

how many members of the public make representations  to

this committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of

Finance  Anti-Inflationary Committee is  headed  by  my

Permanent  Secretary (Development Division). The  other

members  of this Committee are officers drawn from  the

Development  Division,  the Department  of  Trade,  the

Economic  Development Board and the Monetary  Authority

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee can take action against blatant acts of

profiteering under powers conferred by the  Control  of

Essential  Supplies Act and the Price Control  Act,  as

well as other legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's main functions are, first, to watch

closely  price  increases,  particularly  in  essential

commodities  and, second, to plan and take measures  to

keep down inflation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need for any special sum to be set aside

for the use of the Committee, as any expenditure can be

covered by ordinary Ministry and Departmental votes  in

the  Estimates.  If  necessary,  these  votes  can   be

supplemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has already taken a number of measures

to  dampen  rising  prices. It has  increased  interest

rates  on deposits and loans so that some of the excess

money  can  be  withdrawn  from  circulation  and   the

purchasing power which is pushing up prices is reduced.

It   has  trimmed  increases  in  Government  recurrent

expenditure,  where  possible. It  has  removed  and/or

reduced import tariffs to lower costs to importers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>



and prices to consumers. It has taken steps  to

diversify  the sources of supply of essential  imports,

ensuring more stable supplies at lower costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Committee's guidance, the Department of

Trade  has  been  conducting  regular  inspections   to

prevent trade malpractices. In the case of two bakeries

giving  short-weight bread, it has  subjected  them  to

public exposure and obloquy. It has supplied the  daily

list  of  quoted prices of essential commodities  as  a

service  to  consumers who can compare the prices  they

are  paying against those quoted and, therefore,  avoid

further  exploitation by unscrupulous traders.  Efforts

are  continually  being made to consolidate  the  anti-profiteering  programme  of the  Committee.  After  the

warning phase, the Committee will move next to punitive

action  in  prosecution or cancellation of licences  or

restrictions in supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public can make representations to the

Committee  through the Department of  Trade.  In  fact,

about  200  to  300  members of the  public  have  been

approaching  this  Department daily seeking  advice  on

prices   and   availability  of  supply  of   essential

commodities  or furnishing information on  profiteering

activities  of traders. The Department also deals  with

complaints  addressed by members of the public  to  the

Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE), and  passed

on to it for necessary action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, can the Minister tell us when this

Committee was first formed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am not able to tell the Member

the  exact  date,  but it was formed  probably  in  the

middle of last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, in order to make

this  Committee more effective and more representative,

will the Minister consider expanding this Committee  to

include  representatives from interested parties,  like

CASE,  and possibly Members of this House, such as  the

Members for Katong and Potong Pasir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if they feel that

they  can  make some contribution, we would be prepared

to  co-opt them on matters in which we think they would

be  of  help. But generally some of the measures  which

are  being discussed may relate to legislation  or  may

relate,  in the case of measures for control  of  money

supply, to what may be confidential until they are made

public.  I  do  not think it would be possible  in  all

cases to bring them into this Committee.

For  convenience, I shall take the totals for each head

of   expenditure   in  the  Main  Estimates   and   the

Development Estimates as they appear in the  fifth  and

sixth  columns respectively of the Summary of Estimated

Expenditure on pages 49 and 50 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I draw the attention of hon. Members to the

Statement which appears at the bottom of page 47 of the

Paper? The totals in respect of the Main Estimates  for

the two Heads AA



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>



"Civil  List  for  the President  of  the  Republic  of

Singapore" and AB "Statutory Expenditure" are not to be

voted,  and I shall, therefore, not take those  totals.

Further, the total amount to be voted in respect of the

Main  Estimates is $1,943,129,650 and not  the  sum  of

$2,299,475,460 shown on page

50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which amendments stand in the Order  Paper

Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head BC --



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head BC in

respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point of this amendment is to seek

clarification on the question of production  of  annual

reports by statutory bodies constituting a group on the

one hand and departments of the Ministries making up  a

group  on the other. I am aware, Sir, that in the  case

of  statutory  bodies, such as the  Port  of  Singapore

Authority, and so on, such bodies which are established

by   statutes   have  incorporated  in   the   statutes

provisions  which  require the  compilation  of  annual

reports  and  the submission of these  reports  to  the

relevant  Ministers  and  subsequently  to  Parliament.

However,  not  all  Acts incorporate  such  provisions.

There  are  some  Acts establishing  certain  statutory

bodies  which  have, for some reason or other,  omitted

such  provisions, and therefore these statutory  bodies

are   not   compiling  annual  reports  nor  are   they

submitting such reports to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the other group comprising departments in the

Ministries,  these departments, I would presume,  would

be  directed  by a proper authority in so  far  as  the

compilation and submission of reports are concerned. Of

about  60  departments in the various  ministries  from

which  reports  may be expected, only 23 are  producing

reports  at  the  moment. And of  the  23  reports,  18

finally   arrived   at  Parliament   and   subsequently

circulated to Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek the compulsory production of these reports

both  by  the statutory bodies and departments  in  the

Ministries.  Apart from the fact that Parliament  votes

monies  directly  to  departments  in  Ministries   and

indirectly  to  statutory bodies through  contributions

and  loans, I think the convenient availability of such

reports  in the Parliament Library would assist Members

in  making  a  thorough examination of  Main  Estimates

during Budget sessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that I wish to touch on is not

actually for the purpose of securing an answer from the

Minister.  It is rather for the purpose of securing  an

effect  in  the  nature of reporting of proceedings  in

Parliament  by  the  daily  newspaper  in  the  English

language. Examination of Main and Development Estimates

for  the new fiscal year takes place only once  a  year

during  Budget,  and Backbenchers  regard  this  as  an

opportunity  to  express the views of the  constituents

and  their own views upon aspects of Government policy.

It  is  natural,  therefore, that  Backbenchers  expect

their  views  and criticism of Government  policies  to

appear  in an English language daily newspaper that  is

reporting proceedings in Parliament. However, it is  my

view  that  there does not appear to be  an  indication

that  there  will be fair and sufficient  reporting  of

proceedings   in   Parliament.  I  am  concerned   that

Backbenchers receive adequate reporting in the  English

language newspaper daily, at least in the few  days  to

come  when  the  Main  and  Development  Estimates  are

debated  in  Parliament. Backbenchers,  in  the  Budget

sessions taken once a year, certainly hope to show  the

people  that  they  can carry the  people's  views  and

arguments  to Government through Parliament.  It  is  a

pity  if  the indications are that this opportunity  is

going  to be stifled on the one hand by a large  number

of  advertisements in the pages of the newspaper  which

reports proceedings in Parliament, and on the other  by

what   I   think  is  an  excessively  disproportionate

reporting  of the Government in its pages. I feel  that

there  is one whole year for Government policies to  be

reported quite adequately,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>



whereas there is only one Budget session in a year when

the  views  of  Backbenchers on aspects  of  Government

policies may be reported.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first deal with the

Member's  remarks on the press? All I can say  is  that

whatever  a Member says here is properly and accurately

reported  in  Hansard. They can make their  corrections

before publication. As for the press, we do not control

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for annual reports, the position is this: in the

case  of  statutory boards, the requirement to  publish

annual  reports  and  to table them  in  Parliament  is

provided  for  in the statute setting up the  statutory

board  itself.  In  the case of reports  of  Government

Ministries  and departments, this has been  customarily

handled  administratively.  The  decision  whether   to

publish  and table such reports in Parliament  lies  at

the discretion of the Permanent Secretary, who no doubt

consults his Minister when in doubt. I propose to  read

an  extract from the Manual of Administrative Procedure

XV, paragraph 18:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The order of the Permanent Secretary will be obtained

in  case  of a department annual report on whether  the

report is to be printed and published and whether it is

to be tabled before Parliament.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member wants all reports to come to Parliament.

This  means  a  considerable  effort  on  the  part  of

Ministries  and  departments to write  up  reports  and

leave copies in the Parliament Library. The question is

whether  this is worthwhile. I doubt it.  Where  it  is

considered  that the contents of a departmental  report

are  of a general public interest, the practice  is  to

print,  publish and table. Where, however, the  reports

are mainly statistical information, which in many cases

are already reproduced in the Statistical Year Book, or

where the report of a department or Ministry is already

in  the  Year Book, then the printing, publication  and

tabling  in Parliament of such reports is not done,  as

it  would  mean unnecessary duplication  and  waste  of

public funds for they really serve no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



useful  purpose.  Where the report of a  department  or

Ministry  is  of a confidential nature, of course,  the

report  is  not published. I refer to the  Ministry  of

Defence  and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Perhaps

this  is  the  reason why they are not  asked  so  many

questions in Parliament!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure Members that annual reports of departments

and  Ministries hitherto published will continue to  be

published, but every attempt must be made to have  them

printed soon after the close of the year covered by the

report.  In  the  past we have reports filed  in  three

years  after the year in which it was due, and I myself

have had to take up this question with many departments

in  my Ministry -- that it is pointless publishing last

year's report in 1979!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude by telling the Member that if he wishes

a   particular  department's  report  at  present   not

published  for  general information, he can  raise  the

matter with the Minister concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I certainly welcome the Minister's

suggestion, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment in

view of the Minister's reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,724,660 for Head BC ordered to stand

part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head CA --



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head CA be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead BA 1109*. (* The same amendment  also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is moved in order to seek

clarification  in  respect of the Anti-Pollution  Unit.

When  the Unit was first set up in 1971, I spoke during

the  Budget  Debate, as reported in Hansard,  Vol.  30,

col. 789, welcoming the setting up of such a Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time it was not very clear as to which

Ministry would be responsible for such a Unit.  I  also

had my reservations about several Ministries or departments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>



being   agencies  responsible  for  enforcement

action.  In  1971,  the  Ministry  of  Health,  Police.

Registry  of Vehicles, as well as the Port of Singapore

Authority,  were  responsible for  enforcement  of  the

various anti-pollution measures. I asked if it was  not

possible  for the Anti-Pollution Unit to  be  made  the

sole authority for the enforcement of the various anti-pollution measures. Since then the Unit has been set up

and  has been under the Prime Minister's Office.  Since

last   year  we  have  set  up  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment  which  deals  with  various  environmental

problems. I think the Ministry of the Environment  will

be  the  most  suitable Ministry to be made responsible

for the Anti-Pollution Unit. My query raised in 1971 is

still  valid in respect of enforcement authority  being

vested in more than one Ministry or department.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been some

time now since the Anti-Pollution Unit was established.

May  we  have  a detailed account of the activities  of

this Unit, and what has been the general effect of  its

activities?  As  far as I am aware, the  anti-pollution

campaign  has  been quite successful. I wonder  if  the

campaign  could  be repeated from time  to  time  after

short  intervals  so  that our  people  are  constantly

reminded of it until the problem is eradicated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for air pollution, there are still buses and taxis

emitting large volumes of black smoke. Can something be

done to keep a better control of these vehicles?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  actually  the Anti-Pollution  Unit  was

established  in April 1970 and it was under  the  Prime

Minister's Office. It was established initially to look

into air pollution control in Singapore. Since then the

Unit has set up the necessary machinery and enacted the

necessary  legislation to control  air  pollution  from

various  sources. On a wider scope, the  Unit  is  also

responsible for:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the formulation of pollution control policy,

especially those impinging on the industrialisation  of

Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) identification and screening of the larger

industries  according to their proneness to  pollution,

and  to  encourage  the setting up of those  industries

less likely to cause pollution;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the study of problems of pollution caused by

emissions from motor vehicles;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the formulation of standards for environmental

pollution control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit has since actively looked into some of these

problems, and examples are the establishment and siting

of  some  larger  industries, like oil  refineries  and

petro-chemical industries. It also has looked into  the

problem  of  hard  and  soft detergents,  pollution  by

sawmills,  pollution  by agricultural  activities,  and

pollution by motor vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah will

note    that    these   problems   impinge    on    the

responsibilities  of many other Government  Ministries,

departments  and  statutory bodies. Policies  on  these

matters  are  carefully considered  after  consultation

with  these  departments. Thus the Anti-Pollution  Unit

serves  to  co-ordinate the departments  and  statutory

bodies  involved  when it comes to pollution  problems.

Often  a  choice has to be made: either not to have  an

industry because it pollutes and so losing the economic

advantages,  or  to  have the industry  with  attendant

pollution reduced through control with costly  devices,

but still giving economic advantages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the Unit under the Prime Minister's Office has

its  advantages  in  that  the competing  interests  of

various  Ministries can be more expeditiously resolved.

So  the  Anti-Pollution Unit will  continue  to  remain

under the Prime Minister's Office for the time being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Telok Blangah is right in that

enforcement  authority  for the various  anti-pollution

measures   and  control  are  vested  in  the   various

departments  at the moment. For instance, the  question

of bringing smoky



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



buses  to  book comes under the ROV, and not  under  my

Ministry. And the question of pollution in markets  and

dirtying  of  markets, which was under the Ministry  of

Health,  has  now been shifted to the Ministry  of  the

Environment.  That  is  another reason  why  the  Anti-Pollution  Unit  should best be left  under  the  Prime

Minister's Office for the time being. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

my  earlier  answer  to the Member  for  Telok  Blangah

refers  to  some of the main activities  of  the  Anti-Pollution Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Anson, on air pollution, the

Unit  has been successful in preventing an increase  in

air pollution level despite rapid industrialisation  in

the  last  few  years.  Many  existing  factories  have

improved  on  their  house-keeping and  have  installed

control equipment to abate emissions of pollutants. The

Unit  has  also  been  successful in  seeing  that  the

establishment and allocation of factories are done with

due  consideration to the environment,  especially  the

pollution problems. These early preventive measures are

more  effective and economical in the long run.  But  I

would also like to inform the Member for Anson that the

Anti-Pollution Unit published a report in  1973,  which

has  been distributed to Members of Parliament, and  it

covers  in detail the activities of the Unit.  I  would

suggest that, if he wants more details, he should refer

to the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of air pollution from buses and taxis, of

course, requires constant surveillance. The ROV and the

Traffic Police have jurisdiction over this problem,  as

I  have  said,  and many offenders have been  fined  in

court  for  running vehicles emitting excessive  smoke.

The  problem now probably is to see that all the  buses

are  on the move, and it is possible that in the  ROV's

estimate  this  problem is to be given  first  priority

rather than the problem of cutting down the emission of

smoke. Once there are enough buses, probably they  will

then  be  more  severe  upon offenders.  It  is  now  a

question  of  transporting the commuter or  moving  the

buses out of the road.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the real cause of black smoke

actually lies with the running of diesel vehicles,  and

it  is due to the lack of proper operation and lack  of

maintenance  of  the  engine. If  a  diesel  engine  is

maintained regularly and properly, there is  no  reason

for it to emit black smoke. To a large extent, Sir, the

problem lies in the hands of the owners who should keep

their  vehicles  in good mechanical  condition.  I  can

assure  the Member for Anson that with better transport

services  and management, the emission of  black  smoke

will be reduced significantly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of anti-pollution campaigns, Sir, I would

like to assure the Member for Anson that such campaigns

will be held from time to time to constantly remind the

people  of  the need to prevent pollution in  Singapore

and  of  their social responsibility to help Government

in maintaining a clean and healthy environment.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I am grateful to the Minister

for  enlightening me that the Unit was set up in  1970,

and  not in 1971. But I go by the Main Estimates,  Sir,

and  the first time we allocated funds for the Unit was

in  the 1971 Estimates. It is possible that they set up

the Unit earlier and asked for money later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very fact that the Minister for the

Environment is replying to this amendment bears out the

fact that the Unit should be under the Ministry of  the

Environment, and not the Prime Minister's Office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head DA --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind hon. Members that the

guillotine time for this Head is 4.35 p.m.,  and  I  am

going to use the guillotine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head DA be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AA 1002*. (*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the estimated expenditure to be allocated for the

Ministry  of  Defence appearing in the Summary  of  the

Main  and  Development Estimates amounts to  over  $500

million for the whole Ministry. This accounts for about

27  per cent of the total expenditure, and ranks second

place to all the Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully appreciate that the Government has to

allocate  such  a big sum of money for Defence,  and  I

agree that this is necessary because, as an independent

and sovereign State, we must establish in our country a

strong  defence  system  and structure  to  ensure  our

safety,  security  and development.  Without  security,

there will not be any development. But with security we

will  be  able  to  attract foreign  investments,  thus

increasing  our prosperity. This is necessary.  So  the

citizens   of  Singapore  quite  understand   why   the

Government has to adopt such a policy. There  are  very

few  critics in Singapore against such a policy and  if

there  is any criticism at all I think such a criticism

is  based  on misunderstanding or lack of understanding

of the policies and the needs of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly under the enlightened

leadership of our Government and the patriotic  support

of  the people, there will be better performance  among

our  defence  personnel.  I would  like  to  take  this

opportunity to pay tribute to the national servicemen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



who  have given their help to the rural people.  In  my

constituency,  Sembawang, there are a number  of  roads

which  have been made up or repaired with the  help  of

the   national  servicemen,  under  the  gotong  royong

system.  The spirit of co-operation and help  from  the

national  servicemen  have  already  established   good

relations  between  them and the people  of  Singapore,

particularly  in the rural areas. Sir, with  continuing

development  of  national service and national  defence

and  the  greater discipline displayed by our  national

servicemen in peace-time as evident now, we must create

more  opportunities  for them to display  and  manifest

their  co-operative  spirit. I hope that  consideration

will  be  given  to set up a productive  unit  for  our

national  servicemen so that, in addition  to  national

service  and military training, they can be engaged  in

productive  processes, e.g, in agriculture  where  they

can do animal husbandry, vegetable farming, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding all that I have said in praise of

our national servicemen and the defence system, I think

there   is  still  room  for  improvement  in   certain

respects.  Firstly,  there  is  the  request  from  the

national  servicemen to attend night  classes.  I  have

received  requests and complaints from  them  regarding

technical classes to be made available to them  in  the

evenings.  They  would  like to improve  themselves  in

technical  education  so  that  they  can  have  better

opportunities.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they applied for permission, their

applications were turned down. The reason  is  that  if

they want to attend such technical classes they have to

sign  on  for a further service of three years.  It  is

because  of this condition which they are not  prepared

to  accept that they are denied the opportunity to seek

further  training  in technical education.  This  is  a

pity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that at the present

stage  of  our industrial development we need more  and

more  trained  technical  personnel.  Therefore,  those

national servicemen who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



interested  and  who  have the capacity  to  learn  and

benefit from technical education should be given  every

encouragement  and  opportunity to improve  themselves.

Too  stringent conditions should not be imposed on them

if  we  are to assist them in furthering their training

in  technical  education. After having completed  their

national  service, they will be able to join the  ranks

of our industrial workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there is the question of the call-up of

brothers.  I  have  received  complaints  from  certain

families, each with two or three sons, that their  boys

were called up for national service at the same time of

the  year.  This  has  caused great  inconvenience  and

financial hardship to them. The call-up for such  cases

should  be  staggered.  For instance,  the  second  son

should  not  be  called  up until  the  first  son  has

completed  his  national service. I  think  this  is  a

legitimate   request   worthy  of  our   consideration.

However, such consideration has not always been  given.

Applications  had been made but they were  turned  down

most  of  the time. I would like the Minister concerned

to    consider    such   applications   sympathetically

particularly   those   cases   where   the   boys   are

contributing to the maintenance of the family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the question of allocation of duties

for   national   service  trainees.  I  have   received

complaints that, after three months of basic  training,

some  of  the  trainees have been posted to  the  wrong

units.  Trainees who are physically weak are posted  to

the  Combat  Division  or the Artillery  Division,  and

those inexperienced in driving are given driving duties

or  are  forced  to  learn driving. This  inappropriate

allocation of duties has given rise to discontent among

parents. A lot of traffic accidents have resulted  from

this situation. I would like the Minister concerned  to

look   into  the  matter  to  ensure  that  responsible

officers  will be detailed to properly allocate  duties

for the national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, the question of recreational and

cultural  activities. I am glad to say that  two  years

ago in this House when I suggested that there should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



more  recreational  and cultural activities  among  the

national  servicemen,  the  Minister  agreed  to   this

suggestion.  In the camps now cultural and recreational

activities are conducted from time to time so that  the

national  servicemen can have proper  recreation  after

their training and during their leisure hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year I was invited to attend an

evening  function at the Changi Camp.  I  noticed  that

some  of  the national servicemen were quite  talented.

But some of the items in the programme were contributed

by  artistes  from  outside. I do  not  think  this  is

appropriate because the songs they sang were  not  very

healthy. For example, one of them sang a song entitled.

"We  should not pluck a wild flower by the road  side."

This  type  of  song  should not be introduced  to  the

national servicemen during a cultural show. I think all

programmes  should be properly conducted and  organised

by  the  recreational and cultural units in the various

camps. If artistes are to be invited from outside, they

should  come  from  healthy cultural  organisations  or

choirs.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for a long time

there  have  been no statements regarding international

agreements.  May  I  know  the  state  of  the  defence

agreements,  and to what extent will they  involve  our

Singapore Armed Forces?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known that Australia had pulled out quite a

number  of  its  troops from Singapore.  I  wonder  how

effective are the ANZUK forces at the moment, and  what

is  the extent of its future plans, in terms of defence

training and common interest?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to touch upon the intake of

national servicemen. What is the present procedure  for

the  call-up  of  national  servicemen?  I  raise  this

question  because I have observed that there  are  many

potential  boys  who  are  eligible  and  are   eagerly

awaiting for the Central Manpower Base to call them up.

And  there  are others who are still lingering  on  the

streets  and  who may also be called up. On  the  other

hand there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



are many who are hoping for a postponement for a couple

of  years due to some reasons, but they are the ones to

be called in first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that food supplied to the national

servicemen is being wasted. This could probably be  due

either to poor quality or to the fact that some of  the

well-to-do  boys could not be bothered about  the  army

food. Could the Minister say something on this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard that at present there is a lack of

understanding between officers and senior NCOs  in  the

army. Discipline to a certain extent has been affected.

Could  more power be given to senior NCOs and corporals

to  deal  with their subordinates? The NCOs  should  be

given  opportunity to lead and train  their  men.  This

will  help them in times of crisis if the officers  are

being  pinned down. Furthermore, I observe  that  there

are  inadequate recreational facilities in  some  camps

for  these young men. Could something be done  to  help

the men?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, it was reported in the press that the army

would  assist  with  its helicopter services  to  fight

against  fire  in high-rise buildings. Could  the  same

services  be extended to the Police Force to help  them

fight against crime?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the expenditure for

Defence  keeps  going  up from year  to  year.  We  are

spending much more money every year. From time to  time

I  have  been  wondering why we need  to  increase  our

Defence  expenditure  when, in  actual  fact,  we  have

friendly neighbours around us. Is it necessary  for  us

to  increase  our Defence expenditure, when  the  money

could  be utilised in many other ways to promote better

relationship  among the citizens in  Singapore?  Bigger

countries  in  the  world  today  are  lessening  their

expenditure  on defence, but a small nation  like  ours

keeps on increasing it as the years go by.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will deal with the

various  points  which  have been  raised  by  Members.

First, the Member for Sembawang. He has recommended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>



that  soldiers be put to productive work, such  as  the

rearing  of  poultry  and  pigs  and  the  growing   of

vegetables.  He is under the assumption  that  soldiers

have  nothing  to do. Actually they have a  very  heavy

training  programme.  When  they  finish  their   basic

training,  they go on to training at platoon level,  so

much so that their working hours are much more than the

normal  working hours of civilians. For instance,  they

have  to do night training three times a week.  So  how

are they to get time off to rear pigs and poultry?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as for night classes, he said he has received

representations from national servicemen  who  want  to

improve  themselves by attending night classes so  that

they  can  upgrade their technological  skills.  He  is

under the impression that when these requests are made,

they are often turned down. Actually he is right there.

At one time we used to give the battalion commander the

authority to decide whether or not to release  soldiers

for  night classes. Of course, it is very admirable  of

young  men  to want to improve themselves by  attending

night  classes.  However, the number  grew  bigger  and

bigger,  and  we decided to make a check  on  what  was

happening.  We  found that most of them were  having  a

glorious time. Most of those who attended these classes

did  not pass their examinations. Of course, there were

many  who never attended any classes at all! The system

now  is that any soldier who wants to take time-off  at

night  to attend technical education courses will  have

to  apply formally. Their applications will be examined

and   scrutinised  by  the  Technical   Department   of

Logistics  Division.  If  it is  a  genuine  case,  the

applicant  not only gets time-off but MINDEF subsidises

his  fees  and  provides him with books.  That  is  the

present system. If it is a genuine case, he gets it. If

it  is not, as in the case of those national servicemen

who  had gone to see the Member for Sembawang, they are

rejected, and quite rightly so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he also wants brothers to be treated kindly,

i.e, if there are several brothers in the family, then

they should not be conscripted together. I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>



see the logic of it. The principle is this. Whether  or

not  he  has  brothers serving in the Army,  is  not  a

relevant point. The point is, if by taking a young  man

out  from  whatever  he is doing  and  putting  him  in

uniform  to  do his national service, this  results  in

hardship  for the family, such cases are considered  by

an Appeals Committee. And if facts are established that

genuine   hardship   arises,  the   Appeals   Committee

invariably allows the appeal. Indeed, each year we have

about  300  to  500  appeals approved  by  the  Appeals

Committee.  So there is machinery for considering  this

kind of situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the posting of servicemen to vocations,

there  are vocations which nobody likes to do.  Cooking

is one of them. Driving is another. The life of an army

driver is a very hard one. He is among the first to get

up  in the morning and the last to go to sleep, because

he  has  got to clean the trucks before he is  finished

for  the  day.  Here  again,  I  urge  the  Member  for

Sembawang to bear this in mind: by all means listen  to

their grouses with great sympathy, but do not always be

taken in.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the music and drama show which he attended,

he  complains that certain songs sung by foreign  song-stresses  should not have been allowed. There  are  two

points  of view on this. One is that of the Member  for

Sembawang,  and the other is that of the  soldiers  who

listened   to  these  songs.  And  as  he  would   bear

testimony,  the  songs he complained  of  received  the

loudest applause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson claims that there is a waste of

food.  I  am not going to deny that there is  waste  of

food in any of the battalion camps. But I do ask him to

supply  me with details of what wastes there  are,  and

when  and where, because we are fairly stringent  about

this. We have inspectors to go round from camp to camp,

and  we  are  keeping  this subject  under  very  close

supervision.  Any information he gives about  waste  of

food  in any particular camp will be studied and action

will be taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards inadequate recreational facilities that the

Member  complains of, I am afraid he  has  grounds  for

this.  I  am  not  going to say that we  have  adequate

recreational facilities in all our camps. In fact,  the

standard  of  recreational facilities in all  battalion

camps is inadequate. But that is the way it is. How are

we  going  to  have a swimming pool for each  battalion

camp?  How  are we going to have football  fields?  All

these  cost  money.  The Member  for  Potong  Pasir  is

complaining  that we are spending too much on  defence.

But I will deal with that point later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of helicopters to fight crimes, I

think  the  Member  for Anson is an  ardent  reader  of

detective  comic  strips. I do not see how  helicopters

can  be  used  to  fight  crime. Helicopters  are  very

expensive and a dangerous form of transportation. It is

not  to be recommended other than in real cases of dire

necessity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir asks: why not decrease the

defence  expenditure? Why are we spending so  much?  No

one  wants to spend money on defence, neither I  myself

nor  Members  here. Unfortunately, these are  what  one

statistician,   studying   categories   of   Government

expenditure,  calls "regrettable necessities".  If  the

Member   for  Potong  Pasir  has  studied  the  figures

closely,  he  will have noticed that  the  increase  in

defence   expenditure  is  the  smallest  of  all   the

Ministries. The increase in this financial  year  asked

by my Ministry comes to rather less than 2� per cent as

against  some 10 to 15 per cent increase in the general

run of Ministries.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has

not  answered  two of my questions: one  regarding  the

Australian pull-out from the ANZUK forces and the other

on the power given to the NCOs to control their men.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I did not say anything about

the  ANZUK forces because I did not understand what the

Member was saying!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I was saying that Australia

had  pulled  out  quite a number  of  its  troops  from

Singapore. I wonder how effective the ANZUK  forces  is

at  the moment, and to what extent are its future plans

in terms of defence training and common interest?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for Anson should

address his question to the ANZUK Commander! ANZUK does

not  come  under  me.  Seriously  speaking,  ANZUK   is

rethinking the whole position, and no doubt  they  will

come up with new plans in course of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the NCOs, here again I must ask the Member for

Anson's pardon if I did not get him right. He says that

senior NCOs have not been given adequate powers.  I  am

not quite sure what he means by that.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> They cannot control the privates.

If  they have more powers, then they can control  them.

Otherwise there will be no discipline.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think I understand what the

Member for Anson is trying to get at. What happened was

in the past NCOs, mostly national service corporals, in

their  exasperation against recruits who kept on making

the same mistakes or not obeying orders or whatever  it

was,  took  upon  themselves to inflict  punishment  of

various  kinds,  many  of which were  contrary  to  the

regulations. So it was made very clear to them that  if

they  continued to inflict illegal forms of  punishment

on  soldiers under their command, they would  be  court

martialled. And they were accordingly court  martialled

and  sternly punished, as I think they should. But that

does  not  mean  that the NCOs do not  have  powers  to

inflict  punishment.  Punishment  must  be  meted   out

according to the rules and regulations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

before I withdraw my amendment I have a question to ask

the  Minister. This relates to our national  servicemen

and national consciousness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



I  feel  that this is a long-term question which cannot

be  resolved  easily  within  a  short  time,  and  the

Minister has been paying much attention to this problem

of   national  consciousness  and  patriotism  of   our

national servicemen. Thus if our national servicemen do

not  have a strong sense of nationalism and patriotism,

how can we expect them to sacrifice for the country  or

to  serve  the country? What is their position  now  in

respect  of  national consciousness and patriotism?  Of

course, generally speaking, they are quite good in this

respect.  They  obey their superior's orders  and  they

abide  by the regulations. But what are they internally

in  their  own personal feelings and consciousness?  It

seems  that  they have not acquired a strong  sense  of

nationalism or patriotism. This could be assessed  from

their  conversation. Once I visited their barracks  and

some  soldiers were talking to their officers who  were

mainly pre-University or University students. From  the

talk  I  gathered  the impression that  they  are  most

concerned as to whether their studies will be  affected

after  their discharge from national service. They  are

concerned  about  their  future prospects  after  their

period of training. They are more concerned with  their

personal problems than with their contribution, if any,

to  nation  building or defence. Of course, this  shows

that  the  content  of the training courses  lacks  the

inculcation of national consciousness in the  minds  of

our national servicemen. We should inculcate in them  a

sense  of citizenship and other good points and virtues

in order to make them good soldiers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang

brought  up  what  seems to me a very  important  point

which  indeed may constitute a serious weakness in  the

Army,  that  is,  the spirit of national consciousness,

the  willingness  to take up arms  on  behalf  of  your

country. However, if he believes that this is something

that  Army commanders can bring about in two years,  he

is  asking  for  something  quite  impossible.  I  have

discussed  this matter with Army commanders,  and  they

say that this is something they expect to be cultivated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



in  schools, in homes and indeed in general society. If

we  get a situation where a young man turning up in the

Army  knows  nothing about these matters  and  believes

that  what  matters most is his own personal  interest,

there  is  very little that we can do in two  years  to

change  that  kind  of  attitude. We  cannot  brainwash

soldiers in two years' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did an interesting experiment in May last year. I

invited six or seven Members of Parliament taking turns

to   visit   various  battalion  camps   and   training

institutions.  Those  who  took  part  remember   their

experiences very well. The idea, first, was to give the

MPs  -many of them were young MPs - a chance to see the

soldiers and get the feel of their attitudes, how  they

are  taking  to  national service, what their  problems

are, and that sort of thing. That is for the MPs to get

to know the Army. The other part of the exercise is for

the  MPs to tell the soldiers just what the Member  for

Sembawang  has been saying, that is, the importance  of

their  work, the need to defend the nation, patriotism,

and  so  on  and  so  forth. I paid  a  great  deal  of

attention   to  this  exercise  and  had   it   closely

documented.  After a month the MPs and myself  came  to

the  conclusion  that  it was  not  a  very  profitable

exercise.  The  soldiers asked all kinds  of  questions

which  the  MPs consider quite trivial, like  too  many

guard  duties,  no time-off, eggs not properly  cooked,

lavatories out of order, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the impact of the MPs on the soldiers, I am

afraid  my  officers  were  rather  polite.  Those  who

recorded the effect of the exchanges said that the  MPs

were  very sincere and very eloquent. But they did  not

know what effect they had on the soldiers. However,  if

the  Member  for  Sembawang feels very  strongly  about

this,  perhaps we can arrange for him to be in  a  road

show  some  time  so that he can give  a  talk  to  the

soldiers.  But  I  must warn him that the  audience  of

soldiers  will  be  in  darkness.  The  stage  is  well

lighted,  and  if they do not like it, then  they  will

show their dislike very audibly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank the

Minister  for  his  detailed  answers  to  my   various

questions.  At  the  same  time,  I  believe  that  the

Minister  and  the officers under him  are  all  trying

their best to improve the consciousness of our national

servicemen to become patriotic soldiers and  to  become

good citizens also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Tay

Boon Too --



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head DA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 2010.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, amendment (2).



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar):</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head DA be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AA 2902.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one or two points to raise, Sir,I hope you

will  be a little indulgent as you were in the case  of

the  Prime  Minister's Head of Expenditure.  The  first

relates  to the People's Defence Force. I believe  that

the PDF is now only a small force, consisting of almost

as  many officers and senior NCOs as there are  men.  I

have  been  told that the PDF is a sort of a descendant

of  the  SVC, the Singapore Volunteer Corps of which  I

believe our respected Minister of Defence was himself a

member. Many well-known Singaporeans, including  a  few

of  our  senior military officers, are proud  of  their

connections with the volunteers. We have a full-fledged

military  establishment based principally  on  national

service  but  there are those who are  asking  what  is

happening  to  the  PDF.  The SVC  has  given  us  some

interesting  traditions of volunteer military  service,

and  I  wonder whether the Minister could say something

that   might  resolve  the  ambiguous  situation   that

prevails at the moment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point relates to the accident that recently

happened at SAFTI, when people were killed and injured.

I  wonder  whether the Minister would  like  to  say  a

little  bit  more about this accident, if  he  has  the

time, of course -- whether there is any fault that  may

be  attributed  to  people or agency  so  that  further

additional  precautionary  measures  can  be  taken  to

ensure greater insurance against such accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to refer to the road show,

not  necessarily the one which the Member for Sembawang

had a look at. Personally I was extremely impressed  by

what I saw. I could not understand what those actresses

were singing, but the part which I saw and understood I

appreciated  profoundly. I might  mention  particularly

the  humorous sketches. I think they are of  a  quality

that  may  be  appropriate for  presentation  over  our

television. Some of the jokes are somewhat earthy,  but

I  am sure our civilian population will be able to take

them.  I  was rather struck by the originality  of  the

satire   and  the  wit.  I  would  imagine   that   the

presentation  of such humorous sketches over  TV  would

also  serve  to  introduce  parents  to  some  of   the

situations  which  our young servicemen  encounter  and

deal  with, perhaps in very characteristic fashion when

inducted into national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the road show I was also struck by the vibrant way

in which the English language was used, and by the rich

new  coinages the SAF are contributing to  the  English

language. Let me give a few examples, Mr Speaker,  Sir.

The  word khoon means sleep, as in the sentence,  "Hey,

soldier,  you are good at khooning even with your  eyes

open, huh!" The word gabra means a fumbler; a skiver is

a  person who specialises in getting off the hook,  one

who is not willing to do the job, or one who sticks  to

the   same   universal   army   principle   of   never-volunteering.  Maybe that might affect  the  Minister's

reply  when  he talks about the PDF! Then we  have  the

frequent  use  of  the  word  sabo,  which  means,   to

undermine another person's status. I would suggest that

we encourage some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



of  our  young  research lecturers at the  University's

Department of English to look a little bit more closely

into  this very healthy contribution of the SAF to  the

development of the English language in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In the PDF there are two

battalions, the 10th and 15th. The 15th will be  closed

down  by  the SAF, and the men transferred to the  10th

Battalion.  I  hope  the  volunteering  tradition  will

continue, and I agree with a lot of what the Member has

said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the SAFTI accident, a Board of Inquiry has

been  set up and it has just completed its findings.  A

full  statement  will be made shortly  on  this  tragic

episode. Briefly, the Board found that the most  likely

cause  of the accident was a defect in the fuse of  the

mortar bomb.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the comic sketches, I am glad the Member

enjoyed  it.  I hope he will be welcome to  attend  all

future road shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the SAF English, he will be interested to

know that the Personnel Research Department of Manpower

Division,  MINDEF,  is  compiling  a  glossary  of  SAF

English jargon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I am very happy with the Minister's

reply, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

permission to speak on it, as it will be easier for the

Minister to answer?



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head EA be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AA 2902.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

once mentioned about making Singapore the brain centre.

In this respect, what is being done about it? Singapore

is  fast  becoming  an international  centre  for  many

things. We only hope that in this all-important  matter

the  Government  will try to expedite movement  towards

international standards. I would like to know how  much

of  the main scientific facilities are available in the

Republic.  I  would also like to know how effective  is

the  Science  Centre  at  Jurong.  Is  it  being  fully

utilized?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been some time now since

metrication was introduced. We welcome this attempt and

praise  the Government for its good efforts. I  observe

that  many  people still do not know  how  to  convert,

though  there is a conversion table in every  shop.  It

would  appear that the people are slow to use  it.  The

metrication campaign should be revitalised to  see  its

effects  truly felt. Even the kilometre  signs  on  the

road are hardly noticed by the people, though they  are

prominently  placed. This campaign should be  continued

with  better force and effect. Have new equipments been

provided for the purpose? How far has metrication  been

introduced  in markets and provision stores?  We  still

find  the  people  and  shopkeepers  trading  with  the

imperial  system, for example, rice is being  dealt  in

katis,  sugar in pounds, etc. How far has  the  daching

been  eliminated  in the markets, as  there  have  been

reports  of  a  lot of manipulation of the instruments?

Has  the  Minister  thought of  introducing  any  other

reliable  instruments with metric markings which  would

be easier to work on?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our work in developing

Singapore  as  a  brain  centre  is  progressing   very

smoothly.  If we have not been talking a lot about  our

work, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



not  because our brains have been resting or  sleeping,

but  because  our  brains have  been  doing  a  lot  of

thinking  and planning. It is quite true that Singapore

will  have  to live on its ability to export  soft-ware

and   hard-ware  services,  and  we  do  this   through

education   in  post-secondary  schools  and   in   the

universities.  This is one reason why  my  Ministry  is

working  very  closely with the universities,  together

with the Polytechnic and the Ministry of Education,  in

developing courses of study which will be of  relevance

and use to the young people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has a misconception about the use

of the Science Centre which is coming up in Jurong. The

Science   Centre   essentially  will  stimulate   young

students  and adults to be able to read a  little  more

about  the  application  of  scientific  principles  in

technology.  It  is  due  to  be  completed  in   1975.

Currently, we are busy collecting exhibits from various

industrial  firms which will be shown at  this  Centre.

There  is  no central scientific facility in Singapore.

Our  facilities  are  scattered in  many  branches  and

divisions  of  Government Ministries,  and  it  is  not

possible  for  me  to  tell  the  Member  whether   the

scientific  facilities  in Singapore  are  being  fully

utilised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to metrication, the strategy for 1974 is

to  introduce  it  at  market  level,  that  is,  among

consumers.  To-date,  most Government  departments  and

statutory bodies have already completed the first phase

of   metrication,  and  we  are  now  aiming  at   mass

consumers.  If  the Member for Anson had  been  to  Toa

Payoh  on  Saturday night, he would have  seen  me  and

officials  of the Metrication Board trying to encourage

the  illiterate constituents in Toa Payoh  to  use  the

metric system. I do admit, together with the Member for

Anson, that many people are still not very conscious of

the metric system. But if the Member for Anson can tell

me whether one pound of mutton is cheaper than one kati

of  it, or why he prefers to buy a metre of sari  to  a

yard of sari



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



for his wife, which is cheaper, then I will be able  to

answer him how widespread metrication is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be rest assured that my Ministry is doing its very

best  to  try to standardise the weights and  measures,

but  we  cannot avoid manipulation, whether we use  the

imperial  weights  and measures or the  metric  system.

Currently, the Metrication Board is discussing  with  a

number  of daching manufacturers, so that they will  be

able  to use the daching and yet use the metric system.

The  experiment is now in progress and, when completed,

we  will go out to the market and tell the hawkers  how

to sell in grams and kilograms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head FA --



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head FA be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead AA 1003*. (*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Cheong Yuen Chee and P. Govindaswamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this Head, I would like to raise three

questions for answer by the Minister concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has

recently made a goodwill tour of six countries in  West

Asia.  This visit took place at a time when  there  was

international  turbulence  in  those  countries.  As  a

result,  many people have paid much attention  to  this

visit  as it took place during the oil crisis. Sir,  we

can  say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is  wise

and  acute  in  his judgment, and has good  vision  and

foresight  in handling affairs with foreign  countries.

Therefore,  his  recent visit has  undoubtedly  brought

benefits to our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you know, our foreign policy is to cultivate

more  friends and to cut down on the number of enemies.

Of  course, if we do not have any enemy, it is so  much

the better.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the principle of our foreign policy, we

should  pay  attention to other places  in  the  world,

other  than  West Europe and South-east Asia  where  we

have   traditional  relationships.   We   should   also

strengthen   our  friendly  relationship   with   other

countries of the world. We should now pay attention  to

countries  in West Asia and extend a friendly  hand  to

them in order to set up ties in commercial and cultural

fields,  so  that  this relationship  can  bring  about

mutual  benefits.  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister

whether  there  are any more plans to  send  commercial

delegations to West Asian countries to make an  on-the-spot  study  and  analysis with a view to  establishing

wider  commercial relationship and trade with  them.  I

know that in Cairo, we have only a Charge d'Affaires to

run  a  diplomatic mission there. I would like  to  ask

whether  the  Ministry concerned would  establish  more

diplomatic missions in the Middle East.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I think

there is a separate subhead where matters in respect of

High  Commissions and Embassies should rightly be dealt

with.  I  am just wondering if the Member for Sembawang

is beating the gun to it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I do agree that the Member for Sembawang

has  been  embarking on a wide range of subjects  under

this  Head. But as I have been very lenient  with  hon.

Members so far, I think I shall at this instance  allow

him  to  carry on, unless he touches on your amendments

as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Thank you, Sir,It

was really unnecessary for the Member for Telok Blangah

to raise his point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Last year the Minister for Foreign Affairs

disclosed in this House that there were about a hundred

items  of  co-operation with ASEAN countries, including

tourism, cultural and other activities. I would like to

ask: How many kinds of economic activities or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



plans have been implemented and completed? What kind of

benefits  have  been  derived  by  this  kind  of   co-operation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Undoubtedly, international situations are changing

all  the  time. However, our foreign policy is that  of

neutrality  and  non-alignment. We  have  a  very  able

Minister   in  charge  of  relationships   with   other

countries. So we can rest assured that matters relating

to  foreign affairs will be well looked after. However,

I  would  like to ask him whether he has any  plans  to

establish new diplomatic missions and, if so, where.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

many countries, whether Scandinavian or certain Western

countries,  travel formalities are being  progressively

relaxed or even withdrawn for the benefit of bona  fide

travellers  from these countries. This has  come  about

because  of the cordial relationships existing  between

such count ties. There was some discussion sometime ago

among  ASEAN  countries on the need  for  regional  co-operation  on such matters. I wonder what progress  has

been made so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have very often encouraged our citizens,

particularly  our  youths, to  travel  to  neighbouring

countries  in  order  to broaden  their  knowledge  and

outlook.  Because of its close proximity, most  of  our

citizens  prefer  to travel to West Malaysia.  However,

with  the present restrictions imposed by the Malaysian

Government,  many of us have been deterred from  making

such  a trip to West Malaysia. We are aware of the long

queues  of  traffic  along  the  Johore  Causeway,  the

bottleneck  at  the Malaysian Customs check-point,  and

also  at  the  Malaysian  High Commission  Office.  Our

citizens  have to fill up forms and obtain special  car

permits   which  are  now  considered  unnecessary   in

countries  having friendly relationships  in  order  to

travel   to   West  Malaysia.  Because  of  its   close

proximity, many of our citizens would like to travel to

Johore  Bahru, not because of the special  film  shows,

but to see something different,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



for  example,  the  rubber  estates,  pineapple

plantations,  tin mines and rural Malaysia.  Travel  to

such places is an education to many of us, particularly

our  young people, and this can be done over the  week-end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the improved and cordial relationship

between  Singapore  and Malaysia,  would  the  Minister

consider this an opportune time to make representations

to  the  Malaysian Government with a  view  to  seeking

relaxation   o  travel  formalities  for  Singaporeans,

including  youths or student groups who wish to  travel

to West Malaysia for such a purpose?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what is

Singapore's   role  in  the  ASEAN  organisation?   Has

Singapore    participated    effectively    in     this

organisation? What are the various programmes in  which

Singapore  has participated in? In order to keep  alive

our  existence  in  the ASEAN group of  countries,  the

people  ought  to be told from time to time  about  the

meaning of ASEAN and our importance in this connection.

A  campaign might be held. A special day could  be  set

aside, like the Commonwealth Day, calling it ASEAN  Day

to  make  people aware of our membership in the  group.

This  will  also tell the people of the  importance  of

being not only in the international limelight, but also

in the regional set-up. A good example was the 7th SEAP

Games that aroused people's interest in the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I most heartily congratulate the Minister on his

recent successful mission to the Middle East countries.

This  is good for our political development. May I know

what  has  been  the  outcome of this  trip,  and  what

measures  are  being  taken to ensure  that  we  get  a

continuous  flow of oil from the Middle East,  so  that

our  refineries  do  not  dry up?  Has  any  reciprocal

arrangement been made with the countries so  that  they

could  benefit  from our expertise? What  good  has  it

served to Singapore's progress in the next few years?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to avail



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



myself of this opportunity to raise a small point. What

is  Government's attitude in the official establishment

of  diplomatic relations with the People's Republic  of

China? Is there any change?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would also like to ask a question.  We

have  traditional  and  friendly relations  with  Great

Britain.  My  question is now that the minority  Labour

Government  in Britain has been formed, what  would  be

the   good  and  bad  points  resulting  from  such   a

government  in Britain, in relation to our  country?  I

hope  the  Minister for Foreign Affairs, with his  vast

experience  and able manner in which he discharges  his

duties, will be able to answer my question.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I always find it very difficult to

disagree   with   the  Member  for  Sembawang   because

invariably  he  begins his statement  by  unnecessarily

exaggerating  my  successes  as  a  Foreign   Minister.

Nevertheless I think, out of deference to his  feeling,

I would not disagree with him on that score!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the number of points and questions he has

raised  with  respect to my tour  of  West  Asia,  that

matter  has already been dealt with in my reply to  the

Member for Serangoon Gardens a few days ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question by the Member for Toa Payoh

about greater travel facilities to West Malaysia, first

of  all, I would like to say that every country has the

right to regulate how many people should be allowed  to

enter  the  country and how it should  be  -  i.e, its

immigration  rules and regulations. However,  they  are

good  and  necessary regulations, just as we  ourselves

have  immigration regulations to regulate, to a certain

extent,  the free flow of people from West Malaysia  to

Singapore  and vice versa. So we should not  query  the

right of any country to impose whatever regulations  it

thinks fit because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



there  are  so  many considerations, from  security  to

administrative problems. Having said that, I agree with

the Member for Toa Payoh that greater liberalisation of

these  regulations  both from  our  neighbour  in  West

Malaysia and us, would be to the good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these problems, I think, arise Out of the fact

that  the flow of traffic is very considerable.  It  is

not  like Malaysians or Singaporeans going to Japan  or

the  United States. It is a daily affair. Thousands  of

people  go  across daily, and we have  a  rather  small

Causeway  which was built for the days when there  were

no  immigration regulations between the two  countries.

But  1 hope that once the Causeway is widened, then the

administrative  controls which are now necessary  would

be  mitigated, or qualified, so that there would  be  a

greater  flow  of  traffic between Singapore  and  West

Malaysia  as,  I  hope,  is being  done  in  the  ASEAN

countries  to regulate and make smoother the free  flow

of people into the countries comprising ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of our relations with the

People's Republic of China, I think it has been  stated

before that it is our policy to establish friendly  and

closer  relations  with  all countries,  including  the

People's Republic of China. But Members are well  aware

of  the  situation prevailing in South-east  Asia,  and

because  of  that  there  are certain  rather  delicate

problems  in regard to Singapore's position  in  South-east  Asia.  We have said that we would be prepared  to

move in this direction after our neighbouring countries

have   moved   first.   I  think  Members   are   quite

sophisticated  enough  to  understand   why   this   is

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to our relations with Britain as a result of

the  advent of a Labour Government, in itself  I  think

that  does  not  materially alter  our  relations  with

Britain   unless,   of  course,  the   new   Government

introduces  new policies which necessitate  adjustments

on  our part. But so far no material changes have taken

place in regard to foreign policy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



as  enunciated by the Labour Government. Therefore,  as

far  as  I  know,  things are very much  as  they  were

before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, two Members have raised questions in regard to a

topic  which  is  of  great  interest  to  all  of  us,

including  my  Ministry, and that is, in what  way  has

ASEAN  benefited  us? What is the role  that  Singapore

intends to play in ASEAN? Because of the importance  of

ASEAN  to  us  and  to the region, I hope  I  would  be

permitted to say a bit more than I have done  in  other

cases   because   apart  from  regional   organisations

sponsored  by  the  United Nations in  Asia,  the  only

effective  and coherent Asian regional organisation  is

ASEAN.  There  is  no comparable organisation  in  Asia

where  a  number  of Asian countries work  together  to

promote  regional co-operation. I think to this  extent

ASEAN is unique even in the history of Asia. In so  far

as  progress is concerned, since its founding in  1967,

it is my view that ASEAN has progressed far more in the

direction  of  regional  co-operation  than,  say,  the

European  Economic Community was able to do during  its

first seven years. The rationale for ASEAN economic co-operation has been set out in the Report by the  United

Nations  team which completed its Report and  submitted

to  us  in  April  1972. It covered trade,  industrial,

monetary  and financial co-operation, and  the  various

ASEAN  permanent committees -- there are  a  number  of

them  - have been studying this Report during the  past

two years with a view to implementing gradually many of

the proposals put forward by the United Nations team.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore is concerned, it is convinced that

regional  co-operation  is both rational  politics  and

sound  economic  doctrine and that recent  events  have

tended  to  confirm  the  fact of  inter-dependence  of

nations, regionally as well as internationally. I think

the  oil  crisis and the difficulties of obtaining  raw

materials cheaply are really a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



reflection  of the growing inter-dependence of  nations

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN is not only our largest trading partner today,

but  it  also accounts for about a third of  our  total

trade.  ASEAN is becoming an important market  for  our

domestic exports which rose from $510 million  in  1969

to  $717 million in 1972 and accounts for about 22  per

cent  of  our  domestic exports to the  world.  We  are

conscious,  therefore, that this increased  trade  with

ASEAN  countries is a consequence of vigorous  economic

growth  and  growing  prosperity  in  ASEAN  countries.

Therefore,  if  regional  co-operation  can  accelerate

economic   growth  in  the  region,  then  it   is   in

Singapore's interest to play a meaningful and  positive

role in ASEAN economic co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the positive steps Singapore and its

partners  in ASEAN have taken during the past years,  I

think  Members are aware that economic action in  ASEAN

is conducted through permanent committees which control

various functions of ASEAN. There are a number of ASEAN

permanent  committees.  But  the  major  ones  are  the

Permanent  Committee  on  Commerce  and  Industry,  the

Permanent     Committee    on    Transportation     and

Telecommunications, the Permanent Committee  on  Social

and  Cultural  Activities, the Permanent  Committee  on

Science and Technology, and the Permanent Committee  on

Food and Agriculture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Permanent Committee on Commerce and

Industry  has  met  once  since  the  last  ministerial

meeting  in  April last year. But a number of  projects

which the Permanent Committee has initiated are now  in

the  process  of  being implemented or  completed.  For

instance, the ASEAN Products Display Centre in  Bangkok

is  now  in the final stage of completion. The  working

group  on trade liberalisation met in January 1974  and

its work is continuing. The training of ASEAN personnel

in  export promotion techniques is in an advanced stage

of preparation. On shipping, the Permanent Committee on

Commerce and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



Industry  has  finalised the draft  agreement  for  the

facilitation  of search for ships in distress  and  the

rescue of survivors in ship accidents. There are expert

groups    on    bulk   shipping,   marine    pollution,

containerisation, shipping statistics  and  information

and   related  matters.  The  Permanent  Committee   on

Commerce  and Industry is also undertaking tourism  and

has  a  five-year tourism marketing plan with an annual

budget  of  US$300,000 to promote ASEAN tourism.  These

are   under  study  and  there  are  arrangements   for

concessional  air fare rates for ASEAN  representatives

travelling on ASEAN duties. It is intended to establish

ASEAN  centres  of  trade, investment  and  tourism  in

Western Europe. There are also plans for a Manpower and

Training  Facility  Survey on  ASEAN  regional  tourist

development and plans for training of hotel  management

and executives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Committee on Transportation and

Telecommunications  has  set  up  a  sub-committee   to

finalise ASEAN telecommunications projects and to study

regional  satellite communications system.  Also  under

study  is the establishment of a common telephone  line

signal system. So, too, the Permanent Committee on Food

and  Agriculture  is  convening  a  meeting  of  senior

officials   on  rice  and  a  meeting  of  experts   on

fertilisers  and  pesticides. So,  too,  the  Permanent

Committee  on  Science and Technology is working  on  a

project  for soya bean processing and another  on  low-cost  protein-rich food for children. There will be  an

experts' meeting on ASEAN regional atlas and compendium

on climate statistics.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a Special Committee has been established to

co-ordinate ASEAN trade matters. This Committee is  now

working on a cumulative rule of origins for ASEAN which

will enable ASEAN



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



countries,  including Singapore, to take  advantage  of

the EEC GSP requirements. The special committee is also

studying  the  implications of the 1974  GSP  offer  in

order  to  put  up  proposals for more concessions  and

improvements in the 1975 GSP offer. It seems, Sir, that

though   the  ASEAN  progress  was  rather   slow   and

imperceptible  during the first four or five  years,  I

think  the  pace  of co-operation on specific  projects

tended to increase and gather momentum during the  last

two  or three years. I am quite sure that in the coming

years  if  nothing untoward happens, ASEAN  will  be  a

significant  factor in the history  of  the  individual

countries comprising ASEAN.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for giving

detailed answers to all the questions I have raised.  I

would like to mention here that it Was not my intention

humbleness. With this observation, I beg to withdraw my

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in moving this amendment, I

seek  clarification from the Minister on  our  overseas

missions.  As early as 1968, we had made provision  for

15  overseas missions. That was seven years  ago.  Last

year we also made provision for 15 overseas missions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



and  this  year  we have increased the number  by  one.

Where is this additional mission to be located?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1968, Singapore as a nation has come a long way.

I  appreciate the desirability of setting up  embassies

and  high commissions only in places where our interest

will  be  best  served.  I  do not  envisage  ambitious

overseas  missions  set  up for  the  sole  purpose  of

prestige  only.  I  also appreciate the  difficulty  in

finding  suitable personnel to represent our nation  in

our  overseas missions. Nevertheless, I am of the  view

that  our  interests can be better served  by  our  own

missions  in  selected  countries  in  Western  Europe,

Eastern  Europe and West Asia which are  becoming  more

and  more  important  in  relation  to  our  industrial

expansion  and  foreign trade. The 15  Ambassadors  and

High Commissioners we have are in many cases accredited

to  more  than  one country. In the long-term  interest

this may not be desirable as they would not be able  to

do justice to their appointments. I am perturbed by the

fact  that  at  least two of our embassies  abroad  are

manned by Charge d'Affaires, with vacancies of the  top

posts  not  filled for a long period. When  will  these

vacancies be filled?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to inform the House how

many  of  our  Consulates abroad are  looked  after  by

Honorary Consuls, and for what length of time have they

been  Honorary Consuls? Has the Minister any  plans  to

set up more Consulates of this nature?



<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker Sir, I would like to know the reason

why  the  post  of  Ambassador in Cairo  has  not  been

filled. The post was vacated by Mr Lee Khoon Choy  when

he was transferred to the Republic of Indonesia. Why is

it   that   the  Singapore  Government  has   not   yet

established  embassies in Europe and in Arab  countries

in  the Middle East? It is because Singapore has got no

embassies in the Arab countries that Singapore  is  not

known by the large population of the Arab nations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



When  I  went  on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia,  I  was

asked  about Singapore by the Arabs who were  from  the

Arab  countries.  Most of them do not  know  Singapore.

They  do  not  know whether Singapore is an independent

country   or  a  colony.  They  know  about  Indonesia,

Malaysia,  India  and  Pakistan  better  because  these

countries have embassies in the Arab countries.  If  we

call  to mind the Bukom incident and the damage  caused

to some oil tanks in our country, the Arabs do not know

that   Singapore  is  an  independent   country   whose

population  comprise  people of various  religions  and

races.  They still believe that Singapore is  a  colony

because  there are Israeli soldiers in Singapore.  That

is  why it is necessary for us to introduce our country

to  the  Arab countries, especially those in the Middle

East, and to establish embassies in those countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to what extent

have  our embassies abroad been effective? Are they  of

international  standard?  Do  Singapore   citizens   in

foreign countries get adequate help from our missions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent sea-jacking incident has shown that

extremist  elements  in  the  world  do  not  recognise

neutrality.  As such, have any measures been  taken  to

intensify   security  arrangements   in   our   foreign

embassies?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise

just  a very brief point. This year we are reserving  a

large  sum of money for the purchase of properties  for

foreign  missions.  The sum has  been  raised  from  $8

million  last year to $25 million this year. I remember

when  I paid a brief visit to Tokyo a few years ago,  I

discovered that there was a piece of property which  we

could  have bought quite cheaply. But prices have  gone

up  considerably by now. And the same may  be  said  of

other places too. I think we should try and see whether

there  are  economic  advantages  in  our  purchase  of

properties  for  foreign missions, and  to  take  quick

advantage of these opportunities. May



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



I  say that if the Minister wants my support, certainly

he has got it where this sort of thing is concerned.



<br><br><!-- Encik A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Encik A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to take the point

raised  by  the  Member  for Telok  Blangah  first.  He

mentioned  about the small increase in  the  number  of

heads  of missions, and asked whether or not more posts

should  be  created. The practice has  been  to  create

posts  of Ambassadors only when a decision is taken  to

establish a mission in a foreign country. The  adoption

of  this  practice  is  to ensure  that  the  Estimates

correctly reflect the position projected for  the  next

financial  year. The projection is generally  based  on

performance over the last three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973, the missions in Paris and Bonn were

established  -  not  one, but  two.  The  two  posts  I

mentioned  have  been  entered  in  the  Estimates   to

regularise their creation by Establishment Warrant last

year.  Also,  I should like to invite the attention  of

the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah  to  subhead  BA  2901

entitled   "Staff   and  expenses  for   New   Missions

Overseas".  The purpose of this subhead is  to  provide

for  the  emoluments of home-based officers,  including

Ambassadors,  and the cost of running new  missions  as

and   when  it  becomes  necessary  to  establish  such

missions  in foreign countries. Therefore, the creation

of  more  posts  of Ambassadors really depends  on  the

necessity  to establish more missions abroad.  If  this

decision  is  taken,  then there is  no  difficulty  in

creating the additional posts, including those of heads

of missions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's question regarding the number of

Honorary  Consuls we have abroad, the  answer  is  two.

There  is  an Honorary Consul in Sweden and another  in

Zurich, Switzerland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah also wanted to know

when new appointments are to be made.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> When will the vacancies of heads of

missions be filled?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Encik A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik A. Rahim Ishak:</b> Heads of missions represent

Singapore   overseas.  The  appointment   of   a   High

Commissioner or Ambassador is made after a careful  and

thorough  selection of candidates with the  personality

and  skill to carry out the important functions of head

of  mission. The process of selection necessarily takes

time  but  nominations  have  already  been  made,  and

hopefully the existing vacant posts of Ambassadors  and

High Commissioners will be filled during the course  of

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Telok Blangah and Geylang Serai

mentioned about why there are not more new embassies in

West  Asia. When Singapore gained independence  on  the

9th  of  August, 1965, the primary task  of  the  newly

instituted Foreign Ministry then Was to plan  carefully

where missions should be established apart from gaining

membership  in  the United Nations. The setting  up  of

missions  and  maintaining them is a  costly  business.

Therefore,   taking   into  consideration   Singapore's

economy  in  the  early years of independence,  it  was

essential  that  missions  should  be  established   in

carefully selected countries first.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.









<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criterion then was that the political climate in

the  country must be conducive to the setting up  of  a

mission   which   would  not  only  help   to   further

Singapore's national interest but would also facilitate

communications and exchange of views with the receiving

State to the mutual interest of Singapore and the State

concerned.  For  the  sake  of  economy,  it  was  also

essential  that  the  country should  be  strategically

placed,  thus facilitating communications and  exchange

of  views  with  countries in the  region  through  the

expedience of multiple accreditation. Thus it was  that

in  1966  missions were established in London to  cover

not  only  Great  Britain but also Western  Europe;  in

Canberra  and Wellington to cover also other  countries

in  the  Australian  region, and  so  on.  The  mission

established in Cairo in 1967 was to cover the North



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



African states and one of the Arab countries, which  is

Lebanon.   Indeed,   the   Ambassador   in   Cairo   is

concurrently  accredited  to  three  other   countries,

namely, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia and Pakistan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the rapid changes that have and are taking

place in the international scene, particularly in  West

Asia,  have made it necessary for an assessment of  the

adequacy or otherwise of our present representation  in

West Asia. This has led me to believe, especially after

our  recent visit to the West Asian countries, that  it

will be to the mutual interest and benefit of Singapore

and  West Asian countries themselves that two or  three

missions be set up in certain West Asian countries. But

the  setting  up of those missions has to  be  gradual,

that is to say, we could first set them up at consulate

status  and  at  a  later stage raise them  to  embassy

status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the second question posed by the Member

for Geylang Serai relating to the continued presence of

a  Charge d'Affaires instead of an Ambassador in Cairo,

since that Ambassador became our Ambassador in Jakarta,

the  Member may not be aware that it involves  time  to

select  a person with the necessary skill and qualities

for  appointment as Ambassador. As language is a  basic

tool  of  a  diplomat,  the  problem  of  selecting  an

Ambassador  to  the  Arab Republic of  Egypt  has  been

compounded  by  the  dearth of prominent  Arab-speaking

citizens  of  Singapore. However, efforts to  select  a

suitable person are still being made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's other questions such as why do we

have  very few foreign missions in Arab countries,  and

his  experience on his pilgrimage to Mecca where he was

asked  by  Arabs he met in the holy city  as  to  where

Singapore was, and whether it was independent or not, I

can  only  say that it is quite possible that not  only

Arabs  but also people of other nationalities  anywhere

in  the  world  might  not  know  about  conditions  in

Singapore  and whether or not it is independent.  I  do

not think that Mecca



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



is  the only place where the people arc perhaps not  so

informed   or  ignorant  about  Singapore's   political

status.  We can find as many such people all  over  the

world  as there are Singaporeans also, who are ignorant

of  conditions  in other countries. In that  connection

also, it is known to all of us here that not only  have

we  not  got many representations or missions  in  Arab

countries other than Cairo and Beirut, but in fact,  in

Singapore itself, there are only two representations or

missions  of Arab countries. They are the Arab Republic

of  Egypt  and  Saudi Arabia, although many  more  Arab

countries exist not only in West Asia but also in North

Africa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai also made reference to

the  attempted sabotage in Singapore by what he  called

Arabs.  They are, to be precise, Palestinians. He  said

that  possibly  they  came here  without  knowing  that

Singapore  was independent, and that they attempted  to

sabotage  the refineries at Pulau Bukom.  I  am  rather

skeptical  of his reasons because the two Palestinians,

all  of us know, were accompanied by two Japanese. They

came  in,  I  am told, with passports. I am  sure  that

before  they came into Singapore they had gone to  some

place  to  get visas. Wherever they had gone  to,  they

would have found out that Singapore is independent.  To

say  that  the  two Arabs were ignorant of  Singapore's

independence   would   be   perhaps   out   of   place,

particularly when they were with two Japanese Red  Army

guerillas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that the Member made was that the

action was directed towards Singapore. It is now common

knowledge that the guerillas themselves said that their

action   at  Pulau  Bukom  was  not  directed   against

Singapore or the people of Singapore and that they  had

done  it to support the revolutionary struggle  of  the

Vietnamese people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one other point which the Member for Geylang

Serai  had  made  which I cannot remember.  Perhaps  he

might want to raise it later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned about security. What

security measures



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



are being arranged at our missions abroad? The practice

is to send an officer, trained in security, to missions

as  soon as a chancery building has been rented out  or

purchased.  His task is to study the physical  security

arrangement  required to make the chancery secure  from

intrusion. In practically all our chanceries there is a

strong  room in which classified materials  are  safely

kept.  Whenever  possible,  windows  and  doors  giving

access  to  the  chancery are reinforced by  installing

grills.  In  chanceries with a wall-fence,  strands  of

barbed  wire  have  been mounted on the  wall-fence  to

provide additional security. In certain missions  there

are  officers trained in security amongst the Singapore

staff.  In  chanceries which are housed in a  block  of

offices,  grill doors have been installed as a security

measure,  but  generally there are security  guards  to

look  after the safety of a block of offices  in  which

our chancery is housed, for example, our chanceries  in

Tokyo and Manila.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is now under review the security system

in existence in all our chanceries generally. A trained

officer is being sent to our missions for this purpose.

These  systems vary with the locality and  requirements

of  the  owner of the building in which our  chanceries

are  accommodated. If, by the expression "to  intensify

security  arrangements", the Member for  Anson  has  in

mind  the  presence  in  our  chanceries  of  uniformed

guards,  then  I  should like to point out  that  under

Article  22  of  the  Vienna Convention  on  Diplomatic

Relations,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The receiving state is under a special duty to take

all  appropriate steps to protect the premises  of  the

missions against intrusion or damage and to prevent any

disturbance of the peace of the missions or  impairment

of its dignity.'



<br><br>So  the  Member  will appreciate that in  view  of  the

provisions  of Article 22 of the Vienna Convention,  it

would  not  be a good diplomatic move to post  our  own

security officers to missions. However, to allay  fears

of  the  Member  for Anson about the  security  of  our

chanceries abroad, I should like to state that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



a review of the existing physical security arrangements

in our missions has already begun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members asked why there were many Charge

d'Affaires  manning our missions abroad  and  why  they

should   not  be  replaced  by  Ambassadors   or   High

Commissioners.  The fact is that in  all  our  missions

abroad  there  are  only  four  Charge  d'Affaires,  as

compared with a total of 16 heads of missions, that is,

Ambassadors  and  High  Commissioners.  The  number  of

Charge d'Affaires is therefore not unduly large.  There

have been considerable difficulties in finding suitable

candidates to head our overseas missions, and sometimes

it  has been found that rather than have an ineffective

head  from  the  point of view of experience,  language

qualifications  or administrative capabilities,  it  is

better  to  have  a Charge d'Affaires who  is  properly

qualified to carry out these important representational

functions in the country to which he is accredited.  In

fact, the inference might be that Charge d'Affaires are

not as effective as Ambassadors. Well, this need not be

so,  whether they be our own Charge d'Affaires or those

of  other countries accredited to Singapore. There are,

for example, several Charge d'Affaires in Singapore who

have been here for many years and they have carried out

their  functions effectively. For example, from one  of

the  Arab countries themselves, although they  have  an

embassy   here,  it  has  never  been  manned   by   an

Ambassador. Ever since the embassy of the former United

Arab  Republic, now Arab Republic of Egypt, was set  up

here, they have always had a Charge d'Affaires as  head

of  mission.  Again,  because of  the  difficulties  of

finding  suitable  ambassadors  and  also  because  the

Singapore  Foreign Service is a very young  one,  which

will  not for some time produce career officers to fill

head  of  mission  appointments,  it  is  desirable  to

continue to appoint Charge d'Affaires. Because  of  its

status  and  position, Charge d'Affaires can  be  found

from  the  more  senior Foreign Service officers.  This

system permits also the opportunity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



for  Foreign  Service officers to gain  experience  and

knowledge as well as the training necessary for them to

be  promoted to the higher appointments in the  Foreign

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to standards and effectiveness, I am pleased

to be able to inform the Member who raised the question

that  in  spite  of  the absence of a long  established

tradition  of  diplomacy, our  diplomats  have  quickly

acquired  the  expertise  and  experience  which   have

enabled them very effectively to represent our national

interests  on  a  global  basis.  Our  diplomats   have

exercised  a high degree of flexibility in the  use  of

limited manpower resources available to them. They have

continued  to show themselves very capable of  reacting

pragmatically to international developments and in  the

face   of   increasing  complexities  in  international

relations and diplomacy, our officers have successfully

assumed  the  responsibilities of the modern  diplomat.

Their  objective assessment and appreciation  of  major

political  trends have helped Singapore to  adjust  and

cope  with  the tremendous changes in the  world  since

1965.  The quality of our overseas missions is, by  any

measure  of  international standard, satisfactory.  The

Singapore   Foreign  Service  as  a  whole   has   made

significant contributions to the political and economic

well-being of Singapore.

has  given  notice of the next subhead, and my  queries

are similar in respect of both subheads.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, in subhead AA 2310, provision

is  made  for  rental of premises for  headquarters.  I

presume  this  is for the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs,

Singapore  Office. This is a new provision.  Government

has taken over so many buildings from the British Armed

Forces,  and  these  are being rented  out  to  private

individuals  and companies. Can the Minister  therefore

inform  the House as to why should our Government  rent

premises  in  Singapore when it is one of  the  biggest

landlords  in  Singapore? To what  use  are  these  new

premises  going to be put? Where are these premises  to

be rented?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in respect of subhead BA 2310, Rental of premises

for  Overseas Missions, this is the first time that the

provision appears in the Main Estimates, although it is

indicated  that $1.79 million was appropriated  for  FY

1973.  The appropriation for this year is $2.5 million.

I  have also noticed that there is no appropriation  of

funds   in   the  Development  Estimates   for   either

Headquarters  or Overseas Missions. If we  are  renting

premises in Singapore and overseas for the Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs, would it not be more prudent to  look

into  the  possibility of purchasing suitable  premises

instead?  I  think this will cover what the Member  for

Katong  was  trying to say earlier  on  under  a  wrong

subhead.   Everybody  knows,  Sir,  that  real   estate

appreciates, but rentals once paid out is  money  lost.

Sir,  perhaps we may have some premises overseas  which

were bought prudently on our own, and if we do own land

or property abroad, I would like to be enlightened.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, I am indeed grateful to the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



Telok  Blangah  who has raised the question  with  good

intention  and with much concern over the  Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs.  If  I  read him  correctly,  he  was

worried  that the Government would have to  spend  more

money  to purchase property or land overseas. The  same

concern was also expressed by the Member for Katong. If

I remember correctly, Sir, three or four years ago, the

Member  for  Telok Blangah was kind enough to  persuade

his  good friend to purchase a piece of property  at  a

time when the price of houses was relatively much lower

than the present one. He was far-sighted. Unfortunately

his  friend  was short-sighted, or rather conservative.

So  now  the Member for Telok Blangah is living happily

with  his family in the house which he has bought at  a

cheaper  price. But his unfortunate colleague  and  his

family  who  did  not buy a house  then  has  to  share

accommodation with others up till today. Therefore,  in

the  same way I can assure the Member for Telok Blangah

that we are not as short-sighted as his friend who  did

not  take his good advice. We have already acquired  or

purchased  properties  in some of  the  capital  cities

where we have missions, used as chancery or residence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the first part of the question, Sir, since

its  inception in August 1965, the establishment of the

Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs has  been  expanding  in

proportion  with the increasing number of our  overseas

missions  to  cope  with  the increased  workload.  The

accommodation provided in the City Hall became cramped.

Hon.  Members who have visited the Ministry of  Foreign

Affairs  will  notice  that  most  of  the  staff   are

accommodated  in  cubicles because of the  shortage  of

office space. Besides, the City Hall itself houses  the

Ministry  of  Law,  Ministry  of  Culture,  the   Prime

Minister's  Office,  the PUB, and the  Wax  Museum.  So

there  is hardly any more room available at the  moment

to  meet the expansion needs of the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs. However, we have applied for that part of City

Hall  presently occupied by the PUB. This  will  become

available only in 1977 when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



the  PUB  building at Somerset Road is expected  to  be

ready  for  occupation.  In  the  meantime,  additional

office  space  had to be acquired by  the  Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs  to accommodate the additional  staff,

and  there  was no alternative but to rent  the  office

space in Colombo Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the second part of the question, it is the

Government's policy to acquire, whenever possible,  our

own  buildings and lands for our overseas missions.  Of

course,   considerations  of  value  and   prices   are

important in deciding how and when properties are to be

acquired.  It  is not always possible to  get  suitable

premises, and, therefore, it has been necessary to rent

the  accommodation  required until suitable  properties

have been acquired. It is the Ministry's policy to  buy

properties   for   overseas  missions   and,   whenever

possible,  the  accommodations for home-based  officers

are  also  purchased. But this is dependent on  certain

requirements, like price and location.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign

Affairs  has  avoided  answering  directly  the   first

question  of the Member for Telok Blangah. The question

was: if the Government needed premises, why does it not

use  its  own  premises, instead of renting  them  from

others? But as a layman who understands the working  of

the Government, especially the Finance Ministry, may  I

offer  an  explanation to satisfy the Member for  Telok

Blangah?  I  think the Ministry of Finance  works  from

this  angle: if a Ministry can get more financially  in

return  as  a result of whatever arrangement,  then  it

will  do  so.  The Finance Ministry probably  found  it

could  get more financially in return from renting  its

comparable premises to the public than it had to pay to

Colombo  Court for additional premises that the Foreign

Ministry required. Maybe that is a more relevant answer

to the Member for Telok Blangah's question.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the

Member  for  Moulmein  for being a  spokesman  for  the

Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



of  Finance. Sir, I am sure the Ministry of Finance can

look  after itself, and so can the Ministry of  Foreign

Affairs, I hope.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not a

spokesman for the Ministry of Finance, and neither do I

intend  to  be  a  spokesman on their  behalf  because,

whatever they do, it is very difficult to defend  their

policy.  But what I have just pointed out is some  sort

of  an  illustration of the policy of the  Ministry  of

Finance. It sometimes looks a bit queer to the ordinary

layman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> Sir, it appears to mc that he has

also  become  a  spokesman for  the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the ways of the Government are

sometimes  undiscernible. The  Parliamentary  Secretary

did  not  answer  my question really.  I  have  got  no

quarrel  now that the renting of premises in  Singapore

is  a  temporary measure until such time when  the  PUB

moves  out of the present place. The questions I raised

were:  (1) why not use one of the Government's premises

available? (2) if we are renting them, where  are  they

located, and from whom are we renting?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part about accommodation for overseas

missions,  I thought the prudent way was to buy  rather

than rent. Money paid for rent goes down the drain.  If

it  is not possible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

to  buy  the  premises outright, could they  not  share

premises with our State-owned companies abroad, or with

other statutory boards in certain countries, which have

their own premises or rented premises?



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the

Member has not been paying attention to my answer  just

now.  Together with his colleagues he might  have  been

excited  at the moment when I said that we had acquired

the  extra  premises  in Colombo  Court.  We  do  share

premises at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



moment  in the City Hall with the Ministry of Law,  the

Ministry of Culture, the Prime Minister's Office,  etc.

We  could only acquire part of the PUB building when it

is  available in 1977, if we are lucky. Until then,  we

have  to  find alternative accommodation as a temporary

measure to house our staff in view of the expansion  of

the Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Deputy, Speaker. Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head FA in

respect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have moved this amendment in order to bring

forth  my  own  views regarding some  of  the  policies

adopted  by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and to suggest

some  methods  for  promoting certain  aspects  of  our

foreign policy. Unfortunately, most of the topics I had

intended to speak on had already been very well covered

by  previous  speakers, either  under  the  correct  or

incorrect Head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would, however, continue by saying that over

the  past years the Ministry has conducted its  foreign

policy,  to my mind, with a high degree of imagination,

and this is said not with the intention of praising the

Minister  for  Foreign Affairs or other  Ministers  who

have  been  frequently  outspoken  on  affairs  of  our

foreign   policy.  But  I  am  frequently  amused   and

befuddled  with,  on the one hand,  the  expression  of

Singapore's intention of wanting to remain friends with

all,  enemies with none and, on the other hand, on many

occasions,  particularly  at  memorial  lectures,  with

statements which leave very little for conclusion. I am

particularly troubled because it gives the  lay  public

in  Singapore  only  one  possible  conclusion  -  that

somehow in the 1970's there appears in South-east  Asia

the  MaCarthys or Foster Dulles's. This is  unfortunate

because  of  our declared intentions to remain  friends

with  all.  This is particularly more annoying  because

today we realise that the real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



threat  to  Singapore's security and sovereignty  comes

not  just  from  the Communist countries  or  Communist

elements within these countries but it could well  come

from other vested parties. These parties include either

forces  in  and  around South-east Asia  or  even  some

members  of  the powerful and influential West.  I  can

therefore  understand why Singapore does not  pursue  a

positive  or  dynamic  policy  with  respect   to   the

recognition of China because we want to make it  doubly

sure that our immediate neighbours in this part of  the

world  know in heart and in spirit that we are all  the

way  with  ASEAN and South-east Asia. I think  this  is

correct. On the one hand we are very hesitant,  and  on

the  other  hand,  we  tend to overdo  this  particular

posture  by  coming off with a statement which  may  be

detrimental to our future relations with the  countries

with which we have no relations at the present moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving from that to other aspects of foreign policy, I

would  like to touch on our foreign service. I  realise

that  we have something like five High Commissions  and

10  missions  overseas. Not all of these  missions  are

headed  by  Ambassadors or High Commissioners.  Perhaps

this is because we do not have qualified people. But  I

like  to  think that somehow we have not been  able  to

develop  a  degree of professionalism  in  our  foreign

service.  This is something which perhaps the  Minister

for  Foreign  Affairs could comment. I also  understand

that  there is a pretty high turnover rate of staff  in

the Foreign Ministry. I wonder if the reason is due  to

the  unfavourable salary, awards of fringe benefits.  I

think  members  of the foreign service rightly  deserve

something better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of ASEAN, the Minister for Foreign

Affairs has given us a very rosy picture of the  status

of  ASEAN,  and  I certainly hope he is right.  On  the

other  hand, I have also read some literature on  ASEAN

and I am informed that, in actual fact, of the original

100  proposals or more that were conceived in 1967 with

the formation of ASEAN, not more than 10 per cent of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



these  proposals have come to light. What has  happened

to the 90 per cent?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Coming!



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Coming? I hope so. I certainly

hope  that with time we shall be able to see  the  true

fruition of this big family of ASEAN. I would  like  to

develop  this  topic  a little further.  Unfortunately,

Singaporeans had at one time some connection  with  old

Britannia  and  also  with the English-speaking  world.

Therefore,  many Singaporeans are extremely  conversant

with  what  goes  on in the United States  of  America,

London,  or  up  north  in  Edinburgh,  yet,  the  vast

majority of Singaporeans are ignorant of what  goes  on

in  Indonesia,  in  the  Philippines  or  in  the  Sulu

Islands.  To my mind, to know about these countries  is

more important for the future of Singapore than to know

about  what  goes on in the North Sea or in  the  River

Thames. I think there is a lot that this country can do

to promote the awareness of ASEAN and to foster further

the  concept of regionalism. I am most assured  by  the

statement  made  by  the Minister for  Foreign  Affairs

that, in actual fact, ASEAN is moving faster than  many

other  regional gatherings. This is tremendous. I  hope

it  will  continue to move. But, at the same  time,  we

also recognise that ASEAN has its own problems. We know

that   there  are  differences  between  Malaysia   and

Thailand.  We  know  that of late  there  are  dramatic

differences between the Philippines and Malaysia and, I

am  sure,  between Malaysia and Indonesia.  Happily  we

have no real problems just yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the promotion of travel is a tremendous thing.

This  has  been touched upon earlier on.  But  I  think

there  is more that can really be done. Student  travel

should  be promoted. We have an effective organisation,

such  as  the  People's Association, which can  sponsor

youth groups to visit Indonesia and the Philippines.  I

am  not  concerned about Malaysia because we  can  just

leave  the boys alone. They know where to go. They  can

take  a  drive  up to the West coast of Malaysia.  They

normally stop at Bangkok in Thailand on their way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



to  Europe or to Hong Kong. However, we must stress the

importance  of travel to Indonesia and the Philippines,

certainly to Indonesia, which is our immediate concern.

Secondly,  perhaps as a further step in our  effort  to

promote ASEAN co-operation, I think there is a case for

sending   Singapore's   professional   men   to   ASEAN

countries, and I refer more in particular to our  local

doctors  in  the  Singapore service. [Laughter].  I  am

serious  about this in spite of the laughter.  I  think

there  is a case for us to send our doctors for a  six-month  posting or a year's posting to some ulu part  of

Indonesia.  We can probably achieve much more  in  this

way  than some of the airy-fairy ideas that I have come

across. [Laughter]



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And lecturers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Yes, and some lecturers from the

Department  of  Extra-mural  studies  or  the   Nanyang

University. If they want to join, by all means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I think worth considering right

now   is  in  regard  to  our  institutions  of  higher

learning.  To my knowledge, 25 per cent of the  student

population in Singapore's higher institutions  are,  in

fact,  non  citizens.  It  is  worth  mentioning   that

virtually   the  entire  25  per  cent  are   Malaysian

students.  Figures have been given by the Minister  for

Education showing that a sum amounting to about  $4,000

per  student is subsidised. If we work on the basis  of

10,000 students in the institutions of higher learning,

then   we  have  at  least  2,500  Malaysian  students.

Multiply  that  number by $4,000 and we have  to  spend

something  like  $10 million a year to train  Malaysian

students  in  Singapore.  I am not  against  Malaysians

studying in Singapore. I think we should have  more  of

them. It will help us to foster goodwill and strengthen

our relations with Malaysia. But I think perhaps we can

think  of  dividing  the available places  amongst  the

other  members  of the South-east Asian  community.  We

should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



offer  places to the Indonesian students, the  Filipino

students  and  the Thai students. I am  not  suggesting

that each country be given one-quarter of the available

places,  but that we should offer more scholarships  to

students from these three countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, time is running out, and I would like to hear

some reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from time to

time  we  have heard of people advocating establishment

of  diplomatic relations with the People's Republic  of

China,  and  at  each time we hear from the  Government

that  since we are in ASEAN we should wait, and  so  on

and  so forth, without giving very clear answers. So  I

would  like to find Out whether it is because Singapore

is  regarded by the other ASEAN countries  as  being  a

Third China that we do not want to take the initiative.

It  is not only my personal belief that it is so but it

is  also  the belief from various quarters. So I  would

like to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he

is able to confirm this.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the comments by the

Member for Kim Seng do not require an answer because he

was  telling us how he would run the Foreign  Ministry.

He  was  not  questioning my foreign policy. Therefore,

there  is very little to answer. Nevertheless  I  would

like  to  say that some of his thoughts would be  taken

note  of,  some I would think about, and  some  perhaps

require second thoughts. Anyway, I am grateful  to  the

Member  for  putting forward certain points which  have

been illuminating and for saying some indiscreet things

which I would not have said myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Bras Basah, probably he was

not  here  earlier when one Member did  bring  up  this

question  of  representation and  diplomatic  relations

with  the  People's Republic of China. In my  answer  I

understood that, by watching some of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



nods  to  my reply, they agreed with me. But  obviously

the Member for Bras Basah was not here then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, when the Minister gave his

answer,  I  was present in the Chamber. But the  answer

was   so   sophisticated  that  it  was  not  easy   to

understand.  The  Minister did not make  it  clear.  My

question is: is Singapore still regarded by other ASEAN

countries as being a Third China that we do not want to

take  the  initiative to establish diplomatic relations

with Communist China?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Bras Basah

himself is sophisticated. That is precisely the  point.

I  think he understood my reply, more or less as he had

summarised,  or he has asked a rhetorical question.  In

view  of  that, Sir, there is no need to  make  further

comment.  But, of course, I am quite sure that  at  the

next Budget session the same question will come up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, in view of what I would

consider  a  non-reply  from the Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs, I beg leave to withdraw.
