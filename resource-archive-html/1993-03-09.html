  <!-- Mr Robert Chua Teck Chew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Robert Chua Teck Chew (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this debate on the 1993 Budget.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is running in a marathon of the world economies and we can imagine this marathon to have started just after the war. But if we look at the participants, they are in clusters, almost like the real marathon. Right up front, we have the developed economies of the world - United States, Japan and most of the west European countries. Just behind them are the NIEs (newly industrializing economies) such as Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. But just behind the second group, we have the developing NIEs, as they are sometimes called, such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and China. Further down the track, we have the less developed economies such as the African economy, Vietnam and so on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are about half way through this marathon and we should take stock of what is happening. Upfront, the developed economies have been running a very fast race but they are slowing down. But they are still far ahead. The second group, the NIEs, are still running at a fairly fast pace, trying
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to catch up with the first group. But the third group is running very fast. Somehow they took off a bit slowly but now they are catching up. Unfortunately, far behind, is a group of slower developing or less developed economies. We are in the second group. As we try to catch up with the first group, let us take stock of where we are, and how we can get there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy was growing fairly fast after the last recession. But in the last two years we have slowed down. I believe that, like in any race, we have to know how we stand and how we can forge ahead. We have to look at whether we are truly strong or we have too much fat that we should shed or trim. Do we have the right skills and techniques and the stamina to go on? In the long race, we usually have some reserve so that we can at least make the second half of the marathon. Do we make good use of that reserve?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Budget that the Finance Minister has presented to us marks a very important major reform in our tax system which should help us to spur ahead and catch up with the developed economies. In fact, I would describe the 1993 Budget as a watershed budget. It is best described as a pro-growth budget aimed at rewarding entrepreneurship, work effort and companies which take commercial risks abroad. The introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), though painful initially, is a move in the right direction as it would result in a more balanced fiscal system in terms of our reliance on direct and indirect taxes for Government revenue and its treatment of income and consumption. I hope that the tax reform will provide the necessary stimulus to propel Singapore forward in this race of the world economies so that Singapore can catch up with the leaders in the super league.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I move that not enough attention has been given to the problems facing the manufacturing sector. In 1992, the manufacturing sector grew by only
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 2.3% compared with 5.8% for the whole economy. Total employment in the sector declined by 13,100 jobs and the index for unit business cost of the manufacturing sector is at an all-time high of 119.2. This is higher than the level of 114.3 when Singapore entered into a recession in 1985. The same is true of the unit labour cost. Our relative unit labour cost has also been rising since 1989 and we are now close to the 1984 level when measured against the other newly industrializing economies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profit share as a percentage of nominal GDP has also fallen from 52.2% in 1988 to 46.2% in 1992. If the manufacturing sector continues to grow at a lacklustre pace compared to the overall economic growth, the sector's share of GDP will fall to about 22% by the year 2000. May I ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute a table which I have prepared for your reference? [Copies of Table distributed to hon. Members]. I have painted three scenarios of the manufacturing sector growing at half the rate of the GDP assuming that the GDP grows by 4-6%. You will see that by the year 2000, the share of manufacturing of the GDP would have fallen to about 22%. If that continues, it would be less than 20% in the next century. In fact, I would like to draw the attention of Members to 1991 and 1992. In that period, the manufacturing share of GDP actually dropped from 27.4% to 26.5%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above indicators suggest that the manufacturing sector is at the verge of entering into the economic danger zone. We risk the danger of losing our competitiveness and slipping into a permanent era of slower growth unless the Government takes bold policy measures to reverse the decline of the manufacturing sector. The experience of the United Kingdom is instructive. Recently, the British Prime Minister, Mr John Major, admitted that Britain had made a mistake in allowing the manufacturing sector to decline. He felt that the present British government must take a different attitude towards manufacturing. We should learn from the British experience. However, I am confident that the Singapore Government
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will not make the same mistake. The manufacturing community was very much encouraged last year when the then Minister for Trade and Industry made the firm commitment that the manufacturing sector would remain as one of the key pillars or mainstays of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe that more should and can be done to help the manufacturing sector regain its competitiveness internationally and reverse the above unhealthy trends. One of the major concerns of manufacturers is rising labour cost. Unit labour cost has been rising because productivity increases continue to lag wage increases. We must find more innovative ways to increase productivity at both the company and industry level through quality and skills upgrading programmes. I would like to suggest that the Government give more tax incentives and grants for companies to set up in-house training facilities or group training centres at the industry level. This will ensure that the skills acquired by our workers are relevant to the job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More funds from the general Government budget should also be allocated for such purposes as collection from the Skills Development Fund would not be sufficient to meet all our training needs. I am personally against raising the rate of the SDF contribution as it represents a tax on the business community and an added cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue that must be addressed by the Government quickly is the falling share of profits to nominal GDP. Over the last few years, the profit share of nominal GDP has been falling from 52.2% in 1988 to 46.2% in 1992. The declining share of profit may be attributed to keener competition in the international market and the rising cost of doing business in Singapore. This is a cause for concern. Why? It means that manufacturing is becoming less profitable, earning lower rates of return on investment and becoming less attractive as an investment option. We are also concerned because lower profits mean less internally generated funds for new investment in machinery,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> technology, skills training and research and development and also for venturing abroad with new investments and for new markets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures from the gross fixed capital formation showed that investment in machinery and equipment fell by 2.2% in 1992. While we appreciate the 3% reduction in corporate tax rate and the 25% property tax rebate, manufacturers would like to see more action taken to address the issue of falling profit share of GDP. In addition, bold measures are needed to address the problem of rising unit business cost. Thus, it is time for the Singapore Government to embark on a total review of business costs, such as rentals, utilities, health care, labour, transportation and various Government levies such as the foreign worker levy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, I would like the Government to re-examine our land pricing policies. One of the major concerns of Singapore manufacturers in 1992, as revealed by a recent SMA survey on the "Manufacturing Operations in Singapore" was rising rentals. Rentals rose by 11% in 1992, which is much higher than increases in labour cost. While the manufacturers welcome the property tax rebate of 25% announced in the 1993 Budget it must be noted that the rebate will only partially offset the higher property tax paid by many businesses due to the upward revaluation by the Property Tax Department of industrial properties over the last few years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising industrial rentals appear to stem from the Government policy of applying market forces to the pricing of land. We all agree that market forces should determine prices. However, the price mechanism would not yield optimal results in situations where externalities exist. Such externalities cause a divergence between the social and private valuation of a product. Where positive externalities exist, market forces will result in under production at a higher price.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For industrial land, I believe that market forces cannot be used entirely to determine its price. Compared with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> residential land, industrial land creates positive externalities as it helps to generate jobs and income over a long period of time. It is a factor of production which contributes positively to the wealth creation process in Singapore. Therefore, industrial land generates social benefits for Singapore. Thus, leaving the pricing of industrial land to market forces will result in less than optimal provision. It is natural that industrial land will always be valued lower than the price of residential land. Although the industrial land fetches a lower price than residential land, we must encourage more allocation of our scarce land resources for industrial purposes as it generates jobs and income. It must also be priced at an internationally competitive rate so that foreign investors will continue to consider Singapore as an attractive investment location.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to other aspects of the 1993 Budget. The need for Singapore to build an external economy is an important economic strategy for the 1990s. It is needed if we want to catch up with the leaders in the super league. The various tax incentives announced in the 1993 Budget to promote an external economy are very timely and most welcome. I am glad that the Minister for Finance heeded the requests of businesses to provide tax incentives to help them venture abroad.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers also welcome the cap on deductions for medical expenses. It is a wise move to force both employers and employees to become more cost conscious in consuming medical services. However, the implementation of the capping will require the cooperation of unions, employees and employers to look for innovative ways of managing their health care needs. At the same time, to ensure that such capping does not deprive employees of their existing medical benefits, there is also a need to find ways of keeping down the cost of providing medical benefits in Singapore. In other words, we must pay special attention to both the demand and supply sides in managing the health care costs in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in corporate tax rate by 3% for Year of Assessment 1994 is a welcome move and will help to partially reverse the declining after-tax profit share of GDP. The reduction will also help to keep the corporate tax rate in Singapore internationally competitive. The business community is looking forward to further reduction in corporate tax to 25%. This should be done as quickly as possible as it is still far above the rate of 17% in Hong Kong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch on the GST. The business community welcomes the various measures and rebates introduced by the Minister for Finance to offset the unfavourable impact of the GST on the lower income groups. This will help to dampen the pressure for wage increases arising from the higher cost of living contributed by the GST. Given the already high cost of doing business in Singapore, businesses must be spared any additional cost burden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of GST, special attention should be given to the problems of small enterprises in complying with the requirements of the GST. Although the Ministry of Finance exempts all small businesses with an annual turnover below $1 million from the GST, the proportion of small businesses opting for exemption will be lower since there will be pressure from registered customers to demand that these small enterprises also register for GST so that they can claim refund for the GST paid. This can be a serious problem as the experience of New Zealand and a number of other countries showed that the GST always encouraged large companies to deal with large companies, often at the expense of smaller businesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help small businesses register and comply with the requirements of the GST, I would like to propose that the Government provide grants and other financial assistance to help SMEs computerise and upgrade their accounting systems to meet the requirements. The GST is also likely to confer unfavourable cash flow on export-oriented companies. For companies where the total value of direct exports exceed their value added, the input tax
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> will always exceed the output tax. For such export-oriented companies, I would like to suggest that the Ministry of Finance grant exemption for GST on their imported raw materials if the company provides an undertaking that such raw materials are destined for export.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to request that the Ministry of Finance consider the refund of any tax credit within 14 days of submission of the GST return. This will ensure that export-oriented industries will not be further penalised for complying with the GST.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Budget is truly a sensible one for the transition to a consumption-based tax system, as well as one which will ensure the continuation of our low inflationary economic growth of recent years. The Minister has gone to great pains to compare our public expenditure with many countries, including Hong Kong, where he took greater pains to explain why our taxes are much higher than Hong Kong's. Unfortunately, Sir, it is a cruel cold world outside there. Out there, nobody cares a damn why our taxes are higher.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The captains of industry in the capital cities of the world look only at the bottom line. Is it worth while to be in Singapore or is it worth while to be in Hong Kong? We are being compared constantly. It is not strange because we are very much like Hong Kong, city states with a foreign hinterland, no natural resources except for a well educated population, hardworking and productive, first class infrastructural facilities, and so on and so forth. Their decision to invest in Hong Kong or Singapore will be based on the bottom line - how competitive we are to Hong Kong. They will consider factors such as corporate tax, personal income tax, labour cost, land cost, utilities cost, government bureaucracy, labour productivity and so forth, not why our taxes are higher than Hong Kong's. So
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> how competitive are we compared to Hong Kong? That, Sir, is the key factor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is fully aware of that. He knows that comparison will be made by those who matter, including those who decide whether to use Singapore or Hong Kong as the base to invest in other parts of Asia. Yes, there are many areas in which Hong Kong and Singapore are complementary. But in many others, we will always be in competition. To truly succeed, we must be, overall, more competitive than Hong Kong. It is not enough for the Minister to brush aside the competition posed by Hong Kong with a statement that it is impossible for Singapore to emulate Hong Kong's example. We must try!
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benchmarking is a strategy adopted by many successful companies to push ahead. We should also use benchmarks to progress. Just as there are other countries using us as a benchmark in some areas, we must be prepared to use Hong Kong as a benchmark in others, not least their low tax regime. It is difficult, Sir, but then nobody has ever said that being the Minister for Finance is an easy job.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on promotion of an external economy, do not get me wrong about Hong Kong. There are many areas in which we can learn from Hong Kong. Similarly, there are also many areas from which we should distance ourselves. And the suggestion to dismantle our so-called safety nets to create a Hong Kong-like environment in order to produce entrepreneurs is certainly one suggestion to ignore. It is a very seductive argument but I would like to urge the Government not to be lured into the thinking that the only way to succeed is to create the adverse conditions to separate the wheat from the chaff. The safety nets are our strengths, not our weaknesses. History has had many successful men advocating that, because they have succeeded despite the odds, perhaps even because of the odds, their way is the only way. Let the cream rise, they say.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the ugly side of capitalism. We must never fall into the trap. While we advocate the principles of free market enterprise and the pursuit of individual
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> excellence, we must never get carried away by our own rhetoric. This Government is not stupid. This Government has built up Singapore based on caring for the weak, compassion for the less fortunate and support for the poor with many opportunities for those who want to rise above their original stations in life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create more entrepreneurs, it is not necessary to give up our safety nets, because they are more than safety nets. They are the bedrock foundations of our society, the Singaporean society. In a short space of time of only slightly over 30 years, we have created a Singaporean nation out of a motley group of immigrants. This came about because of our bedrock foundations, because they give us a base to go forward, a base to plan our future and our children's future. They give us stability, certainty and a sense of permanence upon which we can plan. Remove these edifices, we remove the foundations of our nationhood.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have taken a different route from Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan to where we are today. MNCs have helped to make us economically successful. If the result of this is that Singapore has insufficient entrepreneurs willing to take risks outside Singapore, I disagree.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may, I would like to ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute some Tables to hon. Members. [Copies of Tables distributed to hon. Members.] In fact, if we look at Tables 1 and 2, in a recent study by the Department of Statistics, the Tables, show that:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Factor income earned from abroad by Singapore residents and companies in Singapore increased from $125 million in 1960 to $12.9 billion in 1992. Compared to GDP, ie, the income generated in the domestic economy, income generated from overseas had grown at a faster rate. While GDP had grown at an average annual rate of 12% between 1960 and 1992, income earned overseas had grown by an annual rate of 16% during the same period.' Of course, the reason why our GNP is marginally larger than our GDP is not because income earned abroad is small. At 17% of GNP in 1992, it cannot be considered small. But that factor income
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> paid to non-residents is also large as shown in Table 2. It is due to our policy of promoting foreign investments in Singapore leading to non-residents taking up an increasing proportion of the income generated in Singapore's domestic economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even so, as the Minister has said, it is not enough. We must encourage more overseas investments, especially when the pickings in our region are so bountiful. I agree, but it is too soon to elaborate much in this area. We should wait for Commodore Teo Chee Hean's report. Whilst doing so, I would like to offer my thoughts on three areas to the Minister of State:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Government, the public sector, must change its mindset. In today's world where economic progress is the name of the game, it must be fully prepared to play its role as a business partner of the private sector. The vestiges of the civil service as a mandarinate, inherited from the British and reinforced by Chinese traditional values, must be banished. Too often, the prevailing thinking in the service is "entrepreneurs equal businessmen equal crooks." Hence, if a businessman comes up with a suggestion, look for the hidden benefits for him. Reject the suggestion if you can find any. If you don't, reject it anyway, since any suggestion from him must be for his own good and therefore at the expense of the general public.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not asking for a lowering of standards, but rather a fair chance for business to be listened to and respected, not only at the political level but at every level where it has to interact with the public sector. Japan has shown the way that when business and the government cooperate in the form of Japan Inc., it can conquer the world. Singapore has done it another way - by the Government taking over the business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my second point is businessmen do not need much incentive to venture overseas, not if there are profits to be made. If they do, they would more likely than not lose, not profit. More importantly for them is that they be allowed to enjoy the fruits of their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ventures, especially enjoying them, ie, the fruits, in Singapore, their homeland. Making money in Singapore and giving the Singapore Government a 30% cut of their profits is, I suppose, considered acceptable. The Singapore Government has earned its share by its excellent governance of Singapore. But giving it 30% of the profits, or later on, 27% of the profits, remitted from overseas where the risks are much higher and the Singapore Government's contribution lesser, that is another question altogether. The Government is aware of this. But it is only prepared to give exemption to those who applied, on a case-by-case basis. This is not good enough, Sir. Nobody, Sir, if he can help it, wants to see the taxman with lots of information. So, in addition to whatever scheme already in place, why not simply reduce tax on remitted income to 10% across the board?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the Minister should consider allowing the combining of all sources of businesses in a company regardless of whether or not a particular source has started producing income. Sir, let me give you an example on this. Assume that a company has two sources of business, say, A and B. If A is profitable and B is still new and not profitable, the losses accruing from B cannot be offsett against the profits from A. There are, of course, many variations in each and every case, but what I have just stated is the basic principle adopted by IRAS. If the Government wants to encourage entrepreneurs to venture into new areas, including overseas, obviously allowing this offset is one of them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third area is one of non-financial assistance. The Government should use its resources to establish an information and research centre on overseas economies, markets, opportunities, etc. The Japanese, through MITI, is reputed to have the best dossier on world markets. The Australians are now also in the game, having announced a package to penetrate into Asia, the centre piece of which is an Asia Economic Centre to provide analysis of Asian economies to Australian firms.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the assistance by the Government in this area should also involve all our foreign missions where each and every mission
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes a Singaporean business centre overseas, helping to arrange meetings with Government officials and businessmen of the host countries, providing information and the like. Appropriate business-minded officers prepared to help even the smallest businessman from Singapore should also be made permanent members of every foreign mission.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>GST.</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past in this Chamber, I have argued against the imposition of a consumption tax. It is not that I am against a tax levied on consumption, but I am against the regressive nature of a simple consumption tax. Hence, I have urged for an expenditure tax which basically retains the progressive concept in the taxing of consumption.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that a consumption tax such as the GST will increase our tax base and permit the lowering of taxes on income, thereby making us more competitive. Unfortunately, while economic success, especially in the brave new world order, demands the law of the jungle, the survival of the fittest, how we will be judged by history as a civilised society will be on how we take care of our poor, our downtrodden, our less fortunate and our underprivileged.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, I must say that my fears of the unfair and regressive nature of the GST have been more than amply answered by the Minister for Finance in his current budget package. The Minister has gone overboard to ensure that nobody suffers during the next five years in the transition to a GST based system of taxation. If anybody is missed out, Sir, it is certainly not by intent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Opposition's cry that the budget discriminates against the middle-class is put to rest by the set of tax savings figures by Arthur Andersen. Sir, I refer to Table 3 in my set of tables sent out. Looking at the figures, a middle income earner with an annual income of $30,000 has a tax saving of $826 per annum. This translates at a GST of 3% into an annual expenditure of $27,533 or
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 92% of his annual income. It is unlikely that he would spend such a high percentage of his gross income. If he spends less, he is better-off under the new system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the $70,000 per annum earner, his tax savings of $1,066 translates into an annual expenditure of $35,533 or about $3,000 per month. Would he spend so much? If not, again, he is better-off under the new system.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not go into details as there will be ample time to air them when the GST Bill comes up for its Second Reading. At this juncture, I would just want to say that the fear of profiteering by the general public is real. Experience of what happened in the past when prices went up on the slightest pretext, with much Government inaction, has much to do with the present state of affairs. So I think the Government must do more than just giving assurances.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Encouraging Singaporeans to own shares.</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that once you teach a person how to be smart, you cannot, later on, teach him how to be stupid. In other words, Sir, while I subscribe to the idea of encouraging Singaporeans to invest in our soon to be privatised blue chip Government companies, the Government must be prepared to accept that sooner or later these same Singaporeans are also going to invest in other companies listed on the Stock Exchange. And when one invests in shares, he can also lose. There is no guarantee of profits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must, therefore, start educating the people on these basic truths. Otherwise, when people lose their hard earned money in the stock exchange, we may have a repeat of what happened several years ago in Kuwait and, more recently, in Taiwan. Then, when the stock markets collapsed, there was great clamour from the man-in-the-street investors to have their governments compensate them for their losses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stock market crashes of 1973, 1985 and 1989 in Singapore, investors
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> were then fewer and more sophisticated. They knew that such were the risks of stock investments. Should this happen again in future, with many more man-in-the-street investors, would investors then be so knowledgeable and understanding?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profits from share investments, of course, include capital gains as well as dividends. Obviously, when more investors are attracted to a market, the likelihood of higher prices for the shares listed in that market also increases. This usually attracts more companies to be listed which, in turn, attracts more investors. This is a common phenomenon of a growing market place. Supply and demand feed on themselves. It is good for investors. My question is: Is the Stock Exchange of Singapore good for investors?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once we were the second largest market in Asia outside Japan; behind Hong Kong, and depending on which measures you use, we were even ahead of Hong Kong. Now, we are fourth after Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Thailand. Sir, I refer to Table 4. Our place in the sun in this field appears to be getting shadier and shadier.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has led to this decline? I am afraid it is not a single dimensional problem and there are many answers. But when institutional investors shun our market for others in Asia, when local investors buy foreign instead of local shares of our own companies, when companies go to overseas exchanges for its public listing after being told informally that they were not good enough for the Singapore main board, when good local companies do not wish to be listed because in the words of a successful local entrepreneur, "I do not mind being a fish in a gold fish bowl, but what I do mind is being told how to swim", then I say, Sir, that something is not quite right in the state of Denmark.
  <br>
  <br>
  <i>Cap on Deduction for medical expenses.</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that we should tackle the problem while it is still not pressing. Besides this fiscal measure, the Government has and will continue to put
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in place many programmes to encourage healthy living, emphasise primary health care and reduce health costs. However, I think as a fiscal measure, the proposed cap is inadequate. It puts the initiative on employers when very often medical expenditure is beyond their control. Very often, besides health care givers, the employees are the ones in charge. They are the ones to fall ill and the ones to decide when they would visit the doctor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Government to consider the following:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Allow companies to set up a trust fund called "Medical Benefits Fund". Contributions from companies up to 2% of total employees' remuneration should be tax deductible as proposed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Employees are not required to contribute to the Fund, but if the Fund runs short, employees and employers should contribute to the Fund. Tax deductibility will still be capped at 2% for employers' contributions, while employees' contributions should be made tax deductible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Fund could be jointly managed by employers and employees. All income accruing to the Fund should be made tax free.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Fund would be used for medical expenses of employees, including the purchase of health insurance schemes for employees. In order to encourage all to take care of their health, a system of cash rebates could be given to those employees incurring little or no medical expenditure. Such cash rebates should be tax free.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I apologise for the complexity of my proposal. But we now live in a more affluent society with more varied needs. In order to cater to such a variety of needs, often a simplistic approach may not be adequate. My proposal has the advantage of putting the issue squarely on the shoulders of those in control of their health. It also does not reduce the level of medical benefits currently enjoyed by the workers.
  <br>

  <br>
  <i>Separate Assesments for Married Women</i>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on separate assessment for married women on all income, I am afraid that in the light of GST and going abroad, this is a much overlooked item. But I must say that I welcome this proposal as it finally treats a woman as an economic person in her own right. I am glad that the Finance Minister has taken this first step. I would like to ask when he would take the second step, ie, recognising women employees in the Civil Service as economic persons in their own rights - that they be not discriminated in medical benefits for their spouses and their children.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Finance Minister on his budget proposals, which this year were wide-ranging and, in the case of the GST-related package, showed a lot of careful thought and care for the impact of the new tax system on the poor. The Minister is also to be commended for the innovative scheme of enlarging the assets of Singaporeans by topping up their CPF accounts to allow them to buy shares. Home makers, the majority of whom are women, welcome this news as their contribution to the GDP often goes unrecognised. Now they can also participate directly in the prosperity of the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his budget speech, the Minister pointed out that for Singapore to maintain strong economic growth in the long term, new policy directions would be necessary. I want to seize this point and ask the Minister, indeed the Prime Minister and his entire Cabinet, to give new thought to a matter which has till now been treated in a fragmented, unsatisfactory way. And this is the question of how we are to bring into balance our economic and social needs. How we can pursue both economic growth rates and full and happy family lives? It is a matter that is crying out for new policy directions.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I surely do not need to explain why good family life must go hand in hand with good economic growth. Why do we work so hard but to provide more for our families? Why are we as a nation seeking strong economic growth but to ensure greater prosperity, an ever improving quality of life for our children and their children? Each of us in this House knows the value of a happy family. In our competitive and demanding world, a warm, strong family life provides security and stability for children; emotional support for wives and husbands, care and comfort for aged relatives in the twilight of their lives.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation, we have declared the sanctity of the family as a matter of primary importance: one of our five core values states that the family is the basic unit of society. Just as the continued prosperity of our nation depends on the productivity of each of us, the strength of our social fabric lies in Singapore having happy, healthy families which give support and strength to the individual.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then do we continue to see family responsibilities as peripheral to our economic life? Why do so many women have to struggle with the double-burden of earning an income and keeping a family together? Why is it still the women who have to shoulder the bulk of the task of raising children and making a home? Why have we, as a society, been so slow in making those changes in attitudes, in behaviour, and in policies which will allow Singaporeans - and especially women - to find a better balance between the demands of the workplace and of the home?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women of the earlier generations may have been happy to play home maker. They mostly had little education and were content to be wives and mothers. But women today are in a very different situation. Labour-scarce Singapore needs women in the workforce. And many Singapore women need to work because their husbands cannot earn enough for the family.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government statistics show that 40% of working men earn less than $1,000 a month. In most cases, this is not enough for a household's needs. The 1987/88 Household Expenditure Survey showed that households with less than $1,000 in monthly income usually spent more than they earned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, many of the 630,000 women in our workforce are there out of sheer necessity - their families need the extra income. And for the vast majority of these women, a foreign maid to help look after the home and the children is totally unaffordable. We have some 700,000 households in Singapore, while there were - at last count made public by the Government - about 65,000 foreign maids. That means 90% of our households do not have the luxury of paid domestic help. Which means that, in many, if not all of these households, it is the women who must look after the home and the family. And, all too often, she must also go out to work in order to boost the household income. Our female labour force participation rate is 51%, and half of these women are married.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me try, Mr Speaker, Sir, to give the House an idea of what an average day in the lives of such women is like.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.00 am: Wakes up. Let the others sleep on a bit while she prepares breakfast. Wakes husband, wakes children. Feeds baby, feeds children, feeds husband. Makes beds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.30 am: Takes children down to school bus. Goes back to her kitchen to prepare children's lunch when they return from school. Tidies house, washes dishes, hangs out clothes to dry, prepares bag of nappies and toys for baby.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's getting late. Baby cries, changes nappy. Locks up the flat and, carrying baby, walks to bus stop with husband. Bus comes, husband settles in for a long ride to work. Wife gets off two stops away near baby-sitter's flat. Tells sitter about baby's medication. Goes back to bus stop and head for work.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.00 am: Baby-sitter calls to check about medication. Wonders whether to scoot from work. But better not, because already taken two days emergency leave this month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.00 pm: Heavy rain starts. Wonders whether children are safely back from school. Did they take in the clothes before the rain came? Are they doing their homework?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resists urge to call children. Calls baby-sitter instead. Baby is having a nap, thankfully.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son calls. Settles fight between him and his sister. Turns back to her typing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Husband calls. Reminds her to buy toothpaste. She reminds him to go to POSB.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.00 pm: First bus is packed. Second bus has standing room. Long ride to the baby-sitter's flat. Sitter complains that she is late again in picking up baby.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes to provision shop. Buys toothpaste, cooking oil, and other items. Heavy shopping bag in one hand, heavy baby in another, walks to bus stop.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily bus is early. Squeezes in, arms aching from her loads. Gets home. Husband is back already and is reading the papers. Children are fighting again. She shouts at them. Asks daughter to look after baby. Daughter grumbles.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooks dinner. Baby cries. Husband picks up baby. She tells daughter to set table. Calls husband and children to come and eat.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no time to eat. Baby cries again. Takes baby to room and puts him to sleep. Husband washes dishes. She mops floor, checks children's homework and school bags. Tells them to stop watching TV and get to bed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are asleep. Husband watches TV. She watches too while ironing clothes. Too tired to finish ironing. Joins husband in front of the TV.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cuddle. Husband wants sex. Too tired. They fight. It is the same old argument.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tells her to stop working. She says they need her income. And she does not want to have to ask him for every cent she needs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They go to bed. She cannot sleep immediately. Worries about whether she is becoming a huang lian po (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (or yellow-faced hag).
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, perhaps some of the Members in this House agree with the husband. Perhaps they too feel it would be better for this woman to stop work because then she would be a better wife and mother.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the truth is, Mr Speaker, many women do leave the workforce in order to concentrate on their work in the home. In 1991, 16,000 women quit their jobs because of the demands of child care and housework. Unlike in many of the developed countries, most of these women never return to the workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these women are happy to stay at home and raise families. Others quit work reluctantly. They fear they will lose touch with the world of work, they wonder whether they will one day regret the personal sacrifices they are making for the benefit of their families. At the back of their minds, in the depths of their hearts, they may feel they are being trapped into doing something they do not really want.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the country, meanwhile, there is the loss on the investment in the education and training of these women. There are today more than 400,000 women whose full-time work is in the home. This figure does not include retirees, and those too old or too ill to work, and those who are full-time students.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 30%, or 130,000, of these 400,000 women have at least secondary education. They could be mobilised for full or part-time work in our labour-short economy. But they will need help in managing the dual-burden of the demands of a job and of a home and family. They will need help from their husbands, from their employers, from the Government, from our society as a whole. And it is time that we here in this
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> highest policy-making body in Singapore paid attention to this need.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to recall the words of our then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, back in 1975 when he spoke at the occasion to mark International Woman's Year - this was organised by NTUC. Mr Lee said, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Societies which do not educate and use half their potential because they are women are those which will be worse off. Those that do and face up to the problems of new social and family relationships to help working wives to bring up the next generation are those most likely to provide better lives for their people.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words, Mr Speaker, were spoken almost 20 years ago. They are even more relevant today. Have we, since then, faced up to these problems? I submit, Sir, that we have not. We have merely tinkered with policies here, taken half-hearted steps towards change there. We have tackled the very real problems of new social and family relationships in an incomplete, fragmented, and unsatisfactory way.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, we have had a string of committees and task forces which have, in one way or another, put their minds to the matter of women in the workforce, and the attendant adjustments needed in policies, attitudes, and facilities. Some of their recommendations have been implemented, but too many have either been forgotten or have received mere lip service.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refresh Members' memories.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1985, the National Productivity Board published the report of the Task Force on Female Participation in the Labour Force. The report emphasised the need to draw more women into the workforce and retain them there.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, we had the far-reaching Economic Committee, whose report laid out the steps Singapore would have to take to get out of the recession and which also looked at the longer-term policies needed for the nation's economic progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many papers generated by the Committee was one on manpower, and this again emphasised the need to get more women to work. The report acknowledged that many women stopped working because of child care and household responsibilities. The Committee suggested this problem be tackled in two ways: (a) Modify the attitudes and behaviour of society; and (b) Reconcile home and work responsibilities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also proposed several steps that could be taken, and I have summarised these along with the recommendations of the NPB Task Force. They are: (1) a public awareness programme; (2) changes in the education system to promote the virtues of sharing of housework as well as equality of the sexes; (3) professional associations, trade unions, and employers should work towards the elimination of sexual discrimination; (4) quality and affordable child care arrangements, including pre-school and before and after-school centres; (5) leave schemes and work schedules tailored to working mother's needs; (6) training and retraining of women.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, other committees have made similar proposals. For instance, in 1989, the Advisory Council on Youth called for: (1) schools to teach children the importance of preparing for their future roles as spouses and responsible parents; (2) more child care centres to be located within high-density housing estates, and in large corporations, Government ministries and statutory boards; (3) an intensifying and upgrading of training and child care staff.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the Advisory Council on Family and Community Life, also in 1989, called for: (1) the special sick child care leave scheme to be extended to fathers; (2) employers to be more family-friendly; (3) a five-day work week to allow workers more time for their families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what has happened to all these proposals? Is anyone following up on them? Or are the reports just gathering dust on Ministers' and civil servants' shelves?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is time for us to stop making these half-hearted attempts to solve what is a national problem. We are now at a stage of our development when we need to bring our economic and social lives into closer harmony. We want Singaporeans to be efficient, productive workers; we also want them to be better-rounded, able to appreciate the arts, hobbies, sporting activities. And we want them to be good parents, to build secure and happy families.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government runs advertisements in the media encouraging young Singaporeans to marry early and start families. We have the Social Development Unit, the Social Development Section, the Social Promotion Section, all busily trying to get young Singaporeans married. This is all very well, but are we doing enough to ensure that the young women we are pushing into marriage will not be saddled with the double burden of work and home responsibilities? And are our attitudes and policies changing in such a way that our young men will enter marriage ready for their role as a considerate husband and caring father? For it is this, Mr Speaker, that young women today expect in a marriage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I believe that the time has come for the Prime Minister himself to take ownership of the task of finding ways to bring Singaporeans' work and family lives into closer harmony and balance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of work and family responsibilities requires a national strategy, and the clout of someone at the very top to ensure that recommendations are implemented fully and sincerely at all levels to make up for a generation of lost time. And that someone should be the Prime Minister.

  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate. This year's budget announced by the Finance Minister is a bonanza budget. It is comprehensive, well thought out and no one should feel neglected.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly with the approach taken by the Government. Despite having done well in the past, we have not become complacent. We are forging ourselves ahead against the competing regional economies. What we are trying to do, and to do we must, is to continue with the momentum of growth.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strategy for staying ahead is to distance ourselves further away from our competitors. Our competitors are ever so ready to want to catch up on us. They want to overtake us.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not allow our success to delude us into complacency. There are those who always want us to cast our eyes on the huge surpluses and reserves and to rest on our laurels. That would be the surest way to go downhill which we must avoid at all cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoy full employment today, in fact, over-employment. I fear that Singaporean stake this happy state of affairs for granted. We seem to have a very short memory. Yes, we recovered all too quickly from the recession of 1985 and 1986 where there were retrenchment, unemployment and uncertainty. Let us be reminded that this can happen yet again, but the question is for how long.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need both foreign and local investments to expand our economy. We want to continue to have more and better paid jobs for our people. Thousands of our young Singaporeans are graduating from the universities, polytechnics, technical institutes and schools each year. More are qualifying into polytechnics and universities. We need to provide new and better jobs for them. Our population is aging. We need to help retain the older workers in the workforce to earn a good living.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With jobs come income, and income comes the purchasing power. Creating
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and providing more and better paid jobs should be our focus and priority. The fiscal measures proposed do just that. It is right to reduce the corporate tax rate and the personal income tax rate to maintain the competitive edge and to be able to expand our economy further.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fail to understand the suggestion by Mr Low Thia Khiang yesterday that the reduced corporate tax rate benefits the big companies and discriminates against the medium and small-sized enterprises. There are also large companies which do less well and will benefit less from the reduced corporate tax rate. Making little or no profit does not depend on the size of the company.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that this is a good time to introduce the GST, a time when we have strong economic growth, the people are gainfully employed and inflation low. Basically, our people can afford to pay the taxes on goods and services consumed. The GST will encourage thrift and prudent financial management of household expenditure. We end up paying less taxes by being frugal in our expenditure. I do not think we should wait, as Mr Chiam has suggested, until Singaporeans are out of work and the country in a recession to introduce GST to prop up the economy. It will be too late for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to speak on the 2% cap on tax deductions for medical benefits. I wish to support the 2% cap on medical expenditure for tax deduction by companies. The tax policy on medical expenditure is not really to deny and restrict the provision of medical benefits for staff. What this novel item does is to alert both the employers and the employees of the impending danger of medical costs rising out of control and causing wage bills to increase and leading business operations to become uncompetitive and unprofitable. Both the company and the staff will suffer as a result.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions have asked that the existing medical benefits enjoyed by the workers be left untouched, whilst the employers have requested that a cost-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> sharing approach be adopted for the excess medical expenditure beyond the 2% cap.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many companies have not yet reached the 2% level. The majority are, in fact, incurring about 1% of the payroll on medical bills. The big item of medical expenditure is really the hospitalisation cost. It would be productive if the employers and the unions can objectively review and reach a consensus as to what constitutes the appropriate ward eligibility for each category of staff. This, in itself, will contain medical expenditure on hospitalisation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies have implemented the flexible wage system for staff. The objective of the flexible wage system is to keep wage cost at a competitive level and when the company makes good profits, the profits are shared with the staff with commensurate increases in bonuses. I believe the flexible wage system provides a good avenue for the 2% capping on medical expenditure to be incorporated into the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, the CPF Top-up Scheme. Many Singaporeans somehow do not view favourably the holding of stocks and shares as good returns on their investments. Many prefer to take short-term profits because of the volatility of the stock market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, corporatisation and the listing of companies in the Stock Exchange of Singapore has a relatively short history. It is only in recent years that we see more and more Singaporeans being made directors of public-listed companies. This is part of the process of learning, growing and maturing. I believe we are reaching a stage where corporate boards are becoming more established and formidable in facing the fierce competition in the market place both locally and internationally.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the CPF Top-up Scheme is really part of the public education programme to get Singaporeans to buy and hold shares in reputable public-listed companies like the Singapore Telecom. Through their investments, Singaporeans can understand better the world of competition, productivity and profitability.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 100,000 Singaporeans who work regularly but do not contribute to CPF. We must do everything possible to get these Singaporeans to contribute to CPF and to look after themselves and their families in housing, medical care and old age provisions. To me, the CPF Top-up Scheme serves this worthy objective of bringing as many working Singaporeans as possible to contribute to CPF.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights):</b> Sir, the Budget Statement this year is both very encouraging and generous. It is also very clear in purpose and that is, to promote an external economy and to provide cushion for the proposed GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to address only one point and that is the nagging fear of the man-in-the-street that prices will increase when the GST is implemented next year and by more than 3% as anticipated by the Government. I think the Government should do two things. First, do more to allay the fear, real or perceived, of the people, and second, ensure adequate checks and balances are in place against profiteering.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps, it is useful to look at some empirical evidence on GST, or VAT. The February issue of the Bulletin, an Australian magazine, quoted a study by Alan Tait, Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department of International Monetary Fund. Mr Tait explored the inflationary consequences of value added tax in his 1988 book, "Value Added Tax: International Practice and Problems". Tait examined changes in consumer price indices, wages and credit over two years surrounding the introduction of VAT in 35 countries, as well as a further six examples where rates of VAT were changed. He found that in 22 of the 35 countries that had introduced the tax, there was "little or no effect of the introduction of VAT on the consumer price index". And in eight of the countries, there was a pronounced "one-off" shift in the CPI and an acceleration in inflation. So the impact of the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> introduction of VAT in most countries is either marginal, or one-off. And he concluded: "While some commentators have associated VAT rate changes with inflation, the weight of evidence seems to be against it."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the Bulletin itself say about GST. It said that "the GST has been labelled regressive because low income groups spend a higher proportion of their income than the rich and will therefore pay a higher proportion of their income in GST." At the end of the day, however, the Bulletin concludes:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...there is a bogus element about the regression argument. The brute fact about the poor is that in all societies, at all times, they have got the dirty end of the economic stick. And in all societies, at all times, their best solution has not been to moan about their plight but to divert their energy to working their way into the higher income group. The problem of the poor is not the presence of taxation but the absence of income.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own conclusion is that the Australian economic woes arise not because of their lack of economic gurus, but rather a lack of political will and foresight. I think the 15% GST proposed is badly needed as a source of revenue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, I think, are fortunate to have a Government with political will and foresight, and in the introduction of the GST at this stage at 3% and it is also revenue neutral. Still I think the fear of the man-in-the-street has to be addressed carefully. The Chinese say, min yi shi wei tian (
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) It is only natural that the men-in-the-street are concerned about the possible adverse impact of the proposed GST on consumer prices. It is reassuring to know that the Government is fully aware of the people's worry and will take various measures to check profiteering and assist the lower-income groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such possible measure is to flood the market with essential products through organisations which have an interest in keeping our consumer prices down, such as the NTUC Fairprice retail cooperative. However, Fairprice is not everywhere. Many new towns are without such outlets and new towns built in the 80s and later are also without wet markets and hawker centres. Fairprice
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> has to bid for shop space. Since it is an important organisation which can help to hold consumer prices down, should the HDB not consider giving them some concessions in bidding? Because I know of some cases where NTUC Fairprice was outbid by other competitors. But I must say that I have no connection or vested interest at all with Fairprice.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hawker centres and wet markets, the Government has decided not to build any more wet markets and cooked food centres. Therefore, many HDB new towns are without wet markets and hawker centres. What they have are dry markets and eating houses or coffeeshops which were bidden successfully many a time at unrealistically high prices. The high cost of operating these markets and shops or stalls inevitably will be passed on to the consumers. Nowadays, you can still get maybe $1.50 fishball guatio and $2 chicken rice at most hawker centres, but I do not think you can get them at this price in an eating house or coffeeshop.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wet markets and hawker centres have not only become prominent features of many HDB estates, they are also important institutions which help to hold consumer prices down. They are very important to the working class, especially the middle and lower-income groups. So should the policy of not building wet markets and hawker centres be reviewed?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect of this problem. The Government seems to have changed its mind a bit on wet markets. A few new generation markets have been planned. But from what I know, the thinking is to tender out these markets to one single operator, like in the case of coffeeshops. The Ministry of the Environment has actually started the practice of tendering out vacant hawker stalls in existing hawker centres. Ultimately, I think it is the consumers again, not the hawkers, who are going to pay for the high bidding prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that we have to have faith in market forces. But the full play of the market forces requires competition.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Therefore, while we should have faith in the market forces, we should also ensure that conditions that allow for the free play of market forces exist or are adequate. That is the most effective way to hold consumer prices down and that is also the most effective way to allay the fears of the man-in-the-street about GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion standing in the name of the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clear message in the Budget speech was the need to develop an "external dimension" for the Singapore economy. Therefore, to encourage local businessmen to venture abroad, he has unveiled a series of tax incentives to go regional. These are unilateral tax credit for dividend income remitted from countries without tax treaties with Singapore; extend double tax deduction scheme to cover exports and services; double tax deduction for approved expenses incurred in developing overseas investment opportunities; and tax exemption for venture capital and regional funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to making Singapore a more attractive centre for various offshore activities, he has announced a 10% concessionary tax rate to approved art and antique dealers, tax exemption for non-resident beneficiaries of trusts where the trustee is an approved trustee company and extend tax holiday for SIMEX by a further five years. These incentives have been welcomed and appreciated by most businessmen. I personally think that these incentives are timely.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, incentives to go abroad is but one dimension of our drive to go regional. The other is entrepreneurial spirit. Recently, there has been a lot of talk lamenting that Singapore lack entrepreneurs like those in Hong Kong. I think we can trace this to our very early independence days. It is historical. Since independence, we had approached our industrialisation programme differently
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> from Hong Kong. We invited MNCs to help us to industrialise. The EDB enticed them and they came in large numbers, attracted by our political stability and, of course, the incentives offered them. EDB's role was therefore to encourage investments and it did not encourage our Singaporeans to go and invest abroad. Even when they helped develop Batam, the comment was, "it is again for the MNCs and the local element is again not remarkably significant."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the message is now clearer. Figures on our economy, as revealed by our Senior Minister, showed the unhappy situation we will be in if we do not make the change to build an external economy for Singapore. While many would like to blame the Government for the lack of entrepreneurs, we should also be thankful that the MNCs brought prosperity and enabled Singapore to develop. In fact, it is never too late to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit. After 40 years of dead end Communism, China is brimming over with entrepreneurs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore entrepreneurs have always been around, but they lack recognition. They were at the fringe, at the periphery of the MNCs, ignored by EDB and Government departments. But today, after Senior Minister's speech, they are in the limelight. Creative Technology is cited by everyone as one of our made-in-Singapore entrepreneur. Yes, he deserves it. I heard him at a seminar explaining why he left Singapore, how Singaporeans did not pay much attention to his ideas and how from a small room in the United States he went around selling his ideas and products.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, risk-taking is part and parcel of doing business. Many have had their fingers burnt, but they accept it as business risk. However, the press and Singaporeans at large are not so forgiving. They are too judgmental and ever ready, to label those who did not do well. The best recent examples are Yeo Hiap Seng's investment setback in the United States. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no shares in this company. And the Government's investment in the Brierley group. Not only that, the press would
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> drag up these names at every mention of investment setbacks. "There is no room for failure" has been bandied around for some time. I think it should be replaced by another saying "Failure is the key to success." We must be more understanding and forgiving.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the way our press hound the offenders of littering. They seem to relish in the embarrassment. For one cigarette butt offence, you put them through this humiliation. It is out of proportion. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not condone littering. Culprits should be punished. But to over-punish sometimes has negative effects on the individual and our society at large.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Senior Minister has encouraged Singaporeans to go regional, I hope the relevant Government bodies would not over-react. We should not allow the pendulum to swing to the other end which is quite possible because of the zealousness to overdo things in this country, especially when the idea comes from our Senior Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While regional investment opportunities are likely to offer better return than those in North America, the EC countries and Australia, we should not give the wrong signal that these countries are no longer important. We depend on these countries for their technology and export markets. Therefore, while we must look regional, we must be prepared to entertain requests from Singaporean investors in Europe, America, Australia or anywhere in the world. Lastly, going to invest abroad should involve total cooperation between private and public sectors. It is necessary to pool our resources together to compete against many major international players. Presently, there is very little of such cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private companies are often reluctant to exchange information or co-invest with the GLCs. They fear that business will be stolen from them. This will impede the development of our regional businesses. I hope Commodore Teo's committee will come up with some ideas to overcome this. We should start a new chapter of cooperation between the private sector, GLCs and the MNCs. Forget the past. EDB and the TDB could help out by
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> providing the relevant information of the business risk and leave it to the entrepreneurs to make the final decision. Perhaps EDB may need to expand its role and encourage investments abroad instead of just encouraging investments into Singapore. I do not think we should establish a new body to spearhead this. We have EDB and TDB. Let them expand their scope of activity to emphasise the regional investment as another branch of their work. Too many bodies, too many rules. Our missions abroad must be on the look-out for such opportunities and work with EDB and TDB and report whatever opportunities they have back home.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the GST and appreciate the Government's concern to ensure that the poor will not be badly affected by the introduction of GST. Such a drastic taxation change is not without its share of problems. The question of the poor and how GST will affect them has been mentioned in many speeches. GST will definitely affect them. To offset this, the Government has come out with a series of rebates for households with incomes below $1,500 a month. These primarily are rental rebates for 1- and 2-room HDB flats and rebates on service and conservancy charges for 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB flats and also upping the public assistance allowance and Singapore Allowance. The rental rebates will benefit more than 83% of the 61,000 HDB tenants. The service and conservancy rebates will benefit 125,000 low income 1-, 2-, 3-room HDB flat dwellers. Dr Ow Chin Hock has even calculated the quantum amount these rebates will help them.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Opposition Members have been very critical lately that we do things to benefit the rich. I think we have been fair to all - rich and poor. The rich and better-educated have an advantage over the poor and less educated. They know how to maximise the many schemes and policies and opportunities provided by the Government. As for the poor and less educated, we must continually reach out
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to them on the many available schemes and opportunities open to them. The best answer is education. We have in place various special programmes, including Edusave, to help them. They cannot start on the same starting line as the others. We must bring them up to the starting level before they can compete.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there must be hope - hope for a better life and most of the poor bank their hopes on their children. Therefore, we must let them know through schools and at community level that any poor child who can study will be helped. That is why this Government has spread their bursary and scholarship awards to neighbourhood schools distinct from the scholarships that always go to the top schools.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot assume that the poor know of the opportunities available. We must bring to their attention by way of the schools, RCs and CCCs that there are social and welfare services like family service centres, custodial care services, financial assistance services, textbook assistance schemes, tuition schemes, at community as well as national level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been doing a lot for the less privileged Singaporeans. I hope the Opposition's cry that we look after the rich should be critically examined.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that we have been fair to all and we will continue to be so. It would be foolish of us not to spread our wealth around because we know that politics of envy can be nasty. That is why from the very beginning we took steps to prevent this. For example, we acquired land, developed it and built subsidised public housing for all. If we had not done that, then the disparity between the haves and have-nots will be very wide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the poor are also saddled with medical problems, C-class beds have been retained in Government and restructured hospitals. I hope NUH will follow suit. Government institutional care for the aged sick must continue to be made available at reasonable cost.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to make everyone own a flat. Rental flats must be retained because some cannot even afford the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> first downpayment. Eviction of poor flat owners because of rental arrears has been handled very carefully by Town Councils and HDB. In such cases, many a time such action was not carried out because of the assistance from the CC funds and easier payment terms have been employed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have to be realistic. We can never help all, but we can provide and create opportunities for them. If they fail to respond, then we can do nothing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One should not be proud to be poor nor should be ashamed to be poor. Many of us in this House started out poor. We were not proud nor were we ashamed to be poor, but we shared one common objective - the determination to get out of the poor trap, the poverty trap our parents were in. We succeeded and we thank the Government for the bursaries and scholarships that gave us the chance to go to college and university.

The various fiscal measures announced and the proposed GST will strengthen our economic fundamentals and take us one big step forward in our economic development in this competitive world. These measures will also promote enterprise, thrift and hard work among Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government has shown that in introducing these new measures, it has not forgotten the social implications and has offered generous rebates and offsets to help the lower income households. According to the Finance Minister, it is the intention of the Government that, as far as possible, no family would lose out because of GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am extremely pleased to see the various kinds of rebates, offsets and grants offered, I am concerned that a not insignificant number of HDB 4-roomers may not be sufficiently compensated. According to the Finance
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister, there are 195,000 households earning less than $1,500 per month. They pay little or no income tax and the proposed income tax reductions will not be sufficient to offset the GST they will pay. 90% of them live in HDB flats. 125,000 or 64% of them are in 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB flats. These households will be looked after mainly through S&amp;C rebates and rebates on rentals or property tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still 41,000 households or 23% in this income category who live in 4-room HDB flats. They will not enjoy the S&amp;C rebates. Their property tax rebates and the little income tax reductions that they will have are not likely to be enough to cover the GST. They may, therefore, lose out because of the GST. Will the Minister consider other ways whereby these households can be helped?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is also generous in sharing the fruits of our economic success with the people. The Edusave grants to our children and the CPF share ownership top-up scheme are excellent examples of this kind of sharing. It is also done in a way which will encourage all Singaporeans, whether young or old, to work hard to ensure the continued prosperity of our nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the CPF Top-up Scheme as announced encourages every Singaporean above the age of 21 to open a CPF account so that as many as possible can be share owners. The only requirement is a $500 co-payment. Many retirees and housewives are very pleased to hear about the scheme. However, the $500 requirement also means that those who cannot afford it will be deprived of the $200 the Government intends to give to every adult Singaporean. Therefore, whatever reasons the Minister may have for the co-payment, I feel that it should not end up preventing poor Singaporeans from receiving the $200.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore suggest that the $200 be given to every adult Singaporean who either has an existing CPF account or registers to open a new account. Co-payment by an account holder should
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> only be required if his account does not have sufficient money but he wants to purchase his full entitlement of the Singapore Telecom shares. Alternatively, the Government may want to consider allowing the $500 co-payment to be paid by a transfer of money from a spouse's or child's CPF account. There is no reason why this should not be allowed. It is a good way to use their CPF money.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has proposed to cap the tax deductibility of medical expenses by employers. The rationale is good. It will cause employers and hence employees to be careful of how they spend on health care.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has wanted to tax health benefits some years ago but did not because of political pressure. The proposal is now being reconsidered by the presidential Task Force on National Health Care Reform chaired by the First Lady Hillary Clinton. But the problem has grown to such an extent that the tax exemption on health benefits provided by employers is now estimated to be 10% of all health care spending in the US, which currently stands at 14% of the US GDP. Imagine what it will cost the employers if these health benefits are suddenly taxed. Imagine how workers and unions will react if employers then try to pass this tremendous tax burden to the workers. The political sensitivity of the problem has become so great that it is no surprise to read from International Herald Tribune recently that Hillary Clinton is already dropping the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must therefore act early when the problem is still manageable. Most companies will not be affected by the proposed capping schedule when it is introduced. There is concern, however, that friction between labour and management may arise because of such a cap. This can be seen by how quickly the employers federation jumped at the proposal and immediately advocate cost sharing of medical benefits between the employers and their employees, and how equally quickly the labour movement reacts to it.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is therefore important to remind employers that there is nothing to prevent them from giving medical benefits beyond the 2% cap, and that the proposed capping should not deprive any workers of existing medical benefits. Of course, employers are free to propose their conditions as far as new and improved benefits are concerned. The two sides must acknowledge the problem of rising medical cost and work together, not only in collective agreement negotiations, but also in other health promotion measures to contain health care costs. There must be such an understanding between employers and the unions so that our harmonious labour-management relations will not be strained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ageing of our workers, the availability of better medical equipment, drugs and services, and the expensive manpower costs of providing health care are pushing health care costs up very rapidly. The increase in health care cost is therefore certainly going to be faster than the wage rise of workers. In the longer term, the legitimate medical expenses by workers are likely to exceed the 2% cap. May I ask the Minister whether the cap will be revised when such a situation arises?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to have the opportunity to take part in the debate on the Budget Statement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major premises in the statement consist of two main points. Firstly, to develop our external economy. Secondly, to pave the way for the implementation of the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first point. I support the Government's policy in encouraging local entrepreneurs to develop their business overseas. However, for local entrepreneurs to go overseas it is not an easy task. The most important thing is that they must have sufficient capital. In Singapore, those people who really have the ability to invest overseas and to compete with
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> international consortia are very few. Apart from very large statutory boards and GLCs or MNCs, other small and medium-sized enterprises only feel that the "spirit is willing but the flesh is weak." Most of the SMEs do not have large profits in Singapore and they are only struggling to survive. I feel, therefore, Mr Speaker, that the tax policy in Singapore, apart from encouraging foreign investment into Singapore, should also support and assist the SMEs in Singapore. These are our genuine Singapore companies that need our assistance.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the nature of the policy of taxation, there are two categories involved. One is the tax on profit and the other is tax on costs. Tax on costs refers to the taxes that the Government levies on enterprises before profit, for example, the foreign workers' levy, stamp duty, etc. The other category refers to the tax on profit after the enterprises have become profitable, like the corporate tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Government should allow the SMEs in Singapore to build up their strength. The Government should abolish all taxation on costs or reduce them according to circumstances. In this way, the Government will be able to lighten the cost of doing business by the SMEs and for them to accumulate more capital.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the tax on profit, of course if you can cut it, so much the better. But it may not be absolutely necessary. If a company makes money, then they will not mind paying the tax that is due, even though it might be still on the high side. This is their responsibility to the State and it is also their contribution in return to the society. If a company does not make money, even if corporate tax is cut down to 0.5%, it is of no help at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government must pay attention to the question of cost increases of doing business here. At the present juncture, Sir, I feel that it is time for the Government or the statutory board to freeze all the rental increases in Singapore. In this way, they will be able
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to cut down the cost of doing business in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our SMEs are strengthened and have consolidated themselves, then they can pool their resources together to go overseas or to have joint ventures with our statutory boards or GLCs to go overseas and to cut down the risk involved. In encouraging local companies to develop overseas, the Minister for Finance has provided incentives to take care of the local companies, and I appreciate this move. However, I would like to remind the Minister for Finance that the Government should ensure that the profits made outside Singapore will be given preferential tax treatment when they are remitted back to Singapore. Because the most important objective in encouraging local companies to go overseas is to earn more foreign exchange. It is not just to enable the companies themselves to make profits for themselves. After that, if our entrepreneurs find that they can make more money and the world outside is better, then they will not come back. And then we will be suffering great losses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the question of attracting foreign investments. All along, we have been giving them tax holiday and tax incentives. Like the local companies, these foreign investors are concerned with the cost of doing business. Therefore, we must create more favourable conditions and environment for them to come in. We have already set certain conditions which are favourable, like our infrastructure in telecommunications, harbour, airport etc. Secondly, we have a very good geographical position. Transportation is very convenient and developed, and there is political stability in Singapore. Our people are well educated and well trained to a very high level. These are favourable conditions. But we also have unfavourable conditions such as the high labour cost, the high land and rental cost. Our taxes are high and there are too many procedures and regulations, etc.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to attract more foreign investments, we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> should review all these unfavourable conditions and continue to strengthen our advantages.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the question of GST. Before that, we must understand that there is a relationship between budget and taxation. This is a very complex matter but the objective is very clear, and that is, to ensure that for all the expenditures of the various departments we have sufficient financing from tax revenue. A government, in taking any tax measure, whether it is direct or indirect taxation, the ultimate move is to get money. So in this regard, the Government, on the one hand, gives some incentives or subsidies or rebates and, on the other hand, it will try to create some sources of revenue. The objective is the same. But taxation, direct or indirect, will mean that different people will be affected differently. Those who pay direct taxes are those in the higher income group. Whereas those who pay indirect taxes, whether they are rich or poor, must all pay the same. So as far as the rich and those in the higher income group are concerned, whether it is a direct tax or an indirect tax, there is no problem in paying. But to the poor, or to the lower income group, or to those without any income at all, like pensioners or retirees, then the indirect taxation is a great burden to them. On the contrary, when there was only direct tax, they had no problem at all.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you say taxation must be fair, then GST can achieve the objective. If you say that GST will give Government a more stable revenue, then it is also true. But in order to have stability in a country, you must have a proper harmonisation between the rich and the poor. That means those who are well-to-do must pay more to help the poor and those less well-to-do. In that way, there will be warmth and care in society, and there will be long-standing stability.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of GST will increase the burden on the lower income group and the poor people who are already hard pressed. As a matter of fact, GST is a pseudonym for price increases.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> At the same time, it may also cause inflation and increase in prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Government says that it will only collect 3% on GST, no one can assure that, because of profiteering or administrative cost, there will be no undue price increases. GST will add to the cost of doing business, will cause prices to rise and this will also affect foreign investments as well as tourism.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you consider all these factors, Sir, and the present economic growth which isgood and when we have a lot of budget surpluses, I feel that this is not the right time for us to implement GST in full. As a matter of fact, we already have some form of GST, for example, petrol duty and all kinds of duties on luxury goods. These can be considered as a form of goods and services tax. The present tax system is already sound and healthy. What we should do now is to think of getting other sources of revenue, to improve our productivity and to cut down expenditure, and to earn more foreign exchange. When the Government enjoys great surpluses, we should return these surpluses to the people and to the businessmen. A reduction in tax is a good measure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget Statement of the Finance Minister, there are tax reductions for the individuals and the companies. Various categories of people stand to benefit by way of rebates, tax reduction and other measures. We welcome these measures. However, I feel that the various measures on rebates and tax reductions are not surprises because the Government wants to cut down the pressure on our people, because of the implementation of GST. It is a red herring that will try to divert the attention of the people from the disadvantages of GST, and that is why they are giving all these perks.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this financial year, GST is not to be implemented. I would endorse and support the fiscal and financial policy of the Minister for this year. But I would not support the implementation of GST next year. I would urge the Minister for Finance to shelve the plans to implement GST from
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 1st April, next year. Otherwise, all the perks given now will be completely nullified or people may even stand to lose. Nobody can assure us that in future there will be no price increases and GST will not cause inflation.
  <br>2.30 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lau Ping Sum -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lau Ping Sum (Ang Mo Kio GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister's Budget Statement this year gave Singaporeans both a clear and comprehensive overview of the underlying philosophy of this Government and details of the fiscal measures proposed for the next financial year. Investing in the future to secure the long-term success of the economy and sustain the quality of life in Singapore, this fundamental philosophy has been instrumental for our success. As is well known, the long run consists of a series of short runs. Hence the range of tax changes, for example, corporate and income tax reduction and the GST have been proposed in line with the objective of making Singapore more competitive and easing the direct tax burden of the economically active population.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective government must look ahead, anticipating probable problems and devising plans of action to counter them. But this is easier said than done. Often, social, economic, political and even technological changes overwhelm the best of plans. Sociologists, economists, political scientists and social anthropologists have their favourite theories on, for example, how Japan managed to transform a ruined economy after the Second World War into the most successful modern economy, the leader in many industries, within a generation. Equally, they are more than willing to speculate on the root causes of Japan's current recession and problems of corruption and malpractice in the financial markets. But there is no sign of agreement on the fundamental reason for the relative performance of different economies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of volatile changes, the need for adaptability and flexibility is crucial. Even in the business sector, the ability to respond speedily to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> structural and technological changes cannot be over-emphasised. In 1982, Tom Peters' book "In Search of Excellence" became a best-seller. All the business administration schools in the US, Europe and elsewhere adopted it as part of their compulsory reading list. Hundreds of seminars were organised to analyze the reasons for the excellent track records of certain companies. And we know that among the companies highly commended by Tom Peters was Wang Laboratories, which unfortunately filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection. In fact, Tom Peters himself, in December 1992, admitted that he had badly underestimated the importance of adaptability because about 30% of the companies that he had highly commended went into difficulties of varying degrees within a few years after 1982.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even IBM, for three decades, the most admired and even feared computer company, is going through a rough patch. Last year, it lost US$4.8 billion. With several Nobel Prize winners in its payroll and a capital expenditure and R&amp;D budget amounting to US$10 billion a year, IBM could not reverse a steadily declining market share. It is currently less than 20% of the total computer revenue in the world, but used to be more than 30-35%. Its total stock value of US$106 billion in 1987 plunged to below US$30 billion in 1992. Microsoft, whose Chairman, Bill Gates, dropped out from Harvard University is now the richest man in US. With a much smaller staff of about 12,000, compared with a high employment of IBM's 400,000, Microsoft's stock value would, by now, have matched or even surpassed IBM in total value. No wonder an angry IBM shareholder, in December 1992, sent a message to Mr John Akers, the then Chairman of IBM, citing Oliver Cromwell, in 1652, when he tried to dissolve the long Parliament and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Begone, you have sat long enough. Do you think to sit here till doomsday come?'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite its excellent track record and considerable strengths, IBM was not quick enough to adapt to the fundamental changes occurring in the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> computer industry. A weakened demand for mainframes, another term for it, downsizing, moving processing from large computer mainframes to smaller PCs and networks, the explosion of power of PCs, the user demand for more friendly interfaces and open architecture (which means that you could buy equipment and software from a number of vendors instead of just one proprietary vendor), all these require decisive changes which the multi-layered bureaucracy of IBM seemed unable to make in time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what my good friend, Dr Ow Chin Hock, said yesterday, size is no longer the most important consideration. Rather, speed in anticipating new trends and understanding their implications is a critical success factor. Intel, the semiconductor company, has become enormously successful by investing for the long term and adapting to changing markets with tremendous speed. Its Chairman, Andy Grove, a refugee from Hungary in 1956, who left the country with $20 in his pocket and, today, the Chairman of Intel, said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If we hadn't kept moving the technology rapidly from the 8088 chip in the original PC with 30,000 transistors to the 486 [which is the latest PC] with 1.2 million transistors, to the forthcoming Pentium with over 3 million - we wouldn't have an advantage ... and we are already beginning to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the generations to follow. The pace of work these days isn't easy to live with, but welcome to the nineties.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fact of life. Rapid and even exhausting changes. The Minister for Finance rightly pointed out in a TV interview after the Budget Speech that we had to introduce these tax changes because the world was changing. There is tremendous competition for capital investments, and tax reforms are necessary. No doubt, they are necessary but not sufficient. We need to enhance the quality of our workforce, upgrade the infrastructure and improve our knowledge of the culture and business environment of the high-growth Asia-Pacific countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a common concern frequently voiced on the GST is the tendency of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> some merchants to use it as an excuse to raise prices. The Government together with CASE and the community leaders, the Shopkeepers' Associations, could work together and see how such acts could be discouraged. NTUC Fairprice and other companies will play a useful role in this regard.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Management Accounting Systems adopted in the Government, it is noteworthy that these computer-based systems have been installed in Government Ministries and completed ahead of schedule. By April, the systems will be in place in all Ministries and statutory boards are being encouraged to adopt them. The objective of using these systems to deliver high-quality public service at lower cost is, indeed, commendable. I would like to know if the concept of Activity-Based Costing (ABC) has been included in the current management accounting systems. ABC is a relatively new approach which, whilst keeping an eye on costs, focuses on the activities that add value to customer satisfaction in a direct way. Rather than concentrate on after-the-fact reports, the emphasis is on setting proactive improvement targets, planning optimum work procedures and preventing variances from occurring in the future. Would the Management Services Department be incorporating the ABC techniques to fine-tune the management accounting system?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to note that greater funding for the arts, sports, cultural and recreational activities will be available. The quality of life in Singapore should be enriched by a more vibrant cultural scene, hopefully, of the right kind. I was surprised to read in the newspapers recently, Sir, that we had some local drama performances where the actor or the performing artiste urinated in front of the audience and drank his own urine. I fail to see the artistic merit, the talent or the sensibility in this performance, and hope that Government funds were not involved in this production. I would urge the artistes themselves to exercise restraint and not to indulge in similar bizarre acts.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional cultural values and activities should be promoted for nothing is more dehumanising than to be impoverished beneath the veneer of American pop culture. The American economist, George Gilder, said:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The most dangerous threat to the US economy and society is the breakdown of our cultural institutions - the family, religion, education and the arts - that preserve and transmit civilisation to new generations. If the social fabric continues to fray, we will lose not only our technological prowess and economic competitiveness but also the quality of life itself.' Let us pause and reflect if this observation holds true in our context. The great unfinished task ahead of us is to achieve excellence in both economic competition and cultural pursuits.

  <br>
  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, before I commence my speech, I would like to respond to what the MP for Nee Soon Central, Mr Cheo Chai Chen, has said. He mentioned that when a company is not making any profit, then it should be exempted from paying taxes. And when it does make profit, then it should have no problem paying more taxes. On the question of the poor, he said that for a society to be stable, we should levy more taxes on the rich and then the society could be stable. Then he went on to say that when our coffer is rich, we should give more tax rebates to our entrepreneurs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when he talked about the poor, he said the rich should be paying more taxes. But when he talked about the businessmen, he said if the country is rich, it should not levy so much taxes on them. If that is the way he puts it, I think Mr Cheo does not have a clear
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> fundamental stand on taxation. Perhaps he has been talking in such a manner to please the people according to circumstances.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he talked about GST, he said it is a flat rate for everybody and the lower-income group will suffer more. But then, if we look at it, we should view the Finance Minister's package as a whole. Whether this Budget would benefit the rich or the poor, we have to look at it from an overall picture. The contents which I would be elaborating in my speech will be able to prove that what Mr Cheo said was wrong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget emphasises the restructuring of our taxation system. The Finance Minister has provided for a substantial reduction in corporate tax at a time when our economy is healthy and when we have a substantial budget surplus. And he would be implementing a 3% GST on the condition that our personal tax burden would not be heavier. In fact, "GST" is not a pleasant word because many people will realise that in the developed countries, the rate is very frightening. It could be as high as 10-20%. In fact, a few years ago when we were talking about GST, many people were very apprehensive about it. At that time, I indicated that I would support the implementation of GST provided the rate was low and that it would not increase the burden of our taxpayers. When our Finance Minister announced the introduction of GST, he did not disappoint us because from the White Paper on GST and in his Budget Statement, he has provided for a number of measures such as rebates and tax reductions to offset the effect of GST on the taxpayer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a scientist, I fed all the information on personal income tax rates for Year of Assessment 1993 and Year of Assessment 1994 into my computer to study the effect of GST on our taxpayers. First of all, if we take in the $700 tax rebate plus the additional personal tax relief of $1,000 and the $200 CPF top-up as well as the $130 rebates for service and conservancy charges for the lower income group, the net result is that for
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> YA 1994 only those with an income of $150,000 per year, I repeat, $150,000, will have to pay $30 more in taxes when GST is implemented in 1994. As for the others, whether they are from the higher income group or the lower income group, when the GST is introduced next year, they will be paying substantively lower taxes. For those with an income of $15,000 per year, if they are living in a 4-room flat or a smaller HDB flat, then their tax burden for next year will be reduced by as much as $778. Even five years later, when the $700 rebate is reduced to $500, those who are living in 4-room HDB flats or smaller flats and their annual income is less than $34,000, they will not have an additional tax burden. As for those whose incomes exceed $34,000 per year, so long as they set aside 13% of their income in savings or on expenditure where there is no GST, for example, purchase of residential property or cars or travelling, then they would not have to pay any additional taxes. It is therefore evident that the implementation of GST will not increase our tax burden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, if in the past, every Singaporean did honestly, I emphasise honestly, submit their income tax returns, then in fact the Inland Revenue Authority will be suffering a loss next year with the implementation of GST. As for people from the lower income group who do not get any subsidy on housing, they would not suffer a loss in the first year of implementation of GST because they will get the $200 CPF top-up in their CPF account. Thereafter, with the GST, they will have to pay at the very most an additional tax of $91 per year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Finance Minister's measures to set aside some money for the CCCs to find out how they could help the people who are adversely affected by the implementation of the GST. I hope the Finance Minister will announce the operational details of this fund so that those people who are affected by GST could relax and adopt an optimistic and active attitude towards the implementation of GST.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the income tax rate, which has been announced, I feel that there is one group of people who have been neglected. They are the working mothers with high incomes who are now receiving enhanced child benefits amounting to as much as $60,000 a year in tax relief. With the GST, they will have to pay an additional $1,800 a year, but there is no provision for them to benefit from this new scheme. I hope the Finance Minister will look into this matter so that this group of people could be given a fair treatment as well.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Finance Minister is also very generous in giving a 5% once-off rebate on our tax payable. I hope that, with the implementation of GST, the Finance Minister would also be generous in allowing this sort of rebate to be given to us, provided we have a budget surplus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Forum pages in the newspapers and from discussions with my friends, I feel that many people still lack the knowledge or understanding of GST. Let me quote two examples. For example, in the papers it was reported that the Association of Provision Shop Owners have a misunderstanding that with the implementation of the GST, their members (the provision shops) will have more accounting work to do, which will result in their operational cost being increased. From the way they put it, I feel that they have not understood the operation of GST because even if they have to pay GST to their suppliers, the wholesalers, the process will not affect their accounting system. Because if their turnover is less than $1 million, they would not have to pay GST to the Government. Therefore, they would not have an additional account ing burden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other people, they said that the 3% GST may be very low, but on every stage of transaction, there will be 3%. By the time it reaches the end-consumer, it will accumulate to quite a handsome sum. As a matter of fact, there are a large number of people having this misunderstanding. It is wrong. As far as the consumers are concerned, all they have to pay is 3% at the end. Because many people do not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> understand the real operation of GST, I hope that the Inland Revenue Authority would, in conjunction with the mass media, be able to illustrate in a very simple manner to members of the public so that they will understand the operation of GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope with the tax restructure, and with the substantive reduction in corporate tax, the enterprises in Singapore will increase their profits. In return, they would increase their investment and reinvestment on projects which would improve productivity and high value-added products. With the restructuring of our tax system, we would be able to attract more quality investments from overseas. This will be a great help to our future economic development and, in the long run, whether it is to the Government's revenue or to the enterprises or the salaried workers, it will be of great benefit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Tong Kok Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Tong Kok Yeo (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with other hon. Members of this House, I wish to commend the Minister for Finance for the budget which has been hailed as a "bonanza" budget with something for everyone. For the individual, the CPF Top-up Scheme to help Singaporeans own shares is indeed an icing on the cake. I believe the same can be said of the companies with the tax incentives to go regional to promote an external economy for Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In announcing the capping of the medical expenses at 2% for tax deduction purposes, the Minister has shared the results of a recent survey of 325 companies conducted by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. I hope the Minister will also share the profile of the 325 companies so that there will be a better appreciation of how the 2% capping is derived. I agree with Mr Teo Chong Tee that the 2% medical capping across-the-board is not equitable to companies with a large number of employees. We must also acknowledge that in most companies the level of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> medical benefits provided differs between executive and non-executive employees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive employees (those who are earning more income) enjoy ward A accommodation when they are hospitalised and it is very much costly as compared with the lower ward accommodation enjoyed by non-executive employees, namely, ward B1, B2 or C. Going by the daily ward fee rates of the restructured Singapore General Hospital, the ratio of the daily fees of ward accommodation of ward A to ward C is in the ratio of 1:10.5. For ward A and ward B2, the ratio is 1:5.5. For ward A and ward B1, the ratio is 1:1.85. Therefore, it is apparent that executive employees tend to incur higher hospitalisation cost. As such, employers and businessmen must take cognisance of this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this backdrop, the impact of this medical capping should not be allowed to result in the deterioration of medical benefits currently enjoyed by workers. As I understood it, the Government's intention in introducing this medical capping is "to prevent a future problem and not to deprive any worker of existing medical benefits". I believe this would be the main consideration when the Government itself reviews the medical benefits of public sector employees. This is of paramount importance because the private sector employers will obviously be watching how the Government do it. The overriding concern is that employers will be inclined to use the medical capping of 2% as a yardstick to cut the cost of medical benefits provided to the employees. This may be an issue for serious contention when unions and employers meet to negotiate their collective agreements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget Statement states that the medical capping does not mean that companies cannot give medical benefits beyond the 2% medical capping. I would see that it also means that workers, through their unions, can secure medical benefits exceeding that limit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the process of free collective bargaining should be allowed to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> determine the extent and scope of the medical benefits provided to employees by employers regardless of the capping. Employers are truly worried and concerned about rising medical cost. The more reason they should now look into ways of how best to implement an effective health promotion programme at the work place, as suggested by NTUC. The Government is already moving in the right direction with the promotion of a healthy life style amongst the population. However, I suspect that employers will be slow in this respect, as cost will be the main deterrent unless there are fiscal incentives to accompany it. But again, Sir, how are employers going to save money if they are reluctant to spend money?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies in the US have shown that companies which actively embark on health promotion programmes experience cost savings over the long term. AT&amp;T announced that over a 10-year period they saved $22.4 million in preventing heart attacks. Lockheed spent $2 per employee on health promotion programmes and demonstrated with a saving of $116 per employee. New York Telephone realised savings of $663,000 in hypertension reduction, $1.5 million in alcoholism rehabilitation, $269,000 in breast cancer and $268,000 in general stress management. There are many benefits to be reaped, both by the employee and the company, by introducing health promotion programmes, such as improved corporate image, improved workers' attitude, decrease work-related injuries, decrease health care cost and, most importantly, increase worker productivity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is heartening to note that the productivity growth for 1992 averaged 3.1%, almost double that of 1991. However, despite this improvement, it still lags behind wage increases. This has been the trend since 1988 and many reasons have been given for this phenomenon. Many of our Hon. Ministers and Members of this House have repeatedly stressed that over the long term, this trend must be arrested if
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore is to remain competitive. Experience of many countries, such as the United Kingdom, are good examples to learn from. A practical and logical course of action to take in arresting this trend, much reiterated and exhorted by many of our leaders, is to improve productivity through continuous education and skills upgrading and training of our workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board has targeted the expenditure on training to 4% of the payroll by 1995. It will be interesting to know how our employers are faring in this aspect. It was 1.5% in 1986, 2% in 1991. It takes five years to reach the half-way mark. I see it that this simply means that employers are not doing enough in the education and skills upgrading and training of our workforce. The Budget outlines the strategies and incentives to make Singapore more competitive. All this will be negated if education and skills upgrading and training of our workforce are taken half-heartedly. We need not wait for 1995. The 3% reduction in corporate tax is best diverted to investment in the training of our workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many a time the wages of workers or costs of labour have always been the punching bag whenever employers or businessmen talk about the rising cost of doing business in Singapore. I agree totally with what Mr Chin Harn Tong said in his speech yesterday. Wages or cost of labour is only one factor of production. Employers and businessmen had better look into more innovative ways to reduce cost in other areas such as manpower optimisation, curb extravagance, reduce wastage and duplication of resources and, of course, productivity improvement through education and training of the workforce.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pointing at wages is the easiest way out. Workers have often been reminded of the 1985 recession. But we should also remind employers of 1979 when the Government restructured the economy to move from low-intensive industry to high-technology and capital-intensive industry.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For workers in the lower-income and middle-income group, two matters are of major concern to them. They are wages and promotion. Such workers want better wages. There is nothing wrong with that. Just as employers and businessmen want more profit. Such workers look forward to annual wage increases. As long as wage increases are not eroded by inflation, cost of living is not a big problem. However, when such a worker is near or is at the maximum of his job rate, he aspires for promotion because he sees it as the only way of earning more. Otherwise, his wage will be stagnated. Of course, there is a limit to the number of employees that can be promoted. Nevertheless, this is their aspiration. Therefore, many of such workers, especially those with low-paying jobs and those at the maximum of their job rate, have heeded the call to upgrade on their own. Despite their comparatively low or stagnant income, they are motivated to do so because they believe this will help to enhance their promotional prospects and earning capacity. This was also the message given by our national leaders that workers will be able to earn more if they go for skills upgrading and training. It will therefore not be far from wrong to assume that the skills acquired by them will inevitably show in their work. Thus, employers and businessmen indirectly benefit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such workers, if a promotion is not forthcoming or their wages are stagnated for many years, these workers will be disillusioned. They can only conclude that it does not pay to upgrade. Their peers will likewise be discouraged to go for upgrading. They will be caught in this trend where there will be no winners but losers. Productivity will suffer, so will workers and employers. Therefore, due recognition must be given to such workers who on their own initiative took up upgrading courses. In this respect, employers should be encouraged to provide incentive schemes to reward them. Just as employers or businessmen clamour for more Government incentive, to go regional.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the profile of our workers, it will not be surprising that a good majority of our workforce is at the maximum point of their job rate for many years. In the years where NWC came up with quantitative recommendations, such workers could at least look forward to some annual wage adjustments. This was not the case after 1986. The NWC comes up with qualitative recommendations. As such, over the years, these workers perceive that the standard of living has declined, their earnings being eroded by inflation. The plight of these workers will be further aggravated next year when the GST is introduced. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, Sir, the tripartite partners in NWC should address the issue of how to ensure that the standard of living of workers who are at the maximum point of their job rate is not eroded year after year by inflation without annual wage increases.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a few words on GST. I am glad that most of the rebates are given upfront, in particular, the pensioners' allowance which over the years has never been indexed to the rate of inflation. The package of benefits reflects the Government's concerted efforts and its sincerity in ensuring that the introduction of GST will not have any adverse impact on the population. It leaves now for the Government to ensure that profiteering does not occur. The over-riding concern with the introduction of GST is profiteering, in particular, by way of rounding-up. It is comforting to note that the Government will monitor prices closely to prevent profiteering by unscrupulous traders and to expose them publicly and, of course, to enforce the Price Control Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see these as an enormous task with immense enforcement difficulties. I ponder how effective these measures are going to be. Nevertheless, I would like to join Mr Ho Peng Kee in asking the Minister whether the Government will encourage and take the lead in reactivating the usage of one-cent coins. I feel that the Government should, so that should there be any eventual MRT or SBS fare increases, it will not be rounded up to the nearest 10 cents.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> After all, it is the lower and middle-income group that takes this form of public transport. Employers and businessmen do not. They use their own transport. Cost of petrol is not rounded up to the nearest 10 cents, but price down to the very one cent.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these comments, I support the motion.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Budget is indeed a landmark budget. This is so not because of its plethora of incentives, rebates, offsets, goodies. But because it sets new directions in three major areas. It lays the foundation for a fundamental reform of our tax system, from a narrower - based income tax to a broader - based GST. It introduces significant incentives for our businessmen to invest outside Singapore, in particular, in the region. It puts in place a new mechanism to reinforce support for good policies - the CPF Top-up Scheme to help Singaporeans own a stake of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has explained the need for tax reform and the GST in his Budget speech. You have heard the arguments for adding an international wing to our domestic economic wing. I want to explain the philosophy behind the CPF Top-up Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's primary duty is to build the right conditions for Singaporeans to create wealth for themselves. These conditions include security, law and order, political stability, social discipline, a level playing field, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> free market, meritocracy and reward in accordance with a person's ability, performance and contribution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this framework, how wealthy a person becomes depends on himself. If he has the ability and puts in the effort, he will do well. If he has exceptional ability, entrepreneurial spirit and good business sense, he can become extremely wealthy. In short, the more successful Singaporeans will end up better off than the less successful Singaporeans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that the less successful Singaporeans are ignored. We will help them, and their children, to do better. We oppose welfare programmes and soft-headed solutions to hard problems. But the truth is we do subsidize productive social programmes heavily - housing, education, and health. On average, a typical Singaporean living in a 3-room flat will receive direct subsidies amounting to about $70,000 during his lifetime. Housing - about $35,000; education - about $25,000 for 10 years of primary and secondary education; health - about $10,000, assuming normal rate of C class utilisation - a total of $70,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income tax he pays over his working life, say, he has a monthly income of $1,500, for 40 years, is about $20,000. With GST and the various rebates, he will not have to pay income tax. Even if he spends his entire income of $1,500 a month on goods and services which attract GST, his maximum GST per year at 3% is $540. Over 40 years, this comes to $21,600 - less than one-third of the direct subsidies he can expect to receive. This ignores the many indirect benefits of being a Singaporean, for example, security, law and order and the large investments in the infrastructure of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who pays for his subsidies? Mostly the more successful Singaporeans. They pay a disproportionate amount of taxes. For example, in 1991, the top 10% taxpayers paid 76% of the total personal income tax collected. Even with the revised income tax rates, higher earners will be the major payers of tax, both income tax
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and GST. They have more money to spend, they will spend more, and so they will pay more GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has worked well. It has served us very well. The able strive, become successful and well-off. They pay more taxes, but not so much as to force them to emigrate, under-perform, or find creative ways to avoid paying taxes. They have the incentive to create more wealth. The less able are helped along to improve themselves. They pay some taxes, but much less than the benefits they receive from the system. They work hard to improve themselves. There is economic growth, employment and wealth leading to more growth, higher wages. We are in a virtuous cycle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a free market economy underpinned by meritocracy, the distribution of incomes cannot be completely equal. The able and more hardworking will earn more than those less able and less hardworking. Someone will always be at the bottom of the income ladder. This cannot be helped. Even in Communist countries, like China and the former Soviet Union, people at the top earn many times more than those at the bottom. In addition, the top people in these countries enjoy generous benefits in kind, like free housing and first-class medical care. This can amount to many times the cash salary. If you take them into account, the ratio of top and bottom incomes is much higher.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for us is whether the lowest 20% live in abject poverty, or are only poor in comparison with others. If it is absolute poverty, we must eradicate it. No Singaporean should live below subsistence level. Indeed, hardly any Singaporean does. But we cannot eliminate relative poverty. There will always be the bottom 20%, no matter what we do.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no quarrel with the SDP, or anyone else, who argues that we should do more for the poor. That is exactly what the PAP has been doing all these years, is doing, and will continue to do. But I totally oppose the way the SDP seeks to agitate Singaporeans through the politics of envy. The SDP deliberately
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> exaggerates the gap between the better-off and the rest. It paints a distorted picture of Singapore society, to arouse jealousy and class resentment. It offers no solutions to improve things, to solve problems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and his SDP colleagues are doing this to win votes. If they succeed in pushing the politics of envy, Singapore will go down the drain. The middle class will envy the rich, the upper class. The poor will envy everyone else. The well-off, instead of helping others to succeed, will react by developing a me-first mentality, and seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the rest of society. Our society will be torn apart.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtuous cycle that we have so carefully built up over the years will turn vicious. People will seek to knock down the system of meritocracy, instead of using it to raise themselves, to climb the ladder, to do better, to go higher. They will demand more welfare programmes, more handouts. This will mean raising taxes. Higher taxes will discourage everyone from working his best. Companies will go elsewhere where taxes are lower. Investments will fall, so will economic growth. Incomes will stagnate. As people become poorer, they will demand still more assistance from the state. The state will have to raise taxes again. A vicious cycle sets in - welfare programmes, more taxes, slower economic growth, demand for even more subsidies, and so on.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should admire and emulate those with ability and wealth, not envy or hate successful people.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without natural resources, our wealth is all man-made. The able do more than their share in creating wealth and generating surpluses for the country. If they are squeezed, or levelled down, the surpluses will quickly disappear. We will have no more budget surpluses to worry about, and no more resources to help the less able and the poor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow the "red eye" disease to infect Singapore. That will be the end of Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to strengthen the virtuous cycle of effort, growth and wealth
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> creation through the CPF Top-up Scheme. This is the rationale for the scheme. We intend to make Singaporeans owners of the Singapore economy through ownership of blue-chip shares. We intend to build up their assets through regular declaration of dividends and capital appreciation of their shares.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is the trustee of Singaporeans' collective wealth and guardian of their future. The reserves that we have built up belong to all Singaporeans, not to a few people in the Government. But it is the Government's job as trustee to protect the reserves and safeguard Singaporeans' future against contingencies. Unfortunately, some Singaporeans fail to see how these reserves directly benefit them. They do not understand that it is because of the reserves that the Singapore dollar is strong and, therefore, the value of their CPF savings is safeguarded and preserved. They do not see how the reserves give investors confidence in the Singapore economy. They do not believe that, despite the rosy prospects for the economy, we may one day run into an unexpected prolonged recession and then the reserves will prove very handy. So they are sceptical when the Government builds up more reserves, and such an attitude has been encouraged by the Opposition. We hope to change this attitude through the CPF Top-up Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how it works. Imagine that we incorporate a company called Singapore Incorporated, or Singapore Inc., to own and run Singapore. All Singaporeans are employees of Singapore Inc. But they are also shareholders. Each has one share. In other words, Singaporeans, both you and I, work for and own Singapore Inc. The Government is the Board of Directors of Singapore Inc. Its job is to manage the Singapore economy in such a way that it turns in a profit every year. The profit is economic growth. Part of it shows up as the budget surplus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As employees of Singapore Inc., Singaporeans are paid in accordance with their ability, performance and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> contribution. But they are equal shareholders. This is the crucial difference between employees of Singapore Inc. and employees of other companies. They have equal shares of the company. For Singapore Inc. to succeed, all its employees and shareholders must, in turn, be committed to work for its success. The Board of Directors must also provide dynamic leadership and sound judgement to lead Singapore Inc. from strength to strength.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Top-up Scheme is a way to realise this idea. If you put $500 into your CPF account between 1st March and 31st August this year, we will, in effect, issue you a share scrip stating that you own one share of Singapore Inc. Your share will entitle you to an immediate dividend of $200 this year. This is 40% return on your capital. It will entitle you to purchase several hundred Singapore Telecom shares at a discount later this year. The total discount will be substantial, and the capital gain hefty, not immediately but over a few years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong says that the CPF Top-up Scheme has a catch. The Government puts in $200 to lock up your $500 for 30 years. As usual, he distorts and exaggerates. The fact is that the $700, that is, $500 plus $200, can be withdrawn after 1st September subject to the CPF rules of withdrawal. You can use the $700 to buy shares, properties, or gold. You can withdraw it at 55 years. If you are 54 years old, you can withdraw the $700 in a year's time, not 30 years. And if you are over 55 years and working, you can withdraw the sum after three years. The rule says that you can withdraw once every three years after 55. And if you are not working for six months, that is, unemployed for six months prior to the date of withdrawal, you can take it out after six months. In other words, a retiree who puts in $500 and does not wish to buy Singapore Telecom shares can withdraw $700 after six months, not 30 years, as Mr Chiam has said. This is a hefty 40% return after six months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to credit this $200 automatically if a person has contributed $500 into his CPF account between 1st
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> March and 31st August. It is automatic credit. But we should not force anyone to accept the $200, if he does not want it. So I am going to ask CPF to print opt-out forms and place them at convenient places in Potong Pasir, Bukit Gombak and Nee Soon Central. I do not know about Hougang. Did the MP there support the scheme? If he did, then I would not place any forms there. Let us see how many Potong Pasir residents and SDP supporters will opt out.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $200 top-up this year will not be a one-off exercise. So long as Singapore Inc. shows healthy profits and the Government accumulates strong budget surpluses, we will top up from time to time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> We can do this provided we keep taxes low and growth high. We therefore must eschew soft-headed welfare policies and confine Government spending to essentials. This is your surest guarantee that the GST rate will not increase above 3% after five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be more opportunities for Singaporeans to acquire shares in Singapore Inc. when we convert other statutory boards into public companies and list them on the Stock Exchange. Singapore Telecom, PUB and PSA are part of the infrastructure of the Singapore economy. Their performance reflects the Singapore economy's performance. If they are run well, the Singapore economy will grow. Conversely, when the Singapore economy grows, they will be profitable. Singaporeans with shares in these companies literally own a piece of the Singapore economy. They will have a direct stake in Singapore's success. Their shares will appreciate so long as the Singapore economy continues to grow. This way, we increase the assets of Singaporeans - through capital appreciation of their blue-chip shares.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the CPF Top-up Scheme is not a handout. That is why we require you to put in $500 in your CPF account to buy a share in Singapore Inc. The $500 is evidence of your contribution to the Singapore economy. It can be present
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> contribution, it can also be contribution from your past savings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Top-up Scheme is only one component of the Government's assets enlargement programme. The other components are HDB upgrading, sale of tenanted HDB shops and Edusave. Each of these components has its unique features, but all of them will benefit lower income Singaporeans more than the upper income Singaporeans. They redistribute wealth. They will help Singaporeans to level up.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB Upgrading Programme will benefit HDB owners living in older housing estates by increasing the capital value of their flats. The sale of HDB shophouses to tenants will benefit the hardworking families who provide us with convenient shopping close to our homes. The Edusave programme will benefit all eligible students in schools. When Edusave is fully operational, every eligible student can expect to receive $4,000 during his 10 years in school. The CPF Top-up Scheme will benefit every Singaporean over 21, rich, middle class or poor. Like Edusave, every citizen gets the same absolute dollar amount. But in relative terms, the benefits mean more to the less well-off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the four components, the CPF Top-up Scheme has the most promise of reinforcing the virtuous cycle of effort, economic growth and wealth creation. It can go on for as long as Singaporeans work hard and Singapore Inc. enjoys strong budgetary surpluses. We intend to top up your CPF periodically, not every year, but when Singapore Inc. has the surpluses to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all Singaporeans already own their homes. We should now work to give every Singaporean a tangible share in the Singapore economy. This share will appreciate in value provided we work hard and we do well. Every Singaporean has a stake in the Singapore economy and every Singaporean has a stake in Singapore's success. The CPF Top-up Scheme will bring this home forcefully to every citizen. [Applause].

  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Minister on a point? How would the Government ensure that the shares of so-called Singapore Inc. will not in time fall into the hands of the wealthy, because shares can be sold anyway you like?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a conceptual share. When you put in $500 into your CPF account, conceptually you own a share. It is your $500. You cannot sell it. But you can use that to buy Singapore Telecom shares or shares of other statutory boards when they are turned into companies. Then, of course, it is up to you. If you want to sell them to the rich, so be it. But then you will benefit from the capital appreciation. If you sell them below the price you paid, which I do not think will happen, unless of course the economy collapses and then it is the fault of Singaporeans, the choice is up to the individual. So if you want to sell it to the rich, it is your right to do so. But I would advise you to keep it for as long as possible because this place is going to succeed and the shares which you hold are going to go up in value.

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, can I just ask the Prime Minister one question? With this top-up scheme, how many more new CPF members the Government expects to have?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment, we have some one million active CPF accounts and we think that all these active accounts will benefit from the CPF Top-up Scheme. But my own estimation is that we should be able to bring in another million into this scheme, because if you have the funds it would be silly if you do not use the funds to help your parents to take advantage of this Top-up Scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $200 million is based conservatively on the one million accounts, but I believe that we will be disbursing more than $200 million. I do hope that as many Singaporeans as possible would take advantage of this scheme and I hope to see, if possible,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> closer to 2 million CPF account holders benefiting from this scheme. But if Mr Chiam wishes to opt out, then of courseit is his right.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I hope the Prime Minister and other Members of this House would not put words in my mouth which I have not spoken. I did not say that I am disagreeable to this scheme. I said that it was a clever scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have one million, in other words, instantly the Government would have the benefit of $7 million worth of funds to use. Is that not right?

  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> $700 million.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Right. It is not $7 million but $700 million. But the $700 million will comprise two components, $200 million from the Government and $500 million which belong to the people. Most of them would have this amount put into their CPF accounts anyway because they are working Singaporeans. So there is nothing extra which you need to put in. You may be referring to the one million CPF accounts which may be opened to take advantage of this?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am talking of these new accounts.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. The new accounts may be one million and I hope there will be one million new accounts to take advantage of this. So by your reckoning, we are locking up $500 million because we have one million accounts. But you can take it out after six months if you are not working. Is that not a good deal?

  <br>
  <!-- Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(
  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to join my colleagues in endorsing the fiscal principles as expounded by the Minister for Finance on Budget Day.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without doubt, this year's Budget is a most welcome one judging by the many positive reactions from various quarters. Not only is it painless, but more importantly, it is a well-balanced Budget that had adopted new approaches aimed at keeping costs down and to make Singapore stay competitive. To help Singapore take off in its next stage of economic development, the Budget has introduced a number of incentives for the business community. At the same time, the Budget this year can also be described as very generous and compassionate in terms of the wide range of rebates, tax reliefs, financial assistance programmes and additional subsidies in education and health which will benefit a wide cross-section of Singaporeans, including the lower-income group.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is indeed heartening to note that our nation has a healthy budget surplus in 1992. As the Minister has informed the House, this position is expected to continue in the next few years so long as our economic growth is sustained. We are indeed blessed, Sir, as not many countries in the world are in this enviable position and what this proves is the principles underpinning our fiscal policy are sound, pragmatic, prudent and realistic. And for this, credit must go to the Minister for Finance and his team of officials for making it possible for all Singaporeans to reap the fruits of our economic success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, Sir, I would now like to make some observations on the Budget Statement. First, I would like to raise the issue of CPF contribution. Workers are generally disappointed that their contribution rate is reduced only by half a percentage point despite the favourable economic growth in 1992.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> They would have been happier if the reduction had been one percentage point because they have been eagerly looking forward to have more take-home pay to assist them to cope with the high cost of living we are experiencing in Singapore. On the other hand, employers have no reason to lament on the increase of half a percentage point in their contribution bearing in mind that they have been given several incentives in this year's budget. Also, employers must never forget our workers' sacrifice when they willingly accepted the immediate reduction of employers' CPF rate during the recession years of 1985-1986. Perhaps the Minister could clarify why the contribution on the part of the workers is not reduced by 1%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of CPF which I would like to touch upon is the CPF Share Ownership Top-up Scheme. The objective of this Scheme is to enable our citizens to own shares so that they will have a more direct stake in the growth and prosperity of Singapore, and this is indeed praiseworthy. But the scheme as announced appears to be restrictive as it is confined only to citizens aged 21 and above who are CPF members. What I would like to ask here is what about CPF members who have not attained the age of 21? Will they be eligible for the scheme as well? Could the Minister please enlighten the House on this point?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next issue I would like to comment on is the capping of tax deduction for medical expenses to the maximum of 2%. While most of us understand the rationale behind the proposed capping as one way of curbing rising health costs, what is disturbing is that some employers have already started to take advantage of the situation by proposing cost-sharing between employers and employees. Therefore, it is not surprising that workers are beginning to be concerned as they consider this development as a sign that employers who are presently providing medical benefits beyond 2% would seek to withdraw these benefits even though there is no necessity for them to do so at the moment. In this connection, I would like to know what measures the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government can take to check on such unscrupulous employers, as the Minister has said in his budget speech, and I quote:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government's aim is to pre-empt a future problem and not to deprive any worker of existing benefits.'
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a brief comment on the issue of the Goods and Services Tax. Feedback from the ground revealed that there is a widespread concern about the final retail prices to be paid by them when GST is introduced. They strongly believe that prices would go beyond 3%. This fear is reasonable and expected because, firstly, people are unclear of the multi-stage collection process of the GST, and secondly, retailers will seize the opportunity to jack up prices through the rounding off process. I would like to ask whether something can be done to allay the fear. Could the Government consider the suggestion that retail stalls be asked to show the breakdown between the sale price and the GST when sales are made or when services are given?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Mr Speaker, I support the motion moved by the Minister for Finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion moved by the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget Statement is to be and, in fact, has been welcomed by everyone. But first I would like to touch on a point made by the hon. Member for Hougang yesterday. He said that the reduction in corporate tax by 3% is not fair, as it would benefit larger corporations or the MNCs more, and the smaller companies or the SMEs would lose out. Mr Low is a businessman and I am sure a very smart one. Surely he knows that in business the larger the investment the higher the profit is to be expected. But at the same time, it carries a much greater risk. He cannot believe that a neighbourhood shop expects to make the same profit as a supermarket or a large departmental store. I wonder if, instead of tax
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> reduction, the Government decides to increase the tax by 3%, would Mr Low come out to fight for the MNCs because they would have to pay more tax? Perhaps nowadays it is fashionable for the Opposition to engage in the politics of envy by pitting one section of the population against another, and doing the same for the business community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this undesirable and dangerous practice, as our Prime Minister has just put it so forcefully, must be stopped because it can threaten the future stability and prosperity of our nation. Just look at the example of some of the countries in our region which engage in this type of politicking. Their economy is in total ruin and their nation divided.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the three main features of this year's Budget Statement must be: (1) the introduction of GST, (2) the call for building up of an external economy and (3) the topping up of the CPF scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the subject of GST has been extensively debated and it would be debated later in this House, and the CPF Top-up Scheme has been so eloquently put forward by our Prime Minister, I would like to go on to my comments on overseas venture.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although venturing overseas is nothing new to both Singaporean entrepreneurs and professionals, the need to speed up our effort has never been so sharply focused. Our domestic economic growth approaches its maximum potential as our economy matures. Like all other NIEs, the need to expand outward is inevitable. Up to now, our overseas ventures in the private sector have been mainly through individual effort, although organisations like EDB and TDB have constantly been making contribution in promoting trade relationship with other countries in our region. They cannot be said to be well-coordinated with the private sector. Our Government has always been far-sighted enough to spearhead business ventures and had laid foundations for development investment abroad, notably the promotion of the Growth Triangle, which took off some five years ago.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, we are becoming the largest investor in Johor in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> terms of the number of projects. Many projects in Batam and Bintan have been completed or in the process of being commenced. Of course, the effort taken by our Senior Minister in building up ties with China through the years and the appointment of Dr Goh Keng Swee as Economic Adviser to China, paving the way for our entrepreneurs to invest heavily in China, should be much appreciated.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we have stepped up our trade promotion to Vietnam and have even looked towards Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos. But all these efforts will come to nought if we do not have a population with a spirit of entrepreneurship and adventure and the courage to look beyond our shore. So far, we have a very efficient business community with well-trained managers and technocrats who have been responsible for the rapid economic growth in Singapore for the last two decades. The business climate in Singapore and other countries in our region is different in both outlook and operating procedures. In Singapore we rely on data facilities, feasibilities, projections, etc. Overseas projects like those in China, Vietnam and even Indonesia, we rely very much on the vision and judgment and personal skills of the individual entrepreneur. In areas where regulations and procedures are much more fluid, the risks of doing business are much higher. But, of course, higher gains can be expected. We therefore have to nurture the young generation of entrepreneurs, professional or even technicians, to this new orientation. They may have to start from scratch to learn new skills and techniques to face up to these new challenges.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government should give maximum support, not so much in terms of monetary guarantee, but rather logistics and facilities to this group of adventurers. It is most important for our Government to set up embassies and send trade representatives to the designated countries to give the necessary support to our overseas workers and families, and assist them to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> settle down in their new environment, help in their children's education and rendering assistance in case of any emergencies. The Government should also speed up R&amp;D programmes to train the necessary manpower for such ventures.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed tax cut on corporate tax and personal income tax and all other tax incentives to encourage overseas ventures are of great help to our entrepreneurs. However, it is apparent that there is no way for us to compete purely on cost. To give an example, last month the hon. Member, Mr Ho and myself, visited Vientiane. The Laotian Government assigned two doctors to accompany us during our visit. We asked them how much they are paid, and we were informed that their monthly pay is US$30, and maybe US$40-$45 with overtime. A 500 cc HondaCub costs about US$1,500. We can see that even taking living cost into consideration, the wage gap is quite astonishing. In order to compete, it must be on value-added areas, whether in goods or services. We must be able to compete in organisation and managerial skill. We must also be able to reinforce our network overseas where information and support can be readily obtained so that we can have the edge over competing entrepreneurs from other countries.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an urgent agenda as other NIEs, like Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, have already had a great headstart, not to mention that their entrepreneurs are not as sheltered as ours. But this is a matter for our survival and in order for Singapore to maintain our target to be a developed country, we must make this undertaking a success. I am confident that with the Government's support and the experience we have gained through our two decades of economic progress, we should be able to carve ourselves a niche in the economic progress in the Asia-Pacific region.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the financial policy of the Government for the coming financial year. I would like to take this opportunity
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to provide feedback on the workers' views on two topics -the proposed adjustment of the CPF contribution rates by half a percentage point with effect from 1st July 1993 and the cap on deduction for medical expenses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, workers are disappointed with the proposal to adjust the CPF contribution rates by only half a percentage point with effect from 1st July 1993. I do not have to remind that our workers have made a big sacrifice in 1986 which helped Singapore to recover from the recession and to enhance our competitiveness. It was the understanding then that the CPF cuts would be restored when the economy recovers. However, the pace of restoration has been painfully slow. Sir, there is a good case for faster restoration. The rate should have been adjusted by at least one percentage point with effect from 1st July 1993. Our economy performed creditably in 1992. The growth of 5.8% compares favourably with that of the other NIEs. Taiwan grew by 6.1%, Hong Kong by 5% and South Korea by 4.9%.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominal wages grew by 7.5% in 1992 compared with 9.2% in 1991. Moderate wage cost increases in 1992 helped to moderate business cost increases. The wage share of nominal GDP increased only marginally from 45.1% in 1991 to 45.4% in 1992. This is well below the figure for Taiwan which was 53.1% in 1990 and the developed countries which ranged from 52.4% in West Germany (1989) to 62% for Switzerland (also 1989 figures). As a result, the increase in manufacturing unit labour cost in 1992 moderated to 3.8% from 5.7% in 1991. In addition, there was a higher productivity growth of 3.1% compared to 1.5% in 1991. The Unit Business Cost Index for the manufacturing sector rose only by 1.9% in 1992, comparing favourably with the average annual increase of 4.9% between 1987 and 1991.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore's competitiveness in the manufacturing sector vis-a-vis the other NIEs declined in 1992, as measured by our relative unit labour cost index in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> US dollar term, this was mainly due to appreciation of the Singapore dollar against the Hong Kong dollar and the Korean Won.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of MTI's assessment that growth in 1993 will be between 6% and 7%, workers look forward to a faster pace of restoration of the employer's CPF contribution rate in 1993. Their reasonable request for an adjustment of one percentage point should be favourably considered by the Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal with the proposed cap on tax deduction for medical expenses at 2% of total employees' remuneration with effect from the Year of Assessment 1994. The aim to encourage both employers and employees to be more prudent in health care spending deserves support. This measure is but one of the many measures to enhance our competitiveness. However, it is important that employers take this proposal in the right spirit. And they should be rigorously reminded that they should not take this as an opportunity to withdraw existing medical benefits. The Minister has said, and I quote, "Government's aim is to pre-empt a future problem and not to deprive any worker of existing medical benefits."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, in cases of companies where employees' remuneration forms a small part of the company's overall budget, employers should provide medical benefits even beyond the 2% cap, even though such expenses are not tax deductible. In this way, they demonstrate their concern for their employees' well-being, and this will spur their employees to work harder for their company's success. There are other ways to monitor and bring down health cost. Employers can implement health promotion programmes for their employees to enable them to keep fit and healthy. Such expenditure will bring them good returns because fit and healthy employees who are properly motivated can help companies to attain higher productivity and more success.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to some aspects of the GST. I am happy that the Government is providing a
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> comprehensive package of assistance, namely, lower income tax, higher personal relief, rebates to help our citizens to overcome problems which they may face following the proposed tax reform and the introduction of the GST. This assistance package will no doubt help the majority of our citizens to cope, to some extent, with the introduction of the GST. As pointed out by many of my PAP MP colleagues, Government is able to cushion the effects of the GST because we enjoy healthy budget surpluses arising from the good economic growth since 1987.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has given the undertaking that "as far as possible, no household will be worse off when the GST is implemented."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to point out that there is need to ensure that with cost of living increases over the years, this package will continue to be adequate. The examples given by the Minister in Appendices E and F (Part 3) of the Budget Statement are worked out based on current prices. Like Dr Wang Kai Yuen, I would like to ask whether they will hold if there is inflation and increases in prices. I would like to urge Government to do a periodic review of the impact on workers' standard of living. An assurance should be given that additional measures will be considered in the event that there are income groups which face hardship because of the tax. It is also important to note that in assessing the revenue loss to Government, because of these measures, the estimated GST collection of $921 million is based on the 1990 private consumption expenditure. With rising expectations and economic growth, this can lead to an increase in private consumption expenditure, and this may well alter the revenue position significantly in the ensuing years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the pensioners, the proposed increase in the Singapore Allowance may not be sufficient to help them. Government should do more for pensioners, taking into consideration the fact that they are former employees of the Government who had worked hard and contributed towards Singapore's
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> progress. I think we owe it to the pensioners to ensure that they will be able to continue to enjoy a reasonable quality of life in their retirement, taking into account their contribution to the nation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the motion.
  <br>4.38 pm
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong (Bukit Gombak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a good budget, save for the GST. I therefore suspect that, on the one hand, it encourages investments from foreigners and, on the other hand, it is a sugar-coating over the GST bitter pill. And like contact pills, once swallowed, it takes a period of time to react accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I question the timing of the introduction of GST, simply because at the moment we have a very sound economy and we have a healthy reserve of over $70 billion. And every year we have huge budgetary surpluses. In 1989, we had $3.7 billion, 1990 we had $3.4 billion, in 1991 we had $5.7 billion, and now we have $4.9 billion surplus. With such strong financial standing, I therefore question the timing of the introduction of the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget is introducing a very radical change to our tax system - from direct to indirect taxation with a broad base. The question before this House is whether the middle and lower-income groups have in the past been paying something like a GST. I am going to say, in fact, they have been paying GST, though not called GST as such. It is a way of indirect taxation by the Government. For example, the foreign workers levy. Because of the foreign workers levy, in the manufacturing sector and the construction sector, costs have gone up and, invariably, the costs have been passed on to the consumers. So that is indirect taxation to that extent and, therefore, they have to pay more, because costs have gone up. And costs have gone up because of the imposition of levy by the Government, bearing in mind the foreign workers levy amounts to $975 million. The foreign workers levy amounts to $975 million which the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Government has received in advance and later on you get the people to pay this back to the Government. It is indirect taxation, which amounts to GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we depend heavily on foreign workers. With the imposition of this levy, the construction industry has to pay more, resulting in rising cost for building condominiums, including HDB flats. Ordinarily, before the levy was imposed, for example, a flat cost $100,000. Now, with the imposition of the levy of $450, probably the cost has gone up to $120,000. But the $20,000 would have gone back to the Government. When the flat is completed, and when the Government sells it to members of the public or its citizens, they would consider this as the cost of increase for the new HDB flats. Therefore, the Government benefits twice over. The first time, they collect the levy, but when the property is for sale, it has not taken into consideration that the increase of $20,000 has already been collected by Government through the levy. That is why the price of the property has gone up. That is also a form of GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next form is HDB rentals. HDB rentals have gone up, and hawkers will have to charge more for their food. It is very obvious. Ultimately, it will be the people, the consumers, who have to pay more for this. That itself, I consider, is an indirect taxation in the form of GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another form is the COE, PARF, ARF, and the road tax. The Government has collected in excess of $1.7 billion from this source of revenue. Quite obviously, this would have resulted in the increase in cost of transport and production. It will again land on the laps of consumers. This, I consider, is also a form of indirect taxation. Like petrol, for example, the ad valorem duty on petrol is about 60 cents per litre. The people have to pay. I know in the Budget there is this provision for reduction. But we do not know what percentage it will be reduced. This is again indirect taxation made through the people.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item is diesel tax. With the imposition of $7,000-odd diesel tax on taxis, the taxi companies will have to raise taxi fares. Had it not been for the imposition of the diesel tax, and had it not been for the imposition of duties on petroleum products, the taxi fare could have been $2, instead of $2.20. So the people are paying indirect tax on the service in this sense. The money has been collected by the Government and the taxi drivers have been made, in a way, the agents for the collection of revenue for the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties collected from petrol in 1990 came to $499 million and, in 1991, $531 million. Then the statutory boards, like TAS and PUB, are monopolistic bodies. You either get their services or none at all. You cannot go elsewhere for water, neither can you go elsewhere for electricity. Similarly for TAS, their prices will keep going up. They will never lose money. So that explains why all these statutory bodies have got surpluses. And the services rendered to the people through these monopolistic bodies will result in the people paying more for the services. This, in a way, is also service tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the reserves of over $70 billion. These reserves have been invested somewhere. Even on a very conservative calculation, based on 4% interest, $25 billion would generate $1 billion in return annually. Where are these returns? And I am sure all these reserves are not just invested by putting them in the bank to collect the 4% interest. They are invested elsewhere. I am quite sure the return would be much higher than just the 4% interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new budget, the Government would lose a revenue of $1.1 billion if they are not implementing the GST. With the GST, they will collect about $221 million. Of course, there is a loss of over $100 million. But bearing in mind, the $1.1 billion loss in revenue was meant partly to induce or to get foreigners to invest in Singapore. Surely, there will be returns for this investment. And as the Prime Minister has said earlier, in good times, the Government is prepared to give back
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> whatever the state has. Why not set an example here? In good times, we should put the budget in practice. Without the GST, the loss in revenue will be $1.1 billion. Set this amount against the budget surplus of $4.9 billion, the Government will still have a surplus of over $3 billion. Why not plough this money back in good times? I am quite sure that the people will go all out to support the Government in bad times.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are worrying about the greying population 20-30 years from now. The ratio is 8:1 but it will be 3:1 later on. With the CPF net being widened now, long before the 20 years, you would have got nearly every Singaporean under the CPF. With the new law to raise the retirement age to 60 years, and with more and more people buying health insurance, MediShield, even the ratio of 3:1 should pose no problem to Singaporeans because all these people would be self-sufficient. And as we pump so much money into education, more and more people will be educated. They will be the working population including the female. Therefore, why are we worrying about 20-30 years from now?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We said we model our system after the New Zealand GST. New Zealand introduced the GST in 1986 at 10% and, in 1989, increased it to 12.5%. But we are way-off from New Zealand. Of course, if you compare the percentage point, Singapore at 3% GST and, New Zealand at 12 1/2%, it is a wonderful proposition to Singaporeans. But then the comparison must not just stop there. New Zealand is a welfare state. They get social security. They get welfare services from the time they are born until they are dead. They get unemployment benefits. They get superannuation benefits when they reach the age of 60. The handicap will get assistance, and so on and so forth. And New Zealand paid $10 billion in welfare payments.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Australia. It is also a welfare state but with certain modifications. They have to pay now for their tertiary education and health, like New Zealand. For New Zealand, they have recently introduced that anyone with an income of $1,300 has to pay ward charges of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> $44 a day. For those earning below $1,300, they do not have to pay any charges in the hospital at all. We are not even talking about a welfare state. We are talking of ploughing back the huge surpluses of $4.9 billion that we have, and we are only ploughing back $1.1 billion. And out of this $1.1 billion, part of it is considered investment to get foreigners to invest in Singapore. Why not? Why are we in such a hurry? Why are we so obsessed with increasing our budget surpluses every year? We have not even touched the reserves, which we should not, because we have very healthy budgetary surpluses every year. For all you know, if we introduce the measure to induce foreigners to invest in Singapore, surely we must have confidence that it will give us good returns and they may even be more than the $1.1 billion we are sinking in now. Even the Prime Minister of Australia has said that the GST is a monstrous tax which intrudes into every aspect of life. And he also said, "Don't have the GST at any cost."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I urge this House to seriously consider this aspect - in good times, everybody enjoys the benefit for the sake of the country; in bad times, the people will share the burden of the country.

  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have to re-learn all my economics after hearing thislecture from Mr Ling How Doong. But I just want a point of clarification. Perhaps he will like to clarify whether he supports the New Zealand model or the Australian model. New Zealand today has a population of our size, with three million people, and welfare payments of $10 billion. Australia today has a population of 17 million or so, and welfare payments of $43 billion. Right now, unemployment in Australia is 11%.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Let me finish my sentence first. He will understand very clearly that Australia is trying to introduce the GST because their economy is in trouble. In Singapore, it is different. We are introducing GST to replace a direct tax system which we know the world is changing to. It is wrong, and it does not make us competitive.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, I must apologise for intruding just now because the Member asked me which model I supported. So in answer, I said that I did not support this. I merely drew an analogy by giving a comparison whereby the public seems to have the impression that if New Zealand has 12 1/2% GST and, Singapore has 3%, it is very reasonable. I said that if you want to draw a comparison, you must put all the facts on the table. You do not just say, "There, 12 1/2%, here, 3%." You must tell them what they get for 12 1/2% and what we get for 3%. I am not supporting the practice in New Zealand and Australia. And I do not support a welfare state at all costs. So I want to make it clear. I meant to draw a comparison here. Do not get me wrong.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very pleased with the categorical statement that he does not support a welfare state. That is why the comparison should not stop at percentages. What is the state of the economy of New Zealand? What is the state of the economy of Australia? Why are they changing? I think these are comparisons that are worth going through. They are profound questions
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> that we must answer. It is not to compare that because it is 3% in Singapore, it will be easier to swallow than Australia's 15%. Do you want 11% unemployment today? Three years of no economic growth and many more years to come? About five or six years ago, the Australian dollar was worth about S$2. Today, if you go to Australia, you pay the most A$1 to S$1. If I am not mistaken, today, the rate of an Australian dollar to one Singapore dollar is about $1.10. Why is this so? These are economics. I would suggest, perhaps, my colleague, Mr Koo Tsai Kee, or Dr Ow Chin Hock, give Mr Ling some basic grounding in economics.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion in the name of the Finance Minister. Since the consumption tax was first mooted a number of years ago, I have always spoken in favour of why a change in this direction is necessary. But I have also made it very clear that I have supported this idea on the condition that there must be corresponding changes in the direct tax system. I think the Finance Minister's very able and comprehensive handling of this very delicate issue has far exceeded my expectations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for this structural change is so compelling, contrary to what Mr Ling has said. I think it should have been done long ago. We have been able to wait to take such a protracted approach only because our economy is very strong. In my various discussions with grassroots leaders and residents, there is a general acceptance that these measures are at the moment quite acceptable to them. Despite what Mr Ling has said, the response from the Opposition bench is rather muted on this issue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the debate on the GST has focused on two main areas. First, the effects on the lower-income group and, second, price increases or profiteering post-GST. I think the first area has been quite well covered by my colleagues. But I want to state that I am personally quite satisfied. I think most salaried employees and self-employed people living in 1-, 2- and 3-room flats will be better off after the GST. The biggest fear
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> for most Singaporeans is that post-GST there will be high price increases and profiteering.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me hazard a guess and paint a different scenario. In the run-up to 1st April next year, I think the predictable consumer response is to spend and buy way above their immediate needs. People are basically human. What they will do is to spend, buy in advance of GST, just to beat the GST deadline. What will happen is that manufacturers, traders, merchants and retailers will respond very quickly. They will make sure that they will create goods, and ensure that there are enough supplies to meet this sudden surge in demand. Our Singapore market is relatively free and goods move in and out without any restrictions. Basically, there are very few imperfections except for controls on cars and so on. Most traders will react in such a manner and, to my mind, it must end up resulting in an over-supply situation. This year's forecast of 6-7% economic growth is very conservative. I think there will be a consumer led boom as a result of this move by all consumers, all Singaporeans trying to beat the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1st April next year, as is the case shown in Japan, I think consumers will loathe to part with their money resulting in a consumption slump. Nobody likes to pay money to Government on levies and taxes. And what will happen is that traders will be over-stocked and they will have to clear their goods. In fact, I predict that after the GST, there will be many post-GST sales.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price increases, contrary to what many people believe, will be minimum. The statement by the NTUC that they will keep their prices, especially on essential items, within 3% of the GST, will also be a further dampener on prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a free market like ours, a very fragmented market, meaning that traders can move in and out any time they like, it is very difficult to profiteer. Fears of profiteering, and I take it to mean that traders increase their prices just to take advantage of the GST, I think is a bit over-stated. With the changes in our
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> consumer spending behaviour, a very strong economy and hence a strong Singapore dollar, a free market with endless supply of goods, and again a safety valve to our neighbouring countries as well - Singaporeans can travel to Johor if they find that Singapore prices are a bit high - and the pervasive presence of the NTUC, Singaporeans' fears on unreasonable price increases are really quite exaggerated. My alternative scenario, I am sure the Minister for Finance will hope that I am right, is not a wish but I believe that this will come about.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the subject of exemptions and zero-rating. Reading the reports in the mass media and from discussions with residents, a common topic relating to helping the lower-income group is the idea of exempting certain goods and services from the GST. There have been reports in the press and the Minister has already rebutted it, that B2 and C class ward charges in hospitals should be exempted from the tax. Some suggested sugar and rice should be zero-rated, and even small television sets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my discussion with residents yesterday evening, one resident did suggest that because the lower-income group can only afford to buy small TV sets, we should waive GST on small television sets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally, GST exemptions are very very dangerous. I think it will lead to all kinds of economic distortions. After all, let us not forget that even the rich can use C class wards. In a free market, how do we ensure that all goods in a provision shop will not be passed off as rice and sugar, if sugar and rice are zero-rated? People, by and large, are very creative, in creating new ways to avoid any kind of Government tax or levy. The more exemptions we have, I fear there will be more avenues for avoidance and in the long run will lead to outright evasion. If we make GST comprehensive, with little or no exemptions, I think this will ensure minimal distortion in our economy.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls for such exemptions are very persuasive, especially when you talk
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> about helping the poor or lower-income groups. However, Sir, no matter how simplistic or simple this idea is, the Government must make an effort to explain and win the hearts and minds of our people and explain to them why even for basic goods and hospital services, it is best that they are brought into the GST and that help of any kind must only come in the form of offsets and income tax reductions which the Minister has already announced. If they are not adequate, certain areas not covered, this can be reviewed. But as far as possible, make GST as comprehensive as possible.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I am very wary of the proposed plan to exempt businesses with sales turnover of less than $1 million from charging the GST. I think this will in the long term act as a dampener to growth and this will also lead to a lot of vertical chaining of businesses from importers to retailers, all with very low sales turnover. For certain businesses, eg, with high volumes and very low profit margins, the 3% exemption is worth avoiding. I think the Minister should be aware of this and I really hope that he will reduce this limit and as far as possible only exempt hawkers and the small traders, and bring the limit of $1 million down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's budget is also notable for another aspect, and it is very clear now that our internal economy, although it is the main engine of growth, as we have said in previous years, must be supplemented with an external dimension. Hence the call for Singaporeans to invest overseas. Our Senior Minister has alluded to a second wing in our economy. However, Sir, so far, this second wing alluded to seems to focus only on the large companies, the public listed companies and Government-linked companies (GLCs). I am no expert on the anatomical structure of a bird's wing, but I know that a bird's wing is made up of very large feathers, a lot of very small feathers and also the down feathers. The down feathers are equally important to the bird in flight. So if we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> take that analogy further, like the wings of a bird, the Government should not just focus on the large companies. I think the focus should be extended to the entrepreneurs and the small companies. Some of these smaller companies, from my own personal experience from meeting these people and also the points made by my colleague, Mr Chandra Das, yesterday, are making very good in-roads into very remote areas in China and Vietnam.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the largest obstacle to these small operations is financing. In the Singapore environment, our banking industry is very conservative and these small businesses have very little or no access to funds. If we are serious in encouraging more small and medium sized companies to venture abroad, I think they must overcome this major obstacle. May I suggest that, besides taking money out from the reserves to upgrade HDB flats, the Government should seriously set aside $1 billion at least from our reserves to back up an insurance scheme. This insurance scheme will back up all the loans that are being provided by the banks. With such an insurance scheme in place, I think bank borrowings can be more forthcoming. Although it needs very careful study, this $1 billion if set aside, can encourage and help more small businesses to go overseas. This will in a way secure our future and our long-term well-being. If this is so, then I think this must be looked into. Mind you, this is not necessarily a losing proposition, because, after all, with an insurance scheme, there will be premiums levied on such loans.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another aspect of encouraging our individuals to invest and venture overseas, and this again has been raised by the Senior Minister, is to lower our CPF safety net. I am surprised that, besides the announcement of the half a percentage point change in the CPF rate, the Minister has not made any substantial announcement in this area. There is no doubt that the CPF scheme has served Singapore very well in the past. I think the question we have to ask is: does it now make Singaporeans more
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> "kiasu", especially those in the high income brackets, and if this is so, does it lead to a lack of entrepreneurship? If this is so, oeen the suggestion of allowing CPF savings for business ventures should be considered.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see a problem here if we allow this to be done. I think the mechanics will be very unwieldy. That is why two years ago, I advocated then that an alternative way was to set an upper limit on CPF savings and progressively reduce CPF savings once a person has reached the upper limit. Presently, there are already cappings on CPF savings, on monthly salaries, on annual salaries above $100,000. So capping is not new. But my suggestion then was to cap the overall accumulated savings. I suggested then that the capping on these savings needed some study, as how much we need to set aside for old age depends a lot on the rate of accumulation of CPF and also depending on the age of the contributor.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High income earners, in my opinion, are quite capable of taking care of themselves. And if this move of capping our CPF savings can be a further boost to entrepreneurship, then this policy must be reviewed. The capping of CPF contributions has several benefits.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it frees the Government from having to debate with the people on how their CPF savings may be used. Second, the Government need not have to challenge the people to invest for higher returns. This is what we are doing now with the investments in gold and stocks and shares. Third, when we cap the CPF, there is more disposable income and increased investments and hopefully these investments will go overseas which is what we are aiming to achieve. Lastly, Sir, wherever possible, there should be less government. And less government in the area of personal savings and, of course, personal choice and this is what GST aims to do, makes for a much less rigid system and will also provide Singaporeans with a much greater measure of personal freedom.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Finance Minister.

  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to take a few moments to address some of the statements made by Mr Ling How Doong. He said that a large proportion of the price of properties was due to the increase in the workers levy. I just want to dismiss his seemingly seductive but untrue point with a simple example. During the Gulf War period, terrace houses in some areas were sold for about $500,000. This day, those who have bought the houses can sell these same houses for about $800,000. During this period, I do not see how the price increase could have anything to do with the workers levy. So I think you can see the fallacy of his statement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he decries the fact that our statutory boards, in being very efficient, can provide low-cost service and accumulate surplus. I really do not know how he wants our statutory boards to be run.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, he says why do we have to worry 20-30 years from now. He does not appear to have any long-term vision for Singapore. I wonder whether his statement reflects the view of the SDP, ie, SDP does not believe in worrying about the future of Singapore. Personally, I would be very worried if those who intend to serve the country do not have any long-term visions for the country.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go on to the Budget proper. The 1993 Budget Statement, in addition to the usual hallmarks of our budget statements, has three important milestones, namely, tax incentives to promote an external economy, a CPF share ownership top-up scheme and measures to offset the GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of building an external economy has spurred the introduction of tax incentives to promote an external economy. We scan the horizons for lands of opportunity and we encourage Singaporeans to embark on a venture to scour these far away lands for the grail of prosperity. These measures give an added impetus to those who answer the call. More can be done. Just as we encourage the setting up of a single
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> window clearance for businessmen wanting to invest in various places such as Batam and India, the Government should consider the setting up of one-stop total business centres. At these centres, businessmen can come for advice on the feasibility of going into various types of business; be briefed on the facilitation measures that have been forged through the EDB or TDB with these countries; be advised on the benefits of the tax incentives available; be directly linked up with financial institutions for financing; and be facilitated in forging link-ups with joint venture partners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in Singapore, a businessman may visit a one-stop total business centre on China, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, etc, where one can obtain a complete business package. Certainly, the private sector must take the lead in going overseas but we must give them the maximal chance to succeed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will next turn my attention to the CPF Ownership Top-Up Scheme. It is a generous gesture on the part of the Government. I support the Prime Minister's view that it is not a handout but a dividend for investing in Singapore Inc. However, there are those whose spirits are willing but financially are unable to do so. In this instance, retirees who have CPF accounts and do not have much savings may find it difficult to put in $500 to benefit from the CPF ownership Top-up Scheme. After contributing to the CPF during their decades of working life, they feel that they should not be left out of the scheme just because they find it difficult to contribute $500 to the CPF account. I feel that these people are the ones that are the most deserving to benefit from this scheme. The Government should consider exempting all retirees of more than 55 years of age, who have previously contributed to the CPF, from the need to contribute $500 before they are allowed to benefit from the scheme. If I may, I will go further to suggest that the Minister should also consider extending this exemption to those in low
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> income families who have already accrued some savings in the CPF account but have had to stop working because of extenuating reasons, for example, physically handicapped or those who have medical illness which precludes employment. I hope that the Minister will not consider it an excessive request to reward those who have toiled hard during their younger days and do not have much to look forward to in their twilight years. With the GST looming ahead, this exemption for these deserving Singaporeans will be indeed a silver lining.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures to offset the GST have to some extent allayed some of my fears about its effect on the lower income group. It does show that the Government has taken great pains to ensure that the lower income group will not be adversely affected by it. However, we do recognise that there may be some families who may not benefit from these measures. As an example, in the area of health care, although subsidies may be given to the subsidised patients seen in hospitals to offset the GST, they will not be able to escape from the effects of GST completely. Let me illustrate with a specific example. In our hospitals, there are far more outpatients than inpatients and a large proportion of the bill comes from the cost of drugs. As the list of standard drugs is limited, there will be many who will be on drugs that are not on the standard list. It is difficult to see how these subsidised patients can escape the effects of GST. I would like to put forward the suggestion that families who are in financial difficulties as assessed by community organisations can be referred to a committee coordinated perhaps by MCD and those deemed deserving of assistance but do not qualify for PA under the current stringent criteria, may be given rebates on the GST on expenditure in essential areas like health care, education, and certain food items. These GST rebates can be reviewed on a six monthly or yearly basis for each family under this scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, the Government must keep a close watch on profiteers. I
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> suggest that for the first year of implementation of the GST, the Government should release a price list of the essential goods and services every month and this should be made known to the public through the mass media. In this way, we can prevent profiteering.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these suggestions, I support the motion.

  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by thanking all Members of this House who have spoken in support of the Budget over the last two days. The debate has been a long one, but many Members have given useful feedback, especially on our initiative to develop an external economy and to introduce the Goods and Services Tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time will not allow me to address Members' concerns point by point. I will, therefore, focus on two areas: first, the building up of an external economy and, second, the introduction of GST. I will also deal briefly with some other major issues. Matters of detail will be carried forward to the Committee of Supply or to the Second Reading of the GST Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of my Budget is to boost our international competitiveness. We must restructure our tax system to sharpen our competitive edge and strengthen our external economy. We must not take our past success for granted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current global economic conditions are not as favourable as in the past. First, world economic growth is sluggish. Many countries, including the world's three largest economies - US, Japan and Germany - are mired in difficulties. Although the US is showing some signs of a recovery, there remain structural problems, like a large budget deficit and an over-sized health sector. Second, trade frictions have increased. The looming trade imbalances are fuelling protectionist sentiments. The recent trade actions of the US Government have raised concern that it is veering towards protectionist policies. The US is the single largest market for East Asia's economic power houses -
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Japan, South Korea and China. US protectionism will retard East Asian growth. Without doubt, the world economic environment is more turbulent and competition is becoming more intense. With the collapse of communism and the dynamism of East Asia, there are more competitors than ever before.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have so far been well served by our open door policy of attracting foreign multi-nationals to provide us with capital, jobs, technological know-how, and ready access to overseas markets. We can no longer rely solely on this paradigm. As we are a small country without natural resources, and with a very small labour base, we are becoming increasingly uncompetitive in labour cost terms with our neighbours - Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and, even more so, with countries such as China, India, Pakistan, East Europe and Russia. We must therefore build up an external economy to complement our present growth strategy. With our accumulated capital, technology and skills, we are well placed to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venturing abroad will create new business opportunities to bring us more wealth. I am confident that, in the long run, overseas expansion will enable us to build up some large local MNCs. Having said this, I must caution that we should not chase evanescent markets all around the world. We should focus our energies on markets which are on the point of take-off, and which we know well. The most promising is East Asia. It is the biggest, fastest growing and most dynamic new consumer market in the world. Our geographical, historical and cultural links give us a competitive edge in doing business in East Asia. We must move quickly to press home our advantage before the best opportunities are seized by others.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my budget, I announced seven tax incentives to encourage Singapore entrepreneurs and companies to make direct investments as well as develop and market their goods and services in other countries. There have been comments that the incentives should have been given across-the-board instead of a case by case basis. With the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> exception of the unilateral tax credit which will be given automatically to any resident who qualifies, an across-the-board approach cannot be used for the other incentives. This is to avoid hollowing out our domestic industries, round tripping of domestic income and our being labelled a tax haven. Nevertheless, we recognise that companies need certainty in tax treatment in planning their overseas ventures. The overseas enterprise incentive has been designed to address this. Companies will now know in advance the kinds of investments which will qualify for tax exemption. This exemption will also be given for longer periods of up to 10 years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members hold the view that the regionalisation incentives will not benefit the small and medium enterprises. This is untrue. SMEs will benefit as much as big companies. They are eligible for all the incentives. Specifically, for the overseas enterprise incentive, all Singapore companies will be eligible, regardless of size. The criteria will be sufficiently liberal so as not to prejudice any particular sector of the economy nor the scale and form of the overseas venture. In addition, the tax exemption for venture capital funds will encourage the financing of SMEs, which would not normally have access to conventional capital markets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, developing an external economy is a multi-dimensional problem requiring a total approach to succeed. We are only at the beginning of our efforts to develop our external economy. More can be done eventually as the needs for those going regional become more clearly defined. Tax incentives alone will not enable us to grow an external wing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have given many suggestions on the kind of support that Government should provide our companies in their overseas ventures. They include financial support, insurance against political risk, greater Government participation and the setting up of Singapore schools and clubs overseas. Government will do whatever else it can
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> to assist in outward economic expansion. The Committee to Promote Enterprise Overseas will look into these suggestions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chiang Meng, the Member for Cheng San GRC, has urged Government to introduce group relief for losses in connection with the call to go regional. We cannot allow this because of the serious tax revenue implications. Where the incomes of the profitable companies comprise Singapore dividends, we may end up by repaying all the tax paid by the companies distributing these dividends. This is because we have a full imputation system in which the tax paid on corporate profits is passed on to the shareholders through the distribution of dividends. We would do well to learn from the experience of countries which allow group relief for losses. They have found that even without a full imputation system, such relief is easily exploited by tax planners.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wong Kwei Cheong has asked for a two-tier corporate tax system to promote entrepreneurship. We will not do so as this allows tax avoidance through business splitting. The better approach is to lower corporate tax across-the-board. People will know that those who dare and succeed will not have a large part of their rewards taken away by tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to GST. The GST will be introduced to allow us to lower our corporate and personal income taxes. By shifting the burden of taxation from the production of income to the consumption of goods and services, we will encourage individuals and companies to work harder and produce and invest more. It will also make Singapore a more competitive place for doing business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has expressed the view that we need not cut our corporate tax rates because we have sufficient tax incentives already to attract foreign investment. If he is referring to pioneer-type incentives, then I would remind him that these are only given for a limited period of time to attract new and specialised investments, and are not
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> enjoyed by the bulk of established companies, particularly those in the manufacturing sector. Even in this area, our competitive edge has, however, been eroded in recent years by competitors who have also cut their corporate taxes and introduced similar tax incentives. Their actions clearly illustrate that we do not have a monopoly on these strategies to attract foreign investments. Cutting our corporate tax rate at this time buys us insurance for the future. It ensures that the profits of Singapore-based companies remain taxed at a rate that will make them competitive with other countries which are also recipients of foreign investment. In this way, we will continue to attract foreign investments to secure our future economic growth and prosperity.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Government's prudence and continued economic growth, we have a healthy surplus and do not need more money now. This is precisely the time to introduce the GST. This way, we can offset the tax through cuts in personal income taxes, rebates, and so forth, and make it easier for households to adjust. If we were to wait until we encounter an economic downturn and the money was needed before implementing the GST, households will find it very difficult to cope.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has said that the Singapore Government in the 1960s opposed the introduction of turnover tax by the then Federal government. He has conveniently failed to point out the high rates at which incomes were then taxed in the Federation. Personal income tax rates were as high as 50%, while tax on corporations was 40%. Obviously, the imposition of a turnover tax posed a further burden on individuals. As the turnover tax was a tax on tax and with cascading effects, it discriminates in favour of large firms which can do many stages of production in-house. For these reasons, the government at that time opposed the introduction of the turnover tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, circumstances are different. Over the years, income tax has come down. This trend is likely to continue as countries compete for capital. In
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore, we are introducing the GST as part of our restructuring to lower personal income and corporate taxes. It is not done for revenue reasons. Our package of offsets is proof of this. The majority of households will be better off after GST. Unlike a turnover tax, the GST does not cause cascading. This is because businesses are able to get a refund of the GST paid against the GST collected. There is obviously no basis for Mr Chiam's comparison.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen, the Member for Hong Kah GRC, is concerned that the lower income households living in 4-room HDB flats will be worse off after GST. Mr Speaker, Sir, although these households will not benefit from the rebate on S&amp;C charges, they will gain from the property tax rebate of about $150 per year. Those with household incomes of $1,000 to $1,500 per month will on the average be able to save $240 per 2year from the reduction in income tax. Together, these two measures will be adequate to offset the GST payable for most of these households.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Opposition have also raised concerns that the middle-income group will not be taken care of under our offset package. This is not true. Households which earn above $1,500 per month will be able to benefit from the generous tax cuts. The tax savings will more than offset the GST payable. Take, for instance, an average household with a monthly income of $2,400 and which spends about $1,700 per month. It would save on income tax by almost $740 per year. This exceeds the GST payable of $590 per year by about $150. This computation has not even taken into account the savings on property tax that can amount to as much as $150 per year, if he owns a property with an annual value of $5,000 or below. If we add the property tax rebate of $150, the total net gain to the household is about $300 per year. Even if we assume that the household spends all of its income after CPF, the GST payable on its expenditure of about $2,000 per month would be, at most, around $720 a year. The saving of $740 from just the income tax alone is more than the GST payable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members are concerned that the package of offsets for GST may be inadequate for retirees. Most pensioners and retirees will be covered under one or more of the various rebate schemes announced in the Budget to help the lower-income groups. Some will benefit from the tax reductions. Others may be supported by their children who will also benefit from the tax cuts and other rebates. There are, of course, a few who may genuinely need help because they cannot enjoy the benefits due to their specific circumstances. This group comprises not only retirees but also low income families living in non-HDB premises. These people will be helped through assistance schemes administered by the CCCs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns have also been raised that while the GST is permanent, the offsets for the lower income groups are transitional. The offsets will operate for five years in the first instance to help lower income households tide over the introduction of GST. During this time, income should grow by 5% to 7% per year in real terms. Most will graduate into the higher income groups and benefit from the tax reductions. However, Government recognises that there may remain a small pocket of lower income households, comprising mainly the older generation, without the skills needed to secure good paying jobs. This group will shrink over time. I have said that Government will re-assess the situation after five years to decide whether we need to continue with the offset package in a modified form. The public can be assured that Government will always look after those who need help. We have done this before, and we will continue to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when families do their sums, practically all will find that the reduction in personal income taxes and the package of rebates and subsidies will fully offset their GST burden.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major area of concern is that prices will rise beyond 3% as a result of profiteering by retailers when the GST is introduced. In our market economy,
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> competition will be our best safeguard against profiteering. Today, there is an abundant supply of necessities in Singapore. If need be, Government will ensure that the supply is increased even more. Government has done this before. Members will recall that the last occasion was during the Gulf crisis. We will not hesitate to do this again, if necessary. NTUC FairPrice has given the assurance that they will not raise prices by more than 3%. This will provide shoppers with a reference point.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their part, consumers should shop wisely. They should boycott shops which raise prices unfairly. This will ensure businesses keep their prices competitive. Consumers can also form consumer groups and clubs. For instance, the Residents' Committees can set up price control groups to monitor and publicise the culprits. CASE is well placed to play a larger role and Government is prepared to increase its funding to CASE to allow it to do so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, Government would take tough action against blatant profiteers. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will review their accounts. As a last resort, the Price Control Act can also be invoked.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members are also concerned that, although the GST rate is 3%, prices may increase far more as businesses will add on to the cost of administering the GST. The GST system that we have proposed is a simple one. The tax will apply as a single rate without complex exemptions and zero rating. As we will also exempt businesses with annual turnover below $1 million, only the bigger ones with proper accounting systems will have to collect the tax. The standard accounting period is three months. These businesses will in fact enjoy a cash flow advantage as they collect the GST on their sales first and pay to the Government only later at the end of the accounting period. All these will help minimize the cost of businesses of complying with the tax. Furthermore, businesses will be able to offset the cost of compliance from the cut in corporate tax. There is, therefore, no reason for any business to raise prices beyond 3%.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been fears that the GST may spark a wage inflation spiral. This should not be the case. At most, the introduction of the GST will cause a one-time increase in prices. This is borne out by the experiences in most other countries. Where introduction did lead to inflation, this was not caused by the GST itself, but by other factors such as excessive wage demands. In Singapore, we have designed a package of tax cuts and rebates to offset practically all households for the GST they will incur. The majority will, in fact, enjoy a net gain in disposable income. There is, therefore, no reason for wage demands to increase on account of GST.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much concern that the GST rate will be raised after five years. The rate will not be raised as long as Government does not need additional revenue. This is possible if our economy continues to grow within our projected range of 4% to 6% and public expenditures are contained. Government has so far been successful in keeping its costs down. To a great extent, this depends on everyone not making unreasonable demands for subsidies. In short, the way to keep the 3% GST rate for as long as possible is to ensure that our income levels continue to rise with economic growth and Government costs are kept under control.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok is of the view that Government should not exempt businesses with an annual turnover of below $1 million. The experience of other countries with GST shows that the cost of complying with the tax falls unfairly on small businesses. In Singapore, we have decided to exempt businesses with an annual turnover below $1 million because it would be difficult for them to collect the tax as they may not have in place a proper accounting system. Small businesses, like neighbourhood retail outlets, HDB shopkeepers, GP clinics, wet markets and hawkers, will as a result not be burdened with having to comply with the GST accounting and collection requirements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, the Member for Bukit Timah, has noted that out of the total GST offsets of $1.1 billion per
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> annum, $318 million will benefit companies, leaving $786 million for individuals. As the GST collection is estimated at $921 million, he has asked who will bear the balance of the tax.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the GST revenue is collected on consumption by both residents and tourists. The estimated yield of $921 million consists of $677 million from residents and $244 million from tourists. The yield from residents is therefore less than the $786 million that Government is giving back through the personal income tax reductions, rebates and subsidies. Government will therefore be giving back more to households than what it collects from them through GST. The net gain to households will amount to about $109 million per annum. In the case of tourists, Government has said that the GST collected from them will be refunded if an administratively simple refund mechanism can be found. Such refunds of course would be borne entirely by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Umar Abdul Hamid feels that the tax rate cuts favour the top brackets. This is not true. The top rate has been cut by three percentage points. This is equivalent to a tax reduction of 9.1%. The tax payable at all other marginal rates has similarly been cut by at least 9.1%. In addition, the 15% rebate for the first $10,000 in chargeable income has been subsumed in the lowest three rates. This means that the tax payable at these three rates has, in fact, been reduced by at least 16.1%. Hence the tax rate cuts do not work against the lower and middle tax brackets.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked for higher personal relief. As I have said before, Government gave higher tax rebates than more reliefs because doing so works to the advantage of the lower income groups.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang is inaccurate in his assertion that the gap between the rich and the poor will widen. The personal tax changes have been structured to benefit the lower income groups. While it is true that the higher personal reliefs are more beneficial to taxpayers in the upper tax brackets, the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Member should take into account the other personal tax changes. The tax rate cuts are proportional. The tax rebate of $700 favours taxpayers in the lower brackets. It becomes a reducing proportion of an individual's tax as his income increases. Overall, the personal income tax structure is now more progressive.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Walter Woon has suggested that legislation be introduced to impose an obligation on children to maintain their parents. This is an interesting revival of a recommendation made by the
  <br>
  <br>1984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee on the Problems of the Aged. The recommendation was not taken up then as it was felt that the timing was not right. The issue was again studied by the 1988 Advisory Council of the Aged. It concluded that such legislation was unnecessary as statistics indicated that few parents were neglected by their children. However, if Mr Woon feels that the legislation is now timely, he may wish to move a motion in this House to introduce a Private Member's Bill for Parliament's consideration. If there is sufficient interest in the concept, the Government will be happy to support the proposal.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that the structural tax reform package that the Government has proposed will serve Singapore well. It will raise our competitiveness and increase our growth. We will have a bigger economic pie to share out every year. Overall, everyone will benefit.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will turn to issues of rising business costs in Singapore. There have been comments that this issue was not adequately addressed in the Budget. The issue is a complex one and it is currently being studied by the Cost Review Committee. We should await the Committee's detailed findings and recommendations. The Minister for Trade and Industry will also be dealing with this subject at the Committee of Supply and I will not dwell on it further.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wong Kwei Cheong and other Members have raised questions over Government's plans to raise the employers' contribution towards CPF to 40% over the next two years and its consequent impact on wages. Government's policy on this matter is well known and I do not propose to expound it again at this time. Members, if they wish, may raise the issue again in the Committee of Supply proceedings.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have raised questions over the Government's proposal to cap the tax deductibility of medical costs by companies to 2%. Like CPF, time does not allow me to enter into a debate on this issue and I will take it up again in the Committee of Supply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much interest has also been generated by the CPF Top-up Scheme. As the Prime Minister has already explained the philosophy underlying the scheme, I will not dwell on it further.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to sum up. 1992 has been a good year. If all goes well, 1993 should be better. The general mood is upbeat. I have no doubt that this optimism will be borne out so long as we stay ahead of our competitors. We have launched our incentives to develop an external economy and restructure our tax system at a critical stage in our economic development. I am confident that these initiatives will fuel our progress from an NIE to a developed nation and create a better and brighter future for all Singaporeans. [Applause].
