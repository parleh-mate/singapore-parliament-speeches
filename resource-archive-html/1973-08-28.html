<div align="center"><b>MOSQUITO BREEDING</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Increase in incidence)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment if he is aware that for the  last  few

months  the  incidence  of mosquito  breeding  has

greatly  increased, pointing to a possible decline

in  the  effective  control of mosquitoes  by  his

Ministry;   whether  this  state  of  affairs   is

attributable to the recent reorganisation  of  the

vector   control  services;  and  why  the  Vector

Control  and Research Branch, the expert body,  is

not   directly   responsible  for  directing   and

supervising  the field vector control staff  which

is  at  the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



moment  supervised  by  the  District

Assistant Commissioners of Environment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, the Ministry of the

Environment  is  aware  of  the  increase  in  the

incidence of mosquito breeding during the last few

months.  Since  March/April  this  year,  we  have

stepped  up our mosquito surveys and control  with

search  and destroy operations. Nine per  cent  of

the  44,530 household premises were found breeding

mosquitoes.  In construction sites  the  situation

was  even  worse. Over 50 per cent of  some  2,363

construction   sites  were  also  found   breeding

mosquitoes. Over the last three months alone, some

2,000  orders  and 350 summonses  were  served  on

households and contractors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous weekly surveys carried out by the

Ministry   of   the  Environment  have   disclosed

distinct  areas  of  high  incidence  of  mosquito

breeding. Action to eradicate mosquitoes in  these

areas has commenced with the application of swing-fogging with a non-toxic insecticide into each and

every  premises.  So far about 4,000  premises  in

Outram  Road, Tiong Bahru, Jalan Bukit  Merah  and

Geylang  have been so treated. The operation  will

continue in Rochore and Beach Road areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above statistics, it can be seen that

far  from  being  inactive, as  suggested  by  the

Member  for  River Valley, my Ministry  has  taken

firm action against mosquito breeders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any recent reorganisation of

the  vector  control  services.  The  control   of

mosquitoes has always been under the Districts and

under  the  charge of Assistant Commissioners.  In

1971,  there  was a reorganisation of  the  Vector

Control  Section  of  the Districts  in  that  the

Sections  were  brought under the  charge  of  the

Senior  Public  Health  Inspectors  in  charge  of

cleansing.   This   was   necessary   to   improve

administration  and  to make vector  control  more

effective as mosquito breeding, as Members are all

aware, is related to cleansing of the drains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vector Control and Research Branch is

responsible   for   research  and   advising   the

Districts of the various actions to be taken.  The

Chief  Vector Control Officer is the  expert  and,

since   April,  he  has  been  advising  and   co-ordinating operations against mosquito breeding by the Districts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is necessary to explain in detail the

type  of mosquitoes that we are dealing with.  The

Aedes  mosquitoes, which are the carriers  of  the

Dengue  Haemorrhagic  Fever, breed  in  relatively

clean water and usually are found in rain water in

containers. These are usually found in households,

construction sites, and in open spaces, but seldom

in  polluted, dirty drains. The Culex  mosquitoes,

which  are not the carriers of Dengue Haemorrhagic

Fever,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



breed  in polluted water. From the above examples,

Members  will  note that there  are  thousands  of

places  that  these Aedes mosquitoes could  breed,

and  it  is  near impossible for any authority  to

carry  out a house-to-house search throughout  the

entire  city at any one time, especially when  the

breeding  cycle  of  mosquitoes  is  very   short,

normally one week. The recent increase in mosquito

breeding is mainly attributable to the increase in

rainfall   over   the   last   few   months,   bad

housekeeping in the numerous construction sites as

a   result   of  rapid  urbanisation,   and   more

generally,  the  complacency and  neglect  of  the

public   to  take  control  measures  within   the

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry participated in a seminar

on  "Mosquito  Control in Construction  Sites"  in

conjunction   with   the  Singapore   Contractors'

Association, the Singapore Institute of Architects

and  the Singapore Institute of Engineers. The aim

of these talks is to inform and educate the people

involved  of  the dangers of these mosquitoes  and

seek   their  co-operation  in  eradicating   this

menace.  The Ministry has also been issuing  press

releases  over the last few months on the mosquito

situation,  but  I regret to say  that  the  press

reports have not given wide publicity, which  they

deserve,  to  the warnings on Dengue  Haemorrhagic

Fever and also on the necessity to take preventive

measures.  The most effective means of  preventing

any  outbreak of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever is,  of

course, to stop mosquito breeding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must reiterate that the control of mosquitoes

is  very  much  the  duty  and  responsibility  of

householders, contractors and, in fact, all of us.

Unless  the  public  plays its part,  the  present

outbreak of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever may get  out

of control.

<div align="center"><b>DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Incidence and mortality)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Health  and  Home Affairs (a) if he is aware  that

the  University authority has reported a total  of

about  370  notified cases of Dengue  Haemorrhagic

Fever (DHF) with at least 10 deaths for the period

April  to July 1973, whereas his Ministry has  not

officially  reported  any outbreak  and  has  only

published  four deaths; (b) why is  there  such  a

discrepancy; (c) what are the actual figures, both

of incidence and mortality; and (d) in view of the

seriousness  of this disease, if he will  consider

making  DHF a notifiable disease by law as in  the

case of malaria.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to

sub-question (a) is yes. The figures on the number

of  cases  and deaths were from a feature  article

published  by a Senior Lecturer of the  Department

of  Bacteriology,  University  of  Singapore.  The

Department   of   Bacteriology   undertakes    the

laboratory diagnosis of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever.

This is done by way of tests on blood samples sent

from  the  hospitals and out-patient  dispensaries

from  patients  suspected  to  be  suffering  from

Dengue  Haemorrhagic Fever.  To  be  certain,  the

tests  are  required to be repeated after  two  to

four weeks. It should, however, be noted that  the

figures from the Department were incomplete as not

all  suspected cases had their blood sent  to  the

laboratory and a second blood specimen  could  not

always be obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure to make an official announcement on

the  outbreak of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever was due

to  lack of information initially and later  by  a

lack  of  co-ordination between  the  Ministry  of

Health  and  the Ministry of the Environment.  The

initial  lack of information was due to  the  slow

buildup of cases over the average "background"  of

cases. Since the disease can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



only be definitively diagnosed by laboratory tests

which  require two blood specimens taken after  an

interval  of  two to four weeks, the outbreak  was

not  evident  until a lapse of time.  It  must  be

remembered  that  Dengue  Haemorrhagic  Fever   is

endemic  in  Singapore and cases occur  throughout

the year as the figures show since 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reports of cases occurring in the hospitals

were sent, as is the normal practice, directly  to

the  Epidemiology  Unit of  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment,  which should have been the  official

source of information when it became evident  that

an  outbreak  had  occurred.  The  absence  of  an

official   announcement   is   because   of   poor

communication   and  co-ordination   between   the

Ministry  of  Health  and  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment.  The Ministry of the Environment  had

taken  over  the responsibility of public  health,

which  included  the Epidemiology  Unit  from  the

Ministry  of  Health  when  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment  was  established  in  September  last

year.  This deficiency in co-ordination,  however,

will  be  put right by regular meetings of  a  Co-ordination  Committee on Epidemic  Diseases  which

has  been formed comprising officials from the two

Ministries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (b), regarding the

discrepancies between the figures purported to  be

reported   by   the   various   authorities,   the

explanation  is as follows. Firstly,  no  official

release on the number of cases and deaths was made

by  the  Ministry of Health. This was because  the

reports  from  the hospitals were presumptive  and

could   have   included  other  fevers   such   as

influenza,   encephalitis,  while  the  laboratory

reports   were  retrospective.  Secondly,  figures

quoted in the press as coming from the Ministry of

Health  were  probably  obtained  from  unofficial

sources.  In answer to sub-question (c), regarding

the   actual   figures,  both  of  incidence   and

mortality, the total numbers for the period  April

to  July 1973 were 207 cases and 20 deaths.  These

figures were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



reported  by the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry

of the Environment and should again be regarded as

presumptive.  Without an autopsy it could  not  be

absolutely certain that all the deaths were due to

Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (d), Dengue

Haemorrhagic Fever is not a notifiable disease. It

is,  however,  by  administrative  directive  made

notifiable  within the Ministry's  services.  This

was  for the purpose of identifying areas of Aedes

mosquito   breeding   and   for   assessing    the

effectiveness  of  mosquito  eradication  measures

over  a  period of time. Generally, the object  of

making   a   disease  notifiable  is  one   or   a

combination of the following reasons:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in the case of a dangerous infectious

disease  where  immediate steps  are  required  to

control   the   disease.  This  is   required   by

international agreement. The purpose is  to  alert

the  international community to  take  appropriate

steps  against the disease. These are mainly steps

in  sanitation and in protective measures. In  the

case   of  Dengue  Haemorrhagic  Fever,  the  only

effective  measure  against  the  disease  is  the

eradication  of the Aedes mosquito vectors.  There

are  no  protective measures such as immunisation.

Further,  unlike Malaria, personal  protection  by

sleeping   under  mosquito  nets,  using  mosquito

repellents are of limited value, as the mosquitoes

tend to be "afternoon biters".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) for epidemiology studies - mainly the

collection   and   tabulation   of   figures   and

statistics.  In  a limited way the  administrative

instruction for notification of the disease by the

Government institutions is for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information is useful for a comprehensive long-term prevention programme of the disease. In the

case of dengue fever, there is only one action  to

be  taken,  that is, the eradication  of  mosquito

breeding.  This  is  a continuous  and  continuing

campaign  taken  whether or  not  the  disease  is

present or peaking. The experts in my Ministry are

not yet satisfied that this disease is so easily



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



and  quickly  identifiable as to make notification

in law useful for immediate counter action.

<div align="center"><b>DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Incidence in Outram Road General Hospital)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Health and Home Affairs if he is aware that in the

present  Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)  outbreak

(i)  many children had been warded with DHF in the

Outram  Road  General Hospital; (ii) Aedes  vector

mosquitoes  were detected in the Hospital  itself;

and  (iii)  at least two doctors who  attended  to

those patients have themselves come down with DHF;

and  what action the Medical Superintendent of the

Hospital   has  taken  to  prevent   the   disease

spreading from that focal point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to

sub-question (i), the number of children warded in

the  Outram Road General Hospital reported to have

Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever for the period April  to

July 1973 was 103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (ii), cases of

mosquito  nuisance have been reported  within  the

large  expanse of hospital grounds  from  time  to

time.  However, previous surveys have  shown  that

mosquito breeding did not necessarily occur within

the  Outram  Road  General  Hospital  grounds  but

occurred  also in building sites adjacent  to  the

Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of April 1973, the Commissioner

of  Public Health was requested to do a survey  of

possible mosquito breeding within the Outram  Road

General  Hospital grounds. On 7th  May,  1973,  he

reported a hole between Ward 8 and the Radiography

building, which has since been sealed with cement.

Another  report revealed breeding in  a  discarded

plastic  basin  in an open space at  the  rear  of

residential  quarters,  Houses  Nos.  416-21   New

Bridge Road. A second report



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



on  31st May, 1973, revealed breeding in Nos.  55A

and 55C Sepoy Lane. These were occupied by private

tenants on a temporary occupation licence, and the

Commissioner  of  Public Health was  requested  to

deal   directly   with  these  persons.   Mosquito

breeding was also found in a drain at a slope from

Sepoy Flats towards Silat School and in a concrete

drain  at  the  servants' quarters behind  Brebner

House   nurses'   quarters.   The   Public   Works

Department had previously been requested to repair

this faulty drain. Follow-up action was then taken

immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth report received indicated that there

was  some mosquito breeding near the reservoir  in

College  Road.  The University  of  Singapore  was

informed  as  this parcel of land was under  their

control. The Hospital authorities have been active

in  adopting  anti-mosquito  measures  inside  and

outside the compounds of the Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (iii), it was possible

that  the  two doctors mentioned were infected  by

the  disease-carrying mosquitoes while at work  in

the hospital. It was also possible that they could

have  been so infected elsewhere. Although one  of

them  was living in the Housemen's Quarters within

the  Hospital grounds, the other was living in his

own  home  in Katong. But the Hospital authorities

have  been  maintaining strict  vigilance  against

mosquito  breeding. But whatever  effective  anti-mosquito  breeding measures are taken  within  the

compounds of the Hospital, mosquitoes could  still

come from outside.

its   initiative  in  setting  up  the  first  co-operative  supermarket, Welcome, in Toa  Payoh,  a

choice area for such an enterprise. I am glad that

since opening its doors for business on 19th June,

1973, Welcome has been well patronized, and I have

no  doubt  that  this is due to its  consumer  co-operative policy of charging reasonable prices and

supplying  goods  of quality, without  wishing  to

make  excessive profit. This must have  helped  in

curbing   unreasonable  increases  in  prices   of

essential commodities, like rice in Toa Payoh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of Welcome to other areas is, of

course,   a  matter  for  the  Welcome  Board   of

Directors to decide, for Welcome must compete  for

its business like any other retail enterprise, and

will require good competent management to succeed.

If  it should decide that its management and other

resources   will  enable  it  to  establish   more

supermarkets in selected locations, the Government

will give its support to Welcome in its efforts to

bring  quality goods and services to consumers  at

fair prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That  the  Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is intended to bring the law up-to-date in

regard  to  the admission and detention, treatment

and  discharge  of persons of unsound  mind  in  a

mental  hospital. The modern trend  is  to  regard

mental  illness in much the same light as physical

illness  and  disability. The  provisions  in  the

existing  Act were laid down as far back as  1934,

probably modelled on the provisions of the  Mental

Treatment  Act, 1930, of England and Wales.  These

provisions  were consolidated in the existing  Act

in  1952. They are, therefore, very much outmoded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in 1934 was on the compulsory

detention of persons of unsound mind. The main aim

was  to prevent such persons from causing harm  to

the community. The role of the mental hospital was

mainly  confined  to  one  of  legal  custody  for

persons of unsound mind. At that time there was no

effective  or  simple treatment for  such  persons

except  preventing  them from  causing  injury  to

themselves or other persons or damage to property.

Since  1934 there have been revolutionary  changes

and  discoveries in the treatment  of  persons  of

unsound  mind.  The trend began with  the  use  of

Electro-convulsive Therapy (1934),  the  discovery

and  use  of psychotropic drugs (1957)  and  anti-depressive  drugs (1959) and outpatient treatment.

At  present,  the trend is towards community  care

and this is provided for by the Mental Health Act,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



1959,  of  England  and Wales  as  far  as  United

Kingdom is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal changes which this Bill seeks to

bring about are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections 31 to 34 relate to the types of

persons who may be sent to the mental hospital for

admission  for  treatment.  Conspicuously  omitted

from  the  amendments are the provisions  for  the

reception  of  a mentally unsound  person  into  a

mental  hospital  by  an  order  of  a  Court.  In

accordance  with  the  changed  attitude   towards

mental  diseases, persons of unsound mind are  not

regarded  as  "criminals".  The  person   can   be

received  in a mental hospital, as any other  sick

person, if he comes voluntarily, if he is sent  by

a  medical  practitioner or if, being  of  unsound

mind, he is considered a danger to himself and  to

others or is being neglected or cruelly treated by

those who should be responsible for his care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5, section 31 is amended to enable

a  person  who requires treatment for  any  mental

disorder  to  be admitted to or to remain  in  any

mental  hospital  without any order  or  directive

rendering  him liable to be detained at  a  mental

hospital.  At  present  admission  to  the  mental

hospital  is  almost exclusively  by  a  detention

order  made by a Court or a commitment  order  for

"observation".  Both connote incarceration  rather

than treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5, the new section 32 will enable

and,  in  fact, require a police officer  who  has

apprehended  a  person who is reported  to  be  of

unsound  mind  and  a danger to other  persons  to

bring such person direct to a medical officer at a

mental  hospital for examination. At  present  the

procedure  to admit such a person is unnecessarily

involved. The police officer is required to  bring

the  person, first, to a medical officer  and  if,

and  only if, the medical officer agrees, will  he

be  sent  to a mental hospital. In practice,  this

step has been found to be redundant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall, however, be making a further amendment

to this section in Committee.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



This  is  being  made  on the  suggestion  of  the

Singapore Medical Association which has made  some

representations to me on the Bill since  the  last

adjournment  of  Parliament. The  Association  had

suggested  that  there might be the  odd  occasion

where the police, in apprehending a person who  is

mentally ill and a danger to himself or to others,

should  have the discretion to take the person  to

any medical officer first, instead of directly  to

a  medical officer in a mental hospital. While the

occasion to take the person of unsound mind to any

medical  officer first, instead of directly  to  a

medical officer at a mental hospital, will be rare

indeed,  the  flexibility nevertheless  should  be

provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsections (1) and (3) of section 33 will also

be  re-amended by the amendments which I shall  be

moving  in Committee. This section refers  to  the

case  where a person of unsound mind is  neglected

or  cruelly  treated. It provides  the  Magistrate

with  powers  to  require  the  persons  who  have

responsibility  for  their  care  to  produce  the

person  of  unsound mind or to require the  police

officer  to  check  on such a report.  If  in  his

enquiries  the  Magistrate has reason  to  believe

that  such  a mentally ill person is indeed  being

ill-treated or neglected, he can refer the  person

to a mental hospital for treatment and care.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magistrate has powers under this section to

impose   penalties   on  the   persons   who   are

responsible for the care of the person of  unsound

mind,  if  they fail to comply with the  order  to

produce the person for examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Singapore Medical Association has

suggested  that  the  penalty  imposed  should  be

extended to charge the persons responsible for the

person  of  unsound  mind for  all  medical  costs

arising  from the care of the person in  a  mental

institution. The motivation behind the  suggestion

is  understandable.  But the  practical  realities

would  render the provision a dead letter. If  the

relatives or persons responsible for the  care  of

the  person of unsound mind are already  negligent

in  the  care  of the person, it will be  unlikely

that  any  order made for the cost of the person's

maintenance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



in   a   mental  hospital  would  be  implemented.

Further,  any  such  order to  pay  the  Costs  of

maintenance  is an open-ended one as the  person's

stay   in   the  mental  hospital  could   go   on

indefinitely. It is for these reasons that I  have

not  accepted the recommendations of the Singapore

Medical Association on this section.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 provides for the reference by any

registered  practitioner of a  person  of  unsound

mind to a mental hospital. This provision is found

in  the old Act. The Singapore Medical Association

had  made  a recommendation on this provision.  It

recommended that it should be provided that in the

event  of  a  person  whom  a  registered  medical

practitioner believes to be of unsound mind as  to

require  psychiatric treatment and who refuses  to

go  for treatment, the registered practitioner can

request and the police officer will have a duty to

take  such person to a mental hospital. I  do  not

agree to this suggestion. This is because a person

who  is merely suspected to be mentally ill should

not  be  subject to coercion and the indignity  of

being  taken  to a mental hospital by  force.  The

type of conditions requiring psychiatric treatment

range  from  the  mild  psychogenic  headache  and

fainting attacks to overt insanity. It would be  a

breach  of  a person's civil rights for  a  police

officer to send, for example, a person who  has  a

mild  psychiatric illness to a mental hospital  if

he  refuses  to do so. Such a person can  exercise

judgement  whether or not he wishes  to  be  under

treatment  in  a  mental hospital and  the  police

should  not  be  made party to force  him  to  get

treatment  against  his  wishes.  This  is   quite

different from the case where the person may be  a

danger to himself as in attempting suicide,  or  a

danger  to  others  and  causing  destruction   to

property. Under these circumstances, it  is  right

and  proper for the police to apprehend the person

and  take him to a mental hospital. This  duty  is

provided under section 32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised provisions are made in section 35 under

clause 5 laying down procedures which are intended

to  ensure  that  no  person is  detained  in  the

hospital



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



for  any  period longer than is necessary for  his

treatment. After examination by a medical officer,

a  person  can be initially detained for 72  hours

for  treatment. Before the expiry of this  period,

another  medical officer must examine the  patient

and,   if  he  is  of  the  opinion  that  further

treatment in the hospital is required, he may sign

an  order  detaining  the patient  for  a  further

period  up to one month. Before the month  is  up,

two  medical  officers (one of whom  is  to  be  a

psychiatrist)  will  be required  to  examine  the

patient   separately.  If  both  medical  officers

consider   that   the  patient  requires   further

treatment  as  an inpatient, they  must  sign  two

separate orders which will allow the patient to be

detained in the hospital for a further period  but

not  exceeding 12 months. After the expiration  of

12  months, if the patient should be detained  for

further  treatment, then the order  for  detention

must be made by a Magistrate on the application of

the visitors of the hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Medical Association had made some

suggestions   on  this  section.  The  suggestions

proposed   were   generally  for  more   stringent

provisions  under which the extension  orders  for

commitment  to a mental hospital are  made.  Thus,

for  the  initial  commitment  of  72  hours,  the

Association proposed that the order be made by two

medical  officers, one of whom may be a registered

medical  practitioner. The first  extension  order

extending  to  one  month  must  be  signed  by  a

psychiatrist,  not  a  medical  officer,  and  the

second extension order up to one year to be signed

by  two  medical officers, as presently  provided,

but  the  difference being that  one  of  the  two

medical   officers   should  be   a   psychiatrist

different from the first psychiatrist who  ordered

the extention of the commitment by one month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered the proposals carefully to see

if there might be any merit from the view-point of

safeguards  over  the present amendments.  I  have

come  to  the  conclusion  that  it  will  not  be

necessary   to  provide  for  the  more  stringent

provisions  proposed by the Association.  For  one

thing,  they are not realistic, nor do  they  take

into account



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



the  organisation of the mental hospital. It  must

be  remembered that a person coming to the  mental

hospital  may do so at any time of the day  or  at

night  when there is only a single medical officer

on duty. It would be impractical if the person who

needs   urgent   admission  cannot   be   admitted

immediately   merely  because  a  second   medical

officer  is not available. Even under the existing

Act,  only  a single medical officer's  commitment

order  is  required for initial commitment.  There

has  been no occasion where it has been found that

this provision has been abused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To require the extension order of one month to

be   signed  by  psychiatrists  would  be   merely

requiring    a   statutory   function    on    the

psychiatrists in the service adding to  the  paper

work,  without any advantage. The medical officers

in   the   hospital   work  directly   under   the

psychiatrists. Patients admitted will certainly be

brought to the attention of the psychiatrists  and

if  a  person requires extended treatment, it will

also   certainly   be  with  the   cognizance   or

instructions  of  the  psychiatrist.  The  medical

officer  on  his own would not sign the  extension

order  without first having ascertained the  views

and obtained the approval of the psychiatrist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there are adequate safeguards in the

Act against wrongful detention: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Board of Visitors have a duty (under

section 30) to check on every person who has  been

admitted to the hospital. Visits are made monthly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Under section 59 there are penalties for

improper detention. Not once has it been necessary

for  the  Board  of  Visitors  to  object  to  the

commitment of any of the persons admitted  to  the

hospital  and  not once has it been  necessary  to

take   action   against  persons  for   improperly

committing a person to the mental hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further protection against wrongful detention is

accorded the patient by the provisions of  section

36  of clause 5 which prohibit any medical officer

from  signing  any order under the Act  who  is  a

relative (defined in detail in that section)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



or who stands in any fiduciary relationship to the patient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 37 in clause 5, the Medical

Superintendent  or a psychiatrist  at  the  mental

hospital  will be empowered to order the discharge

of  a  patient. It has been found that in a number

of  cases,  it  would be in the  interest  of  the

patient to be treated as an outpatient rather than

an  inpatient  of the hospital, so that  he  could

live  in an environment which is conducive to  his

recovery. Under the existing law, the discharge of

a person committed to the hospital can be effected

only  by  a  Court Order in the case of  a  person

admitted  by Court Order, and in all other  cases,

by   a   Board   of   Visitors  or   the   Medical

Superintendent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I refer to some minor re-amendments

which  I  shall be moving in Committee. Section  2

refers  to  the definition of a psychiatrist.  The

definition  has  been reworded  to  make  it  more

precise.  This was made at the suggestion  of  the

Singapore   Medical  Association;  the   operative

wording  being that a psychiatrist is one who  has

experience  and holds qualifications in psychiatry

which  are  approved  by the Director  of  Medical

Services. In the original amendment, the reference

to  psychiatry  has been left  out  and  it  might

presumably  be  conceived  that  the  psychiatrist

could  merely,  on  approval of  the  Director  of

Medical Services, be any medical practitioner  who

is acceptable to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has stated in his speech that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in a number of cases, it would be in the

interest of the patient to be treated as  an  out-patient  rather than an inpatient of the hospital,

so  that he could live in an environment which  is

more conducive to his recovery".



<br><br>While I have no doubt that some patients are  best

treated  as outpatients, in practice I wonder  how

thorough  is  the  investigation  into  the   home

environment   of   a  patient,  particularly   the

financial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



position of the family concerned, in deciding upon

the desirability of outpatient treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of my work on the ground, I

have  come  across a number of cases of  complaint

from  families that they are unable to look  after

the   patients,  and  that  they  would  like  the

patients  to be detained for a longer period;  but

the  mental hospital invariably is quite reluctant

to  do  so. There was at least one case I know  of

where  the parent of a patient came to me  with  a

very badly damaged head. In another case, after  a

patient  was  released and  sent  home  the  whole

family  could not get any sleep for nights because

he  threatened to burn down the house.  These  are

two  of  the several cases which I have  received.

Generally  a family would come along and  complain

that  as  soon as a patient was brought  home,  he

would suffer a relapse, or that his condition  was

no  better  than when he was first  put  into  the

mental hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of investigating into the family

background  as  to  whether the family  adequately

understand  the  circumstances of caring  for  the

patient  or  whether  they are  financially  able,

should  be  looked into very carefully. I  suspect

that it is rather a question of lack of facilities

at  the  mental hospital that causes many patients

to  be  treated as outpatients. Perhaps we  should

seriously think of expanding the facilities at the

hospital.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this point

that I have put forward, that mental patients  can

recover  better if they are gradually returned  to

their  own home environment where there is  family

care and family love, is a modern trend. From  the

medical point of view, it is a sound one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has brought up some

problems,  such  as  the family  not  being  in  a

financial position to maintain the member  of  the

family  who is a mental patient or that the family

is   quite  reluctant  to  take  on  their  social

responsibility of trying to rehabilitate a  member

of  their family. Of course, before releasing  the

patient, we do send our social workers to go and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



investigate the family background, and so on.  But

this  responsibility cuts both  ways.  The  public

should  realise that they just cannot dump on  the

lap  of the Government to take care of everything.

That  should not be the attitude. They  must  also

play their part. It is a matter of the doctors  on

the  one side and the members of the family on the

other, or the social workers coming in between, to

see  that  these mental patients are brought  back

slowly  into the home environment. It is  all  for

the  benefit of the patients. But, of course,  you

do find families who are psychologically averse to

taking back a person whom they thought is not in a

sound  state  of  mind.  If  they  adopt  such  an

attitude,  of  course,  the  patient  will   never

recover.  These are the odd cases that  have  come

up.  My  report  is that quite a great  number  of

those  patients who have been brought  back  to  a

home  environment have recovered. But, of  course,

the  odd  cases will always come up. When they  do

come  up, Members of Parliament may have  to  deal

with  them.  And in dealing with them,  they  will

have to put their problems to me, as far as mental

cases are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the facilities at the hospital,

may  I say that, as I have announced in an earlier

sitting,  we are establishing a half-way  home  in

Sembawang  for the slow rehabilitation  of  mental

patients. I think this will meet the problem which

the Member for Jalan Kayu has posed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do agree

that it is the social responsibility of the family

to try to help in the recovery of the patient. But

all  that I am concerned with is whether the  home

environment  of  a  patient is  investigated  into

before he is sent home. That is my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING AND PYRAMID SELLING (PROHIBITION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to prohibit in Singapore the

trading practice known as pyramid selling  or,  as

it  is  sometimes more euphemistically  described,

multi-level  marketing. Until the arrival  on  the

Singapore scene of an international company  known

as  Holiday Magic, this practice was comparatively

unknown  in  Singapore,  though  the  practice  is

widespread and has expanded enormously  in  recent

years  in  certain western countries such  as  the

United  States  of America, Canada, South  Africa,

Australia  and the United Kingdom. Some  of  these

countries have taken steps to ban pyramid selling;

others  have attempted to control or regulate  it,

but with varying degrees of success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already clearly indicated its

attitude  to  the practice of pyramid  selling  by

taking action in the High Court in April this year

to  wind  up,  on grounds of public interest,  the

company  known as Holiday Magic which  carried  on

pyramid  selling  of cosmetics in  Singapore.  But

petitioning the High Court for a winding up  order

of a company is a lengthy and time-consuming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



procedure. In the result it is  a  poor

substitute to the expression of condemnation  that

is  inherent in an Act of Parliament that  outlaws

in  plain terms this trading practice and makes it

a  criminal  offence for any person to promote  or

participate in such practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential features of pyramid selling are by

now  well  known to Members. In general terms,  it

may  be  described  as  a  scheme  or  arrangement

relating  to  the  sale of goods or  provision  of

services  under  which  the participants  pay  for

their rights under the scheme and receive a reward

for  recruiting new participants. Taken  together,

these  two  factors  lead  to  expansion  of  such

schemes on the chain-letter principle. This may be

better  understood if I explain how these  schemes

work. In a typical pyramid scheme for the sale  of

goods, a company sells and the participants buy  a

right  to sell its goods. Legally the participants

are  usually  regarded as independent  contractors

who  buy for resale the goods from the company  or

from other participants at a discount on the price

to   the  consumer.  The  participants  are  often

described  as  franchise  holders.  The   original

franchise  holders,  as  well  as  selling   goods

themselves  to  the public, will  recruit  further

participants to whom they will sell the goods  for

resale  to the public and, in some cases,  to  yet

another  level  of participants. In  this  way,  a

hierarchy  is built up, each receiving a  discount

from  the  consumer's price on the goods he  buys,

the size of the discount depending on his position

in   the  hierarchy.  Hence,  the  terms  "pyramid

selling" and "multi-level marketing".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all but the lowest level in the structure,

the   franchise  holders  receive  a  payment  for

recruiting   new  participants.  This   leads   to

expansion  on  the chain-letter principle.  A  new

franchise holder pays immediately a sum of  money;

the  amount of the payment being determined by the

level  at which he wishes to join the scheme.  For

this  outlay the franchise holder usually receives

some  goods or credit for goods and some  training

in addition to his other rights under the schemes.

Thus, at the higher levels the franchise holder



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



can  earn  money in two ways; first, by profit  on

sales  he  makes himself and often by a commission

on  sales  by  those on his part of  the  pyramid;

secondly,   from   payments  for  recruiting   new

participants (from the new recruits). Those at the

lowest  level of the pyramid form the bulk of  the

sales  force: they are usually recruited  to  sell

the  products at the lowest rate of commission  to

the public. The company running the scheme has two

main  sources of income: the sale of its goods  or

services   to   the  franchise  holders,   and   a

proportion   of   the   payments   made   by   new

participants or by existing participants when they

buy their way into a higher level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The franchise holder suffers a number of

disadvantages under these pyramid selling schemes,

including the following. He does not usually  have

exclusive  rights to sell in a defined  territory.

Goods  and services are difficult to sell  because

the rewards for recruiting far exceed those to  be

earned  from  selling  and  because  the  discount

structure  of  pyramid  selling  makes  the  goods

expensive  by  the time they reach  the  customer.

Furthermore the goods are rarely advertised. Since

the  higher  level  franchise  holder  can  seldom

recoup  the  investment by selling  goods,  he  is

often  driven to terminate the contract  and  seek

repayment  from the company or to concentrate  his

efforts   on  earning  a  return  from  recruiting

others.  The conditions of the contract  are  such

that  it  is impossible on termination to  recover

any  part  of  the  investment  from  the  company

except, perhaps, repayment for unsold goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High pressure salesmanship by the pyramid

selling  companies' representatives gloss over  or

conceal  these inherent disadvantages but  at  the

same  time  stress  the high  rewards  (which  are

mostly  illusory) available to a franchise holder.

Little  or  no information is provided  about  the

company's  assets,  turnover, capacity  to  supply

goods,  demand  for products,  or  the  number  of

franchise  holders recruited or to  be  recruited.

Recruits   are,  furthermore,  put   under   heavy

pressure  by  the  selling or advertising  tactics

adopted by the promoters



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



to  sign  a  contract and little or no opportunity

given   to   them  to  rescind  if,   on   further

reflection, they should wish to do so.  Since  the

promoters  rarely have a big stake in the  scheme,

the major part of the risks are taken by franchise

holders  at  different levels in the  scheme.  The

chief   attraction   of  the  scheme   for   these

companies,  apart from this, is  that  capital  is

made   available  cheaply  and  quickly  and   the

franchise  holders  are left with  the  burden  of

holding and disposing of the stocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result has been that countless franchise

holders  in  the  countries I have mentioned  have

over  the  years  suffered considerable  financial

loss  and hardship by being lured into these "get-rich-quick" schemes. The Government is  determined

that  this sort of situation should not be allowed

to  develop  in Singapore. Thus, the  decision  to

legislate to outlaw the practice before it becomes

widespread  and before members of the public  here

are  induced to part with their savings on a large

scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, after a close study of the

operations  of  these pyramid selling  schemes  in

Singapore   and  elsewhere,  has   come   to   the

conclusion   that  the  undesirable  features   of

pyramid  selling  are so clearly contrary  to  the

public  interest that the objective should  be  to

eliminate  them  rather than  attempt  to  control

them.  We  have  no doubt in our  minds  that  the

objectionable features of a pyramid selling scheme

to   which  I  have  referred  are  tainted   with

dishonesty  and  are  potentially  fraudulent   in

intent. But having said that, I should add that it

would  be  extremely difficult to prove dishonesty

or  fraud  in  relation to these  pyramid  selling

schemes  under the existing general principles  of

our  criminal  and civil law. New provisions  are,

therefore,  essential  to deal  specifically  with

this practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill accordingly makes it unlawful

for  any  person  to promote or participate  in  a

multi-level marketing scheme or arrangement or  to

hold out that he is promoting or participating  in

such a scheme or arrangement. No



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



business that is designed to promote such a scheme

or  arrangement will be allowed to  be  registered

and  no  company, whether foreign or  local,  that

proposes  to  promote such a scheme or arrangement

will  be  registered or incorporated in Singapore.

Every existing business or company that promotes a

pyramid selling scheme must, upon the coming  into

operation  of  this Act, cease to do so.  Existing

companies   that   promote  such   a   scheme   or

arrangement must within sixty days of  the  coming

into  operation  of this Act take  steps  to  wind

themselves up voluntarily or petition the court to

wind  up the companies concerned. If they fail  to

take  or  complete  the  necessary  steps  to  get

themselves  wound up, the Minister  has  power  to

petition the court to wind them up compulsorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is confidently expected that these proposed

measures, once they are translated into law,  will

be  effective  to  eliminate  pyramid  selling  in

Singapore. However, it should be pointed out  that

it  is  not  the intention of this Bill to  outlaw

schemes  or arrangements which do not contain  the

objectionable elements that I have referred to. It

is   recognised   that  there   are   systems   of

franchising  (including  perhaps  sub-franchising)

and  direct  selling  which  are  not  necessarily

objectionable  and  which  should  be  allowed  to

develop.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a legislative and drafting aspect, it is by

no  means  easy  to  distinguish  clearly  pyramid

selling  schemes  from those other  systems  which

sometimes  have  a pyramid element  in  them.  The

question of definition, therefore, assumes primary

importance  in  this  Bill. The  definition  of  a

pyramid  selling scheme or arrangement  should  be

one  that  is  easily understood  and  capable  of

effective  application and be  so  drafted  as  to

pinpoint   the   objectionable  elements   earlier

mentioned.  It should not, however, be  so  widely

drafted  as  to prevent development  of  perfectly

lawful  schemes  and arrangements.  Provision  has

accordingly been inserted in clause 11 of the Bill

for  the Minister by regulations to spell out  the

elements  of a scheme or arrangement that  may  he

lawfully



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



operated  in  Singapore. Although  these  elements

have not as yet been comprehensively worked out by

the Attorney-General, it is envisaged that schemes

of  franchise  trading where the franchise  holder

does  not  recruit  others  and  sells  goods   or

provides  a  service from one  level  and  from  a

retail  establishment will not  be  objectionable.

Again,   schemes  of  direct  selling  where   the

company's main source of income is from  the  sale

of  goods  and services rather than from  payments

for   recruiting  others  and  where  the  company

subscribes  to  a code of conduct  and  where  the

franchise  holders are agents of the company  (not

independent  contractors) and work  in  a  defined

geographic area, etc., will not be objectionable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of a "pyramid selling scheme or

arrangement"   in  section  2  is   not   intended

accordingly to interfere with these other  schemes

or  arrangements  to  which I have  referred.  The

definition adopted will ensure that recruitment of

participants  in pyramid selling  schemes  on  the

chain-letter  principle will be prevented  for  it

would  be impossible to take or make payments  for

rights in such a scheme or arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill summarises

the   objects   and   reasons  of   the   proposed

legislation,  and I need not elaborate  upon  them

further  except  to draw attention  to  clause  10

which  makes  it clear that sales to consumers  of

commodities received by the seller under a pyramid

selling  scheme,  the promotion of  which  becomes

unlawful  under the Bill, are not declared  to  be

unlawful if the commodities were received  by  the

seller  at  any  time before the  Act  comes  into

operation.  The  purpose of this provision  is  to

confer  a  limited  measure  of  protection   upon

existing   franchise  holders  who  have   already

participated in an unlawful scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill which seeks to amend the Companies Act

may, in certain of its provisions, be regarded  as

an  extension of the philosophy that is  basic  to

the  Securities Industry Act. That is to say, that

in  great  measure  this Bill  is  concerned  with

matters involving the protection of investors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision has also been made in clause 4, which

amends  section  39, for the Registrar  to  exempt

companies from compliance with any requirements of

the  Act  relating to the form and  content  of  a

prospectus if, in his opinion, compliance would be

unduly  burdensome. This amendment is intended  to

make   it   easier  for  foreign  companies   with

innumerable  subsidiaries to seek listing  on  the

Singapore Stock Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions that appear in clauses 9, 10, 11

and  15  are in one way or another concerned  with

dealing  in  securities by  officers,  agents  and

employees   of  a  company,  with  disclosure   of

shareholdings  held  by  directors  or  with   the

extension  of  powers to ascertain the  beneficial

ownership  of securities where, for example,  such

securities are held in nominee names. They are, in

short,  designed to ensure that persons, by reason

of  their  position  in  a company,  do  not  take

advantage of confidential knowledge of the affairs

of  a  company by buying or selling the shares  of

their  companies for their own profit or for other

persons'   profit  and  to  the  disadvantage   of

shareholders or investors generally, and to ensure

that  these persons make full disclosure of  their

shareholdings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concepts involve not only the dishonest form

of share trading known as insider trading but also

the  duty  of  directors of a company  to  make  a

general disclosure of their shareholdings so  that

the   investing  public  are  aware  of  what  the

managers of a company are doing with their  shares

in the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to insider trading -which may

loosely  be  said  to be the use  of  confidential

information before a rise or even a fall in  price

of  a  share or stock - the existing section  132A

has  been  considerably expanded in  clause  9  to

cover  not  only the dishonest use of confidential

information  by  officers of a company  (including

directors)  for their own financial  advantage  or

that  of  other persons but also of  agents  of  a

company (such as bankers, auditors, solicitors  or

stockbrokers) and employees similarly misuse  such

confidential  information for their own  financial

advantage  or  that  of  other  persons.   Equally

significant,   this  concept   that   appears   in

subsection (1) of section 132A extends to apply to

dishonest use of confidential information by  such

persons to gain advantage for themselves or  other

persons  where there is a possibility of  a  take-over  offer being made to another corporation,  or

where   there  is  possibility  of  a  substantial

commercial  transaction being  entered  into  with

another  corporation by dealing in the  securities

of that other corporation on a stock exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Minister has power under

subsection  (7), for the protection of  investors,

to  restrict  dealings  in  the  securities  of  a

corporation  by an officer, agent or  employee  of

that  corporation  during  certain  periods  of  a

financial year of a corporation when such  persons

are,  or  are likely to be, in possession of  what

may    be    called   privileged   price-sensitive

information regarding a company's securities.  The

Minister  under  this section may  also  direct  a

committee of a stock exchange or the committee may

of  its  own  motion investigate any  dealings  in

securities and for this purpose may summon persons

to give evidence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



This power taken together with the powers that may

be delegated by the Minister under section 208 (by

clause  15)  will enable a committee  of  a  stock

exchange to get behind nominee holdings, which  is

one  of  the  methods used by insiders to  acquire

large  and  secret holdings in a company  that  is

likely to be made the target of a take-over bid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we have attempted to make insider trading

a  specific criminal offence, it would be rash  to

claim that the section covers all forms of insider

trading  or that a successful prosecution  can  be

launched  in every case where insider  trading  is

suspected. The section does not, for example, deal

with a situation where information is acquired  by

third persons by improper or dishonest means, such

as  the bugging of company discussions. But it  is

not  to  be  thought  that such  persons  can  use

information  acquired in this way  with  impunity.

They  could  still  be  caught  in  the  catch-all

provision (section 87) of the Securities  Industry

Act  which is drafted in the widest possible terms

to  deal with all forms of fraud or deceit used in

the  purchase or sale of securities. A prosecution

for  insider trading could he launched under  that

section    against   any   person   who    misuses

confidential  information.  However,  it  is   not

intended    that   persons   who   have   acquired

information  in a perfectly proper and  legitimate

manner   and  who  are  not  insiders  should   be

penalized  under  either of these offence-creating

sections.  But  it  is the intention  that  if  an

insider  deliberately benefits an outsider through

the  misuse  of  his confidential information,  he

will  be liable under the provisions as if he  had

received the outsider's benefit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are additional problems of definition in

the section which are extremely difficult to cover

with any degree of precision. For example, an area

of uncertainty inevitably arises by the use of the

words  "affect materially the price of the subject

matter  of  the  dealing on a stock  exchange"  in

relation to the non-disclosure of the confidential

information.  Such problems will necessarily  have

to  be left to a court to decide, having regard to

the particular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



circumstances of the case. Again, the  section  is

limited  to dealings in securities with an insider

on  a  stock  exchange  and  does  not  extend  to

dealings  in securities that take place outside  a

stock  exchange. Experience in the application  of

this   provision   will   tell   whether   further

amendments  to  this provision  are  going  to  be

necessary. Since the proposed new section  extends

to  employees  of a company, it is doubtful  if  a

company  will be able to tell its staff  that  the

forthcoming company results are going to be  good;

again where staff purchase options in shares,  the

time when these options are exercised could create

difficulties,  though the Minister could  in  this

latter respect exempt such dealings in regulations

made under subsection (7) of new section 132A.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these and other purely drafting

problems, the Government is determined to  provide

and   enforce  a  legislative  framework   whereby

insider traders can be brought to book for  it  is

now  generally agreed that this dishonest form  of

trading is just as reprehensible as other forms of

dishonest trading which are punishable under  Part

X of the Securities Industry Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions in the keeping of

a  register of directors' share-holdings  and  the

general  duty  of directors to make disclosure  of

their holdings that are at present provided for in

section 134 of the Act, these provisions have been

substantially  redrafted. The effect  of  the  new

section is to oblige a director to make disclosure

to  the  company  not only of the details  of  his

shareholdings    but    also    debentures     and

participatory  interests,  rights,   options   and

contracts  to  which he is a party,  and  for  the

company to enter into its registers, amongst other

things, the price and the date of the transaction.

These  details must be entered by the  company  in

its register within three days of receiving notice

from  a  director. The Registrar has the right  to

require the company to submit to him a copy of the

register or any part of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining provisions are much the same as in

the existing section except



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



that the penalty for default has been considerably

increased.  The  new section  135  is  related  to

section  134 and obliges directors to comply  with

the  latter  section and also  to  advise  of  any

change  in the particulars of his holdings  within

24 hours of the change. A company, however, has  a

period of seven days within which to advise  other

directors of the company of events occurring under

subsection  (1). Certain defences to a prosecution

under this section are made available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 13 the intention is, as mentioned in

the  Explanatory  Statement,  to  spell  out  with

greater  particularity what  are  the  powers  and

duties  of  auditors  of companies  in  regard  to

reports or accounts and consolidated accounts. His

duties  are now put in a more positive  form;  for

example, he must now form an opinion as to whether

he   has   obtained   all  the   information   and

explanations that he required rather than,  as  in

the  existing provision, state in his report  that

he  has  not  obtained  all  the  information  and

explanations  required.  Furthermore,  if  he   is

satisfied  that  there has been a breach  or  non-observance  of any provision of the Act,  and  the

matter  has  not  been or will not  be  adequately

dealt  with in his report on the accounts  or  the

consolidated accounts or by bringing  this  matter

to   the  attention  of  the  directors,  he  must

forthwith  report  the matter in  writing  to  the

Registrar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that an auditor may fearlessly and

conscientiously carry out his duties  as  auditor,

by  a  new section 174A, he is not, in the absence

of  malice,  liable in any action for  defamation.

Neither  shall  any other person  be  liable  who,

without  notice, publishes a document prepared  by

an  auditor  in  the  course  of  his  duties  and

required to be lodged with the Registrar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next significant feature of the Bill appears

in clause 14 which amends section 179 dealing with

take-overs  and mergers. In July of 1971,  Members

might  recall  that I indicated in a statement  in

Parliament  that  a study would  be  made  of  the

London  City  Panel  and Code  on  Take-overs  and

Mergers to ascertain if a similar non-statutory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



scheme  would  be  suitable  and  appropriate  for

introduction   into  Singapore,   either   as   an

alternative  or supplemental means of  controlling

take-overs  and  mergers.  I  shall  reserve   for

another occasion a statement on the nature of  the

Code  and  the  principal functions of  any  body,

panel  or  committee,  and  the  constitution   of

membership  thereof  that  may  be   set   up   to

administer  the  Code. On this  occasion  I  shall

confine  myself to giving brief reasons, based  on

advice  tendered to me by the Securities  Industry

Council,  why  the non-statutory  Code  should  be

adopted  in Singapore in addition to the statutory

provisions dealing with take-overs and mergers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great advantage of a non-statutory Code is

its  flexibility, a very necessary attribute  when

one  is  laying  down in effect  what  amounts  to

business  standards of behaviour in take-over  and

merger  situations rather than the laying down  of

strict  legal  rules. Such a Code can  be  amended

easily  to  deal  with new situations  that  might

arise  or to revise existing concepts that  appear

in  the  Code.  Again,  the creation  of  a  body,

committee  or  panel, to supervise and  administer

take-overs  and mergers that consists  of  persons

who  are  conversant  with  the  workings  of  the

securities market, ensures that the experience and

expertise of those persons can be utilised in  and

brought  to  bear  upon  this  complex  field   of

business. But more than anything else there is the

consideration   that   our   existing    statutory

provisions, standing by themselves, are inadequate

to  deal with the many problems likely to arise in

take-over and merger situations. Although it would

not  be difficult to expand the existing statutory

provisions   to  ensure  greater  disclosure   and

equality of treatment of shareholders and  so  on,

the   statutory   provisions   would   still    be

unsatisfactory  for, by their very rigidity,  they

militate   against  the  prompt  and   expeditious

settlement of take-over problems and can never  be

detailed  enough  to cover the wide  diversity  of

take-over  techniques, bid  tactics,  patterns  of

share ownership and control,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



the  consideration offered, and so  on,  that  may

occur from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inevitable delay in seeking amendments to

statutory  provisions by way of an  amending  Bill

with  the  difficulties that this may cause  to  a

pending  takeover should also be borne in mind.  A

more practical consideration is that, owing to the

serious  shortage of qualified and  trained  staff

possessing  the  appropriate  expertise   in   the

Registry  of  Companies, it is not at the  present

time  possible for this department effectively  to

administer and supervise take-overs under a purely

statutory  scheme.  It would be some  considerable

time  before  persons of the right calibre  become

available and, even then, it is doubtful  if  they

could have the same amount of expertise in matters

connected  with the securities industry  that  one

would  expect to find and utilize in  the  private

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these brief reasons, it is considered that a

supplemental non-statutory Code is likely to be  a

more   efficient   and   expeditious   method   of

administering   and  controlling  take-overs   and

mergers  than non-statutory provisions.  I  should

add,  at  this  point, that if this  amendment  is

passed   and   a  body,  panel  or  committee   is

constituted to administer a non-statutory Code, it

is envisaged that, unlike the existing London City

Code, the powers conferred upon such administering

authority  would be much greater than is conferred

upon its London counterpart. These powers would be

conferred under the Securities Industry Act and in

the  provisions  of  this Bill. The  administering

authority would still, as in London, however, have

consultative and supervisory functions. It is also

important   to  mention  that  this  administering

authority  would  work  very  closely   with   the

Quotation  Section  of  the Stock  Exchange  which

would  retain many of its existing functions  with

regard  to  companies concerned in take-overs  and

mergers. The Quotation Section would, for example,

satisfy  itself that the offer documents meet  the

requirements of the Code. It will, of  course,  be

necessary  for  the  Stock Exchange  Rules  to  be

considerably  expanded in regard to  its  takeover

and merger rules, and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



Committee  of the Stock Exchange are looking  into

this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result, section 179 has been amended to

enable  the Minister, in subsection (11)  thereof,

for the more effective administration, supervision

and  control of take-overs and mergers, to  direct

by  notice  if  he considers it necessary  in  the

public interest or for the protection of investors

that   all  parties  in  a  take-over  and  merger

transaction shall, in addition to compliance  with

the  Tenth  Schedule, be bound to  abide  by  such

general  principles and rules of  a  non-statutory

nature   as   he  may  determine;  these   general

principles and rules would be administered by such

body,  panel  or  committee as  the  Minister  may

specify in the notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister decides to take action under

this  provision,  it is envisaged  that  he  would

direct that provisions similar to the London  City

Code on Take-overs and Mergers would be binding on

all  parties  to take-over and merger transactions

with,  of  course,  such modification  as  may  be

necessary   to   adopt   this   Code   to    local

circumstances. It is also envisaged  that  such  a

Singapore Code would be administered and  enforced

by the Securities Industry Council, the membership

of  which would be enlarged to include a number of

merchant  bankers  experienced in  take-overs  and

mergers.  In  actual practice, it is thought  that

the Securities Industry Council would create a sub-committee  to  handle the take-overs  and  mergers

aspect  of the Securities Industry Council and  to

report  its  decision  to the Securities  Industry

Council for consideration and approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment to section 179 will ensure

that  the  body, panel or committee (in fact,  the

Securities Industry Council) that will be  dealing

with takeovers and mergers will receive copies  of

all the notices and statements referred to in that

section. Subsection (10) at present provides  that

such notices and statements should be sent only to

the  Registrar or a Stock Exchange.  Members  will

also note the amendment made to the Tenth Schedule

which also concerns take-overs and mergers (clause

21).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the amendments to section 208

(clause  15)  is  principally  to  confer  upon  a

committee  of a stock exchange, with the  approval

of  the  Minister, to make its own enquiries  into

nominee  holdings. The nominee  system  does  have

certain advantages, namely, banks sometimes prefer

to  have complete control over shares lodged  with

them as security and therefore register the shares

in  their names; investment managers can buy large

blocks of shares in nominee names rather than many

small  blocks  in  many  names.  Again,  if  large

investors are making substantial investments in  a

particular company, they might not wish it  to  be

generally   known  since  this   could   have   an

exaggerated  effect  on the market  price  of  the

company  concerned; certain investors do not  want

to  be  troubled  personally with offer  documents

collecting  dividends and so on, and  leave  these

things  to professional advisers acting in nominee

names.  But  these have to be weighed against  the

disadvantage  that  nominee holdings  conceal  the

buildup  of very substantial holdings in a company

and   are  sometimes  used  to  conceal  dishonest

insider dealings. While it is not intended at  the

present  time to abolish nominee holdings,  it  is

the  intention that greater use will in future  be

made of section 208 to investigate these holdings.

Nevertheless,   the  whole  subject   of   nominee

holdings  will be reviewed at a suitable  time  by

the Securities Industry Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in clauses 16 and 17,

which  amend sections 217 and 218 respectively  of

the Companies Act, enable the Minister to petition

the   court  in  certain  circumstances  for   the

compulsory winding up of companies that  carry  on

the  business of multi-level marketing or  pyramid

selling.  The  proposed amendments are,  in  fact,

related  to the Bill which has been considered  by

Members  and  which  is designed  to  ban  pyramid

selling in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final significant feature of this Bill is

concerned with investment companies and  is  dealt

with  in  clause  18. Members will  see  from  the

Explanatory  Statement  what  the  effect  of  the

amendments would be to Division I of Part XI.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



I  need  not  enlarge upon this  explanation.  The

purpose of all the amendments proposed is to relax

the  rigour  of some of the existing  restrictions

with  regard to the powers of investment companies

to  borrow,  to invest in other companies  and  to

underwrite  securities, and  to  relieve  them  of

certain  obligations with regard to  the  articles

and prospectuses and particulars to be attached to

balance  sheets. Only one investment  company  has

been  proclaimed  as such up to the  present  time

but,  with  the  development  of  Singapore  as  a

financial and investment centre, more applications

will  be  received from companies to be proclaimed

under subsection (2) of section 319.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that our Securities Industry

Act  was drafted on the basis that a common  Stock

Exchange  between  Singapore  and  Malaysia  would

continue to exist. Certain provisions of this Act,

accordingly, gave legislative recognition  to  the

existence  of  the  joint Malaysia  and  Singapore

Stock  Exchange.  The decision  of  the  Malaysian

Government to discontinue the joint Stock Exchange

and    to   operate   its   own   stock   exchange

independently  has, therefore,  radically  altered

the  existing  legislative position.  One  of  the

immediate consequences of this decision  has  been

that Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



was  obliged  to  create its  own  separate  Stock

Exchange  and, as we all now know, this new  Stock

Exchange is called the Stock Exchange of Singapore

Ltd.  The  former joint Stock Exchange of Malaysia

and Singapore is in the process of being dissolved

and   no   longer  operates  a  stock  market   in

Singapore.  The only stock market in existence  in

Singapore  is  the  stock  market  of  the   Stock

Exchange of Singapore Ltd. This Stock Exchange has

been  approved  by  me  under  section  6  of  the

principal  Act.  With all these  developments,  it

will   be  readily  appreciated  by  Members  that

amendments  will need to be made to the  principal

Act  to  bring  the  Act into line  with  the  new

factual situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement explains the nature of

the  amendments  that  arc proposed.  I  need  not

elaborate  upon them except to say that  with  the

repeal  of  section  98  of  the  Act  legislative

recognition will no longer be given to the  former

joint  Stock  Exchange of Malaysia and  Singapore.

The  new Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd, will now

operate independently with its own Rules, Bye-laws

and  Listing  Requirements. Members of  the  Stock

Exchange  of Singapore will henceforth  deal  with

members of the Stock Exchange of Malaysia  in  the

same  way  as they deal with members of any  other

foreign  stock  exchange,  whether  they  are   in

London, Hongkong or elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dissolution of the joint Stock Exchange has

not,  up  to the present time, materially affected

the  total number of companies quoted on  the  new

Singapore  Stock  Exchange. From  this  total  the

Singapore registered companies number 76  and  the

Malaysian  companies number 154.  The  balance  is

made  up  of  45  companies  registered  overseas,

mainly  in  the  United  Kingdom.  It  may  he  of

interest to Members to learn that during 1972 (and

the  previous years of 1970 and 1971 were not  all

that different), of the total turnover of units on

the former joint Stock Exchange something like  60

per cent to 70 per cent of this total turnover was

attributable    to   Singapore    share    dealing

transactions,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



though  I  should stress that it is difficult  for

technical  reasons to be precise as to  the  exact

contribution  to total turnover made by  Singapore

and Malaysia. It is, however, true to say that the

greater  part of the total turnover  of  units  is

over  the  last few years attributable to dealings

in  Singapore. Again, the total paid-up capital of

the  Singapore registered companies  in  1972  was

$1,275  million compared with Malaysian  companies

which   was  $1,460  million,  and  total   market

capitalisation for Singapore quoted  companies  is

approximately  50  per cent higher  than  that  of

Malaysian quoted companies. The turnover value  of

shares  of Singapore quoted companies in 1972  was

approximately three times higher than in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for dealers in securities, there are 17

member-companies and one member-firm consisting in

the aggregate of 63 stockbrokers - the member-firm

referred  to  will  in the next twelve  months  be

converting    itself   into   a    member-company.

Additionally,    there    are     277     dealers'

representatives (formerly described as dealers and

remisiers). Both these factors, that  is  to  say,

the  number  of  companies  quoted  on  the  Stock

Exchange  and the number of brokers operating  are

relevant in relation to the viability of  a  stock

market  as, of course, are the number of investors

and  share traders who are prepared to risk  their

monies at any particular time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Singapore Government's point of view,

it  would  welcome the continuance of the  present

position  whereby  Malaysia  registered  companies

continue  to  be quoted on the Stock  Exchange  of

Singapore. But even if it should come to pass that

some  of  these  companies,  for  one  reason   or

another,  cease to be quoted here there  are  good

grounds  for  believing that the  Singapore  Stock

market  would be a viable one. In this connection,

I  should  mention that ii is the  policy  of  the

Government and of the Stock Exchange to  encourage

the  listing of new companies that come up to  the

standards  for  listing laid  down  by  the  Stock

Exchange and the Securities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



Industry Council. This policy will extend not only

to  local  companies  but  also  to  companies  of

international standing that are registered outside

Singapore that wish to have a listing on our Stock

Exchange.  Conversely, subject to guidelines  laid

down by the Securities Industry Council, Singapore

companies  will  not be discouraged  from  seeking

listings on foreign exchanges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this does not disguise the fact that the

creation of a separate Stock Exchange in Singapore

has   created  teething  problems  for  the  Stock

Exchange   Committee.   Many   of   the    initial

difficulties   brought   about   by   the   sudden

transition  to  a  separate Stock  Exchange  have,

however,  I  am  glad  to say,  been  successfully

overcome.  The  Committee  has  faced  up  to  its

problems  in  an  energetic and business-like  way

which  augurs well for the future of the new Stock

Exchange. The Committee has brought out New  Rules

for the Exchange which are a great improvement  on

the  old Rules. These Rules take into account  the

provisions  of the principal Act which affect  the

Exchange  and its members. The Committee has  also

published  in booklet form its policy with  regard

to corporate disclosure. Since this policy is very

much concerned with the maintenance of a sound and

healthy   market  and  with  fair   treatment   to

investors,  the  Government  expects  all   listed

companies to comply with the new policy. They must

also   pay  strict  regard  to  the  new   Listing

Requirements  that  have  been  prepared  by   the

Exchange  and  sign  without delay  the  necessary

undertaking to be bound thereby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence, therefore, of adverse factors

that  cannot at present be anticipated, we can,  I

venture to say, look forward in the years ahead to

increasing growth of this Exchange. In the context

of  Singapore's development as a financial centre,

it would not, I think, be over-sanguine to predict

that  the Stock Exchange will assume much  greater

importance  than hitherto, both from a  local  and

international point of view.
