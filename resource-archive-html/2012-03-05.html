Mr Chairman, Sir, one of the most pressing issues today has to do
with that of Singapore's burgeoning population. In the annual Population
Trends report released by the Department of Statistics, the total population
grew by 2.1%, with our total population hitting 5.18 million at
the end of June last year. This has fuelled many practical fears
and concerns by Singaporeans as to the adequacy of the nation's
infrastructure to absorb such rapidly increasing numbers. </p>

strains of this is young, newly-working adult Singaporeans. I would
like to ask the MND whether more can be done to ensure that newly
built flats are made affordable for younger start-up families as
well as the average working-class family. Would the Ministry also
continue to review and revise income ceilings on a more regular
basis so that it corresponds to the demands of Singaporeans from
a wider segment of society, thereby ensuring that homes remain affordable
for a broad section of the population? </p>

plans to help target groups such as divorcees with children and

the line-up beyond just building more subsidised rental flats?</p>

increases, we would need more "spill out" spaces such as parks and
gardens where people can unwind and come close to nature and feel
restored and refreshed. Also, given the many tributaries and rivers
in Singapore, how could we help to bring even more Active, Beautiful
and Clean (ABCs) projects and near-the-river experiences to Singaporeans?
If there are these pockets of solace, close to mother nature, away
from busy roads and concrete infrastructure, it could well help Singaporeans
cope with the inevitable increase in population which globalisation
brings to a small and attractive city-country.</p>

                  </span>:
Sir, please forgive my flu-stricken voice. First, Lift Upgrading
Programme (LUP). The LUP is a Government programme where the bulk
of the cost is to be borne by the Government with the balance co-shared
between residents and Town Councils, each paying between 5% and
12.5%. However, based on the accounting used by HDB, the Town Councils
are paying much more and are subsidising HDB's share. This is because
HDB's definition of LUP costs is different from what a common person
understands. HDB defines LUP costs as "the total cost of lift upgrading minus
the Town Council's share of the lift overhaul costs".</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a4b4cb5e-3463-4638-b7fb-fe9f50d178a6">
                  <a name="budget__id-a4b4cb5e-3463-4638-b7fb-fe9f50d178a6"><!--a--></a>What then is lift overhaul?
During LUP, new lift shafts are erected. Once operational, HDB requires
one or two of the existing lifts to be shut down. According to HDB's
logic, the shutting down of these lifts is deemed an overhaul. The
Town Councils have to pay HDB the overhaul costs, as overhauls are
cyclical works to be done by the Town Councils. The overhaul cost
is based on a 28-year life span for a lift. If the lift is 24 years old
now, the Town Council has to pay the depreciated portion, that is,
24 out of 28 years of value based on HDB's costings, which cannot
be challenged. This could easily work out to about $100,000 for
each lift. For 10 blocks, the Town Council would be required to pay
a substantial amount of $1 million, just for the shutting down of
lifts.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cb491683-9b02-4706-8d9a-d1bcb6dfe606">
                  <a name="budget__id-cb491683-9b02-4706-8d9a-d1bcb6dfe606"><!--a--></a>There are several issues
here. First, use of the word "overhaul" to cover shutting down is
convenient to HDB but does not square with the usual meaning of
overhaul. Second,
from the Town Councils' perspective, it is unjustifiable to pay
HDB $100,000 per lift when no physical overhaul work was done but
the lift instead became extinct. What HDB is bearing is not based
on the total bill of the LUP but a lesser amount after first making
the Town Council pay to HDB part of the total LUP bill through such
lift overhaul costs. This results in a significant drain on the
Town Councils' sinking funds, way above the one-off LUP assistance
provided by HDB. How does HDB justify such accounting?</p>

HDB estates where there are few multi-storey car parks, families
may be asked to park their cars some distance away from the block,
even a few hundred metres away, for the second car, in particular.
In other car park clusters, even the first car may need to be parked
some blocks away. Residents are concerned not just because of the
inconvenience. It poses difficulties to the less mobile, and ladies
have expressed to me safety concerns. It was reported in December
that MND is studying a mechanised parking solution for implementation
in mature HDB estates. Since then, some parking experts and others
have thrown up some possible strategies. Could MND share more information
about what it is looking into to ease the car park shortages for residents
in mature HDB estates?</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, under the vehicle parking certificate scheme implemented
in 1994, all heavy vehicles in Singapore are required to have a parking
lot in an authorised parking place licensed by LTA. Many of these
designated parking spaces are located far away from residential
homes of drivers of heavy vehicles. For example, they could be located
in the industrial estates. On the roads, I have seen prime movers
with bicycles mounted at the back of the vehicles as an innovative
way to cycle home after the drivers have parked their vehicles in
the industrial parks. For many of these drivers, getting home after
duty can be a challenge, especially when they start work early and
they end work late. They have to travel long distances back to their homes
and there are also no public transport vehicles available at those
early hours.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d7251214-37f5-4b61-b20e-13accdd64dfe">
                  <a name="budget__id-d7251214-37f5-4b61-b20e-13accdd64dfe"><!--a--></a>As a result, some resort
to illegal parking along public streets near their homes. This can
cause them to be fined and bring inconveniences to others. For example,
many of my residents in Seletar have given me feedback that there
have been many instances of overnight parking of heavy vehicles
along public streets and sometimes within the residential estate.
These vehicles pose safety concerns and congestion problems especially
to vehicles, such as the public waste collection vehicles, that
need to move within the estate in the mornings to remove garbage.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-97540a70-47c6-4ca6-8bcd-c184af90e03c"><!--a--></a>Can MND set aside more
interim heavy vehicle parking spaces situated near residential areas
to meet the needs? Currently, such parking sites are available,
located near to residential areas such as those in Bishan and Ang
Mo Kio Ave 1. These parking sites are conveniently located under
the MRT tracks or near to HDB housing estates. These are heavily
sought after by drivers of heavy vehicles and often have a long
wait list. It demonstrates that the practicality and needs of such
parking sites. Currently, there are also many empty plots of land
under MRT tracks which are not utilised, such as the space next
to Yio Chu Kang MRT Station. These plots of land can offer temporary parking
spaces for heavy vehicles. Will MND be able to identify more of
such sites to bring relief to residents and drivers, so that drivers
of heavy vehicles need not park illegally or find other means to
get home after work? It would therefore be easier for them to go home after
their work. Residents need not put up with the potential safety hazards
and inconveniences, and there will be a win-win situation for everyone. </p>

when I broach the topic with some HDB officials, the idea still
seems to be relatively new to them, so I was not sure that the idea
had actually permeated through the levels of MND. And since there
is a new Minister since the last time I spoke on it and a new Minister

the topic again, believing like Robert the Bruce that if at first

by the recent furore over the day care centre at Woodlands. Whilst
one should be mindful of the need to have amenities, there is also
a need to balance the void deck space available. I thought it would
be a good idea to reserve the second floors of new HDB precincts
that are being built for amenities, such as elderly day care centres,
senior activity centres, facilities for the disabled or childcare
centres. There is precedence for this – Block 118 at Bukit Merah View
in my constituency has the Moral Neighbourhood Link, a VWO which
serves the residents in that area. I would urge HDB to consider
this because that way, we can keep the void deck space void but,
at the same time, still provide the amenities and facilities that
are needed for various precincts.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-66cdfba4-6cfc-4bbd-b047-fcb31513071d"><!--a--></a>The second idea was the
one of sports stacks. Inevitably, every HDB estate will have complaints
about boys playing football and that is natural. Boys will be boys.
They will play football.
Other people also want the space for games, and I also understand
that space is a premium and we have limited space. I thought that
the idea of having a sports stack, meaning set aside some land away
from the main blocks but still part of the precinct. One level could
be used for football; another level could be used for ball games like
basketball or netball; another level more for the senior-type games
like gateball; and another for racquet games like badminton, table
tennis and things like that. In that way, we can still maximise
the use of the land, the footprint is kept small because we will
stack it up so it benefits the residents. It promotes sports and
at the same time, it takes away the noise nuisance for the residents.
I would like to ask HDB to consider these ideas.</p>

Mr Chairman, Sir, many of our residents in HDB estates find cycling
a good recreational activity, a convenient form of transport around
the neighbourhood and a way for them to travel to the nearest MRT
stations. HDB estates were often not designed to cope with this
increased demand for bicycles and the resultant need for more parking
facilities. Also, HDB estates provide only basic bicycle parking
facilities that afford inadequate protection against theft. Residents
do not feel confident with parking their bicycles in allocated areas.
Instead, they park the bicycles on their floors of residence. And
when I do my block visits, you can often find bicycles clogging
up the corridors which lead to congestion and fire hazards. Would
the Ministry be open to (i) re-designing bicycle parking facilities
that provide more security against theft, and (ii) increasing the
number of secure bicycle parking facilities? </p>

Mr Chairman, I would like to respond to Minister Khaw's call to
go beyond building homes to building communities. Indeed, we need
to design and build our neighbourhoods into places which are not
just great places to live, work and play, but also places where
we have strong relationships and community life. Today, people mostly
live in gated communities and for many, the main value of the home
is its dollar market value. There is often little value ascribed
to the value of the community they live in, or the social capital
and relationships in their neighbourhood. Social ties among HDB
residents seem to have worsened, households more isolated and neighbourly
disputes.</p>

that each neighbourhood is unique and diverse, and has distinctive
characteristics, reflecting the identity of the residents who have
emotional attachments to it. Each neighbourhood has a discernible
centre, which can be a square or a busy street junction, where the
bus or train stops. Homes are within a five-minute walk from the
centre, or within the 400-metre radius. There are mixed types of
homes housing people with different demographics, facilitating the
bridging type of social capital. Within the neighbourhood, there
are shops and services of sufficient varied types to supply the
weekly needs of a household, so they do not need to visit the mall. There are so called
Third Places where people can be regular customers and visitors, and
can establish connections. There are attractive, usable public spaces
for formal and informal community gatherings. The Residents' Committee
in the neighbourhood are empowered to take on estate management,
and they constantly engage residents to make meaningful decisions
and set rules on how their neighbourhood should evolve and be uniquely
organised. More "white spaces" are set aside for this. There is
depth of interactions, mutual self-help, and more informal volunteerism.
There are formal and informal groupings within the community to
plan and organise activities and initiatives within the neighbourhood.</p>

with some of these design elements in building new HDB estates.
Let me just summarise the core differences with today's approach.
First, there is more emphasis on the software, including infrastructure
that supports the building up of relationships, like Third Places.
Secondly, very importantly, there needs to be co-creation and genuine
empowerment of residents with much more active participation from
them. Thirdly, everything needs to be on a human scale, walkable.
Together, with having a distinctive character, this will make people
stay outside their homes, in their neighbourhoods. I hope MND will
take into account my suggestions.</p>

Sir, the fast ageing population of Singapore requires fast implementation
of elderly friendly features in our built environment. Many Singaporeans
are ageing within their respective communities, and thus require
these elderly friendly features to enjoy a good quality of life.
Sir, the introduction of barrier-free access amenities in housing
estates and lift upgrading of HDB flats have brought much convenience
to our residents. But barrier-free access amenities may not be adequate
to make our built environment elderly friendly. We need to better
understand the needs of our elderly, and facilitate them to live,
work and play in our community. Sir, I wish to ask the Minister
the following questions: (i) what is the long-term plan to facilitate
Singaporeans to "age in place" in the community; and (ii) can the
Ministry identify and implement more elderly friendly features which
are necessary for the elderly to live, work and play in our built

the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) is an upgrading programme for
flats built in 1986 or earlier. They have not undergone upgrading
before. It is highly popular with residents. Currently, there are
300,000 eligible flats for HIP. I am glad to know that the Ministry
is rolling out HIP at a faster pace. Last year saw a doubling of
beneficiaries of 5,500 to 10,000 flats. However, MND's assurance that
they would take 10 years to complete the balance of 250,000 flats
– is too long. This is an important consideration as rising cost
due to inflation and manpower may further delay its full implementation.
As the ageing of these older flats give rise to higher incidents
of defects such as spalling concrete and leaking ceiling and pipes,
what can the Ministry do to speed up the completion of HIP?</p>

Mr Chairman, eating is often called the natural pastime of Singaporeans.
We love our food but many do not know too much or do not think too
much about where our food comes from, unless there is a sudden surprise shortage
or sharp increase in prices. With limited land and resources, Singapore,
in fact, imports more than 90% of the food we consume. This reliance
on imported food make us more vulnerable to shortage, especially
with the threat of climate change and inflation food cost. Sir,
it is good that the AVA has taken effort to ensure that, except
for eggs, most other key food items in Singapore has less than 50%
of their supplies coming from a single country. What is the Ministry's
plans to continue to bolster sufficient supply of key food items
and restore their supplies in the event of surprise disruption and
mitigate sharp price increases? With increased globalisation and
diversifying food sources, how would the Government assure that
the food that comes in will remain safe to eat, so that Singaporeans
can continue to enjoy their food with confidence? Let me continue
in Mandarin. </p>

Chairman, Singapore can be considered a food paradise. Just counting
eggs alone, Singaporeans consume 4 million eggs a day. However,
whether it is rice, wheat, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits, eggs
or tea, we rely on imports for all these. The smooth, steady supply
and safety assurance of our food, which we have enjoyed for so many
years, does not happen by chance, neither should we take it for
granted. The Ministry of National Development must continue to act
as a safeguard for us, do more to explore more food sources, and work
with all businesses in the food industry, as well as the public,
to safeguard our food safety and the stability of our food supplies.
We hope that the situation in Taiwan – where people are worried
about eating beef, chicken and eggs – will not happen here, so that
Singaporeans can continue to enjoy their food with a peace of mind.
Even if something unfortunate happens, and we are unable to avoid
it, I hope that the Government also has plans to help Singaporeans
deal with it calmly, and minimise the negative impact. </p>

started out as a young nation, providing adequate housing was a
pressing task. In 1960, it was estimated that a quarter million
people were living in slums, and another 200,000 to 250,000 in attap
squatter settlements, which means leaking roofs and flooding during
rain, not to mention the poor hygiene and being prone to fire. As
Minister Khaw highlighted, we built 21,000 flats in just three years back
then to relieve the pressure on housing. </p>

as quickly as we can, at 25,000 flats per year, but for a very different
context – 90% of Singaporeans own their homes. There are currently 900,000
HDB flats and 300,000 private homes. Our housing programme is very
well regarded internationally. Singapore is frequently cited in
the ranking for "Top Global Cities" and "Most Liveable Cities".
Our economy has advanced, and so has the standard of living for

still. The external environment requires us to adapt. Our society

But being economically vibrant or world-class is not the end in itself.

In other words, a few blocks of flats sharing a common cluster of
facilities. For existing estates, we wish we could do the same but
not all the estates have the space for us to do so. We will try
whatever is practical. So, besides multi-storey car parks, if we
can find the space, other possible solutions include additional
surface lots, electronic parking systems to regulate demand, and
also mechanised car parks if user acceptance proves positive.</p>

near residential areas are suitable for heavy vehicles because of
alternative development plans, noise and safety concerns. But I
noted his suggestions on making use of space under the MRT tracks,
so I think we can explore that with LTA. </p>

continue to rebalance our centres of growth to create comfortable
spaces for "live, work and play". Mr Gerald Giam asked about alternative city
centres. We do take a comprehensive approach to shaping our city. </p>

are building up Marina Bay as our new commercial heart. Along with
the new infrastructure for business, it will bring many new and
good jobs for Singaporeans. Marina Bay is also becoming a bay for
the people as it establishes itself as a venue of national events
and celebrations. Community events such as arts festivals, sailing
and charity walks are also being held.</p>

we are creating new growth centres in different parts of the island.
These will provide jobs and amenities closer to homes and minimise
the need for cross-town travel, as Mr Giam has pointed out. Under
Master Plan 2008, the Government announced the development of three
growth centres in this decade – Jurong Lake District, Paya Lebar
Central and Kallang Riverside. To-date, 450,000 square metres of commercial
GFA has been made available for development in these centres. How
large is 450,000 square metres? This is equivalent to about nine
AMK Hubs. </p>

be developed with a unique personality. For example, Kallang Riverside
aspires to be Singapore's sports and lifestyle hub. Anchored by
the new Sports Hub, Kallang will provide 4,000 new homes, complemented

five Vivo cities. New parks and improved riverfront promenades will
also bring people closer to the waterfront. </p>

needs and allow community bonding to flourish. Indeed, to meet future
aspirations, HDB's aim is to build well-designed, sustainable and
community-centric towns as part of its recently launched "Roadmap

such as Punggol, you will find a number of new ideas being adopted.
For example, HDB has paid special attention to promoting vibrant
community spaces. At the town level, Punggol will have a Town Plaza
as the epicentre for community events. At the precinct level, Treelodge@Punggol
is an example where HDB has piloted a "stacked development", with
a first-storey podium car park, a roof deck above that provides
space for greenery, playgrounds, fitness corners and other facilities, and,
finally, flats above the roof deck. There is also a conscious effort
to locate facilities nearer to residents to help lower transport
costs and minimise inconvenience. In fact, if Members look carefully
at the picture, sometimes when you are in there, it is quite hard to
tell whether you are on the first, second or third floor, because
of the design and because it is well-integrated. I appreciate Ms
Indranee's idea to integrate these facilities into the precinct
but we need a certain minimum size in order to incorporate all these features
in one precinct. We will unveil the plans for Punggol's next phase
of development in the second half of this year. </p>

plans to roll out pilot projects under the Greenprint concept. For
a start, HDB will "green" a neighbourhood in Jurong East with water
and energy-saving solutions, as well as a Pneumatic Refuse Collection
System. To promote eco-friendly transport, HDB will also enhance
the cycling and pedestrian network complemented with secured bicycle
parking facilities which Mr Ong Teng Koon spoke about. The Greenprint
will also look at supporting greener living by piloting a Green Home
Package, where residents can choose the types of energy-saving appliances
to green their homes. From the pilot's findings, HDB will then refine
the Greenprint model for possible rollout to other HDB estates. </p>

we are committed to ensuring a greener overall environment for Singaporeans.
As Singapore continues to urbanise, it will be even more important
to soften our otherwise hard, concrete landscape, as Mr Christopher
de Souza mentioned. Our aim is to develop an urban landscape with
pervasive greenery, where our parks, gardens and green spaces are
linked up to form large tracts of greenery. We want to transform
from a garden city to a City in a Garden. What this means is that instead of having
a garden just outside our homes, we will have the entire city nestled within
a garden. </p>

NParks will add a world-class garden, the Gardens by the Bay, when
it officially opens in June this year. We will also enhance the
connectivity of our green spaces, including the proposed Round Island
Route which Deputy Prime Minister Teo just announced. As greenery
becomes more pervasive, we will also bring biodiversity back to

a way of life. We will actively engage Singaporeans to co-create

of an exciting Global City. A pre-requisite is safety – whether
people feel safe living here. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang urged the Government
to safeguard Singapore's food supply and safety. As we import over
90% of our food, we cannot control global food prices and supply.
To mitigate supply disruptions and volatile food prices, AVA will
continue to actively diversify our overseas supply sources. AVA
is also working to boost local production of three strategic food
items, namely, leafy vegetables, eggs and fish to further enhance
the resilience against supply shocks. </p>

$20 million for its Food Fund to support R&amp;D, local farm capability
upgrading and food source diversification. To ensure food safety,
there is also overseas accreditation and inspection of food sources.
AVA also conducts rigorous testing of imports before they are allowed
for sale in Singapore. Even as Singapore forges ahead as a global
city, we cannot forget that our ultimate goal is to build an inclusive
society and a better home for everyone. We must be alert to changing demographics
and anticipate future needs. </p>

the ageing of our population will become much more apparent. Our

within the decade, we will see the number of seniors increase by

Let me elaborate on some of our key ongoing and upcoming efforts
in response.</p>

Programme (LUP) is on track to complete by 2014 to improve accessibility
for residents, especially the elderly. Ms Sylvia Lim asked about
LUP costing for Town Councils. The understanding is totally correct
in terms of how it is computed. The principle, however, is applied
consistently to all Town Councils. The Government will fund up to
90% of the lift upgrading costs. As Town Councils are responsible
for replacing lifts at the end of their lifespan in the first instance,
they will bear their share of the costs if existing lifts are replaced
as part of LUP, with the Government shouldering the bulk of the
remaining cost. The Town Councils are required to bear the depreciated portion
of the replacement costs based on the age of the lifts. This is
something the Town Council should have been saving up in the form
of the sinking fund over the years. Ms Lim asked why Town Councils
are required to pay for old lifts that are overhauled or replaced.
In fact, these lifts are all replaced – it may not be at exactly
at the same lift shaft but in different parts of the block where
a new lift is provided and an old lift is shut down. So, when we
do LUP, we make sure that each block gets at least the same number
of lifts, if not more. With the current funding structure, LUP,
as a programme, will cost a hefty $5.5 billion to complete.</p>

(HIP), which provides practical improvements such as safer clothes
drying racks and elderly-friendly toilets, is being ramped up, as
suggested by Mr David Ong. This year, up to 28,000 households will
stand to benefit from the programme. Within these five years, we
aim to cover 160,000 flats. This is about 60% of the remaining eligible
households. If we sustain this pace, we will be able to complete
HIP in 10 years, budget permitting. We will accelerate HIP where possible,
but seek the public's understanding that HIP is a massive programme
covering 300,000 flats.</p>

of both the young and the old, HDB has adopted Universal Design
guidelines for its new residential projects since July 2006. Universal
Design features include larger and lower light switches, wider corridors,

on our laurels, and we will continue to implement more upgrading
programmes. As announced by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman, we will make
our homes more age-friendly, especially for those in need. Today,
there is a pilot to retrofit 500 households in Marine Parade with
senior-friendly features like grab bars; slip-resistant treatment
for bathroom floors; and ramps within the flat. The initial response
has been encouraging, with over 50% of households taking up the
offer. One of these households is Mdm Loo. At 90 years old, Mdm
Loo previously had to grab anything within her reach (for example,
chairs, tables, doors and so on) to move around her flat. After
the retrofit, she can now move around her flat more confidently
with the new grab bars. In fact, when she was trying out the new
grab bars, she was all smiles and happily said "not bad, not bad,
it's more convenient for me now." </p>

Mdm Loo, we will extend these retrofits to more households under
the "Enhancement for Active Seniors" or EASE programme, starting from

programmes at the same time can reduce the inconvenience to benefiting
households. </p>

there are some families who may not need all the improvements under
the EASE programme. Hence, families can choose their own combination
of improvements based on their needs. In addition, elderly and vulnerable residents
who wish to get the enhancements earlier can apply directly to HDB.</p>

the Government will heavily subsidise the enhancements. Similar

in July 2012 and will provide more details then.</p>

not just physical integration; we need to be open and mutually accepting
as a society about catering to the needs of different groups – seniors,
the young, and families – alike. This mutual acceptance will help
us grow to be more gracious as a society, and build a truly caring

Mr Chairman, as we advance as a society, we must not forget our
past. The collective history of Singaporeans is what makes us unique. Stories
of our forefathers coming from foreign lands – some distant, some
not so distant – landing in Singapore, living here, working here,
setting up families and businesses here and, in time to come, passing
on here. Finding the bridge to our past is important as it keeps
us rooted to the generations of people who have in some way shaped
or formed and moulded us into the people we are today.</p>

Joo Chiat, there is a strong link with <em class="ph i">Peranakan</em> heritage
and culture. The residents there are very proud of this link with
the past. The benefit of this, we have found, is that they have
started to attract people from all across the island who are attracted
to this nugget of Singapore's past. It might be because they have
some <em class="ph i">Peranakan</em> heritage themselves, or it could be just because
they are interested in something which they are interested in. Nevertheless,
the experience of Joo Chiat in heritage-related events does have
their own following and there is a growing interest among younger
Singaporeans in participating in such events.</p>

is more that can be done, not only by MND but by other agencies
as well, such as the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee when
it comes to naming constituencies and demarcating boundaries. It
should perhaps consider the heritage of the area in addition to
the population shifts. For example, it is a bit odd that Joo Chiat
SMC is named after a geographical area that it does not cover. I
am sure there are other examples. Names are important. They provide
identities and a visual and mental cue for our memories and experiences.</p>

debate was Bukit Brown. Apart from the fact that exhumations are
emotional issues for many, concerns were also raised that Bukit
Brown contained much which were worth preserving. Interestingly,
Chew Joo Chiat, after whom my constituency is named, is buried in
Bukit Brown, alongside with several other prominent Singaporeans
in days gone by. I would like to ask the Minister whether he can
institute a system whereby decisions are made in relation to sites
or matters of significant historical value and the relevant stakeholders
would be consulted at an early stage of the process so that views
of interested parties can be taken into account, and informed decisions
eventually made.</p>

Sir, in this fast-paced and globalised world, we should not underestimate
the necessity and desire to identify and protect heritage sites
that can give Singaporeans a sense of identity and belonging. We
should be very careful to ensure that locations treasured by people
do not get demolished too easily in the name of progress, as we
may lose a part of our soul with it. We have felt the pain of losing
iconic buildings before – the National Theatre, the old red-brick
National Library, the Van Kleef Aquarium. Good reasons were trotted
out by the MND leaders of the day – too expensive to renovate and
maintain; need the land for other uses and redevelopment. Today,
some still wonder: were the right decisions taken? This question often
enters my mind when I drive through the short Orchard Road tunnel,
for which the old library building had to be crushed. </p>

that there is a surge of interest today on heritage issues. It signals
their search for emotional anchors and for a narrative that connects
the present to the past. The latest evidence of this is the civic
effort to save the Bukit Brown cemetery. I visited it recently and
found it informative. It gave deeper insights into how our early
pioneers lived and died. Some of the tombs are decorated with sculptures
and works of art. </p>

old has heritage value. But what are the criteria applied? What
are the processes in place to make a proper evaluation? Are the
views of experts, civic groups, independent heritage organisations
and stakeholders adequately taken into account? It is necessary
to lay down clear guiding principles and to put in place a wide
consultative process. We should not rush to demolish what some may
treasure as heritage sites - as once demolished, what is lost cannot
be recovered. </p>

is always a constraint in Singapore. This is a given. But it does
not answer the question of why a road to cater to a group of some
motorists, say, is given higher priority over what some others may
value as a heritage site. In fact, the space argument can also be
used to support higher priority for heritage conservation. Singapore,
being a small and relatively young nation, has fewer heritage sites
for the people to focus its attachments on. Precisely because of
this, even if a few of those areas go, the effect would be even
more devastating than in big countries which could boast a host
of landmarks spanning centuries.</p>

much to conserve our natural and cultural heritage over the years.
I would urge MND, however, to do another review on the merits of

Mr Chairman, sometime late last year, LTA announced that a dual
four-lane highway in Bukit Brown will be built from early 2013 to
alleviate congestion along Lornie Road and the Pan-Island Expressway
during peak hours. In a statement, the Land Transport Authority
(LTA) added that the new road, to be completed by 2016, will also
cater to expected growth in future traffic demand. It said that
the new road will cut through parts of the Bukit Brown Cemetery,
and it estimated that it will affect about 5% of the more than 100,000
graves there. </p>

several groups of stakeholders voiced their concerns and their unhappiness,
with one grouse being that stakeholders were not consulted prior
to the decision, and the other being the impact the project will
have on Bukit Brown. Mr Chairman, here let me declare my interest
as a member of Nature Society Singapore, one of the groups of stakeholders
which have voiced our concerns. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a8cd2546-9f58-4099-95c8-c8f466950d79">
                  <a name="budget__id-a8cd2546-9f58-4099-95c8-c8f466950d79"><!--a--></a>Then, on 22 November 2011,
to a question raised by Ms Irene Ng in this House, Mr Khaw Boon
Wan explained that these options had been considered, three of them:
(a) the widening of Lornie Road, (b) viaduct above Lornie Road,
and (c) a tunnel below. All these options were thought to be unworkable;
thus, the need to stick to the decision for the proposed highway.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Straits

said that plans for the proposed highway will proceed. Here are
my questions. I have broken them up into four parts.</p>

mentioned, that is, the widening of Lornie Rd, the viaduct and the
tunnel, what were the other options, if any, that had been considered before
they were narrowed down to these three options? My second and third
questions are related. We all understand that forests provide free
eco-services, one of which is that they act like a water storage
tank as they absorb water through the soil and the roots when it
rains. We also know that when these natural areas are removed and
are paved, ground infiltration is interrupted, surface storage is
removed and, as a result, there will be an increase in the speed
and the quantity of the surface run-off. This is serious in view of
the close proximity of the proposed project to Bukit Brown. In fact,
in a report, in January 2012, by the Expert Panel on Draining Design
and Floor Protection Measures appointed by the Ministry of Environment
and Water Resources, it is stated that rapid urbanisation had been
a contributing factor to the floods. Here are my two related questions.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ae774ea-4426-4f92-ac00-b76172f21a7b">
                  <a name="budget__id-8ae774ea-4426-4f92-ac00-b76172f21a7b"><!--a--></a>Firstly, has a complete
Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) that includes biophysical, especially
hydrological, social and other relevant effects of the highway been
conducted and, if so, what are the results? Secondly, in view of
the recent floods and the resulting public concerns and outrage
and the report by the Expert Panel aforementioned, would the authorities
consider deferring the project until an EIA, if it had not been
done, conducted or concluded, or other sorts of studies, are then conducted
and concluded?</p>

Budget 2012's tagline of an "Inclusive Society, a Stronger Singapore"
and in view of the outcry that ensued after the proposed highway
was announced, would MND ensure that there will be more effective
and inclusive channels for
public engagement and consultation in the future and, if so, what
would these plans look like?</p>

Mr Chairman, I have been visiting the Bukit Brown cemetery since
I was little. My great-grandfather was one of the many tens of thousands
of early migrants buried there and, as far back as I can remember,
every <em class="ph i">Qingming</em> festival, my parents would dutifully visit
his grave to clear the weeds, bring offerings and pay their respects.
As a child, I never thought much about its significance. As an adult
and a parent, however, I have come to treasure this link that I
have to my ancestral past. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-71cb2651-92f4-4593-8e0e-19626f272909">

poignant for me when I took my two children to visit the grave a
few weeks back. Nothing quite replicates the emotional experience
of standing on the very ground where your forefathers were buried
five generations ago. A cemetery is not just for the dead and about
the dead. It is about keeping our history, our memories and all
the meanings of our past alive for the living and for future generations
of Singaporeans.</p>

be sentimental about land use in Singapore. In a short span of 40
years, we have seen the destruction of over 200 cemeteries in Singapore.
Many of our housing estates, our schools and amenities would not
be here today if previous cemeteries had not made way for them. </p>

point for me in this debate about Bukit Brown is that Bukit Brown
is not one of the many cemeteries in Singapore. It is, in fact,
now one of the important few left behind in our midst. And as such,
it is fitting that we deliberate on this question of its demolition
with a lot more care and consideration.</p>

cleared many shophouses and old buildings to make way for urban
development. But at some point, we realised that if we did not start
preserving and conserving whatever shophouses we had left, even
the remaining few would be gone. My question is: has MND conducted
any systematic survey or impact study to look at the tangible and
intangible benefits of preserving Bukit Brown? If so, can these findings
be shared with the public? And if not, would MND consider holding
back road-building works until a more in-depth impact study is conducted?</p>

Teo also recently announced that the Government is preparing a White
Paper on Population that will be released at the end of the year. Should
we not wait until there is a stronger national consensus on our
population growth strategy before we commit irreversibly to this
course of building more roads and more housing on this historical
piece of land? Sir, I suppose, in short, my question is: can we
ask for a "stay of execution" on Bukit Brown? There will be other
sites with similar issues in the future. How will MND incorporate
citizen consultation and engagement with civic groups into their
decision-making process when it comes to long-term urban planning?</p>

Singapore is considered the most liveable city. However, in our

caused by men. It shows that there is much to be done in our journey

conflicts related to pets and neighbours. We hope that, if we want
our environments to be more harmonious, and allow the ecosystems
to co-exist, we must resolve the issue of homeowners with dogs and
cats. Although the problem appears simple, we must nip the problems
in the bud. Ultimately, we must link pet business owners, pet lovers, animal
rights activists, residents and grassroots together on a platform,
to work together to create an inclusive and sustainable green environment

                  </span>:
Sir, there are four areas which hinder productivity increase in
the construction industry. First, too many rules to comply with.
Sir, many practitioners complained that we have too many rules to
comply with in the construction industry. Each time an accident
occurs, many new rules will be introduced. As a result, many practitioners
are spending time doing paperwork, instead of construction work. Sir,
we need to review our Building Control Act and rules to ensure that
our rules enhance productivity. We must also set productivity performance
standards for various Government approving agencies to reduce bureaucracies
and delays in approvals.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1874</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-290f8e0e-f611-4ece-ac81-4fdfdc3dbd7b">
                  <a name="budget__id-290f8e0e-f611-4ece-ac81-4fdfdc3dbd7b"><!--a--></a> Secondly, design and supervision. Almost
every building in Singapore has a unique design, and thus a learning
curve in construction. There is a lack of standardisation in the
design of building components to facilitate increase in productivity.
Except for HDB, the private sector lags behind in the introduction
of prefabrication technology to expedite construction. We should
encourage the use of more prefabrication of building components,
and set higher buildable score by BCA to increase productivity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ce87079d-95f3-4afb-8e8e-f4cb46adb15e">
                  <a name="budget__id-ce87079d-95f3-4afb-8e8e-f4cb46adb15e"><!--a--></a>Due to the low fees paid
to building professionals, there is a lack of supervision on site.
Very often, the Resident Technical Officer is the only person who
controls the speed of construction. The lack of supervision by professionals
also resulted in many abortive works, thus causing wastages and
delays.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e3eeb855-ac18-447a-917d-7299debe6e3d">
                  <a name="budget__id-e3eeb855-ac18-447a-917d-7299debe6e3d"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, procurement methods.
In Singapore, many developers still adopt the traditional method
of engaging contractors through lump sum contracts. Under such arrangements,
the consultants and contractors do not share the same objectives
of ensuring that the project completes on time and within budget.
As such, many unproductive hours are wasted in resolving conflicts
and problems. Sir, design and build contracts are usually considered
better procurement method as it provides a one stop service in the
delivery of projects. In Japan, design and build contracts are commonly used
to build good construction teams which deliver high productivity
and quality projects. </p>

of workers. The high turnover of skilled workers in the industry
is another barrier to achieving higher productivity. Many foreign
workers are trained in Singapore but do not stay long enough to
contribute productive work. Sir, may I ask the Minister what are
the plans to increase the productivity of the construction industry?</p>

of going to Bukit Brown.</p>

of Queenstown as there have been a lot of developments there. I
remember my parents bringing me to Queenstown when I was young.
I remember the <em class="ph i">pasar malams</em> along the streets; I remember
the cinemas, which are now churches. I remember when we went to
cinemas in the old days, we bought <em class="ph i">kacang putih</em> in newspaper
cones; I do not know if they are still around. Or the hawker centre
there that has recently been torn down. I will always remember the <em class="ph i">yew

kneaded the dough, and the way he made the <em class="ph i">yew zhar kway.</em> I
would go home and practise doing it with plasticine. </p>

memories for our children when they look back in the future. I understand
where Mr Charles Chong, Ms Janice Koh and many of you are coming
from. As I do the many passionate Singaporeans who champion the Bukit
Brown cause or that of their alma mater, or of the various locations
around Singapore that hold meaning to them. I do also understand
that many of us sometimes wonder if we are changing too fast. What
price, development? </p>

past. The issue at hand, as many of you have shared, is about our
identity and our sense of what it means to be Singaporean; our sense
of what it means to be Singapore. It is about our spirit; it is
about our soul. Often, we do not talk about these things enough.</p>

We know the emotive stories leading up to our Independence and thereafter
but our history goes way beyond 1965, beyond the heroic accounts
of Lt Adnan during the Second World War and even before Raffles.
We all grew up with tales about Sang Nila Utama and his exploits.
Real or otherwise, it all makes up part of our history. Our history
provides us with a sense of who we are. With the passage of time, stories
are interwoven with documents, images captured, virtual constructs,
and physical markers that are left behind whether by design or by
chance. </p>

culture, we talked about art. Those things, together with our stories,
define who we are as a people. We are a young nation but that should
not discount us from valuing a very rich heritage that all of us
share. These memories are anchors to our past even as we look forward
to our future. This is why we can proudly call ourselves Singaporeans
and not just any global citizen. </p>

of the first things I wanted to know was what is being done on this
front. Like many, I also wondered, are we developing too fast and
are we tearing things down where we should not? It has been an eye-opening
and a humbling experience. I would say this quite definitively:
my colleagues in URA care a great deal about these things. In our
earlier years, our urgent priorities were to develop, to get the economy
right so that we could provide jobs for our people and house our
people. But we also realised, as pointed out earlier, that if we
were not careful, we were beginning to lose some of our precious
past. </p>

was set up to ensure that we tread carefully. Many areas and buildings
were deliberately saved from urban renewal. Today, we have conserved
over 7,000 buildings and earmarked our oldest urban areas like Kampong
Glam, Little India, Chinatown and Boat Quay for conservation. In
fact, we drive past many of these developments every day; we have
taken them for granted; and we forget. As Mr Low Thia Khiang pointed
out last week, although we talk about heritage and history, sometimes
not enough people visit them, and we should encourage more people
to visit all these places that have been kept. It is, and I want
to emphasise this, not about economics and it is not about development
value because if it were, many of these sites would have been long
gone in order to maximise plot ratio. </p>

Parliament House, you will see the work of URA and other agencies
like NHB and Preservation of Monuments Board. This area was first
set aside by Raffles in the 1820s as the Administrative District.
Today, many of its buildings and civic uses have been retained. The Old
Parliament House, just behind us, at its core, is Singapore's oldest
building. It is now a venue for arts programming.</p>

environment is also very much part of our heritage. We declared
Bukit Timah and Central Catchment as Nature Reserves; they harbour
one of the richest sources of biodiversity in the region. Thanks
to the efforts of National Parks Board and stakeholders like the
Nature Society of Singapore, we can continue to appreciate our natural
heritage and bring people there, such as to some of the treetop walks.
The majestic hornbills, for example, which used to be extinct in
Singapore, can once again be seen and heard on our island, as we
try to bring back some of this wildlife into the city.</p>

we should celebrate and be proud of. No one is like us. We are an
entire nation squeezed into just over 700 sq km. We need to decide
how best to allocate land to live, work and play and, as Mr Laurence
Lien commented earlier, to build communities. We have to decide
how best to, at the same time preserve our environment, our heritage
and our history. Few cities, if any in the world, need to make these
choices, because most, if not all, of these cities are part of a
much larger country.</p>

is but one part of a larger story to celebrate our history and heritage.
We should also focus our energies on ways to document our stories
and to share them. To be proud of the history and heritage that
we already possess. Stories and memories make all the difference.</p>

role in this. I fully agree with what Minister Yaacob shared on
Friday. MICA's Singapore Memory Project builds on much work already
done over the past years and takes it further. It is an exciting
and, I think, a very meaningful project where Singaporeans should
come on board and act upon it. With advancements in technology,
we can now collect and share memories in ways which we could not before.
We can weave our heritage together, individual by individual, memory
by memory. We need to move fast because with the passing of time,
as the older generation passes on, we need to capture those memories.</p>

heritage markers, and that remains important, to bring trails to
life to educate and to inform Singaporeans. The National Library
Board and National Archives will also continue to document and promote
our collective stories and memories. There is very much more that
we still need to try and capture and to document.</p>

Cemetery? You will realise that Bukit Brown is part of a much larger
fabric that is our history and heritage. I will say this: I believe
that Bukit Brown is very rich in heritage value. Many of our forefathers
who built this nation, such as Lim Chong Pang, Lim Nee Soon, Chew
Boon Lay and Chew Joo Chiat are buried there. Indeed, these names
remain familiar to us because parts of Singapore are named after
these pioneers. But the legacy of these pioneers does not lie with
the tombstones in Bukit Brown. It lies in their works among us.
Those things can be celebrated as well. </p>

taken such a long time and deferred our development plans for Bukit
Brown. Ms Irene Ng asked us not to rush. We have not. The 2-km long
road across the cemetery will replace Lornie Road – we are looking
at replacing Lornie Road with a stretch that will cut across Bukit
Brown. This is part of the Outer Ring Road System. It is not a new
thing. This Outer Ring Road System has been around since the British
days. What it does is it enables motorists to bypass the city. There
is already a traffic jam at Lornie Road during peak hours, and the
new road is urgently needed, not simply for future developments
but it is needed because housing is also being developed in the
northeast and northern part of Singapore. It represents part of
that network to allow people to move back and forth; not just people
driving but public transport as well.</p>

if we considered other options. We did. Our efforts to enhance public
transport, and manage and optimise traffic flows will continue.
However, the road is required for the Outer Ring Road System, so
we are left with few options. We considered widening Lornie Road
but that would have encroached into the Central Catchment Nature
Reserve, and it would also have entailed land acquisition which where
we can, we try to minimise and avoid. A viaduct: that was something
that we had considered but it would also have had similar impact.
For example, road diversion would have been required during the
process of building some of these viaducts. Tunnelling – a tunnel
would have caused more damage to the cemetery as major tunnels are
typically constructed by the cut-and-cover approach, meaning you
cut a hole for the tunnel and then you cover over it. Boring – if
you were to bore the tunnel, you do not have a bore that is large
enough to create this eight-lane road. You would have to create three
separate tunnels in order to create that. You would have to go deep
but at the ends, again, you would have the cut-and-cover method
to provide for the exit points. And that would, again, cause quite
substantive damage, more so than a road would. So, the proposed
road was decided upon because it had the least impact. </p>

required agencies to evaluate the impact of the proposed road on
the environment. PUB and National Parks Board studied the drainage requirements
and its impact on the environment before the plan was approved.
LTA is also carrying out a biodiversity study to address specific
concerns arising from the roadworks. We are exploring ways, and
I think it is quite possible, and we will ensure that wildlife can
continue to traverse within the Bukit Brown area.</p>

drainage is valid. But for Bukit Brown Cemetery itself, development

the cemetery, having decided on proceeding with the road? Most of
our projected plans for housing will be effected much later. In
the near term, the southern part of the area, which largely centres
around the old Police Academy, will be developed for public housing.
It is an extension of Toa Payoh, which is why the whole area there
is significant from the housing perspective. Toa Payoh, in fact,
used to be called <em class="ph i">An Xiang Shan.</em> It used to be a cemetery,
as with Tiong Bahru, as with Bishan. These are now homes for many,
many Singaporeans. In these places, our children are growing up
and forming their new memories of these places themselves.</p>

were surfaced many years ago as part of the Concept Plan. And as
with all Concept Plans, there was public consultation, getting stakeholders
and various groups
to share their views. With the surge in interest, I asked for these
plans to be re-surfaced, to go through in detail again to see if
we had missed anything. Could we have shared better with the public
at the earlier stages? I think we could have. Some of these briefings
that we have provided to various groups, we could have done them, perhaps,
on a much broader basis. But not all plans can be shared beforehand
largely due to market sensitivity, especially where land acquisition
could take place. And, inevitably, it is our responsibility to make
the final call on the trade-offs between competing land needs. I
have been corresponding with many who actively champion the Bukit
Brown cause. One shared with me that he felt moved when he was brought
round the cemetery. I know how he felt. I feel it too, every time
I go there to run and to explore the place, to bash through the
bushes and stumble upon new tombs that have been overgrown by plants
and trees. The earlier exhumations at Tiong Bahru, many years ago,
also raised similar community concerns. Recalling the opposition
then, the late Mr Lim Kim San had asked a group who came to see
him, "Do you want me to look after our dead grandparents or do you
want to look after your grandchildren?" </p>

the URA and LTA have been funding the documentation of about 5,000
graves which may potentially be affected by the road. Dr Hui Yew
Foong championed this initiative and is now leading the effort.
He has brought on board Dr Loh Kah Seng, who is helping to capture
the stories which are important, and Dr Gan Su-lin, who is exploring
how best to record the religious and cultural rites involved with exhumation.
I think many of these rites and practices would fade with time if
we do not document them. I also want to recognise the work of the
many volunteers who stepped forward and put in many hours. I visited
them recently and met volunteers, such as Ms Wendy Tan and Mr Chua
Seng Huat, who coincidentally are from my constituency; architecture
post-grad students like Zhen Ru and Qiao Ling, and champion documenter Mr
Seow Kit Chua, who apparently is able to document up to 41 graves

Dr Teo Ho Pin's questions on construction productivity. Our previous
efforts to raise construction productivity have had some positive
results. But, as Dr Teo highlighted, productivity improvements have
been very slow. It is not good enough. It is a structural problem
because of our industry's heavy reliance on workers and especially
foreign workers. While we have seen some technology adoption among our
construction companies, we can do more. Our annual construction
productivity growth still lags behind those in the manufacturing
and services sectors. And it is behind those in developed countries. </p>

experience in the construction workforce, especially as the industry
presses ahead with the productivity drive. We agree with our industry
partners. MND and BCA will work with the Ministry of Manpower on
how we can retain experienced workers to support our productivity
drive, and to moderate the demand for foreign construction workers
over time. And we should be able to make some announcement in a

also must continuously upgrade the skills of our construction workforce.
Since 2008, BCA has certified more than 10,000 workers to possess specialised
skills in 17 key construction trades, through its Construction Registration
of Tradesmen Scheme, or CoreTrade in short. </p>

scheme, BCA will launch a new multi-skilling scheme in July this
year, to recognise workers with a breadth of construction expertise
under the "Higher Skilled" category. For example, workers with structural
steel and welding skills; or, those with drywall and ceiling board
installation skills will be classified as such. </p>

upgrading pathway is clear. With more of such multi-skilled workers
who can take on more and varied assignments, companies will have
greater flexibility in optimising their manpower deployment on site
and, hence, are able to hire fewer workers. Under this scheme, the
workers must pass BCA's skill assessments to qualify for lower levy as "Higher Skilled"
workers. Employers will, hence, be encouraged to send their workers
for training outside of their first skill to boost their productivity. </p>

attention to these companies as they represent a large pool that
must be plugged into the construction productivity drive, if we
are to see productivity gains for the sector as a whole. This year's
Budget is committed to extending special help to small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), because they will be the group most affected

to transform the industry. In part, we have no choice because going

As the Minister of State in the Ministry of Manpower, I have keen

                  </span>: Sir, I would like to ask
the Minister whether the Ministry of National Development will review
some of the very old rules and regulations or practices that may
be obsolete, for example, the one that I cited last week about asking
the divorcee to get a letter of confirmation from the ex-husband.
I believe this is something that could be obsolete and is causing
a lot of pain to the residents.</p>

Khaw Boon Wan)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, we certainly have and we do
review policies all the time. Since I stepped into MND, quite a
number of rules and policies have been changed and I do not think
that is the end of it, and we will continue to press on. Some rules
are put in for good reasons. I do not think they are frivolous,
for example, the rule on divorcees and the need to get ex-spouses'
consent, which I have a lot of sympathy with. Therefore, I also
asked why it was so. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fda716cb-5a76-4c67-93b2-c6be703c95dd">
                  <a name="budget__id-fda716cb-5a76-4c67-93b2-c6be703c95dd"><!--a--></a>Let me try to explain
this in simple terms. You have a couple – let us call them A and B.
They can own one subsidised flat, if they keep the marriage intact.
But if there is a divorce, A or B may then retain or apply for a
subsidised flat within five years. So, that was the rule. There
was a five-year debarment period. If they want, only one of them may
retain or apply for a subsidised flat. The other party can only
buy a resale flat; in other words, an unsubsidised flat, which is
not an issue. The issue is subsidy.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ea73966-ad1b-4f6f-bc34-6119a4c4831c">
                  <a name="budget__id-8ea73966-ad1b-4f6f-bc34-6119a4c4831c"><!--a--></a>So, you have a couple,
if the marriage remains intact, they have one flat. If they divorce,
and if without this rule, they may split the children between them
and have two subsidised flats. Then, which couple is better off?
To stay married or go for divorce? So, that was the basis behind
this policy. It is not a new policy, it is quite old. There were cases
in the past where people were gaming. It was very unfortunate; it
was an abuse. They were never divorced but just wanted to take advantage
of having these two subsidised flats, and they feigned divorce,
while remaining married in practice. Their marriage is intact but,
in form, seemingly they divorced, and then they opt to buy two flats.
This was an old case, and that prompted this policy, but the story
did not end there. I recalled reading in either <em class="ph i">Wanbao or </em>
                  <em class="ph i">Shin
Min</em> a few months back, about a reporter interviewing some sales
agents. The sales agents told them that that there were some couples
thinking of doing this, that is, they are actually not divorcing
but they intend to file a divorce, so that they can have two flats.
Their plan is to rent out one flat, while continuing to stay together
in another.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4d01df00-440e-47f2-a630-9f7bb9ced57a">
                  <a name="budget__id-4d01df00-440e-47f2-a630-9f7bb9ced57a"><!--a--></a>So, let us not be naive
and think that everybody is honest. The vast majority are, but there
are cases of abuse like these. And that is why the policy was put
in. Without the time bar, each party who has custody of the child
could then apply for a subsidised flat immediately after divorce,
thus resulting in two subsidised flats. The time bar ensures that
a divorced couple is not treated better off than a married couple.
However, the time bar is waived if a divorcee buys a subsidised
flat with his or her parents or a new spouse. In other words, the
family unit is different from the original one.</p>

in response to some abuses. I must say it is not a common occurrence
but it is not uncommon either. It is not a common occurrence, perhaps, because
of the rule. Because without this rule, it may then become common,
which is what we are trying to avoid. As only A or B is allowed
to have one subsidised flat, we need the other party's consent to
give up the right during this five-year debarment period. Because
we are in no position to decide whether A or B is more deserving
of a subsidised flat, in the case where the kids are split between
them. </p>

at MPS, the rules have, , created problems for many genuine divorcees.
Therefore, what I have told HDB is to be sympathetic to genuine
divorcees. They turn back to me to say, how do I know whether it
is genuine? I said, well, we have to try to ascertain. Therefore,
we need to probe. That is why it has to be on a case-by-case basis.
However, over the weekend , as I thought through what had been raised
by Er Dr Lee Bee Wah, and after many e-mails with my staff, I told
them, let us do this: if A and B divorced, and A has custody of
all the children who are young – let us say the settlement between
the two is that one of them has full custody of all the young children
− then in cases like this, we shall, henceforth, immediately waive
the time bar for A without the need to seek consent from B. But
the time bar must continue to apply to B who has no kids in custody.
In this way, we put the interest of the young kids uppermost. In
addition, given the MPs' feedback, I will also review whether the
time bar of five years is a little bit too long. I think to waive
it, or to make it zero, is unwise. But I want to mull over this
one – whether five years is too long − and we will try to balance
between deterrence against abuse and minimising hardship on divorcees. </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Sylvia Lim</strong>
                  </span>: May I seek
some clarification from Minister of State Lee Yi Shyan concerning
my cut on Lift Upgrading Programme? The nub of my cut is actually
to ask why Town Councils are paying HDB for older lifts that are
being shut down under the name of overhaul cost. I have four clarifications
in relation to this.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c47b49cf-b791-49f9-9d36-396b24805094">
                  <a name="budget__id-c47b49cf-b791-49f9-9d36-396b24805094"><!--a--></a>First, does Minister of
State Lee agree that to use the term "overhaul" to describe a lift
that is shut down is actually not in keeping with the meaning of
the word "overhaul"? The second clarification is on HDB's definition
of lift upgrading cost, which is a net of the actual lift upgrading
cost minus away Town Council's contribution towards the overhaul cost.
Does this actually mean that the Town Council is subsidising the
cost of the LUP, in particular the Government's portion of the LUP?
The third clarification: I agree with Minister of State Lee that
cyclical works such as lift overhaul are part and parcel of Town Council's
work and, of course, Town Councils do accumulate sinking funds for
that. But does he also not agree that if Town Councils were to do
these cyclical works on our own, we could determine the timing and
also the costing of the works? And we note that HDB's costing is
rather higher compared to our own estimates. The fourth clarification: two
years ago, during the COS of MND 2010, it was announced that HDB
would provide one-off LUP assistance to Town Councils. If we looked
at the debate there, there was a recognition by MND that LUP does
cause a strain on Town Councils when it comes to sinking fund usage;
in other words, more than above the cyclical funds that Town Council
accumulates. As usual, LUP does cause a burden, so that is why the
LUP Assistance (LUPA) was provided. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ae6fe229-cd24-4bd1-9797-4398fa2b171d">
                  <a name="budget__id-ae6fe229-cd24-4bd1-9797-4398fa2b171d"><!--a--></a>We have looked at some
of the LUPA provided by some of our clusters for LUP and we find
that in a particular cluster − if I can just give an example of,
say, about 11 flats which are largely 3- to 4-room flats − the Town
Council's share of the LUP cost is supposed to be about 7%. But
including the overhaul cost which we have to pay, it becomes about
16%. Despite the LUPA being provided of half a million dollars,
we are still paying about 12%, which is much higher than the roughly
7% we are supposed to pay. In light of this, would the Government
at least consider looking at the LUP Assistance amounts? </p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr
Lee Yi Shyan</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, I want to thank Ms Sylvia Lim
for her clarifications. I also want to commend her for knowing the
mathematics very well. Sir, if you want to take a step back on the
LUP programme, this is a programme that was added on in year 2001,
to give access to all the residents in different floors. We know
back in the older days when HDB flats were first built, there were
lift landings, and residents actually shied away from those units
because it meant noise and loss of privacy, and so on. So actually,
people wanted to stay away from lift landings. Anyway, fast forward,
decades later, we find that people are requiring that facility,
especially when they are getting older, and there is no question
about the need. So, the LUP programme comes in and, as I have mentioned, this
is a $5.5 billion programme over a period of 15 years or so. As
you can imagine, when this programme was introduced, the estates
are at different ages. Some were maybe 15 years old; some may be
20 years old; and some may be very near the lift replacement cycle
which is 28 years. As part of the discipline of the Town Councils,
and I mean all Town Councils, they always set aside a portion of
their S&amp;CC charges into a sinking fund. And one of the biggest
items of the sinking fund usage is actually for lift replacement.
So, at the 28th year, if you have been saving regularly, conscientiously, you
would be able to have, say, $100,000 to replace each of the lifts
that is "retiring". </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-1a81a80d-87fa-4b43-be56-a13ebfd3e653"><!--a--></a> Since LUP was introduced
halfway, some of the lifts may be 20 years old, some may be 22,
25 years. What the Government is saying is that for this portion
of the money that they have saved up, "Don't worry, you know, we
know you haven't saved for the 28 but you saved for the 22, that
is fine. We give you a new lift, and you pay for the 22 years and
the new lift will start from there." I think this is fair because
this is something that the Town Councils have been anticipating
to spend on. So, it is fair to draw down this amount from the Town
Council's sinking fund.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-89a84ce6-038e-425f-9078-e63e151625bf">
                  <a name="budget__id-89a84ce6-038e-425f-9078-e63e151625bf"><!--a--></a> Likewise, the formula
will apply to other lifts of different ages. However, the costs associated
with replacing the lift is not just the lift carriage or the lift
car. In most cases where we need to build new lift shafts, across
the slab block, let us say, there will be costs incurred in the
building of lift shafts, diverting the service lines below the lift
shafts, putting in power and so on. These are additional costs that
the programme will bear. Also, using analogy A and B, so A, Town
Councils will pay for a portion of the lift costs, X over 28 and
then for the other component of the costs, let us say, call it B,
HDB will pay up to 90%. When it was introduced in 2001, many Town
Councils said, "If we charge 10% to the residents, maybe it is too
high. Town Councils will be happy to chip in the 5%." That is why
we have the formula – 90% by HDB; 5% from Town Councils; 5% from residents
on the component B. A and B together, we are able to roll out this
programme quite successfully and we expect to complete by 2014.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-06e30cad-b65f-49d6-aae8-47c5aacfa74f">
                  <a name="budget__id-06e30cad-b65f-49d6-aae8-47c5aacfa74f"><!--a--></a> There is no doubt that
the drawdown for lift replacements will be the highest item in the
cyclical work of the Town Councils because the other cyclical works,
such as painting, water tanks and so on, will occur in shorter intervals
but the cost is much lower. Therefore, I think, going forward, it
will be prudent for Town Councils to review what will be needed
in another 28 years' time and then to adjust S&amp;CC charges accordingly.</p>

that MND is helping Singaporeans who are in distress with regards to
their housing matters. I am also hopeful that he mentioned that
he is mulling over the issue of how to help singles to own flats.
He mentioned that singles attaining the age of 21 can form a family nucleus with their
parents. However, if you look at the environment today, I feel that
even at the age of 21 or even late 20s or early 20s, one is not
sure whether one is going to be single. Sir, I am very concerned,
especially, for older singles who would like to form a family nucleus
with their parents. However, their parents are constrained with
the fact that they already got the maximum number of times of grants or
subsidy. So, I hope Minister will exercise his discretion and be
sympathetic and compassionate to this group of Singaporeans, especially
singles with parents who are in distress.</p>

Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for his view on the negative
reaction by some segments of the population towards the studio apartments for
the elderly, for example, in Toh Yi Drive. Just today, we heard
that the Toh Yi Drive residents have selected another location for
the apartments but the residents of that other location also feel
that it is not appropriate and also are rejecting that option. Can
I ask the Minister whether MND should take a firmer stand on this
issue because the elderly is a group to be treasured and valued,
and not to be treated like a leper colony to be shunned?</p>

related one but it is to the Minister of State. It is about honouring
the past and the older generations before us. Sir, I understand
that hard decisions have to be made and that the Minister of State
has done a lot to engage the civic groups and to document the significance
of the graves. But there must be a distinction made between documenting
graves and putting it in the CD or online, and a physical marker
where people can go and appreciate the engravings, the stories that tombs
tell. For example, the Ong Sam Leong grave has engravings to do
with filial piety and this kind of value can be passed down to future
generations not only through stories or CDs, but through a physical
focal point for the story, and how we ourselves are honouring the
graves of those who have contributed to Singapore. Can I ask the
Minister of State whether it is possible for him to consider preserving
some of tombs that have significance to the country and which can

your point by giving a short reply. Indeed, we must be firm with
the policy of helping the seniors and that is why I stress the ancient
Confucian saying in my earlier speech. That ethos of helping seniors
to age with peace of mind underpins my policy and I hope Singaporeans,
in general, would embrace that, too. We will all grow old one day,
so let us try to put ourselves in the seniors' shoes. And where
facilities are needed, let us try to think about whether that option
should not be exercised so as to help our seniors age with peace
of mind. But the process is important and, therefore, the engagement
is important. We will continue that process of talking but, at the
end of the day, a decision will have to be made and if, indeed,
that is the best option for the seniors, then we will press on.</p>

Chairman, physical markers are utterly important. In fact, in my
discussions with the advisory group and the various stakeholders
involved over Bukit Brown, there are different ways that we can
try to preserve, whether tombstones, carvings, tiles, apart from
just documentation alone. There are really three parts. I mean,
one, documentation of the physical graves by marking it through
GPS and so on. That is important. The other one is in terms of capturing
the stories, which as the Member mentioned, are the carvings, the
inscriptions placed there. And another part, which is also very
important, is capturing the rituals that will take place with exhumation.</p>

that a large part of Bukit Brown Cemetery would actually be remaining
as it is for the next two decades or so, because the bulk of the
development in the immediate future will take place in the south,
the old Police Academy area. Apart from the road, the rest of the
Bukit Brown Cemetery will remain. We will work closely with the
interest groups in terms of how we think we could possibly preserve
some of these things and that is quite possible.</p>

Mr Chairman, I thank the Minister for adjusting the policy to allow
those who exceed the $1,500 salary threshold to still rent flats
from HDB but at higher rental rate. I believe this will help many
families in difficult housing circumstances. I have three questions.
Will requests under this new policy be more easily approved than
previously, or will they still have to go through the trouble of appealing
through their Members of Parliament? Secondly, can this be extended
to families who are ineligible for rental flats due to other factors
like the 30-month debarment period or having working children whom
they are estranged from? Thirdly, what are the rental rates under
this new policy?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
because the cases are usually unique, it is very hard to generalise.
Of course, they will have to appeal. They can appeal directly to
the HDB, as most do, or sometimes they do double barrel. They go
straight to the Member in parallel. Either way, whether it comes
from the Member or from the HDB branch office, we will look at each
case. Last year, just as an example, we approved more than 100 families
whose income exceeded the $1,500 ceiling. I expect the numbers to
grow for this year and in the future.</p>

should affect some families, then you have to look at the individual
case. If we deviate from the rule, we have to find a reason for
doing so. I have expressed the principle last Friday that for victims
of misfortune, like a sudden death of a breadwinner, our default
position is to try to say yes. Try to find a reason to say yes, so
long as the spirit of the policy is not flouted.</p>

depend on their salary. If he is earning, let us say, $2,500 versus
another one with $2,000, there must be a difference in their rentals.
For those earning below $1,500, for example, rental for a 1-room
flat is $30 and $110 for 2-room flat, or thereabout. For those,
earning about $2,000, we are charging something like $200 plus.
It is still heavily subsidised. But I think there must be a difference
for those who are earning below $1,500.</p>

that new MNCs or companies that come to invest in Singapore may
require to be kicked off by foreign talent who are more familiar
with the operations and organisational requirements. However, Sir,
once they have been operating here for some time, we should have
a system to ensure that over time, the core of every company must

I am certainly not advocating job protectionism, and saying that Singaporeans
must be given these roles even if they are not suitably qualified.
I am not saying that. I believe, instead, that it is possible to
have proper measures and policies that can identify areas where
Singaporeans can lead, where they can be consciously developed to
match or even surpass the talent that foreigners bring with them.
At the same time, we must ensure that companies are incentivised
to transfer knowledge and skills to our local workers, so that our
dependence on foreign talent is lowered even in the future. In this
way, also, our local workers will get the good promotion and the
career advancement prospects they deserve, and be more motivated
to pursue upgrading to move up the employment value chain. </p>

like MOM to also look at the retirement savings for our workers. Is
the Ministry taking steps to improve the rate of return on CPF savings
so that workers can grow their retirement savings, and are there
also other measures to increase the living standards of workers
once they stop working and earning an income? What are the ways
are we going to look at to tap the potential of our older workers
because Singaporeans are now living longer? This is an increasingly
urgent issue given our increasing life-expectancy and, at the same
time, the cost of living in Singapore.</p>

this is a tale I hear often and it is always a disheartening one.
Elderly folks who have very little cash savings and low CPF balances
– it is a situation that
makes every day a struggle; too old or sickly to work and without
family support for one reason or another. Some of them live hand-to-mouth.
For the lucky ones, they have a home at least and can be assured
of a shelter over their heads; however, there are others who are
not so well off.</p>

70s shared that she and her husband have no children and only have
some savings but not enough to afford a rental flat in Singapore.
Sometimes, they rent a room in Johor Baru or when living in Singapore,
stay a few nights with friends for a while before moving on to the
next house. Without sufficient retirement savings, they have to
rely on the kindness of relatives and friends. Although some relatives
have offered to take them in, this is not something they feel that
they can burden their relatives with.</p>

older Singaporeans unload the wealth stored in their homes for their
retirement. Will this scheme make a sufficient impact on the retirement
adequacy of our Singaporeans? Would our elderly have enough Medisave

"to take care of the aged folks of other people as we take care
of our own" is a traditional Confucius ethical ideal. However, the
reality that we face today, is that many elderly Singaporeans no
longer pin their hopes on their children to take care of them when
they are old. Hence, to a large extent, both the Government and
the people must work together to try their best to help our old
folks stay healthy, stay employed, and work for as long as they
wish to. Furthermore, we must ensure that they have enough savings
and CPF funds to retire comfortably. We must continually adjust
and enhance our plans that cater to the elderly, so that our old
folks will have enough support as they age. </p>

Sir, older women in Singapore is a vulnerable group that needs more
of our attention. Income security is a key concern for them. The
economic development of Singapore was achieved in an incredibly
short time – it means that older women today are less likely than
their counterparts in the developed world to have gone to university.
This has implications for their late-life employment.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-01475305-1c9d-41ec-88cf-c0b45414aeda">
                  <a name="budget__id-01475305-1c9d-41ec-88cf-c0b45414aeda"><!--a--></a>Women are often the caregivers,
not just of infants, but also of the elderly and the sick. Sometimes
they are forced by circumstances to stop work in formal employment to
devote themselves entirely to care-giving. Our retirement policies
for this group of women seem to imply they are to depend on their
husbands and children to support them in old age. But if they are
unmarried, widowed, or have no children, there will be no one to
care for them. Furthermore, women have longer life expectancies
than men. That is
why in my speech at the Budget debate, I proposed the idea of pension
credits in Singapore as an example of an instrument that may be
more effective in protecting older women financially compared to
labour market policies.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-4918f694-f5f6-4014-90f5-211501479622"><!--a--></a>In countries like Sweden
and Germany, pension credits or care-giver credits may be earned
during time taken off from work for maternity leave or for the care
of the elderly and the sick. These would be used to help women qualify
for full pension and retirement benefits. There are various formulae
to work out the exact benefits, but they usually take the woman's
last drawn salary and compute a supplement based on it for their
pension accounts. In Singapore, we may not want to adopt the idea
of pension credits for women care-givers on a full scale. But currently
no semblance of such scheme exists at all, and this is not sustainable.
Otherwise, it is a contradiction that the Government encourages women
to have more babies, but also expect them to remain in the workforce. </p>

older women also affect retirees in general, including men. Again,
when compared to our counterparts in the developed world, the raising
of our official retirement age has taken place at a faster pace. </p>

contribution rates and interest rates at an earlier age, so that
the effect of interest rates compounding will have a much larger
impact on the individual retirement fund. If the concern is to better
prepare Singaporeans for retirement, increasing CPF contribution
when one reaches 50 may be too late. If the aim is to increase contribution
at all, the earlier the better. Increasing CPF contribution only at
the age of 50 makes little policy or financial sense, especially
at a time of their life when their salaries may actually start to
dip. This leaves the older workers with less disposable income,
at a vulnerable point of their lives in terms of health and for
other potential costs. </p>

low-income elderly workers will become less attractive to employers,
who may then prefer to hire foreign workers for the same job, since
that would not require them to make a single cent of CPF contribution.</p>

The move by the Government to curb the country's reliance on foreign
labour represents a continuation of a long-term policy. With an
eye towards ensuring sustainable growth and productivity improvements
in the decades to come, this move is certainly a step in the right
direction. At the same time, the decision to raise CPF rates for
older workers, with the ultimate aim of bringing it in line with
that of younger employees, was also announced. This will hopefully
make older workers more employable and lure more of them back to
the workforce.</p>

that firms can hire comes as part of a series of efforts that kicked
off in 2010, when a schedule of foreign worker levy hikes was introduced.
And stricter criteria for employment pass and S-pass issuance also
took effect earlier this year. It is worth noting that despite the
higher levies, the foreign workforce has grown 7.5% annually over
the last two years. It is no surprise then that companies have expressed
dismay and fears that they simply may not be able to find enough
people to do the work with the new measures implemented. This is
especially the case in labour-intensive sectors such as retail,
food and beverage, and logistics. And the hard truth may be that
such short-term pain is a necessary tough decision that must be
made as Singapore restructures for the long haul.</p>

measures to help smaller firms, the Budget also includes a Special
Employment Credit (SEC) of up to 8% of a worker's wage when they
hire Singaporeans over 50 years of age. Some observers have said
that this may provide a boost to firms looking to tap on the latent
pool of local manpower that includes homemakers and early retirees.
However, employers may be forced to offer higher wages to entice
these homemakers and retirees back into the workforce, thereby outweighing
the benefits of the SEC. </p>

Deputy Prime Minister and Manpower Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam
is committed to "treading a balanced path in our manpower policies". I
believe that for Singapore's economy to continue to thrive, we must
indeed remain welcoming to businesses and talent from abroad, in
order to create and sustain good jobs for our local populace. At
the same time, this must be balanced out by policies which guard
against an over-reliance
on foreigners. To this end, the Ministry has assured Singaporeans

at no higher than one-third over the long term.</p>

Ministry what measures are being put in place to increase the productivity
of Singaporeans, even as we seek to reduce reliance on foreigners
in the workforce. First, how is Singapore's national productivity
data obtained and is it possible to distinguish foreign workforce
productivity from that of the local workforce productivity, so as
to enable us to craft more targeted policies to tackle the productivity issue
head-on? What are the concrete plans the Ministry has in place to
enhance the skills, capabilities and productivity of each worker,
so that we can provide more complex and customised services which
would ultimately translate into higher profits for the industries
and higher wages for our Singaporeans? Therefore, the question is,
how do we differentiate between our local workforce productivity
and the foreign workforce productivity? If, indeed, our local workforce
productivity is already very good, then we should do less for those
industries or any other intervention measures for that matter. Besides
higher foreign worker levies and tighter quotas on employment of
foreign workers, can more be done to help companies shoulder higher-wage
costs so that more locals can be hired? And can incentives be offered,
for example, to encourage more housewives and retirees to do part-time
work? </p>

                  </span>:
Sir, like many advanced economies, Singapore faces the twin challenges
of an ageing and shrinking workforce. Our businesses need to reduce
their reliance on foreign labour amidst a tight labour market. It
is even more urgent now to maximise our manpower and resources more
efficiently and effectively. Job redesign, capital productivity,
automation and process improvements are some of the ways that the
Government is already helping companies to improve their operational
efficiency. Job redesign can certainly keep our workforce flexible,
nimble and responsive, especially in a time of rapid changes in
the global economy and Singapore's demography. Our demographic profile
suggests that more of our workforce will want to work flexibly moving
forward. This is especially so for older workers, retirees or those
who will be retiring. Flexibility and job redesign are also important
factors to women who are thinking of re-entering the workforce as
well as mothers with young children. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1d463e8f-e96e-46d3-be8d-578dfbffce8e">
                  <a name="budget__id-1d463e8f-e96e-46d3-be8d-578dfbffce8e"><!--a--></a>To this end, I hope MOM
can nurture a healthy, skills ecosystem with job redesign for better
skill deployment − an ecosystem of healthy networks and support
between policymakers, businesses, tertiary tuitions, trade and industry
associations as well as community groups, such as Active Agers and
women's interest groups. The Government can also take a proactive
approach as an aggregator as well as an educator in harnessing the
latent pool of manpower and talents, as well as levelling up their
skills. The environment and spirit of cooperation will provide more
accurate information on skills demand and supply between the stakeholders
and facilitate a better matching for redesign and deployment of
manpower and resources. </p>

reasons for the Government to play an even more active role. The
potential benefits are: (1) better alignment with economic restructuring;
( 2) support for workers and employers; (3) more efficient distribution
of manpower resources;
(4) ability to support job redesign through policies and interventions
where needed; and finally, closer alignment with the institutes
of higher learning. Today's jobs are being challenged by tomorrow's
demand – all too quickly. If we can collectively maximise our manpower
though job redesign across industries and sectors, we have a chance
to recreate value, increase productivity, provide long-term employability
and future-proof our workers for the better. </p>

Sir, currently the dependency ratio ceiling for foreign manpower
is based on broad industry sectors. It will be helpful to further finetune
the sectors based on specific industries to better ascertain and
calibrate the need for foreign manpower <em class="ph i">vis-a-vis</em> Singaporeans
in specific industries. In industries where Singaporeans can be
trained to take up the jobs, there is room for the dependency ratios
to be further tightened. In industries where attracting Singaporeans
poses a challenge due to the nature of the work and working conditions,
the dependency ratio can be relaxed. MOM may also want to consider
a step further by looking at the work scope of jobs within the specific
industry to determine whether more can be done to allow Singaporean
workers to reclaim specific jobs.</p>

approach is needed to achieve the objective of increasing the wages
of lower income workers through productivity while minimising the
possible fallout of the SME because: (a) the range of SME businesses
and industries is complex and a macro policy instrument will not
be effective in helping the industries restructure; (b) an abrupt
forced transformation of certain industries, such as the cleaning
and construction industries, could result in a rapid rise in costs
and eventually end up with the consumers paying higher prices; and
(c) some industries may also result in a monopoly by a few companies
that will dominate the market, as others may not be able to cope
with the required change.</p>

will be a more cumbersome process and will require more resources.
However, this will show that the Government cares to look into the
problem and concerns of the SMEs and is prepared to help solve the
problem and minimise the pain and suffering of a restructuring process.
I believe that the outcome will be more satisfying.</p>

Mr Chairman, our manpower policies must help Singaporeans raise
their skills and expertise, secure the best jobs and support increases in
their incomes. Over the past week, Members of this House have discussed
measures to curb the growth of lower wage foreign workforce under
the work permit scheme. However, there remain significant concerns
on the ground about whether or not the same is being done for higher
level jobs, mainly those professionals, managers and executives.
This is a significant group that makes up more than half of our
workforce. Singaporeans want and aspire to do these jobs. However,
it is worrying to observe the rapid increase in foreign professionals
who hold Employment Passes − a growth of 24% over the last two years
– the fastest growing category of foreigners. </p>

the qualifying salary levels as well as education qualifications
for Employment Pass holders. Whilst we wait to see the impact of
these changes, can we do more? Sir, there is absolutely no doubt
that Singapore needs to remain
open to international talent in order to be globally competitive.
We recognise that Singapore is home to corporations that operate
at world class standards and, therefore, we need to ensure their
ranks are staffed with the best talent from around the world. </p>

we ensure Singaporeans with the right skills are being considered
first for the best jobs and where there are gaps, employers take
determined steps to develop Singaporeans for these jobs? Our current
system relies too much on the conscience of companies to adopt fair
and responsible employment and staff development practices. The
reality is that business is all about pragmatism. Given a choice,
companies will turn towards the most convenient and cheapest option
to fulfil their objectives. As long as there is an easily accessible
pool of foreigners to tap into, there is less impetus to seek out
Singaporeans to fill the best jobs. </p>

by global trends that have shifted growth drivers from the West
to the East. Whereas in the past, competition for jobs had primarily
come from the lower cost Asian countries, Singaporean executives
now encounter competition from even the developed but job-scarce
nations of the West. Given our country's strong proposition as one
of the world's most liveable cities, and also our attractive position
as the hub of the vibrant Asia, we have become a magnet for the
talent from all over the world competing for a limited number of
quality jobs. </p>

the Minister to consider strengthening our Employment Pass system
so that we ensure that Singaporeans have the first consideration
for the best job: first, EP approvals be subject to employers showing
clear evidence of efforts to employ Singaporeans first before having
to resort to hiring foreigners; and second, even when employers
demonstrate they are not able to find Singaporeans with the relevant
skills, they are obliged to put in place a plan to invest in the
training and development of Singaporeans to fill these jobs. </p>

welcome foreigners as a supplement to their local workforce already
have such measures in place. This allows corporations to employ
the best international talent without adversely impacting the job
prospects of local professionals. At the same time, there is impetus
to continuously develop local talent to world-class standards. From
the standpoint of security, such a systematic manpower plan will
also protect strategic industries and guard against vulnerability
from over-reliance on foreigners in selected sectors. </p>

Sir, the further tightening to reduce our economy's dependence on
foreign workers is a necessary step in the right direction. However,
I would like to ask the Minister for Manpower to do more, by refining
the Ministry's current segmentation of industries in coming up with
foreign manpower policies including Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs).
This does not divert us from our specified goals of reducing our
overall foreign manpower dependence and raising productivity. Because
given an overall target and roadmap, the idea is to make it possible
for foreign manpower policies to be less stringent for some industries
than for others, not for them to be less stringent than the <em class="ph i">status
quo</em>. Such refinement will allow the Government to gradually
implement additional measures for industries where there is room
for tightening. It will allow more targeted measures to help us
more effectively meet our set goals by taking into account the different
realities faced by our businesses in the different industries such
as their prospects for further productivity gains and the different
ways foreign workers complement Singapore workers.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-b1ecac70-e2f3-4882-9457-016ba93a1930"><!--a--></a>The Minister mentioned
that it will be quite inequitable if a large firm that undertakes both
the high and low end segments in the aerospace industry is entitled
to a higher foreign worker quota, while a small firm that is competing
with it at the high end is forced to operate within the more stringent
quota. But regrettably, inequity also results when you apply the
same requirements to two firms that may be differently situated.
As the Minister pointed out, there are differences between industries
and even among companies in the same broad industry. The question
is, practically, can something be done to take them into account?
Practically, how are the differences between these two firms addressed,
when, for example, the Government works with Singaporean companies
to set different productivity targets and roadmaps for different
industry sectors? It seems to me that we would have a more effective
and targeted and equitable approach if companies and industries
with different characteristics with different productivity targets and roadmaps, for
example, need not all face the same DRC when it comes to their foreign
manpower requirements. </p>

Sir, recently I was travelling in a taxi and the taxi driver shared
with me that he used to work as a container truck driver, earning
some $4,000 a month for some 13 years. He was happy with his job
but, sadly, his pay was gradually reduced to $2,000-plus. And due
to competition from foreign truck drivers, he eventually lost his
job and became a taxi driver. This Budget announcement to reduce our
dependence on foreign labour is welcomed by many Singaporeans. Mr
Chairman, Sir, I wish you were there to witness the glow and the
smile on his face when this taxi driver shared with me that he was
looking forward to returning to his previous job as a container
truck driver, which he enjoyed doing very much.</p>

taxi driver to applaud the Government for restoring the hope and
confidence of many Singaporeans by putting in place a calibrated
approach of reduction in the DRCs and S Passes. While I understand
the pain and the difficult transition that the companies have to
go through, we also understand that it is absolutely necessary.
Rather than to prolong the pain, I think it is wise to act on it
now and not only to do it now, but to do it well. I am glad that
the Ministry has now put in place a more stringent set of criteria
to keep pace with improving salaries of our Singaporean workers
and PMEs and this helps to ensure our local workers will not be unfairly
undermined. I noted that the real wage increase has been low over
the past years. I would like to ask the Ministry what are our plans
to encourage companies to tap on the incentive schemes to upgrade
their businesses and processes, so that our workers can have a fair
share in this productivity gain.</p>

the Government to close all loopholes to ensure that employment
and development opportunities will be given to our Singaporeans
and this should not be compromised. My concern is whether this change
of policy can be effectively implemented, bearing in mind that there
will be employers who will always try to circumvent the restrictions.
I would also like to ask the Minister how enforcement measures will
be stepped up to ensure compliance with this new requirement. Further, could
the Minister elaborate on how the MOM intends to monitor employers
to ensure that they provide more employment opportunities and to
develop Singaporeans to fill up these job vacancies?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
the Finance Minister has explained that the timing of the new measures
to curb foreign labour is deliberate, given that we are now facing a
slow growth year, which presents an opportunity to lower the dependency
ratio ceilings while companies are ostensibly not facing a demand
crunch. </p>

from the Minister as well in his wrap-up of the Budget Debate that
no effort will be spared to help SMEs to upgrade and increase productivity,
and that the foreign labour curbs will be implemented in a calibrated
and measured way. Greater flexibility has also been promised to
enable companies to maximise their use of foreign staff.</p>

there is a definite need to restructure our economy to remain competitive
even as we take into consideration the social concerns expressed
by Singaporeans.
But I believe that in doing so, we run the risk of contributing
to rising costs in Singapore in the short term. Inflation in 2011
was 5.2% and the Monetary Authority of Singapore has said earlier
that inflation in 2012 will average between 2.5% and 3.5%. And while
consumer price inflation in January eased slightly to 4.8%, down from
5.5% in December, core inflation which discounts accommodation and
private transport costs soared to a three-year high of 3.5%.</p>

already attributing this to earlier cost increases, including labour
cost hikes. And the domestic labour market is very tight. We are
seeing an almost fully employed resident labour force, with our
jobless rate at a 14-year low of 2% in 2011. Companies, especially
SMEs, might not be able to reduce their dependence on foreign labour
and offset cost increases despite the assistance schemes provided.</p>

wages for lower income Singaporeans and using more local workers
is possibly likely to drive prices for goods and services up as
businesses pass on cost increases to consumers. Economists have
said that they see significant upward cost adjustment in the economy
already underway, as the tight labour market gives rise to higher
business costs to add to already higher transport costs and rents.
Just last December, Singapore rose two notches to become the sixth
most expensive city in Asia, surpassing Hong Kong for the first
time in at least a decade, according to a survey conducted by ECA
International. And globally, we have also moved up to 31st spot
from 42nd a year ago.</p>

indicated that there may be further adjustments to policies, especially
pertaining to levies if the curbs do not seem to be working. I would
like to ask the Manpower Ministry (MOM) if there is the possibility
for adjustments to be also made if it becomes apparent that the
curbs on foreign labour are contributing to rising inflation in
Singapore.</p>

Sir, this year, MOM is reviewing the Employment of Foreign Manpower
Act to strengthen enforcement and hold employers and other stakeholders
more accountable for the basic employment standards and well-being
of foreign workers. The Ministry also helps to educate foreign workers
on their employment rights and sources of help, and is piloting
a series of pre-departure briefings on topics such as employment
laws and terms for construction workers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3025b3aa-a65e-486e-adc9-103e10b9e205">

moves that the Government is implementing on an infrastructural
level to advance the welfare of foreign workers and enhance the protection
of their rights, I am uncertain just how many of these well-intended
measures actually translate into practical and effective solutions
for workers embroiled in on-the-ground difficulties and disputes.
It is an unequal playing field, which works against the vulnerable.
How far can education of their rights really go, when foreign workers
risk losing their jobs, which is the only means of financial support
for their families back home? </p>

First, ensuring foreign workers, including construction workers,
are paid on time. Just two weeks ago, it was reported that some
200 foreign workers had protested in a field in Tampines over the
non-payment of their salaries. According
to these workers, they had not been paid since last November and
were owed amounts ranging from $2,500 to more than $3,000. The workers
also alleged that they had been given inedible food to eat, and
were made to pay illegal charges of $1,500 to renew their work permits.
One of the workers who was interviewed was close to tears as he
recounted how his wife had been begging him for money to pay his
child's school fees in Bangladesh. I am not commenting on the merits
of the case. But, what can the Ministry do to enhance the policing
of employment practices if indeed their plight is true?</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1899</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5d77abc9-88b4-4860-84cb-cd4420e183bd">
                  <a name="budget__id-5d77abc9-88b4-4860-84cb-cd4420e183bd"><!--a--></a>The second issue is: adequate
rest for our foreign domestic workers. Everyone deserves rest. Maids
are no different, for everyone deserves rest. Some have said that we
should leave it to agencies and the maids to work out contractually
whether they will have a rest day. However, the maid is inevitably
in an unequal bargaining position with many if not most unable to
comprehend contractual terms written in English. Therefore, any
analysis on the topic of rest days must be viewed through that reality.
In this House, I had previously raised the issue of rest days for
Foreign Domestic Workers, with the MOM saying it is analysing this.
Is the Ministry of Manpower in a position to provide an update on
this? After all, everyone deserves rest. We are all human.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-54bb724f-719c-4e11-b54e-d9e33b334631">

do with the controversial Maid Review section of a blog that allows
employers to post and view alleged misdeeds of maids. VWOs have
complained that the site violated the rights and privacy of maids
by revealing details such as their names, photographs, Work Permit
and passport numbers. Although the Maid Review section has now been
made private, the problem is not totally resolved from the domestic
workers' point of view as employers may still have access to their
particulars and any uncomplimentary remarks made about them. If
something untrue is said of them, this could ruin any prospect of
re-employment with a subsequent employer. This is extremely unfair.
Would we want that to happen to ourselves? Surely not. So, whoever
it is running that blog, have more compassion. What more can MOM
do to ensure that maids have at least some recourse to action or
a channel for complaints to be made? Would the Ministry consider
exploring legislation which prevents users from uploading personal
profile data such as those in identity cards and Work Permits? </p>

HR or finance functions. Deputy Prime Minister Tharman had said
that the increase in foreign worker levies may continue beyond our

Sir, I would like to thank Members for their very useful observations
and questions so far. I would like first to address the questions related
to retirement adequacy and the CPF, whilst Minister of State Tan
Chuan-Jin and Senior Parliamentary Secretary Hawazi Daipi will respond
to the other important matters raised.</p>

Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Seng Han Thong and Mrs Lina Chiam had raised
relevant issues concerning retirement adequacy, particularly as Singaporeans
live longer. Some questions were also raised during the Budget debate, including
by Ms Mary Liew.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-699e1805-6b99-4d56-b9bf-b59f9374aed4">
                  <a name="budget__id-699e1805-6b99-4d56-b9bf-b59f9374aed4"><!--a--></a>How well does the CPF
system provide Singaporeans for their retirement? The short answer
is that for the current generation of older Singaporeans, as I mentioned
in my Budget Statement, cash savings are low for many. At the same
time, the majority of them have significant wealth in their homes.
On the other hand, for the younger generation, and especially for
those in the middle and lower income groups, which is the group
that the CPF principally aims to serve, their CPF savings provide
significantly higher income for their retirement; in fact, at a
level that is comparable to the median for the OECD countries. And
this is even without taking into account the fact of higher home ownership
in Singapore. For the younger generation that will be saving throughout
their working lives and eventually retiring, the CPF system will
be able to provide a level of income in retirement that is comparable
to the median of the developed countries, and this is without taking
into account the fact that they will also own a home, which is not as
common in the developed countries when we talk about the middle
and lower income groups. So, that is the sum of the matter. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-98c62a99-4d77-4d77-90bb-9e99daef562d">
                  <a name="budget__id-98c62a99-4d77-4d77-90bb-9e99daef562d"><!--a--></a>Let me say that the CPF
system aims to help Singaporeans save enough to meet a basic level
of needs in retirement. What do we mean by a basic level? The Minimum Sum
(MS) that is to be set aside at age 55 is set at a level necessary
to meet the typical expenditure needs of retiree households in the
lower middle income group. It should cover the needs of those in the second
quintile of incomes, that is, between the 20th percentile and 40th
percentile of incomes. That is how we go about planning the system and
setting the parameters, making adjustments from time to time, making
sure the Minimum Sum is sized right. Not too low but not too high
either. It should meet the retirement needs of the lower middle
income group. It should, therefore, of course, also cover the needs
of those further down, those in the first quintile.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1901</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d2e97f98-d959-465f-a85d-51bf40b1792b">
                  <a name="budget__id-d2e97f98-d959-465f-a85d-51bf40b1792b"><!--a--></a>For middle income households,
too, although their spending in retirement is usually higher than
for those in the lower middle or lower income group, the CPF still
forms an important part of their retirement savings. However, the
Minimum Sum is not adequate to support the expected needs of those
in the higher income households, and it was not designed for that
purpose. They would usually have private savings outside of the
CPF to tap on. It is not the aim of the CPF to cater fully to their
needs, or those, in fact, higher up than the upper middle income
group. If we had to cater to those needs, we would need much higher
contribution rates or a much higher CPF contribution ceiling, and
a much higher Minimum Sum. That would be excessive for those in
the bottom half of incomes. It would not be appropriate to design
the system to cater to the needs of those in the upper middle and
higher income groups because it will cause problems lower down. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f250fcbc-59f5-4112-b466-aae96cf6b879">
                  <a name="budget__id-f250fcbc-59f5-4112-b466-aae96cf6b879"><!--a--></a>Mr Seng Han Thong, therefore,
rightly asked whether the Minimum Sum is too high or unattainable
to those with lower incomes, which is the key target group. A member who
is 55 today – current generation of those retiring - and who has
full Minimum Sum in his CPF can expect to receive a monthly payout
that is just enough for an average two-member retiree household
in the lower middle income group, that is, in the second quintile
of incomes. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-23e80433-9b37-482c-b00c-b2a4b44d9f7e"><!--a--></a>It is not uncommon for
one spouse amongst such families to not have worked consistently.
Sometimes not at all but, typically, they would have worked a little
bit but not consistently over their lifetime. Indeed, this is one
of the reasons why a significant proportion of today's retired persons
have not met the Minimum Sum. Many are spouses who work infrequently
or not at all. This is why it is prudent for the Minimum Sum of
an active individual to be adequate to support the basic needs of
a two-member retiree household because it is quite common within
that income group that one spouse has not accumulated much CPF savings.
MOM reviews the Minimum Sum regularly. We have to bear in mind that
CPF members may also make a property pledge and withdraw sums above
half of the Minimum Sum. Bearing all these in mind, the Minimum
Sum is not excessive. We review it regularly and there is, in fact,
little room to have a reduced Minimum Sum for the purpose of ensuring
an adequate stream of retirement income. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-04199fc2-0d2d-4169-8176-9d7705d29d17">
                  <a name="budget__id-04199fc2-0d2d-4169-8176-9d7705d29d17"><!--a--></a>Let me now turn to the
question of whether our CPF system will provide adequate retirement
income for today's younger workers – not for the retirees but those
who are young today but will eventually be retiring in the future.
Will the Minimum Sum also be unattainable for many, like it is for
many in today's older generation? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-38f56666-48a5-42c5-b733-e78041d28232">
                  <a name="budget__id-38f56666-48a5-42c5-b733-e78041d28232"><!--a--></a>The percentage of active
CPF members who meet their Minimum Sum at age 55 has, in fact, been
improving year by year, for instance, from only 36% in 2007 to 45%
in 2011. It will keep improving because with each successive cohort
– it is a very unusual experience Singapore has had over the last
40 years – we see improved educational profiles and improved lifetime
incomes. So, it will keep improving.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-15fcd9a1-50b9-425b-bc38-82bb1431e07c">
                  <a name="budget__id-15fcd9a1-50b9-425b-bc38-82bb1431e07c"><!--a--></a>Amongst those starting work today, about
70%-80% should be able to attain the current level that is set for
the Minimum Sum in cash, not with property pledge, by the time they
retire, adjusted for inflation, even after they have withdrawn money
for a home. So the current level of Minimum Sum can be backed fully
in cash, adjusted for inflation, by the time today's starting generation
reaches retirement, 70-80% of them should be able to achieve this.
So, our CPF system, with current contribution rates, is broadly
appropriate for the younger generation of Singaporeans. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1902</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-19b7baeb-7d7d-4db4-90c9-3dca191848fc">
                  <a name="budget__id-19b7baeb-7d7d-4db4-90c9-3dca191848fc"><!--a--></a>During the Budget debate,
Ms Mary Liew had also cited an academic study which showed that
income replacement rates in retirement, in other words, retirement
payouts compared to pre-retirement income – we call that the income
replacement rate – the study had found that income replacement rates
were low in Singapore. Those low rates were, however, for a worker
in the upper middle income level, the 70th to 80th percentiles.
As I mentioned earlier, it is not the purpose of the CPF to cater
fully to the needs of better-off Singaporeans. Our own projections
showed that for the median and the bottom half of Singaporeans,
income replacement rates for younger workers, once they retire,
will be comparable to the OECD average. We will publish an Occasional Paper
on this topic setting out all the assumptions and data before too
long. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fd683d52-7cd7-4939-84ec-b067903f545e">
                  <a name="budget__id-fd683d52-7cd7-4939-84ec-b067903f545e"><!--a--></a>I should add that for
those at the higher income level, we have the Supplementary Retirement
Scheme (SRS). This is mainly helpful for those in the upper third
of incomes because they get the income tax deductions. In last year's
Budget, we had raised the yearly cap on the amount of savings that
one may save under the SRS to $12,750. I am not sure how we got
such an exact number, but it is $12,750, yearly cap. For a member who
consistently saves the maximum amount over 30 years, he will be
able to set aside almost $400,000, without counting the interest
or investment incomes he gets from the savings – quite a substantial
sum.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5ca0ba6d-e7ee-4ac6-9378-92f2f0e8b62f">
                  <a name="budget__id-5ca0ba6d-e7ee-4ac6-9378-92f2f0e8b62f"><!--a--></a>I should add that for
the younger, lower wage workers, a further source of retirement assets
comes from our housing grants, which will allow them to own a home
that grows in value. The vast majority of Singaporean households
in the bottom 20% of incomes own their homes. This is a key and
distinctive feature of our social security system. Unlike most countries,
even the developed countries, our low-income group owns an asset
that can grow in value as our economy grows, and which they can
monetise in their retirement years, if necessary. As I have shown,
however, for our younger cohorts, as I just mentioned earlier, monetisation
may often not be necessary as their CPF savings in cash will itself
yield a stream of income in retirement. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a47a2477-8812-42c7-9453-59b16028a26d">
                  <a name="budget__id-a47a2477-8812-42c7-9453-59b16028a26d"><!--a--></a>Plus, our low-income workers,
they get Workfare Income Supplement (WIS). For a low-income worker
who starts off at, say, $1,200 a month, WIS will raise his CPF savings by
about $35,000 by the time he reaches 65. Not a small sum. So the
Housing Grants plus the WIS are actually major boosts to the retirement
savings of the lower income group. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-94c9f68f-5053-4e54-8ee3-6105b2a9f821">
                  <a name="budget__id-94c9f68f-5053-4e54-8ee3-6105b2a9f821"><!--a--></a>One of our tasks in MOM,
as we go forward, therefore, is to ensure that most low-wage workers
are in the CPF system. If they are in casual jobs and not receiving
CPF from their employers as they should, they lose out on many things.
They lose out on Workfare and they lose on the various other Government
top-ups that come from time to time. And when we add it all up,
it is a fair bit. So, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Hawazi Daipi will
talk about this later. We are stepping up both our enforcement and
promotion efforts to ensure compliance with the CPF Act.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4c8ebc8b-4627-42eb-934c-a004d962d9ad">
                  <a name="budget__id-4c8ebc8b-4627-42eb-934c-a004d962d9ad"><!--a--></a>Next, the current generation of elderly,
which is all among us – Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, Mr Zainudin Nordin, Mr
Seng Han Thong and Mrs Lina Chiam had raised this issue. The CPF
balances of our older Singaporeans are much lower than what we will
see in future generations. There are several reasons.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1903</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-781675a2-a167-48a8-971a-a8a192c6eac5">
                  <a name="budget__id-781675a2-a167-48a8-971a-a8a192c6eac5"><!--a--></a>First, wages were much
lower 20 to 30 years ago. Amongst the women, it was not just wages
being low, but labour force participation was far lower. Many of
us will remember what it was like in those days.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1e96a20b-43d6-4616-8b85-7ca196f0c407">
                  <a name="budget__id-1e96a20b-43d6-4616-8b85-7ca196f0c407"><!--a--></a>Second – and this is a
very important factor – our older Singaporeans invested a larger
proportion of their CPF savings in their homes. The withdrawal rules
were different in those days. For much of their working lives, 80%
or so of their CPF contributions could be used for housing, and
many used them. We have moderated this since so that now less than
two-thirds can be used for housing so that we can provide more for
retirement and healthcare needs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e0a347ed-890b-43c9-b8f7-9335ab2aeab6">
                  <a name="budget__id-e0a347ed-890b-43c9-b8f7-9335ab2aeab6"><!--a--></a>Third, our older Singaporeans
were in the past not required to set aside as much savings in their
CPF accounts when they turned 55. A person turning 65 this year
would have had to set aside only $70,000 as his Minimum Sum, a big
difference from the prevailing Minimum Sum of $131,000. And for
those who did not meet their Minimum Sum, which would have been
the majority of members of that generation, they were still allowed
to withdraw at least half of their CPF balances in cash at age 55
under the 50% withdrawal rule. In other words, even if they did
not meet the Minimum Sum, they were allowed to withdraw half of
it under the old rules. Some of our older members, those aged 72
and beyond this year, were able to withdraw all of their CPF balances
by pledging their property. So the rules were quite different in
those days. For all these reasons, the amount of savings retained
in the CPF accounts of older Singaporeans is low.</p>

helped this generation of older Singaporeans to own their homes,
and most have fully paid up their housing loans. They therefore
have substantial CPF savings locked up in their homes. This is why
we want to give them more support to unlock the savings in their
homes and supplement their retirement income, not just to get the
one-off large lump sum but to supplement their income throughout
life, through to the end of their lives. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-48770d1f-fdaf-4b71-8203-4899cd7155bb">
                  <a name="budget__id-48770d1f-fdaf-4b71-8203-4899cd7155bb"><!--a--></a>Some retirees rent out
a spare room, especially after the children have moved out. It is
a very useful form of income. That is one way in which you monetise
the value of the home. To add to their options, we have introduced,
as I mentioned in the Budget Statement and as we have debated, the
Silver Housing Bonus (SHB) and we have enhanced the Lease Buyback
Scheme. MND is also building more studio apartments, many of them
in mature housing estates and, at the same time, introducing the
new Ageing-in-Place Priority Scheme so that the elderly can live
near their family and friends. </p>

do not need to take advantage of these schemes. Two-thirds of those
aged 65 and above, in fact, receive a monthly allowance from their
family. The family
is quite happy that they keep the home; they want the asset to be
there, continue to appreciate in value and the family provides them
a monthly allowance. That is quite common. And many also receive
other forms of support in the community or sometimes through Government
transfers, especially for the lower income group. But as our society
ages, we must be prepared. The need for different ways to convert savings
in the home into retirement income will grow. That is why the Silver
Housing Bonus and enhanced Lease Buyback Scheme are important.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1904</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cb5f59cb-0c41-42ee-8b6a-2f8a890d3ab8">
                  <a name="budget__id-cb5f59cb-0c41-42ee-8b6a-2f8a890d3ab8"><!--a--></a>On the question of older
women in their retirement, in fact, Senior Minister of State Grace
Fu has raised this in the Budget debate and Mrs Lina Chiam has just
raised it as well. The Silver Housing Bonus, in fact, will help
older women significantly. For retiree couples where the husband
had worked and the wife was either a homemaker or worked for short
periods, moving from a 3- or 4-room flat to a studio apartment will
provide a significant boost to their CPF LIFE payouts. If the husband
was a median income earner, let us say, if you look at the wage
profile of median income earners in the past, it was not very high.
If the husband was a median income earner, his RA balances would typically
have been slightly above half of the Minimum Sum. Therefore, when
they take advantage of the Silver Housing Bonus Scheme, because
his RA balances already above half of the Minimum Sum, he would
be able to take substantial cash proceeds out, besides getting higher
CPF LIFE payouts. So they move to a smaller flat, put some money
into the CPF to reach the Minimum Sum, but still a substantial amount
of cash comes out, and they get significantly higher CPF LIFE payouts
for the rest of their lives. So, the husband and wife benefit.</p>

– this is an important point – family support, particularly within
the immediate family. For instance, the Minimum Sum Topping-Up scheme provides
tax incentives for members who top up the CPF of their wives and
mothers. The number of top-ups today is not large, but we are thinking
of ways to improve and simplify the current schemes to encourage
more top-ups. </p>

solve the problem for widowed homemakers with little savings, or
poor elderly couples who do not own a home, for example, the case
that Mr Yeo Guat Kwang mentioned. For these groups, we must help
them in other ways, through ComCare which we have expanded by providing
rental flats, which MND is building more of, and by partnership
with the community, which we are also doing more of and also finding
more ways of supporting the community as it gets involved. So, that is
a very important area of work for those whom the CPF scheme cannot
serve their needs – widowed homemakers or those who are very poor
and cannot afford a home, not a large group, but an important group
– we have to find other ways to help them, and we will.</p>

issue of returns on CPF monies. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had asked about
this. We have to take a long-term perspective on CPF returns. In
fact, over the long term, CPF interest rates have provided reasonable
returns, on top of inflation. Over the last 10 years, for example,
the return on the Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts (SMRA
accounts), after accounting for inflation, was 2.5% per year. Over
the last 20 years, it was 2.2% per year, real returns, after accounting
for inflation. This was despite the extra 1% interest on the first
$60,000 which we introduced only in 2008, despite this starting
only in 2008, when you look at the last 20 years, the average real returns
is still 2.2%. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-0cea3ed5-9945-46e8-ab79-2b6f59f0fae4"><!--a--></a>If you look forward now, the compounding
effect of this extra 1% interest, on top of market determined long-term
bond rates will, over the long run, help to shore up members' CPF
savings, especially for those in the lower income group who benefit
most from this extra 1% interest. Current interest rates are very
low, because of extremely easy monetary policies of the US. This
may persist for another two years or so, but few people expect such
low interest rates to stretch over the longer term. </p>

mind, as I mentioned earlier, that a large proportion of CPF savings
of Singaporeans is, in fact, invested in housing, which is a hedge
against inflation. </p>

median earner considers the rate of return on his total CPF savings
– comprising not only what he still has in his CPF balances but
what he took out and put into the home, the CPF savings component
of the home – if he adds it all up and computes the total return
on his CPF savings, it would have been about 6%-8%, or in real terms,
4%-6% per year, on average, until he reaches 55. </p>

he gets from CPF LIFE, he can choose to realise some of the gains
he has accumulated in his property through the various ways I discussed earlier,

Coming out of retirement stream of income, you still have to pay
rental cost. </p>

our CPF system regularly to ensure it meets Singaporeans' needs,

response, which has to do with CPF LIFE.</p>

year for the CPF. From 1 January next year, the majority of members

Members with balances of above $40,000 in their Retirement Accounts
will be automatically included in CPF LIFE, while those with lower

enhancement. The current Minimum Sum Scheme provides payouts for
a limited period – slightly more than 20 years. In contrast, CPF
LIFE provides Singaporeans with an income for life, doing away with
the worry that savings may suddenly run out towards the end of their
lives. </p>

who are aged 65 today, about half of them are expected to live beyond
85, and one-third are expected to live beyond 90. We have to keep
reminding ourselves of that – one-third of the group, that is, 65
today, is expected to live beyond 90. Future cohorts of those who
will reach 65, including those who are going to reach 55 in the
next few years, will live even longer. That one-third figure is
going to get larger. So, more and more retirees will outlive their
CPF savings if they were on the Minimum Sum Scheme. CPF LIFE is
therefore an important and timely evolution of the Minimum Sum Scheme. </p>

about CPF LIFE. Some people think the Government introduced CPF
LIFE to hold on to their money for life. You can read about this
rather easily, by the way. Actually, all it means is that you get
paid for life under CPF LIFE,
instead of for about 20 years under the Minimum Sum Scheme. CPF
LIFE does not change how much you can withdraw from the CPF in cash,
and it does not change how your savings in other CPF accounts can
be used. </p>

is that some people believe you will end up losing your CPF savings
if you do not live long enough under this new pooled insurance scheme.
If you do not live long enough, you are unlucky, you will lose your
CPF savings. But this is not the case because when you are on CPF
LIFE, you will leave a bequest. The bequest goes to your loved ones,
not to other CPF members, and not to the Government certainly. You
will get all of your capital back, either through your monthly payouts,
or in a bequest that you leave to your family and loved ones. </p>

operating CPF LIFE since late 2009, when members above 55 were able
to opt into the scheme. This was an opt-in phase in the last two years.
About 73,000 members, in fact ,signed up for CPF LIFE – not large
compared to the total number of eligible members we have, but this
73,000 is already equivalent to the total number of private annuities
in force today. We did not market CPF LIFE aggressively during this
opt-in phase. </p>

for a breakdown of the various plans that members have opted for.
Members could choose from four plans – Plus, Balanced, Basic and
Income plans – different levels of bequest and different levels
of payouts. The higher the payout, the lower the bequest. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-507e91ca-33ed-4ae5-8967-45d7c461ae97">
                  <a name="budget__id-507e91ca-33ed-4ae5-8967-45d7c461ae97"><!--a--></a>The most popular plans
were the Plus and the Balanced Plans, with nearly 90% of members
opt-in for either plan. They preferred the features of these two
plans – relatively high monthly payouts, but also a bequest. The
least popular plan was the Income Plan which does not offer a bequest.
In fact, only 3% of this group of 73,000 opted for the Income Plan. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-06562a73-b0c1-4af3-b4c8-0f9c9e73f68a">

and relates to Mr Seng Han Thong's question, we also received feedback
during this very useful opt-in phase that members had to put significant
effort into understanding and choosing from amongst these four plans.
But the payouts between the plans were not so significantly different,
as Mr Seng Han Thong more vividly expressed. For instance, the difference
in payouts between our two most popular plans – the Plus and the
Balanced Plans – is only about 4% on average, the difference in
payouts, or about $30 at the projected median balance in 2013 of
$90,000. </p>

and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang had asked what enhancements we might make
to the current scheme. Learning from our experience during this
opt-in phase, we will make CPF LIFE simpler, starting with the first
cohort next year. We will refine the scheme so as to bring the number
of CPF LIFE plans down from four to two. It will provide simplicity,
but retain the best features of the existing plans. </p>

the features of the Plus and Balanced Plans. These were the two
popular options. We combine the features of these two plans into
a new option called the Standard Plan. The Standard Plan will also
serve as the default plan – the plan that will automatically include
members if they do not make a choice. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-18568343-af07-4738-a7b4-534c15531cff">

Plan, which was previously treated as the default plan during the
opt-in phase, the new Standard Plan will provide slightly higher
payouts. The payouts for the Standard Plan will be very close to
the previous Plus Plan. However, members on the Standard Plan will retain
the flexibility to use their Retirement Account monies for housing
between 55 and 65, just as the previous Balanced Plan allowed. So it
borrows from the flexibility feature of the Balanced Plan, and you
could use your money for housing until 65 with the slightly higher
payouts for the Plus Plan.</p>

remove the Income Plan. It had not been popular. This is the Plan
which offered no bequest. It had not been popular, as I mentioned,
only 3% of members chose it. There is also a drawback of the Income
Plan, in that members may choose the plan without careful consideration
and regret their choice later. </p>

opt-in phase, the CPF Board wrote to the members who had signed
up for the Income Plan to confirm their choice, highlighting once
again that it did not offer a bequest. About 30% of them who had
chosen the Income Plan thought again about it and changed their
minds. </p>

feels he is making the right decision at the time, first, people change
their minds; second, even if he feels he is making the right decision
at the time, family circumstances can change. That is a reality
we are all familiar with. For example, a member who may have been
estranged from his child or spouse, but subsequently be reconciled,
may prefer to have made a bequest. </p>

this no-bequest feature is that you lose all of your savings to
the LIFE fund if you pass away not long after you join the Income
Plan at age 55. And even if you pass away later but soon after age
65, you lose most of your savings, and your family gets no bequest.
It is natural that the next-of-kin will be most unhappy in such
a scenario, when the member unfortunately passes away early. After
careful consideration, therefore, we decided that as part of the
simplification of CPF LIFE in our effort to reduce the number of
plans, we will remove this no-bequest Income Plan. </p>

LIFE will therefore comprise just two simple choices – the Standard
Plan, which you see there on the left [<em class="ph i">indicating</em>], which
will serve as the default plan, and the current Basic Plan, which
will remain unchanged. These two plans provide a meaningful choice
for members. The Standard Plan will meet the needs of most members,
slightly higher payout but still they get a bequest. It will also
give members flexibility to use their Retirement Account monies
for housing until age 65 years. The Basic Plan will continue to
cater to members who prefer a higher bequest and are willing to
accept slightly lower monthly payouts. They will also have the flexibility
of using the monies for housing even after age 65. </p>

LIFE when they turn 55 next year, the transition will be a smooth
one. We already have the Minimum Sum Scheme that everyone is used
to. Monthly payouts begin after the draw-down age of 65, and a bequest
for members' beneficiaries upon their demise is also part of the
Minimum Sum Scheme. So, those are existing features of the Minimum
Sum Scheme. You get a monthly payout after age 65 and there is a
bequest upon your demise. This will continue under CPF LIFE. What
CPF LIFE does is to extend the Minimum Sum Scheme for life with
minimal reduction in monthly payouts. So, we have a scheme that
everyone is familiar with, it will continue but CPF LIFE will extend the Minimum Sum
Scheme for life with minimal reduction in monthly payouts.</p>

CPF member who has $90,000 in his Retirement Account at age 55.
Ninety thousand dollars is the median Retirement Account balance
for active members in this cohort. If he were under the Standard
Plan, the default plan, his monthly payouts will be only 2% lower
than what it would have been under the Minimum Sum scheme, but he
will get payouts for life. He has no risk of finding that if he
lives long, fortunately, but suddenly the money runs out – no risk
of that. </p>

the CPF LIFE scheme. Members will have income for life and for those
who are needy, who have other needs, such as severe medical needs which
may crop up for some as they get older, we have to help them through
other schemes, which I have detailed in the Budget Statement and
which are in many of our existing Government policies which we will

change that we are making, a related change also to help raise CPF
LIFE payouts in retirement. As Singaporeans work longer, CPF contributions made
after age 55 will become an increasingly significant component of
their retirement savings. The increase in older workers' CPF contribution
rates will further reinforce this. Members would expect that these
additional contributions after age 55 should translate into higher
monthly payouts once they reach their drawdown age at age 65, and rightfully
so. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-095ee2e9-9388-4b44-9fd6-d5faa8fa482d">

when a member reaches 65, we will automatically transfer his Ordinary
and Special Account monies into the Retirement Account, up to the
cohort Minimum Sum. This is similar to what is currently performed
at age 55. We will do it as well at age 65 because there have been
contributions between 55 and 65 and this is going to become increasingly
important in the years to come. </p>

how much a member can withdraw in cash from their CPF accounts.
Without this new arrangement, the balances may remain untapped in
the Ordinary Account and Special Account until the member's demise,
unless the member activates a transfer himself. His OA balances
would also earn lower interest rates under that arrangement. The
change is a helpful one. It will help raise payouts, ensure that everything
is swept into the Retirement Account so members can enjoy higher
payouts for life.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
in the current competitive globalised world and uncertain economic
conditions, my belief is that we need to continuously strengthen
our workforce and build resilience in them. That is one sure way
to ensure that our economy can remain competitive and our workers
can remain relevant to the fast changing industrial landscape. Thus,
I am glad that our Government is investing in our workers' training
through the strategic CET Master Plan. Sir, these resources for
our workers will be very important and I am confident that we will
benefit from it in the long term</p>

the good infrastructure like the CET campuses and more, I would
like to ask the Minister to update the House on the progress of
the CET Master Plan. Are we providing more resources and support
for training and the re-training of our workers, especially the
low-wage workers and older workers?</p>

standards set up by WDA and the tripartite partners are getting
good recognition by industries and industrial practitioners. Are
our workers more employable after attending the WSQ courses and

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Tan Su Shan (Nominated Member)</strong>
                  </span>:
Sir, the current Budget seeks to reduce our overall reliance on
foreign workers and to cultivate better jobs for all Singaporeans. Yet,
a recent <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> article cited an MOM report as
noting that two-thirds of jobs created in 2011 went to foreigners,
that is, only one-third went to "locals". And, incidentally, the
term "locals" somehow includes Singaporeans and PRs. So Singaporean
citizens had fewer than one-third of the jobs created, while having
to deal with the problems of overstressed domestic resources.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a3a828ba-d70c-498f-b5e8-6ddadfdd2bc9">
                  <a name="budget__id-a3a828ba-d70c-498f-b5e8-6ddadfdd2bc9"><!--a--></a>With that, Sir, I have
three questions and one suggestion point to make. The three questions
I have are geared towards asking the Ministry for more clarity on
their definitions and also more clarity on how Singaporeans are
benefiting from these jobs. The suggestion point I have is to see
how we can be more effective in encouraging more women back to the
workforce. Let us begin with the three clarifying questions.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4e4abf35-22c5-45fa-a25a-3665354ac4cd">
                  <a name="budget__id-4e4abf35-22c5-45fa-a25a-3665354ac4cd"><!--a--></a> Firstly, why is it that
most MOM statistics, with the exception of the unemployment rate,
co-mingle Singaporeans and PRs in the segment termed "locals"? This
can be misleading, as the official statistics show how well the
locals are doing on the job front, but does not differentiate between
Singaporeans and PRs.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a208d539-e2ff-4261-aeab-363427c4b401">
                  <a name="budget__id-a208d539-e2ff-4261-aeab-363427c4b401"><!--a--></a>Secondly, what is the
distribution of new jobs created in each of the past 10 years amongst
Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners in each segment?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-42eda25c-9814-4a61-9e39-ff910a87eef9">
                  <a name="budget__id-42eda25c-9814-4a61-9e39-ff910a87eef9"><!--a--></a>To have a sense of the
extent that new job creation benefits Singaporeans, it will be good
to know how many jobs have gone to Singaporeans alone, and the percentage
that represents. The add-on to that question is what percentage
of total pay flows to Singaporeans in each of the last 10 years?
This enables us to have a sense of whether Singaporeans have a fair
share in the high-paying jobs created.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7978cda7-ed32-4f3d-b08e-7bcb1ece8aa6">
                  <a name="budget__id-7978cda7-ed32-4f3d-b08e-7bcb1ece8aa6"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, in 2011, our
resident unemployment rate was 2.9%. This was higher than our overall
unemployment rate of 2%. How would our situation look if we combine
the current or projected structural unemployment of Singaporeans?
There is definitely enough evidence on the ground that PMETs in
their 40s and 50s are finding it hard to be re-employed, even with
significant pay cuts.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3cb7b0c6-e32c-438b-b98f-dd039f1155a5">
                  <a name="budget__id-3cb7b0c6-e32c-438b-b98f-dd039f1155a5"><!--a--></a>There was a recent <em class="ph i">Channel
News Asia</em> programme dated 27 February and a report on CDC donations
that revealed that in 2011, 27,300 residents had employment and training
assistance. However, only 10,800 found jobs. Should we take this
to mean that the job placement success rate was only 39.5%? If not,
what is a more accurate way to interpret this information?</p>

attempt to do is to understand the basis of our official unemployment
rate calculation, and help reconcile official numbers with ground experience.</p>

the suggestion to get more women back to the workforce. It is a
good one. And the latest statistics are very encouraging. In 2010,
the numbers showed that 71.2% of the women aged between 25 and 64
are working, up from 69.4% in 2009. But for older women, aged 55
to 64, the figure is still very low at 43.4%. The good news – there is plenty
of help available to help younger working women get back to work.
From the "Back to Work" and flexi-work programmes started by Government agencies,
to websites like Careermums.com to Mums@work to the newly formed WEWAM
– it is a nice name! WEWAM. It stands for Women Empowered for Work
and Mothering – there seems to be plenty of outreach programmes. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-030cdd1f-c49d-471f-8054-cbb10422b5a3"><!--a--></a>What this House and the
Ministry perhaps should know is that there are also many women's
groups and associations who have stepped up to help. These groups
tend to be sector based, and one such example, if I may, is the
Financial Women's Association, which has helped women in finance
who lost their jobs during the Lehman crisis, find new jobs, and
which is still championing the networking of women who wish to return back
to work in the financial sector. The Singapore Council of Women's
Association has also successfully pioneered the Women's Register
to mentor women needing help in the workplace. However, these many
outreach programmes need support in order to succeed, especially
to reaching out to the women who need help, and especially for older
women who may not be that Internet savvy. These women's groups are
run by full-time working mothers like me who have limited time and
resources and, hence, in order for them to be more effective, they
need funding, administrative and execution support for their various
initiatives. They will also need some time and some help in advertising some
of their good work that they can do, in order to reach out to a
wider audience and in order to place more women in the right sector
and in the right jobs. So, my suggestion is – may the Ministry provide
some umbrella support to these various women's groups and to help
link women looking for job with the right association and the right
channels that are already available?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
the Government's commitment to reduce the number of foreign workers
at the S Pass and the Work Permit levels in Singapore received largely
positive support by many Singaporeans. However, many professionals are
concerned that the Government has not sent similar signals for the
Employment Pass (EP) segment which concerns PMETs and professional
jobs that Singaporeans hope to be given more opportunities to prove
themselves in the face of competition.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fbe998d5-2946-4383-b2b1-af9bfaf23cfe">
                  <a name="budget__id-fbe998d5-2946-4383-b2b1-af9bfaf23cfe"><!--a--></a>I believe most PMETs are
prepared to face foreign competition and recognise the value and
the foreign expertise if they are better qualified and have the
expertise to offer that locals are not able to provide. Can MOM
share what is the rate of tightening of EP categories compared to
S Pass and Work Permit categories? Has the MOM conducted studies
on capability or experience gaps of Singaporean PMETs and how they
can maximise job opportunities at this level, as in a globalised
economy it may not be practical or realistic to lock in all professional
employment to Singaporeans? But can we adopt a policy whereby employers
should justify what if Singaporeans cannot fulfil the role, or one
who is currently employed within a company cannot be groomed into
the role before a foreign professional is recruited if their competency
levels especially are similar?</p>

PMETs can take leadership and management positions and how the Government
can help at this level? There are many foreigners heading our local
companies, including banks and public-listed companies. Can these
leadership positions otherwise have been filled by local PMETs with
the right competency, skills and experience? In our small market,
our local PMETs sometimes like the exposure and the opportunity
to run large-scale business units or projects. Thus, how can we
help our level PMET workforce overcome this inherent weakness?</p>

PMETs, according to a Labour Force report of 2011, are "most receptive"
and "active in training". On average, PMETs' participation rate
in training is about 6.8 days a year in 2011. Can the Government
do more to help PMETs with training and job facilitation as they
have specific needs which may not have been fully met under our
current CET framework?</p>

ask if there are measures to help middle-aged or older PMETs – with
Singapore's economy facing more challenges in the upcoming years,
it is more likely that middle-aged PMETs will lose their jobs with
the structural changes in the economy – and how this group will
be given more assistance by the Government.</p>

is a welcome move, thanks to the Finance Minister. This gives assistance
to older workers up to 65 years of age and those earning $4,000
a month. But many PMETs are earning above $4,000 a month. In fact,
we have seen more of them earning more than $4,000 substantially
since 2011. Can the SEC help our older PMETs and can we extend the
age limit to above 65 years old since the Government encourages
lifelong employability?</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-bb11b26b-d6b7-436c-9d77-25fa8c5c8bc2"><!--a--></a>These are some of the
concerns. I would like to just focus on a few as I have highlighted
the others during the Budget debate. Firstly, we need to have a
better and deeper appreciation of the issues, challenges and opportunities
facing PMEs. For a start, we need to know potential PME jobs within
the intermediate term. Our current students and future PMEs are
particularly concerned about their future job prospects. For example,
in the latest NTU Career Fair in February 2012, it is widely reported
that the number of job vacancies had dropped from 4,500 to 3,000.
I believe for many of them securing a job first may be all that
matters. All PME segments in whichever life stage would also like
to understand where the future growth sectors are and whether the remuneration
will commensurate with the investment of time and efforts in the
area of discipline
that they have taken on for their education, continuing education
and work experiences.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1913</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3e5f02e5-a7be-40ca-9939-d302bc6736e2">
                  <a name="budget__id-3e5f02e5-a7be-40ca-9939-d302bc6736e2"><!--a--></a>By the same token, the
issues and challenges facing PMEs are varied and sometimes complex.
It is therefore appropriate we set up a PME taskforce to examine
the specific concerns and issues involving and concerning PMEs and
possibly at a tripartite level especially for issues revolving around
unemployment, employment, under-employment and employability.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d1c8ce80-4c3f-431b-8c25-01cd2cdfdffc">
                  <a name="budget__id-d1c8ce80-4c3f-431b-8c25-01cd2cdfdffc"><!--a--></a>On the vulnerability of
older PMEs, those above 40 years of age, what can we do to help
"future-proof" their jobs? I foresee that more and more of them
will be affected by layoffs during restructuring exercises. They
may have top qualifications such as Masters or even First Class
Honours. Nonetheless, once retrenched, they take a long time to
find the next job. It is not uncommon that they will take at least
half a year to one year to do so. Some are forced to go overseas
to look for greener pastures whilst others have to take on significantly
lower-skilled jobs or embark on a freelance career. Speaking to some
of these PMEs online and offline, we should not just look at the
employment of these PMEs but also the quality and pay of their new
jobs. The current approach to scaling up career fairs for PMEs is
but one approach. I feel we should also try to change the perception
of employers about older PMEs. I would like to therefore propose
a three-pronged pre-emptive approach to disprove such a perception
that older PMEs are not as valuable – namely, conversion, placement
and employee-cum-employer education.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6f7181fa-9ba0-4ae2-8e9b-21e7ec17047e">
                  <a name="budget__id-6f7181fa-9ba0-4ae2-8e9b-21e7ec17047e"><!--a--></a>On conversion, the Government
can first work with the private sector by promoting better career
mobility through different tracks for PMEs. For companies who are prepared
to hire PMEs from a different industry, there has to be greater
funding for a career conversion programme in terms of both training
and wages on a once-off basis. We should embark on a drive to get
our employers to support this programme. On placement, the public
sector should lead by example in setting a better rate in hiring PMEs
who are aged 40 and above. The current rate is about 1,200 per year
which is about 9% of new hires. To signify a change in paradigm,
I feel the public sector should take the lead and raise this hiring
percentage and perhaps even raise it higher during times of economic
uncertainties. On employer and employee education, we should promote
the hiring of older PMEs, investigate any discriminatory practices
and provide a formal mechanism for the aggrieved to seek redress,
and older PMEs should be equipped with the knowledge of the employment
landscape and opportunities.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-a98076c5-148b-47dc-afd9-69d2aa092bc3"><!--a--></a>I would like to seek further
clarifications on how a better link for our Continuing Education
and Training and Skills Training for Excellence Programme, the CET
and STEP systems, can correspond to the life stages of a PME. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ed502ce1-9805-4890-a99b-df01a3161db2">
                  <a name="budget__id-ed502ce1-9805-4890-a99b-df01a3161db2"><!--a--></a>First, when a typical
Polytechnic or University graduate seeks to land his or her first job,
their concerns will be usually on the pay, career prospects and
development of their job. I mention job and not career as the former
is defined by a financial need which is understandable as the graduates
need to pay off their study loans. Our current approach is to provide
the maximum catchment of prospective employers for the graduates
to embark on their first job. I would therefore like to suggest
a closer collaboration between the educational institutions and
WDA on a more proactive approach. This can be a start to map out
the career needs and history of the individual PME. The State's
involvement in this is important as prospective employers can have
access to a ready pool of PMEs with different expertise for the
various vacancies. From the PMEs' perspective, they can have a more detailed
understanding of the employers they are working for since this is a
national database. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1914</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-033aa20e-35bf-4a5b-a354-f24f871377bf">
                  <a name="budget__id-033aa20e-35bf-4a5b-a354-f24f871377bf"><!--a--></a>Second, continuing with
the life stage, after five to 10 years of working, the individual PME
may have at least one or two job switches. He or she may have a
clearer sense of the longer- term career that they want to be involved
in and the particular industry they want to be in. We ought to find
a mechanism to capture this information as well on a participation
basis by the PMEs. This is important as it will help to cut down
on funds invested into unnecessary training, studying or skills
upgrading if there is a clear job profile that the PME is going
for. There has to be a clearer link to the qualifications obtained,
how it has helped to raise productivity and thereby leading to a
real wage increase. Coupled with other life stage needs at this
time such as setting up a family, our PMEs need a national training
infrastructure to be future-ready. Many years ago you could learn
something in school and use it for the rest of your life. This has
changed. The entire landscape has changed. Previously, we used to
learn, work and then retire. Now it will be: learn, work, learn,
work, learn, work and then retire. Second-skilling is now ever more
crucial to ensure employability especially during uncertain times.
In order to motivate the individual to take a larger interest in
his or her own skills and capabilities, I would also like to urge
the Government to study the successful lifelong learning models
in Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Sweden. This is in
terms of how public spending in adult education can help to enhance
the creativity and innovation of our workforce, adding value to
them and helping them to raise their pay. I further suggest that
whatever amount the individual has invested into his or her upgrading should
be eligible for tax relief as well and that the current tax relief
limits should be reviewed. Similarly, there also ought to be a tighter
framework and subvention for students and adult learners who are
enrolled in private universities. Can we consider establishing even
more adult education colleges so that our PMEs can undertake study sabbaticals
if needed and supported by the employers? </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-140f4a8b-9154-488d-9189-b94c1d8e7529"><!--a--></a>In the third life stage,
where our PMEs are 40 years old and above and have their own families,
future proofing their jobs becomes a top priority. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e9670b04-e84b-4935-b8bd-f4def15b4449">
                  <a name="budget__id-e9670b04-e84b-4935-b8bd-f4def15b4449"><!--a--></a>To sum up on the three
life stages that I have outlined, I hope to see the Government play
an even bigger role to support PMEs in their career development
beyond what we see today. Are there plans to set up a national PME
jobs databank? For our local PMEs, I have mooted previously for
a PME Capability Development Fund. There is an entire train of activities
in enhancing the employment and employability of PMEs. It is not merely
placing them in a job but in the right job. Before we land them
a job, there is a need for proper career counselling and even professional
coaching. Some PMEs I spoke to said all they need is for us to connect
them with prospective hirers and they are more than able to do the
rest. Unlike traditional job fairs utilising a one-to-many approach, PMEs
will require one-to-one or one-to-a-few approach as the types and
range of PME jobs, requisite capabilities and development opportunities
are extremely diverse and vacancies are mostly one to a few in a
single company. Efforts needed are thus more extensive. Are we able
to develop new capabilities to train, equip, re-design, counsel, coach,
place, retain, and nurture our PMEs? Resources required are going
to be huge. This PME Capability Development Fund can well be for
the tripartite partners to tap on to train and equip PMEs including
second-skilling them and also rolling out initiatives and programmes
identified by the PME taskforce. There is also the possibility of
setting up a "one-stop shop" to meet and serve the needs of PMEs.
It could well be a comprehensive resource portal for PMEs with updated
information and pointers and also
link to job search engines including coaching and pre- and post-job
placement career counselling.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-d60c7039-34b2-4e62-8ea2-735787634c14"><!--a--></a>In continuing the theme
on PMEs, my final area of concern is with regard to strengthening
measures to help female PMEs cope better with the challenges of managing
their careers and raising their families. The lack of family-friendly
work practices and flexible work arrangements is forcing many women
to delay starting their families or, even worse, give up their careers.
May I ask the Minister what more could be done to introduce a more
conducive working environment for back-to-work women, in particular,
female PMEs who wish to re-join the workforce after an extended
period away from work? Without flexible work arrangements, it would
be difficult to encourage our families to have more children. I
am aware MCYS is aggressively developing our childcare services
and providing support from various angles. However, we also need
to get employers to provide better work-life balance as this is
critical to support women with families.</p>

Mr Chairman, unlike the US and many of the economies in Europe,
Singapore has had economic growth, a strong job creation and low
unemployment. This is an enviable position to be in. Singapore must
continue to have quality jobs so that Singaporeans will continue
to have good job opportunities and real wage growth.</p>

for Singaporeans in the workforce is set to improve as the younger
cohorts entering the workforce are better educated. Residents employed

those with diploma and professional qualifications, the share is
47%. Close to 52% of residents employed in 2011 were in professional,
managerial, executive and technical jobs. Resident unemployment is
also low in 2011.</p>

of skills and profile of our resident labour force, we must ensure
that we continue to have good career prospects for PMETs as they
form a large portion of our labour force. Singapore continues to
be an attractive base for companies to locate their regional and
hub operations. This creates good job opportunities, especially
higher-end PME jobs. While we need to maintain Singapore as an attractive and
open market for talent, can the Ministry share what strategies are
there to incentivise companies based in Singapore to ensure development
of local PMEs and skills transfer to build a strong and relevant
local talent base for higher-end jobs? What placement help is also
given to help PMEs who have been displaced, especially in the later
part of their careers?</p>

change, as they move higher into the higher end of the PME roles.

what measures are there in place to ensure that relevant skills are

cognisant of as we look at having PME jobs for Singaporeans, is
that Singaporeans also have the opportunity to get out of Singapore.
The PMEs in Singapore actually have opportunities and continue to
have opportunities. One of the things we must do is to ensure that
we do not lose that talent base as well and therefore it is imperative
that we continue to look at how we can keep our local PMEs in the
high-end jobs.</p>

Speaker, Sir, firstly I would like to declare that I am the President
of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (SCCCI),
and Managing Director of Pacific International Lines. Last Thursday,
Deputy Prime Minister Tharman said in Parliament that Government
will go out of its way to reach out to SMEs, via working with the
business associations, Enterprise Development Centres, and CDCs. This
is to ensure that SMEs could benefit from all assistance schemes.
At the same time, the Government would be making more land available
under the Government Land Sales Programme to help reduce rental
overheads. It has also declared exercising greater flexibility in
the foreign worker policy. This move has my wholehearted support.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9341468d-899e-4137-ad48-b19a213e7a9c">
                  <a name="budget__id-9341468d-899e-4137-ad48-b19a213e7a9c"><!--a--></a>On raising productivity,
I feel that effective communication and timely policy adjustments
would enable the Government and businesses to work together to address business
challenges. This is indeed the objective of our active participation
in the Budget debate. I take this opportunity to share what we have
encountered when promoting various government assistance schemes.
In 2006, SCCCI set up the Enterprise Development Centre with the
support of SPRING Singapore. Over these five years, we discovered
this common problem. Start-ups and "micro companies", like HDB neighbourhood
shops and shops in Chinatown, Little India and the Malay Village,
cannot meet the application criteria because they are simply too
small.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-510e7361-183a-46d9-8aea-dcb53106926f">
                  <a name="budget__id-510e7361-183a-46d9-8aea-dcb53106926f"><!--a--></a>EDC@SCCCI holds regular
briefings or workshops in Mandarin to explain Government policies
to businessmen. When our EDC staff make calls inviting them to participate
in these sessions, they get this standard response: "I don't need
to listen. In any case, our company is too small and can never qualify."
Going forward, Government and associations need to look into improving
the promotional outreach, and simplify the application procedures.
This is to ensure that more SMEs could really take good advantage
of these schemes. This is truly the challenge faced by the Chamber
and the government agencies. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman has
said, the Government is prepared to go out of its way to help the
SMEs, and hold their hands to help them improve productivity.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6896ffb9-2c0e-49fa-ac98-02c8ebb9ca98">
                  <a name="budget__id-6896ffb9-2c0e-49fa-ac98-02c8ebb9ca98"><!--a--></a>There is a Chinese saying:
"A capable man needs three helping hands to do a good job." Every
successful entrepreneur would go through an initial phase. He may
be full of ambition and passion. If he cannot find workers, he would
be fighting a lonely battle. At such a time, any solution would
be most encouraging and gratifying. Hence, I would like to suggest
broadening manpower sources and adjusting the management process
and remuneration for part-time workers. This would encourage students,
housewives and older individuals to re-enter the workforce by working
part-time. This would relieve the labour shortage for "micro companies"
and SMEs. This year, the Ministry of Manpower has relaxed the policy to allow foreign
spouses to apply for employment under the Long-term Social Visit
Pass-Plus. This move would also help to relieve the acute manpower shortage.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1917</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-50ffb30a-a3bf-427e-a6de-8a2189925dae">
                  <a name="budget__id-50ffb30a-a3bf-427e-a6de-8a2189925dae"><!--a--></a>One of the Chamber's members
has indicated that part-time workers prefer to be paid in cash upfront.
If we were to let go one foreign worker, the company needs to recruit two
or more part-time staff to fill the vacancy. If the Ministry of
Manpower could allow employers to pay part-time workers like housewives
in cash and waive CPF, these part-time workers could have more ready
cash. Employers could cut down on administrative work and this could
be one way of raising productivity. Thus, I hope the Ministry of Manpower
could consider relaxing the policy of CPF for part-time workers
to encourage more employers to recruit them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-80076054-cc95-4950-9fa4-58ae02fa113d">
                  <a name="budget__id-80076054-cc95-4950-9fa4-58ae02fa113d"><!--a--></a>My second point is on
Special Employment Credit (SEC). Engineers, professionals, managers
and other older middle-income workers would be affected by the economic restructuring.
Under the SEC, employers who employ older workers earning $3,000
or lower, could get 8% wage subsidy. For workers with a monthly
wage of between $3,000 and $4,000, the SEC would be lower. For those
earning more than $4,000, SEC would not apply. However, the older
workers who earn more than $4,000 are also the people whose service
companies would like to retain. Thus, I would suggest that the Government
raise the salary level for SEC, to include this group of middle
income workers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-97519a2d-c8c8-44c2-ada0-2580df621793">
                  <a name="budget__id-97519a2d-c8c8-44c2-ada0-2580df621793"><!--a--></a>Finally, I would like
to emphasise that foreign workers are an important component of
the Singapore labour force, and they have also made great contributions
to Singapore's economic development. Foreign workers are not cheap
labour. They take up jobs in industries that most Singaporeans are
either unwilling to take up or unable to undertake. Hence, training
provided by companies should also be extended to foreign workers.
This would enable them to improve their skills and effectiveness,
and raise overall productivity.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
weaning the economy off foreign labour requires us to look inwards
to our existing pool of elderly workers, retirees and homemakers.
We share the view of the Finance Minister that many of our homemakers
in Singapore who retire early are willing to work either part-time
or full-time. We are a small nation, we are a small population.
It is imperative that we find ways to maximise our manpower needs to
meet the requirements of the economy to grow and to compete globally. </p>

employees in the workforce differ in abilities, desires and needs.
Hence, re-integrating them into the workforce may call for customised approaches
depending on their abilities and situations. Re-integrating the
retired professional versus integrating the production worker will
require a different approach. I would like to know what programmes
MOM has to encourage industries to re-design work processes to cater
to elderly workers and how successful these programmes have been.</p>

the workforce are another pool of human resource. However, attracting
them into the workforce has a different set of challenges. I would
also like to know what progress has been made in this area so far. </p>

the effectiveness of its programmes and what other strategies does the
Ministry have to further encourage these groups to go back to the

hours, I believe proximity to their home is another important factor
for them. The Government may want to relook at the land use and
usage of property in residential areas to allow some suitable industries
to be located within the residential zones. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, as we
reduce our dependence on foreign labour, getting Singaporeans to
fill these gaps becomes very critical. We still have a large proportion
of women who are not working but are contributing meaningfully to
their families. We noted that women with young children aged between
0 and 12 years old are more likely to quit the workforce to focus
on the development of their children.</p>

like Sweden, Finland and Norway, we do not have a double hump for
women's participation in the labour force. Our women leave their
jobs to take care of their children and many never return to the
workplace and thus resulted in a single hump. The longer the women
stay out of the workforce, the more challenging it will be for them
to return. Most employers also become more reluctant to employ them.
I think we should take the approach of prevention is better than
cure. </p>

become more educated and more are carving a niche for themselves
in their careers, they find themselves hard pressed because of the
lack of flexibility in how work is being done. If we are going to
call ourselves an inclusive society, then women should be given
the opportunity to work, have a family and be able to take care
of their loved ones while still having a career with progression
and decent pay. And the only way to do so is to ensure that we have
a culture that supports flexi-work in our workplace. </p>

me to share the case of Joanne that the NTUC's Women Back to Work
Programme has helped. She is 40 years old and she has one eight-year-old
child and a sickly father. She is a graduate working as a bank officer
earning some $3,000 a month. Joanne quit her banking job in 2005
when she found that she had to juggle between her young daughter,
who was one year old then, and her father who suffered a stroke. In 2007,
after nursing her father back to health, she decided to return to
the workforce. After trying for a year, she was very disheartened
that no employer was willing to consider her at all. Subsequently
for Joanne, she came across the NTUC Women's Development Secretariat
(WDS) who worked with enlightened employers who were mindful of
the gap. In October 2008, they finally secured a job for her with
a financial company as a deals executive. Today, I am glad to say
that she is still employed as a senior executive.</p>

Joanne that we helped, there are many more out there needing support,
especially our female PMEs. Besides the existing efforts that the Government
has made, I would like to ask the Ministry to consider the following:
(i) being the largest employer, to take the lead by creating more
flexi-work for women in the public sector; (ii) to consider some
forms of incentive or tax relief to help women who do not rely on
domestic help but very much dependent on nannies or their relatives for
child care help and support. And I think this will also continue
to encourage women to return to the workforce; (iii) I support the
call by Mr Ang Hin Kee to extend the Special Employment Credit to
employers to recruit back-to-work women in the workforce. I understand
the Minister's view, and we are not giving up and we are trying
again; (iv) to launch annually a nationwide "Flexible Work Arrangement
(FWA) Campaign" to generate more awareness as well as to encourage
companies to implement FWA in a more concerted way; (v) besides
offering flexi-works funding to companies, try to make it fit the
process of claim user-friendly and also make it more attractive
to tap on, with minimal restrictions and administrative procedures;
(vi) to adopt additional measures to support back-to-work PMEs who
face greater obstacles compared to the rank and file women as opportunities
are even more limited for them, including developing a database
of both the employers and the back-to-work PMEs to support job-matching efforts.</p>

I would like to ask the Government to make every attempt to encourage
our women to return to the workforce. They have gone through the
different challenges in life and are mature and responsible. I am
confident that most will be resilient to stand by their employers.
Especially during the tough time when the company is facing crisis,
you will see that women are like tea leaves – you will never know
their strength until they are in hot water. We will be there for

Sir, three areas of recommendations: First, on job re-designing

enforcing best sourcing and offering cash grants to the SMEs and

help transform these jobs. </p>

and Training (CET) for the Disabled. Sir, the typical workforce
in Singapore benefits from the structured CET that is rolled out
very well by MOM under the WDA since the last recession. The CET
programme for the able-bodied workforce has gone from strength to
strength with expanded offerings and target groups like the PMEs.
However, there is little attention or resources allocated to ensure that
the workforce comprising the disabled (PWDs) is continually trained
and can count on lifelong learning to ensure that their skills are
relevant and their employment sustained. If the CET issue is not
addressed, the Special Employment Credit for the disabled (PWDs)
will lose impact soon as their skills will become obsolete due to
a lack of lifelong structured training and development. I urge the
Ministry to provide headcounts, expertise and funds to form a CET
taskforce to work with key disability groups in Singapore to develop
a future-proof special-needs workforce.</p>

Career Management. Sir, the Government has expended millions of
dollars to ensure the Singapore workforce is relevant and can work
for as long as they wish to. I wish to highlight the need to inculcate
in all Singaporean workers, the PMEs especially, the ability to
retrenchment- and future-proof themselves through more proactive
career management on their own. Prevention is better than cure.
It is often too late and too traumatic to receive career counselling
only when one is retrenched or displaced, or about to be retrenched
or displaced. I urge the Ministry to take the lead in launching
bite-sized, multi-lingual training programmes delivered in the appropriate
media, to coach Singaporeans, especially the PMEs, how to proactively manage
their careers and make themselves retrenchment- and future-proof.</p>

Mr Chairman, thank you for allowing me to touch on issues pertaining
to the changing profile of our local workforce. Firstly, our local workforce
is ageing. According to the annual reports on labour force in Singapore,
about 18% of our workforce was more than 50 years old in 2001. In
2011, 10 years later, more than 30% was above 50 years old. The
median age of our workforce had also increased from 38 years old
in 2001 to 42 years old in 2011. In view of this, how can the Government
help companies to change the way they operate to take into account
the ageing workforce besides providing Special Employment Credit?</p>

our economy to be less reliant on foreign workers and seek expansion
in new growth areas, how do we ensure that our CET system can stay relevant
for the workers and employers? I understand that MOE is also pumping
more resources into CET. Thus, how does MOM plan to coordinate with
MOE in CET for better synergy?</p>

vocational training to Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). The desired
outcome is to get more PWDs to be employed so that they can also
contribute to the society. However, we cannot assume that the vocational training
for the PWDs will last them a lifetime. PWDs need CET like any other
workers. How can WDA or e2i help in this area?</p>

workers are of the view that their CPF should not be reduced just
because they hit the age of 50 while other workers, especially the

Special Employment Credit indeed made everyone happy as the credit
(8%) is adequate to cover the increase in mature workers' increased
CPF rate. This is a good case of tripartism at work. However, to
achieve the employment rate for older persons, aged 55 to 64, of
65% by year 2015, as the national target, the challenge of how to
match the skill gap between the jobs available and the mature workers
remains. We need the tripartite effort to resolve the issues at
the workplace and most of which is how flexible we are in work arrangements.</p>

instead of being inclined to ageism, we should look at ways of harnessing
the "intrinsic value" of the older workers? There are definitely
things which younger persons cannot do as well as the older persons.
For employers, may I suggest to embrace opportunities given by employers
to adopt new ways of applying the tacit knowledge which they possess?
And for the Government, that is most important, to provide funding
on training systems which facilitate such positive shift in employment
of older workers. So instead of looking at just basic employability
and vocational skills, there are soft skills which older persons
need to acquire before they can transit to new jobs.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr David Ong (Jurong)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
many Members of this House have spoken about the ageing population.
Yes, our population is ageing and the pattern of retirement is changing
rapidly in Singapore. People are increasingly coming to terms and understanding
the impact of living longer and the need to adequately prepare for
an extended period in retirement. These changes in demographics
represent a squeeze on those of working age, as well as on the Government,
as we look to provide retirement incomes and healthcare for the
ageing population. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9d3cd590-9662-4b90-973d-eef0b00dea63">
                  <a name="budget__id-9d3cd590-9662-4b90-973d-eef0b00dea63"><!--a--></a>The economic benefits
of prolonging working lives should not be underestimated. There
is a key link between health and productivity. If you have a population
that is healthy
and productive later into life, not only do they contribute longer
to the economy, but they also help to lessen the burden on the society.
Employers must prepare for a new employment landscape of an ageing
society with a growing pool of older workers. This entails a change
of mindset as to how employers perceive our senior workers who are and
will get much fitter and able to work much longer than 65. </p>

two real life cases to illustrate my point. Albert, aged 62, is
now working as a Property Officer. Although he is still healthy
and energetic, he is worried that he will be told to retire or take
on a lesser role in the same organisation soon. He wants to continue
working in the same job that he believes he is good at. He knows
that if he were asked to retire, it would be difficult for him to
find a similar job. Albert feels that his performance is on par
with his younger colleagues and if not better, considering his richer
work experience and ability to relate better with people of all
ages. He wonders why an older worker is viewed and treated differently. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-fb9b7d55-0c0f-49b1-9f47-36578cd24558">

to Michael, aged 65, who will retire end of this month. He has been
very loyal to the organisation, having worked there for over 40
years. He is on a yearly contract since reaching his retirement
age two years ago. He is still able to work well with no let up
in age, ability and agility. He receives good appraisals for his performance
yearly and he is still able to contribute at the same level for
another few more years. However, he now has to take on a lesser
role in the same organisation. In fact, it is a waste for someone
with a vast experience who is able to work and want to work, but
has to retire or redeployed once he reaches retirement age. Sir,
I am sure there are many more of such examples.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-decc4f89-ff01-49a1-abaa-85b888424d7d"><!--a--></a>I would like to ask the
Ministry to relook at the relevance of the retirement age and how
it can help promote and support pro-elderly employment with no age discrimination
or prejudice. People can be more productive into their 60s and 70s,
and the last thing we want is to lose their talent and enthusiasm
from the workplace due to an arbitrary retirement age. The Government
can continue to actively support companies and older workers with
training, job re-design and workplace restructuring. So, instead
of justifying their employment purely from a cost and renewal angle,
it is time employers recognise their contribution, loyalty, seniority
and experience with a pay that is fair and just. There should not
be any age discrimination where we have to make older workers cheaper
to be employable. The concept of a "retirement age" is becoming irrelevant,
whether it is a desire to stay connected or active at work, reach
a certain nest-egg number, dealing with health-care costs, or grappling
with mortgage debt, more workers are deciding to delay retirement. </p>

can help and support employers with various schemes to retain older
workers, both public and private employers need to change their
perception and attitudes on how we treat our older workers. It is
time for employers to embrace them, treat them with dignity and
give them a rightful place in our workforce. Taking the words of
the hon Member Patrick Tay, it should be " work, learn, work, then
play and come back to work again". </p>

Sir, ours is an open economy and with globalisation, Singapore's
workforce and companies based in Singapore are vulnerable to the
impact of the current global uncertainties and jobs of Singaporeans
will be affected. In the event of a protracted subpar growth scenario
in Singapore, will there be measures and help extended to workers
and companies, especially those in the externally oriented sectors, to
assist them to cope? Will there be programmes to help companies
weather the impact of economic downturn and to prevent any large

to help workers retrain so that they will be able to move to other
industry sectors that may be less affected and have employment growth opportunities?</p>

Mr Chairman, I understand that the drive to raise wages for Singaporeans
will involve bringing in new and higher-paying industries to Singapore.
A corollary of this is that some other industries may die out. Now,
in a recent Institute of Policy Studies called "Singapore Perspectives",
economist Hui Weng Tat suggested a possible increase in structural
unemployment. But, in particular, he noted a rising share of those
among the unemployed with post-Secondary level education and a rising
share of PMETs will be among those retrenched.</p>

on 16 December, it is also noted that six in 10 workers retrenched
between March and June last year were holding PMET positions. One
of the other difficulties that <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> reported
was that only around half of the laid off PMETs managed to find
jobs within six months. To me, this suggests that there exists a potential
for structural unemployment. The people who might be heavily affected
by this include the PMETs. Is there any assistance for people currently
working in industries that may die out to ensure that they can get
jobs in the new ones that may emerge?</p>

a few questions. I would like to state that traditionally we have reported
our manpower statistics based on the resident workforce as this
is in line with international norms and reflects the labour market
attributes and outcomes by differentiating the permanent pool of
workers, which largely comprises Singaporeans, PRs and the non-transient
population. Nonetheless, we also recognise that going forward, there
is increasing public interest over how Singaporeans particularly
are faring and how they are performing. So we complement our statistical
publications on residents with occasional papers on Singaporeans
in the workforce. For example, in October last year, we provided
analysis and statistics on the employment rate, unemployment rate,
and incomes of Singapore citizens. In addition, we are now regularly
releasing key labour market outcomes for Singaporeans – for example, unemployment
rate on a quarterly basis, median and 20th percentile incomes annually in

I think what is important is for us to look at the actual outcomes
for Singaporeans – in terms of their income and employability because
that ultimately is where the rubber hits the road. Despite going
through three downturns in the last decade – at the turn of the
century with the dotcom bubble burst, the SARS crisis and then the
2008 crisis – the median full-time Singaporean worker has done reasonably well.
Real median income gains averaged 2% per annum in the last five
years from 2006 to 2011. This is real median income. Including employer's
CPF contributions, this would average about 2.5% per annum. At the
20th percentile level, the real income grew at 2.2% per annum between
2006 and 2011. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b0b411a5-4cad-4a49-bccc-1d4c6e3bfabc">
                  <a name="budget__id-b0b411a5-4cad-4a49-bccc-1d4c6e3bfabc"><!--a--></a>In contrast, median incomes
have mostly either stagnated or declined in real terms in economies
like Japan, the UK, the US and Taiwan. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e28d8e9a-4d4f-44ff-a324-cd3b92d35e63">

Singaporeans aged 25 to 64 also grew steadily over the decade, from
73.7% in 2001 to 78% in 2011, and this is one of the highest internationally. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2f2f54b3-18c8-418e-8c3f-ad7559409d79">
                  <a name="budget__id-2f2f54b3-18c8-418e-8c3f-ad7559409d79"><!--a--></a>As shared earlier, unemployment
is low. Even among Singaporean PMETs, it is low at 2.4% in 2011.
We cite these figures, not to make ourselves feel better, but it
is important to use them as reference points and markers to compare
ourselves with how other
developed countries are faring in this fairly challenging climate.
And I would suggest that while the figures may seem low on its own
but from a contextual basis in terms of how other countries are
doing, in the midst of fairly difficult circumstances, I think we
are not doing too badly. </p>

structural unemployment, which we monitor closely. One of the key
indicators is the resident long-term unemployment rate. Our resident
long-term unemployment rate is and remains low at 0.7% in 2010,
and ranged from 0.5% to 1.4% in the past decade. </p>

resilient through the ups and downs. From our perspective, a key
reason is that the Continuing Education and Training (CET) system, and
our education system, which is part of the larger landscape, has
enabled our workforce to remain globally competitive. By being globally
competitive, companies can thrive and when companies thrive, jobs
are created for our people to keep them employed. </p>

CET and how we are looking at improving it. Mr Zainudin Nordin had
asked for an update on what we have achieved with CET. </p>

of a million workers went through WSQ training, of which 68% were
lower-skilled workers, and about 44% of them were aged 40 and above. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7ec13986-2b84-4f97-8fcc-3901a400299d">

of a very sizeable sample size, 12,500 trainees, most of them found
WSQ training useful and this is from the trainees' perspective –
90% of them reported better work performance. I will elaborate later. </p>

Wei Neng also asked how we keep our CET system relevant. This is
a very important question. Our WSQ is benchmarked against world
standards which WDA develops in close consultation with key industry
representatives because it does not make sense if the training has
no relevance to the industries, so we try to make sure that it remains
relevant. Currently, our WSQ system comprises 30 sectoral frameworks,
with more than 14,000 courses. MOM works closely with MOE on a whole-of-Government
approach towards CET. </p>

about the need to have creative and innovative workers for a knowledge
economy. Ms Jessica Tan asked how we can help locals seize good
job opportunities through skills transfer. </p>

of work is evolving and the environment is changing as well and
workers who are prepared to apply their skills in a more diverse
and flexible way will stay relevant. What this means is that on-the-job
training becomes critical. This is something that Mr Gerald Giam
talked about, and this is something that we have been placing emphasis
on and will continue to emphasise on that. </p>

in New Technology or what we call INTECH grant funds for training
in such growth areas, and the Strategic Attachment and Training Programme
(STRAT) funds overseas on-the-job training with leading companies.
On average, over 3,500 locals were trained under these programmes
annually over the past five years. </p>

are ready to take greater ownership over their personal development.
I agree and think that this is important. WDA is seeking to make
CET more accessible, personally relevant, and individual-centric. </p>

Mohamad and Mr Zainudin expressed concerns about the challenges
facing PMEs and how we can help them with training and job facilitation. Mdm
Halimah Yacob raised similar concerns during the Budget debate.
We fully recognise that PMEs, who are the fastest growing segment
of our workforce, have very diverse professional development needs
and is a group that we need to pay attention to. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5fe27908-da80-450a-8198-023f835bbb46">

Singaporeans in PMET jobs grew from 42% to almost half, 49% over
the last 10 years. If we just look at PMEs alone, it is nearly 30%
of employed Singaporeans. </p>

at how to improve our competency-based CET offerings for PMEs to
complement our academic CET programmes, and we are open to suggestions from
PMEs and employers on what would be most useful to them. Again,
staying relevant is important, so feedback is critical. </p>

Excellence Programme (STEP) was introduced last year to better support
the CET needs of our increasing PME workforce. Within one year,
there are now more than 500 courses available under STEP and over
50,000 PMEs have undergone the various programmes. In addition,
360 STEP scholarships for Singaporeans valued at $12 million have
been set aside for eight sectors, which include aerospace, retail,
tourism and healthcare. </p>

to upgrade themselves. But many have also fed back to us that they
need more assistance to find the right job. This year, we will focus
on employment facilitation and we will introduce three programmes
to help PMEs: </p>

launch CaliberLink, a one-stop service point for PMEs that integrates
training assistance with career services. CaliberLink will complement
the existing career centres based at the CDCs as well as that operated
by e2i. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-dec06511-bae9-445c-aafd-06e046fe8c52">
                  <a name="budget__id-dec06511-bae9-445c-aafd-06e046fe8c52"><!--a--></a>PMEs can look forward
to services such as career coaching, training advisory, career transition
programmes, networking sessions with employers and employment facilitation.
CaliberLink will allow us to effectively and holistically assist
PMEs. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-7e4df516-9fc2-4eba-b22f-6eeafac25673"><!--a--></a>In December, I corresponded.
I received an email from Mr Tan Wei Thong. He is a professional
who, after working several years in China, wanted to return to Singapore
to be closer to his family. He shared his views about what could
be improved and shared about some of the challenges and difficulties
he faced. I received an email from him actually just a few weeks
ago, and he told me that career consultants at CaliberLink helped
him with resume and interview skills workshops, and provided job
referrals to prospective employers. The knowledge he gained complemented
his own job search efforts
and he found a job as a Director in a regional manufacturing company.
I was very happy to receive that email from him. This is because
CaliberLink is pretty much at a soft-launch stage, but to have such
a response from the public at such an early stage, is encouraging.
I hope he will be one of CaliberLink's many success stories in years
to come. </p>

the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME) as a Programme
Partner to manage Max Talent, which is a pilot Place-and-Train programme

helping SMEs hire talented Singaporean workers. This programme,
we believe, will help achieve this. Besides enhancing the talent
pool and capabilities of SMEs, who traditionally would highlight
that they find difficulties recruiting and attracting PMEs, it also
widens opportunities for PMEs themselves and to realise that SMEs
also offer very positive and very viable career opportunities. ASME will
work closely with SMEs to provide PME vacancies and to help them
improve their HR management. For PMEs, ASME will help to place them
and equip them with the essential management skills and knowledge.
The programme will start in April 2012. WDA will provide more details.</p>

the economic restructuring effort, Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Vikram

This is something important to recognise. Therefore WDA will now increasingly
collaborate with community groups, grassroots and self-help groups
to establish a structured referral process to ensure that these
job-seekers get the comprehensive help that they need. Not just
in terms of helping to find jobs but in the process of getting to
know the applicants and their circumstances more personally, we may
help to link some of them who have needs that go beyond the jobs,
with the various agencies involved to provide a more complete set
of assistance.</p>

as Deputy Prime Minister Tharman announced in the Budget Speech,
we will enhance training subsidies and absentee payroll support
for SMEs. SMEs will receive 90% training subsidies when they send
their local employees for the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications
(WSQ) and other certifiable courses and academic CET courses. About
8,400 courses will potentially fall under this scheme. </p>

also claim higher absentee payroll funding at 80% of basic hourly
salary capped at $7.50 per hour. This is a significant increase
over the current cap of $4.50 per hour. This three-year initiative
takes effect from July 2012 and will cost an additional $30.5 million
per year, benefiting an estimated 8,000 SMEs and 65,000 workers
a year. </p>

WDA will expand the intakes of Place-and-Train (PnT) programmes,

inactive Singaporeans back to work – several Members have asked
how we can help them or vulnerable workers participate more fully
in the workplace and to contribute more. Tapping this latent pool

150,000 of them.</p>

waiving CPF contributions for employers who recruit home-makers
for part-time work. Now, while this may lower the cost of hiring
these workers, it will be, in their case, at the expense of their
retirement adequacy because many of them would have very little
CPF to begin with, because they have been out of work for a long
time. Many home-makers actually choose not to rejoin the workforce largely
because of a lack in suitable flexible working arrangements, or
because they lack the confidence and skills to go back to work. </p>

to both tackle the barriers to them re-entering the workforce as
well as to give them the opportunity for skills upgrading through
CET. As Members Mr Low Thia Khiang and Ms Mary Liew pointed out,
one of the first things that needs to be done is to promote flexible
work arrangements. Flexi-Works! Scheme and the Work-Life Works!

at least one form of work-life arrangement to their employees, up
from 25% in 2007. </p>

that has tapped on the Flexi-Works! Scheme. They offer flexible

one such employee who managed to re-enter the workforce, even while
she had a young child to care for, due to the permanent part-time arrangement
offered by Home-Fix. Clearly, providing flexibility in working arrangements
can attract economically inactive persons back to the workforce
and allow workers
to better manage both work and family responsibilities. And as we
begin to tighten the workforce, in terms of the availability of
the foreign workforce, I think this is one area which companies
should seriously consider expanding so that we can look at bringing
more of these people into the workforce. </p>

Secretary Hawazi Daipi will speak more on low-wage workers later.
Let me just say that the CET needs of vulnerable workers are of
key concern to us. Ms Sylvia Lim asked how much low-wage workers
benefit from training. I think that is a valid and important question.
In fact we asked that of ourselves all the time, not just for low-wage
workers, but for all workers – does training help? Mr Low Thia Kiang
also asked about the effectiveness of these training programmes.
As Ms Lim had noted, the Workfare programme provides both an income
supplement and generous training incentives. In 2011, close to 50,000
low-wage workers benefited from the Workfare Training Support (WTS).</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5d7bdf0a-ea5c-4182-a67e-d299a022602b">
                  <a name="budget__id-5d7bdf0a-ea5c-4182-a67e-d299a022602b"><!--a--></a>Training alone may not
lead to immediate wage improvements. Rather, it must be a result
of improved productivity which, amongst other factors, depends on
the knowledge and skills of the worker and whether these are effectively
applied to the job and workplace. It is true that sometimes actual
improvements in profits may not filter down to the workers immediately,
but a rational employer would have to do his calculations and adjust
wages commensurate. And this is something that we will encourage
companies to do. Otherwise, he would not be able to retain his good
staff.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cceff2a4-451f-45bf-aa87-4bf53e940384">
                  <a name="budget__id-cceff2a4-451f-45bf-aa87-4bf53e940384"><!--a--></a>Ms Lim mentioned data
from WDA's annual WSQ Training Outcome Evaluation Survey. In 2011,
90% of low-wage workers said they performed better at work as a
result of the training. This is from the low-wage workers' perspective.
This is not a feedback on the courses itself but after they have
re-joined the workforce. Ninety-five percent of companies surveyed
also agreed that the training improved the performance of their low-wage
employees. In addition, 88% of low-wage trainees indicated that
they will continue to take up other WSQ courses. So this is actually
very important because it shows that for the workers themselves,
they find a tremendous value in undergoing this training. And I
would suggest that it is not just in terms of skills, but because
they are better skilled, I think it also brings with that a higher
degree of confidence and also enhanced their own respectability
at their workplace. And this can only auger well for the long-term
for the individual.</p>

indicated they are willing to continue training, I think it is an
indication of WSQ training. But this is something that we will continue
to monitor and to make sure that we improve. And we recognise there
are costs to training. But these should not stop workers from taking
the first step because even a little training will go a long way.
For example, Mr Mohamed Hardi was previously working as an odd-job worker.
Career consultants at Northwest CDC helped him enrol in a five-day
Forklift Driver Training Course and find a job at Caterpillar Pte
Ltd for an almost 50% increase in salary. </p>

to illustrate possibilities and inspire Singaporeans to continuously
upgrade and up-skill. And they are not exceptions but realities
which Singaporeans should aspire for. Like I said earlier, the feedback
from the workers themselves is a clear indicator of the value that
these training provide for older workers. </p>

about how it is important to help older workers go for training.
As I shared earlier, 44% of people who obtained WSQ training in
2011 were above
40. That is about 109,000 older workers. The perception among some
employers that older workers benefit less from training is something
we hope to correct. </p>

who go for training are more likely than younger workers to have
a positive experience. From the earlier mentioned survey, we also
found that 82% of workers aged 50 and above found training useful,
as compared to 77% of workers aged 30 and below. Seventy-four percent
of older workers were also more motivated at work, as compared to
66% of younger workers. And this feedback is something that companies
should pay attention to as well as to look at who they might choose
to employ, especially as we are now encouraging re-employment; and
this something that reflects well of older workers. </p>

be inclusive and cater to Singaporeans with special needs. Ms Denise
Phua and Mr Ang Wei Neng have suggested extending CET to persons
with disabilities. Given the customised needs, our approach is to
let organisations with expertise in this field take the lead in
developing such programmes and WDA will play the supporting role.
For example, the Centres for Training and Integration (CTIs) initiated by
the Enabling Employers Network (EEN) and supported by MCYS and NCSS
provide structured training for persons with disabilities through
on-the-job training and placement programmes. WDA has been supporting
these programmes since July 2011, and will provide over $600,000

90% pilot funding for Workplace Literacy and Numeracy (WPLN) assessment
for students from selected Special Education Schools, Assumption Pathway
School and Northlight School. The WPLN credentials are recognised
in lieu of GCE qualifications by about 3,700 employers and allow
progression to vocational education courses. We hope that more employers
will come on board.</p>

economy for sustainable growth, we need to ensure that this growth
is inclusive. Mr Zainudin Nordin spoke about the importance of preparing
our workforce and workplaces for an ageing population. The ageing
population is a demographic reality. This is something that is going
to happen. The percentage of our labour force aged 55 and above
has more than doubled from 8.5% in 2001 to 18.2% in 2011. The employment
rate for residents aged 55 to 64, encouragingly, rose to a new high
of 61.2% in 2011 from 59% in 2010. Our older workers will also become
more educated over time. The experienced and valuable members of
our workforce who can contribute long into their silver years, with
the right workplace arrangements. Many companies are already recognising
this. </p>

MOM's 2011 Survey on Retirement and Re-employment Practices, the
proportion of companies that allow the employees to work past 62

and Re-employment Act (RRA) in effect since 1 January this year,
we expect the employment rate of older residents to continue to
improve towards our target of 65% by 2015 which will bring us closer
to the older worker employment rates in mature economies such as
Japan and Sweden. </p>

have the choice to keep working if they are able to and if they

two main ways.</p>

of a Special Employment Credit (SEC). As outlined in the Budget
Speech, the SEC will be enhanced from this year to provide employers
with continuing support to hire older Singaporeans. Mr Teo Siong
Seng had asked whether if we could lift the wage cap of SEC for
PMEs who earn higher than $4,000 to benefit. In the Budget debate,
Mr Patrick Tay expressed similar concerns for the employability
of older PMEs due to increase in CPF contribution rates. This group
of PMEs would largely comprise senior executives and professionals.
Some of them clearly with deep expertise and experience will continue
to be highly sought after. But there will also be those who will
find difficulties in their new job late in their careers. We will
be introducing several job facilitation schemes targeted at PMEs
this year to help them. And some of these have been elaborated earlier.</p>

budget thinly to cover all older workers, including such senior executives,
would mean that we can only give SEC up to 4% wages, instead of
the 8% we currently give. It is instructive to know that at $3,000,
SEC covers about 70% of older Singaporeans. As it moves up to $4,000,
it covers 80%. The SEC itself actually covers between 70% and 80%
of our older workers.</p>

Scheme will be extended until March 2013, to provide generous funding
support to help companies to re-design jobs, work processes and workplaces
to make them more age-friendly. I totally agree with Mr Low Thia
Kiang that integrating older workers into the workforce requires
different approaches for different groups. The best way to illustrate
this is to show the example of St Luke's Eldercare who has re-designed
jobs for its older workers. </p>

organisation that offers care services for seniors. Over 90% of

importance of enhancing its work processes to make it age-friendly. </p>

ADVANTAGE!, they equipped all passenger vans with hydraulic wheelchair
lifters. This is a very simple idea and a very simple enhancement, but
one that has a big impact on helping its older workers perform their
jobs better. It reduces the physical strain on the care staff and
drivers. Every day they have to lift the immobile elderly up onto
the vehicles and with this simple device it has made it a lot easier
for them. And this also reduces the number of employees needed to
perform certain tasks.</p>

what we are doing to help companies change the way we operate to
fit an ageing workforce. I think St Luke's Eldercare harnessing
ADVANTAGE! is one good example of how it can be done and we encourage
more companies to follow suit.</p>

doing away with the statutory minimum retirement age, something

model from Japan. And Japan today enjoys one of the highest employment

this year and implementation has by and large been smooth. Nonetheless,
we need to monitor its progress and to make sure that it remains
effective. We must also continue to equip our workforce with the
right skills. Employers should take the initiative to encourage
the development of their older employees and the adoption of age-friendly
jobs at workplaces. I think we all need a concerted effort by society
at large because there is a fundamental belief in the value of older
workers in the contributions they can make. And it is important
for us to remember that as we look after older workers, the younger
workers are also looking on because they eventually themselves will
also become older workers themselves. I think it is also a reflection
of the values that we hold as a society in terms of how we regard
our older workers.</p>

the topic on managing the inflow of foreign workers. As the Committee
would have appreciated during the Budget debate, there are really
no easy answers to the issue of foreign manpower. Despite the various
measures announced, such as SEC, some have asked why we have not
done more and implemented more quickly? On the other hand, we also
hear from Singapore business owners and HR managers who say that
changes have taken place way too suddenly and will affect their operations
and plans. Can we calibrate it? Can we hold back? Can we slow it
down? We fully understand where all these different perspectives
are coming from. I think their concerns and frustrations are valid
from their perspectives. However, as a Government, we have to manage
all these tensions that pull in different directions. We need to
find a balance where our economy can thrive and create better jobs
for Singaporeans. That, at the core of it, is what we are trying
to.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28a33caf-2913-4d11-8fa3-d17959c61c50">
                  <a name="budget__id-28a33caf-2913-4d11-8fa3-d17959c61c50"><!--a--></a>Meanwhile, we must ensure
that Singaporeans remain at the core of the workforce. Members,
Jessica Tan, Foo Mee Har and Mary Liew, have asked how we can encourage employers
to develop Singaporeans as a core of their workforce. The tripartite
partners released a set of guidelines on developing a Singaporean
core last October. Employers are expected to adhere to the guidelines.
They should make reasonable efforts to attract and consider Singaporeans
for job positions on merit and to train and develop the potential
and careers. Since the launch of these guidelines, the Tripartite
Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) has reached out to
employers and responded to allegations of discriminatory employment
practices. So far, each employer that TAFEP had approached, following
a complaint, understood and accepted the need to abide by these
guidelines. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-35d71531-6293-4a70-8362-6f82e6efcd56">
                  <a name="budget__id-35d71531-6293-4a70-8362-6f82e6efcd56"><!--a--></a>Most employers believe
it is in their interest to develop Singaporean workers and they
do not condone discrimination. We met a number of CEOs in our various
dialogues and one of them, who was quite forthright, said that he
was genuinely surprised to hear TAFEP's feedback and feedback from
his own Singaporean employees themselves about how some perceived
discrimination was taking place at the workplace. He said that he
would address this issue. Many employers have shown TAFEP their
efforts to recruit Singaporeans. Some have even taken extra steps
to review the hiring patterns of the individual business units to
check for and to address biases.</p>

which are important, I think we also have another arm of our effort
which is to ensure the quality of foreign manpower. Mr Heng Chee
How has expressed concerns about the possible sharp rise in the
Employment Pass (EP) stock during
an economic upturn. Mdm Foo Mee Har suggested employers show proof
that they try to hire Singaporeans before being allowed to hire
EP holders. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1934</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1075433c-5675-4683-b657-05320ecc2067">

subject employers to additional administrative hurdle, lengthen
their hiring process and add more friction, costs and rigidities.
It will be more onerous for employers, particularly SMEs, who may
have other pressing HR needs and fewer resources, to deliver such
proof quickly and affordably. And we think that it will affect labour
market flexibility and that is a key part of our competitiveness
and this will also affect the viability of some of these companies
in their decisions to come or stay here. And that in turn will affect
creating jobs in Singapore. But this is something we have to bear
in mind and we have decided to take a more pragmatic approach for
now, to regularly review our EP criteria to ensure that only high-calibre
EP holders are brought in to complement our local PMEs. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e6beaaf-7540-475b-99bd-8b9999c1daaf">
                  <a name="budget__id-9e6beaaf-7540-475b-99bd-8b9999c1daaf"><!--a--></a>With regard to PMEs, as
highlighted earlier, a tremendous amount of effort will be put in
to help all PMEs not only just upgrade themselves but in terms of
job facilitation as well. We recently took two significant steps.
The first was in July 2011 when we raised the salary requirement
for EP holders. Then again in January this year, we raised salary requirement
as well as tightened quite significantly their legibility criteria.
I would like to remind Members that we have to be very careful in
these policies. We need to find the right balance. The skilled foreign
manpower bring with them expertise, knowledge and network that our
economy needs in order to grow and create better jobs for both our PMEs
and rank-and-file Singaporeans. I think having an open and diverse
workforce is important to Singapore because not only for Singaporean
companies but foreign companies. It ensures that they remain viable
and they are able to thrive and, in so doing, they create jobs for
Singaporeans.</p>

how EP holders have been affected by our tightening measures as
compared to the Work Pass and S Pass. It is not possible to compare
the impact of the measures as they have been introduced for the
various Work Pass categories and they are quite different. And we
target the foreign workers quite differently. The measures for EP
holders focus on raising quality while those on S Pass and Work
Permit holders are mainly price mechanisms – that is, levy increases
– to moderate growth in numbers. </p>

the levy increases which began in July 2010 and will run through
July 2013 while the EP tightening measures only took effect last
month. As Deputy Prime Minister said earlier, if the foreign workforce
continues to grow rapidly despite all these measures, we will have
to further consider changes and further measures to dampen reliance
on foreign workers. These steps have been taken in the last few
years. The economy has been doing well, companies have been doing
well. So, notwithstanding all that, the demand has continued to
be quite high. So, this is why we are stepping up our efforts to
manage the numbers.</p>

time to talk about the Dependency Ratio Ceilings (DRCs). Several
Members today and at the Budget debate, suggested a finer differentiation
of the DRCs between industries rather than just between the various
broad sectors. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1f246830-811f-4779-a4a8-065e764bdd6f">

tightening DRCs in industries where Singaporeans can be trained
to take up jobs and relaxing them in industries which have difficulties attracting
Singaporeans. Our broad sectoral approach already recognises that
in some sectors
like construction, it is much harder to attract Singaporeans. That
is why their DRCs are more generous. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1935</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ae7b4bd3-c202-4e1a-9f74-cf8a0911afd0">
                  <a name="budget__id-ae7b4bd3-c202-4e1a-9f74-cf8a0911afd0"><!--a--></a>This concern that Mr Low
and other Members have raised is a very relevant one. Our current
approach takes it into account. The question really is about the
practical side and the implementation side of the house. It is about
how much more can we go down into the details and how much more
finely we can disaggregate the industries, while still achieving,
and it is important to remember this, the broader objectives of
reducing overall growth of foreign workers to within one-third of
the workforce and boosting productivity. Those objectives remain
important. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-916e4e82-502b-4f57-887d-f4678c4abb48"><!--a--></a>Deputy Prime Minister
Tharman addressed this issue earlier but let me take the opportunity
to reiterate. There are three reasons to highlight. Firstly, we
need to achieve an overall reduction in the growth of foreign workers
but most industries that we speak to – the companies, in the emails
they send us and when they come to speak to us at the various dialogues,
say that they are different, they cannot find Singaporeans, they
need to have more foreign workers. Almost consistently, many of
them will say that they need more foreign workers. In fact, the
industries calling for more foreign workers are the same ones that
contributed most to the foreign workforce growth in the past five
years. Mr Low's point about easing the DRCs in sectors such as these
where they find it difficult to hire Singaporeans, would have the
effect of opening the floodgates further because many of these companies
themselves are already hiring many foreign workers. So, it is something
we need to be very careful about.</p>

also have much lower productivity levels as compared to their counterparts
in developed countries. So the construction industry is one which
I highlighted earlier. I would acknowledge that it is not easy to
bring in young Singaporeans into that sector but it is a very large
industry. There are some of the more professional jobs which we
believe, by a change in job scope, by change in the income levels
or the wage levels, young Singaporeans could be attracted to move
in. But, importantly, in terms of the reliance on foreign workers,
it is an industry that has way too many foreign workers when you
compare to the construction industry, say, in Australia, and some
of the developed countries, say, in Japan. So we believe that by tightening
this in some of these sectors, it will force productivity improvements
and that, in turn, would have a significant impact on the overall
numbers of foreign workers in Singapore.</p>

to some of these industries will actually lead to fairly perverse
outcomes. They will constrain the growth of high-productivity industries, because
remember, the overall objective is to bring down and to manage the
overall numbers. As we liberalise in some of these sectors, which
actually draw on many foreign workers, it will mean that some of
the high-productivity industries, we will need to tighten it and
actually that will affect them more significantly. So it will be
actually counter-intuitive because it will constrain the growth
of high-productivity industries while we incentivise some of the
low-productivity industries. And this will also affect their capacity
to create more jobs and good jobs for Singaporeans.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1936</p>

it as a given that it is difficult to hire Singaporeans today and
therefore it will remain so. I think if we look at many of the developed
countries in Europe, for example; and Germany is a good example,
some of the jobs that Singaporeans seem to shun here – educated,
competent Germans are undertaking those jobs. In the same way, we
believe that a lot of it has got to do with how we re-design the
work and the work environment, and wages also have to move. So if
we continue to give such industries more foreign workers, they will
not have any incentive to improve productivity and change the nature
of work in order to draw in Singaporeans into these areas. These
good jobs can be created. And I totally agree with Ms Denise Phua
who raised that we need to re-design jobs and the environment. In developed
countries, we see that happening and we believe that this can be
done in Singapore as well. </p>

manpower shortages have conceded that remuneration, job image and
work conditions are, in fact, important factors which need to be
addressed to attract local workers. And this is something that we
believe can be done and should be done.</p>

play a very important role in this. Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked how MOM
plans to help SMEs share best practices for productivity gains.
This sharing of best practices is quite critical. You will find
in industry one company complaining about how difficult it is, but
in the same industry, a rival competitor took everything on board,
began to change and actually began to thrive. How do we manage the
exchange of good practices and ideas? It is not easy but it is something
that we should endeavour to do and that is where associations and
federations come in. My Ministry has already started work with the
Singapore Retail Association and the Singapore Hotel Association on
initiatives to attract locals and to increase productivity, including
industry benchmarking and job re-design. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0e5dc196-f37d-4fb0-8eca-3eb08e0e7b34">
                  <a name="budget__id-0e5dc196-f37d-4fb0-8eca-3eb08e0e7b34"><!--a--></a>Thirdly, industry-specific
DRCs are difficult to implement in reality. Mr Low Thia Kiang also
acknowledged that actually the range of SME operations is very complex.
We fully agree. It is exceedingly complex. And it is precisely because
it is complex that it is very difficult to then go in and start
differentiating every industry because every one is fairly unique
in their own way and will have their arguments about why they should benefit
from more liberal DRCs. It is important to also highlight this point
with regard to the DRC that, actually, most companies in Singapore
are not maximising their DRCs. There is still space for them to
hire Singaporeans and to hire foreign workers, if they need to. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-29c487a5-b881-4638-a711-40c105f38dbf">

industries are not clear-cut. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman explained,
especially for some of the bigger companies, they may reside in terms
of their work nature, they are both production, manufacturing as
well as services. For some of these companies, you actually provide
them an advantage over the very SMEs that some of the Members have
raised about why we should look after them. This is why we think
that having a broader-based sectoral approach would make sense. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-384389f6-434f-4628-ab1b-1c0e4acadc03">
                  <a name="budget__id-384389f6-434f-4628-ab1b-1c0e4acadc03"><!--a--></a>The detailed micro-management
of DRCs will literally amount to a central planning system for the
allocation of labour. The fact is that technology changes, jobs
change, work environment changes. We have seen that happen even
within the span of just a few years. It will become very difficult
for the Government to be constantly tweaking the system to allocate
foreign workers differently, as industry and work conditions change. This
has a tremendous impact in terms of uncertainty for businesses and
it will affect their
long-term planning and investments. Firms would not know whether
to invest in productivity to try to attract locals or not, or to
wait for more liberal DRC. Such a system would also be prone to
constant lobbying, which would unfairly advantage the well-resourced
and the larger industries, to the detriment of the smaller ones,
particularly the SMEs.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1937</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8f304cbd-a2e8-435b-a46a-24704db24df4">
                  <a name="budget__id-8f304cbd-a2e8-435b-a46a-24704db24df4"><!--a--></a>Let me just say that this
is a very complex landscape. It is precisely because it is complex
that we need to adapt for this. Our foreign labour framework basically
operates as such: there is a DRC and there is a foreign worker levy.
The DRC system, we look at the context, the nature of the different
sectors, and we define broadly the different DRCs for the work space
at large. These define the boundaries. The foreign worker levy will then
be the precise tool that will delve into the details and into this
complex world. It is transparent, everybody knows what the foreign
worker levy is, and companies will then decide how much they are
prepared to pay. If they are not prepared to pay, then they re-engineer
and change the process. We believe that this system has worked well
for Singapore. This is why, in terms of our basic approach, we believe
that having this combination of the DRCs, which is differentiated
across the broad sectors, and the levy, will be the mechanism that
makes sense for us. </p>

that differentiated DRCs would help low-wage workers. We are quite
concerned about this because having liberal DRCs in some of these
industries which we assume Singaporeans would not be interested
in, may actually have the opposite effect. For example, allowing
more low-cost foreign workers in the cleaning industry would actually
undo many of the initiatives we are taking to encourage companies
to best-source. We believe that even in the cleaning industry, there
are good jobs for Singaporeans. Liberalising the DRCs will permanently
keep out the older and low-wage Singaporeans who may find relevant
employment in these industries. Those who remain, more likely than
not, will continue to see stagnant wages and poor working conditions
because firms are not pressured to restructure. These jobs, we believe,
like many other jobs, have the potential to be good jobs, and it
is possible to make them so for Singaporeans in the industry. We
need to do this re-design across the whole spectrum of jobs that
are in Singapore. </p>

– and it is important to come back to the objective – to upgrade and
restructure our economy. It is painful but it is something we need
to do now, to avoid the pain that we will suffer later as competition
continues to rise in the surrounding region and beyond. But we know
that the current balance must be adjusted carefully. For firms that
need help to adjust to the new environment, we want them to use
our generous schemes to restructure and to thrive. This is the best
way to help companies make the necessary transition. We cannot afford
to keep postponing this. </p>

At the heart of everything, our people remain at the centre of what
we do. We create the conditions to provide good jobs for them. Being
able to stand on one's own two feet and to respect the dignity that
comes with work, are part of the ethos that our forefathers have
handed down to us. When we talk of the low-income earners, notwithstanding
the wide range of assistance provided, we believe that providing
jobs is the best form of welfare. So when we talk about economic
growth, it is not just for economic growth alone. It is not just
about the GDP numbers. It is about providing an environment where
good jobs can exist for Singaporeans. </p>

and nurturing our people is one of our core areas of emphasis. Our

our education system. This year, we have placed great emphases on

out for our elderly and disabled. Low-wage workers are a big focal

                  </span>:
Mr Chairman, as a result of reduced CPF contributions for older
workers over the years, many seniors today have seen their CPF under-contributed
to face today's higher cost of living. These older workers, especially those
above 60, have low levels of CPF savings due to the lower CPF rates
in the last 20 years. Today, many of them also find it more difficult
to make ends meet with a limited income and CPF savings. What can
the Government do to help our older workers in this category? While
the CPF is important, what many of these older workers really need
is cash-in-hand to deal with immediate needs of the day, that is,
the rising costs of living in stagnant wages. For older workers,
I also urge the Government to consider releasing WIS payments more
regularly to help them ease their financial burden. Many of our younger
low-wage workers, they are daily-rated freelancers or paid-on-project
basis. They face a dilemma which some employers are happy to exploit.
These employers compensate them with more cash rather than CPF contributions
because it seems a win-win situation for both sides. However, without
CPF contributions, these low-wage workers will lose out on many
of our Government schemes, such as the WIS and housing benefits.
How could we better educate them on the disadvantages of doing this?
And what measures are in place to prevent such exploitations by
employers against our younger low-wage workers?</p>

Mr Chairman, many Members before me have spoken on the important
topic of bridging the income gap. But before adding to the list
of programme suggestions, I would like to suggest we have better
research on Singaporeans' lifecycle of earnings and industry-specific
realities. </p>

on social mobility, it focused on relative social mobility, or people
going up and down the income ladder. There is something unsettling
about the research. Yes, we want social mobility and incomes of
the lower income to go up. But I do not think we want to do this
by pushing the high-income and middle-income earners down the ladder.
And we know already of many middle-income earners, who face declining
income. Hence, we must worry about declining incomes at all income
levels.</p>

study to identify the types of jobs that pay these low and declining
wages, and to see if structural changes can be made or even industry-specific programmes
and incentives given for employers to pay fairer wages. For example,
the PAP Town Councils are now paying their cleaners more. How do
we get the private sector to follow suit, where cleaners typically
earn only around $4 an hour? Better still, how do we bring cleaners
into private homes, where hourly rates can even go up to $15 an
hour? We need better studies on the factors that affect wages. </p>

I am heartened by the Government's pledge to take the lead in Best
Sourcing as it demonstrates that the Government agencies are responsible
service buyers. While this is a good move, I would like to propose
some measures, based on feedback that I received from the industry
players, to make the impact of Best Sourcing more systemic across
Government and private sectors to benefit more low-wage workers.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-51d35a93-cf77-4dc8-b416-209fbc5bf242"><!--a--></a> First, I would like to
propose for the Government to consider introducing legislation where
all service buyers will be held accountable for the employment conditions
of the outsourced workers working under their contract. This would
be similar to the Work Safety Health legislation where the main
contractor is held responsible for ensuring safety of all workers,
regardless if they are subcontractors, as long as they are working at
the worksite. This legislation will ensure service buyers, regardless
whether they are from Government or private sector, to be more careful
in awarding contracts and will only award to reliable service providers
with good human resource and employment practices that are in compliance
with the Employment Act and conform to good practices as being advocated
in Best Sourcing. </p>

Government to study the possibility of reviewing existing Government
contracts to ensure they are aligned with the Best Sourcing guideline.
This is to ensure that our outsourced workers can get the necessary
wage adjustment and not having to wait for the contract to end. </p>

MOM is working with its tripartite partners to leverage on the existing
cleaning and security accreditations framework to help workers in
these industries earn better wages and employment terms. Currently,
the Government is working only on the cleaning and security sectors.
I would like to ask for the plan or approaches with regard to other
sectors where there are low-wage workers, such as landscaping, retail,
logistics, F&amp;B and others.</p>

Prime Minister Tharman and Minister of State Tan have given the

coming fiscal year to help Singaporeans achieve retirement adequacy
and to build a Singaporean core in our workforce. I will now touch
on the measures to help low-income Singaporeans benefit from our

Deputy Prime Minister Tharman in the recent Budget Statement, our
shared mission is to build an inclusive society and a stronger Singapore. Mr
Zainudin Nordin asked about the group that might not be able to
enjoy this inclusive growth, especially the number of Singaporeans
who are low-wage and do casual and contract work. </p>

workers have been focused on the bottom 20% of Singaporean workers.
Based on income data of 2011, this group of workers earns a monthly
income of $1,500 or less. Over the past few years, the number of
workers in the bottom 20% has increased in tandem with the growth
in the size of our overall workforce. </p>

employees in the bottom quintile are casual and short-term contract
workers. They are those who work on an ad-hoc basis or on contracts
of less than one year. This percentage has remained fairly constant
over the last three years, although the incidence is slightly higher
amongst the low-wage group compared to about 12% of Singaporean
employees in general. Our overall share of contract employment in
Singapore is not unusual among developed countries. For example,
it is 15% in Germany and France, and 13% in Canada. </p>

bottom 20% is a multi-faceted challenge. Almost half are aged 50
and above, and more than three-quarters have secondary education
or lower. They also train less compared to the other income groups,
and are more likely to suffer poor employment standards. I agree
with Mr Laurence Lien that we need to understand low-wage workers
and their challenges better, and that this calls for more research
and analysis. We agree, and MOM will consider his specific suggestions
further. </p>

also requires sustained efforts on multiple fronts. It cannot be
done just by one agency, the Government alone. It has to be a concerted
effort by different
parties – employers, unions, as well as the Government. It is not
a sprint, but a middle-distance race. Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about
the approach that the Government was taking. During the Budget debate,
Mr Ong Teng Koon also asked how we could raise the wages of those
at the bottom.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1943</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0c42491c-8410-4fa8-96c3-e5d7de76b2f6">

First, we help the lower-income Singaporeans become more productive
so that they can earn higher wages. We do so both at the workers'
level as well as the employers' level. Through the Workfare Training
Support (WTS) and other programmes, we are helping low-wage workers
upgrade their skills, so that they can improve their employability,
find better jobs and earn more. And through the Inclusive Growth
Programme (IGP), we are helping companies improve processes and
redesign jobs, so that they can offer higher-value jobs that can
pay more to our low-wage workers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b6db83da-5734-4bab-b41f-8ec1f9f3be96">
                  <a name="budget__id-b6db83da-5734-4bab-b41f-8ec1f9f3be96"><!--a--></a>Second, we encourage low-wage
workers to work and help create opportunities for them to do so.
Again, we approach this at both the level of the worker as well
as the employer. The Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (WIS) supplements
the incomes and retirement savings of low-wage workers and encourages
work. WIS currently benefits about 400,000 workers, with a total
annual payout of more than $400 million. </p>

Credit (SEC) provides employers with an incentive to hire older
low-wage workers. With the enhancement of the SEC to up to 8% of
wages, there is now an even stronger incentive to tap the older
workforce to meet manpower needs in a tight labour market. </p>

Mr Yeo Guat Kwang offered various suggestions to improve WIS, such
as raising the cash component of WIS. Sir, we review WIS every three
years and will consider these suggestions when we review WIS holistically
next year. </p>

whether WIS can be paid more regularly. Other Members, including
Dr Amy Khor, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Ms Irene Ng, Mr Inderjit Singh
and Mdm Halimah Yacob, have also asked in the past whether WIS can
be paid more frequently to low-wage workers so that they can be
used to meet daily expenses. </p>

estimate that about 440,000 older low-wage Singaporean workers will
receive WIS, or an increase of about 10% from today. Employees with
a steady income will receive payments quarterly, instead of twice
a year. While we are making
a move to quarterly payments for employees, I should stress that
we will not be raising the payment frequency further, as the intent
of WIS is to encourage regular and sustained work. </p>

WIS eligibility is automatically assessed based on their monthly
CPF contributions, self-employed persons (SEPs) are required to
declare their net trade income before they are assessed for WIS.
While SEPs are given the option of declaring both their mid-year
and full-year income, less than 1% of all of them do so. The vast
majority of SEPs declare their full-year income and contribute to
Medisave to receive WIS once a year. The Medisave contribution that
needs to be made by SEP for the mid-year payment is also estimated
based on their full-year income, which can result in an over or
under-contribution to Medisave. Hence, from this year on, SEPs will
be paid WIS once a year based on the declaration of their full-year
income. For SEPs who are required to file an income tax return with
IRAS, no further income declaration is necessary.</p>

important pillar of our social security system. Regrettably, not
every low-wage worker receives it. This is because some fall outside
the CPF system, which is used to administer WIS. So, if they are
not in the CPF system, they will not be able to benefit from all
the WIS payments. Under the law, not paying CPF is a serious offence
that can attract a fine of as much as $10,000 per charge; in other
words, $10,000 per worker per month. To compound the problem, some
workers also prefer that their employer does not contribute CPF,
so that they too can avoid contributing their employee CPF and have
higher take-home pay. This may give them a better take-home pay,
but certainly this is short-sighted. </p>

and Mr Zaqy Mohamad pointed out that workers lose out in the end
when they do not receive CPF. This is because the Government channels
a significant part of its assistance, such as WIS as well as any
other occasional top-ups, to the low-income via CPF. Furthermore,
they also compromise their retirement adequacy. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-658e1071-53cd-4cbb-a331-25927fea3ae6">

Singaporean worker aged 55 earning $1,000 per month who is not in
CPF net over the past five years would have foregone more than $9,000
in cash and CPF from the Government through the WIS, Workfare Special
Payment, Workfare Special Bonus as well as top-ups to the CPF Medisave
Account. If we were to include the employer CPF contributions due
to him, he would have lost out an additional $11,000. In total,
this worker would have lost out more than $20,000 over a five-year
period, which works out to be about a third of his overall pay.
And we have not counted the interest he would have earned in CPF.
The worker who is not receiving CPF, whether because of his own
will, or because the employer does not want to pay him CPF contributions,
will lose out a lot. I would like to urge all Singaporeans who are
aware of any relative, neighbour or friend who are forgoing their
CPF to remind them that they are losing out, and urge them to make
sure they ask their employers pay them CPF.</p>

that Mr Zainudin Nordin raised is non-compliance with the Employment
Act (EA). The EA sets out basic employment terms that employers
must offer their workers. For example, the workers cannot work for
more than 12 hours a day. Workers must also be given 14 days of
paid outpatient medical leave per year. However, some employers
are unaware of the obligations they have to their employees, while some
others deliberately circumvent it. </p>

in his speech earlier, MOM will step up efforts to bring about compliance
with the CPF Act as well as the Employment Act. We will do so in
two ways. First, we will step up education of both employers and employees
on their obligations and their rights. There are misperceptions
to correct. For example, one false impression is that CPF contributions
are not mandatory for part-timers and casual workers, such as restaurant
workers who only work on weekends or are only called up to help
out at large events. This is incorrect. CPF is payable for such employees.
To raise awareness, the CPF Board and MOM will launch a media campaign, as
well as intensify our outreach in collaboration with NTUC, SNEF
and other partners. Second, MOM and CPF Board will ramp up enforcement
efforts. We have increased the number of inspections since the start
of this year, and we will step this up sharply over the next five
years. We will focus on sectors where non-compliance is known to
be higher, such as F&amp;B, retail, cleaning and security.</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-4864c6d9-7933-4c02-ac16-0667dc27ca06"><!--a--></a>In some sectors, employers
attempt to reduce CPF they pay by claiming that certain payments
made to the workers are reimbursements. This may form a large portion
of what workers receive as take-home pay. Valid reimbursements do
not attract CPF. However, many of the expenses may not be valid
reimbursements. This is how some employers circumvent their obligations
to pay CPF. For example, cleaners and security officers receive
large and regular payments as laundry reimbursements. But they typically
wash their uniforms at home, rather than incur laundry expenses.
We recently encountered a case where the security guard earned a
basic pay of $745 but received a monthly laundry reimbursement of
$182, based on an income of $745. The laundry reimbursement was
close to a quarter of the security guard's basic pay, but the worker did
not receive any CPF on it. There are other examples. We will therefore
tighten up on enforcement to reduce instances of employers trying
to circumvent their obligations under the CPF Act with such malpractices.
Workers play an important role in our enforcement efforts. We encourage
workers to come together and come forward if their employer did
not pay CPF or accord them what is due under the CPF Act and the Employment
Act. </p>

a different type of challenge faced by some groups of low-wage workers
– cheap sourcing. As I have shared with Members at the debate on
the President's Address last October, a significant number of low-wage
workers are currently employed in outsourced sectors, such as the
security and cleaning services sectors. These sectors are often
subject to the problem of cheap sourcing, where service buyers award
contracts mainly based on price. As a result, service providers
bid aggressively low to win contracts, and cut costs by reducing
benefits and depressing wages, as manpower is a major cost for such
services. When this takes place, low-wage workers bear the brunt,
in terms of stagnant wages, poor employment conditions and few opportunities
to up-skill themselves.</p>

Sourcing to tackle this problem. The tripartite partners recently
released an updated Tripartite Advisory on Best Sourcing practices
that encourages service buyers to outsource responsibly and adopt
best practices when doing so. To accompany the Advisory, we also
launched an implementation guidebook to provide practical tips for
service buyers. It is a detailed guide, providing even sample text
that can be replicated in tender documents and contracts. Buyers,

for the Government to review existing non-BSI contracts and to provide
extra funding to help Ministries cope with any increase in cost
that can be expected. Sir, the Government will need to allow sufficient
time for the cleaning and security companies who intend to participate
in our tenders to meet the new requirements. The Government will
study the various options available to manage the transition. All
these will come at a cost to the Government. MOF will ensure that Ministries
are adequately funded to implement this initiative. But the Government
will not stop there. In conjunction with these efforts, we will
also tighten regulatory frameworks for the cleaning and security
sectors so that workers in these sectors can enjoy better employment
terms. So, it is not just the pay, we also want to make sure that workers
in these two sectors enjoy better employment terms. Let me elaborate
first on cleaning. </p>

require special attention. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman explained
in the Budget Statement, most Singaporeans, including lower income
Singaporeans, have enjoyed significant real income growth over the
past five years. However, a few occupations at the bottom of the
income ladder, such as cleaners, have not seen this lift in incomes.
During the Budget debate, Dr Amy Khor, Mr Inderjit Singh and Dr
Teo Ho Pin also spoke on the need to help raise the incomes of cleaners. We
can help cleaners by strengthening the Clean Mark accreditation
scheme, which is a voluntary scheme introduced by NEA in 2010 to
evaluate cleaning companies on their ability to deliver good quality
cleaning services. NEA has been improving the accreditation scheme
so that accredited companies and their workers must meet higher training
standards and productivity requirements. MOM is working with NEA
to strengthen the employment-related criteria. </p>

not work as well to ensure that training and standards translate
into improved wages in this sector. In fact, while cleaning practices and
workers training have improved over the last 10 years, the wages
of cleaners have fallen by about 3%. Fortunately, we introduced
the WIS in 2007, which helps to make up for the drop in the incomes
of this group of workers.</p>

security sector. Our focus here is working hours. Security officers
work very long hours. It is not uncommon for a security officer
to work 12-hour shifts, six days a week. This translates to a total
of 72 hours in a week.</p>

are not ideal from a security standpoint, as vigilance may be compromised
by fatigue and loss of attention. The long hours also become a barrier for
Singaporeans who are willing to work but who are unable to work
such long hours, creating difficulties in recruitment and retention.
A recent feedback that I received from a member of the public affirms
this. He talked about how the 12-hour shifts that security officers
have to put in meant less time for their families. He related how
security officers' performance would be improved if the hours were
shorter and how more Singaporeans would be willing to join the security
industry if working hours were better. I fully agree with him.</p>

can help ease the manpower shortage in the security industry. Recently,
the Singapore Police Force and WDA launched a programme to attract
mature workers and back-to-work women to work as security officers
by offering 6- to 8-hour shifts, instead of the usual 12-hour shift.
More than 150 job-seekers responded in just one job fair. I think
this is a significant reaction by the workers who want to look for
jobs in this sector. And as I said, we can do better.</p>

how we can do so and cut down overtime over the next few years,

and security services are typically small compared to overall operating
costs. One real estate company told us that outsourced cleaning
and security functions make up about 6%-7% of the operating costs
of typical offices and shopping malls. A check with a large supermarket
chain revealed that these amount to less than 2% of the total operating
costs. A hotel that outsourced public area cleaning and night kitchen
cleaning said that together these were less than 1% of its operating costs.
The incremental costs arising from these measures we are talking
would be even smaller – just a fraction of these cleaning and security
costs. Furthermore, we will phase in the changes so that they are
even more manageable to businesses.</p>

company that builds and designs natural landscapes and water features

They became more productive, and the end result was a significant
reduction in the man-hours needed. There were cost savings of about
$11,000 per month, and the workers enjoyed significant pay increases.
There has been a good improvement in their salary as a result of
mechanisation and improvement in productivity.</p>

example, this time from the logistics sector. It offers express delivery
services. Its workers have to manually handle a large volume of
consignments every day. One notable project TNT has undertaken is
the "Red and Green" system, which deploys a high-tech scanner to
verify the hundreds of parcels passing through its facility. Workers

in each sector, the wider industry can also upgrade and raise their
productivity, so that all workers in the sector can benefit.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)</strong>
                  </span>:
I received many complaints from residents in the Silat precinct
of Tanjong Pagar-Tiong Bahru division about foreign workers loitering
at the void decks of the HDB blocks. The residents felt uncomfortable
for safety and security reasons.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d2c732c3-5f68-4aa7-801c-dcfd5d32f732">
                  <a name="budget__id-d2c732c3-5f68-4aa7-801c-dcfd5d32f732"><!--a--></a>I asked the agencies why
the foreign workers were there, and I could not get a definitive
answer. So, I decided to go and find out for myself. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-db6fd440-3441-4612-b94f-f7242a2583f8">
                  <a name="budget__id-db6fd440-3441-4612-b94f-f7242a2583f8"><!--a--></a>One evening at about 11.00
pm, I went to the precinct, accompanied by two volunteers. I approached
the foreign workers and asked them why they were there.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-84ac8ecf-6eee-4dae-b231-ab3478fe3ad6">
                  <a name="budget__id-84ac8ecf-6eee-4dae-b231-ab3478fe3ad6"><!--a--></a>They said that they were
from Punjab. They had work related injuries. They were waiting for
their compensation claims to be processed, and they could not work
in the meantime due to their injuries. As they could not work, their
employers were not interested in their welfare. The employers provided
dormitory places but no food. Some employers were smarter: knowing
many workers were vegetarian, they offered normal fare, but not
vegetarian food so that they could not be accused of not feeding
them. The employers also did not pay them, so they had no money.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28d468e8-2452-4055-85f3-d8b40bff84e8">
                  <a name="budget__id-28d468e8-2452-4055-85f3-d8b40bff84e8"><!--a--></a>They therefore come to
the Sikh Temple at Silat because the temple offers free vegetarian
food as part of the charitable programmes. They save on transport
by not returning to the dormitories, choosing instead to hang around
the precinct next to the temple because of the pleasant greenery
and pavilions, which were intended for residents, but which have
now become a congregation place for the foreign workers. Some workers
had been waiting for eight months for their claims to be processed.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-63906524-fc4b-4334-85bb-7e185cb4da9f">
                  <a name="budget__id-63906524-fc4b-4334-85bb-7e185cb4da9f"><!--a--></a>Although this example
pertains to Silat, this is in fact an island-wide issue, as I have read
of similar complaints in many parts of the island. So, there are
actually two main root causes of the problem: (a) the employers'
conduct; and (b) the length of time to process the claims in the
labour tribunal.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bb36a58a-de09-4fbc-a4e1-bc2041e6138a">
                  <a name="budget__id-bb36a58a-de09-4fbc-a4e1-bc2041e6138a"><!--a--></a>I understand that employers
are supposed to give the foreign workers an allowance and food pending
claims resolutions. But this is not happening on the ground. So,
it is an enforcement issue. I would ask MOM to step up enforcement
and, if necessary, increase the penalties and disincentives for
defaulting employers. And if MOM says it needs to have information
on defaulting employers before it can act, all it needs to do is send
its officers down to the Silat precinct, and you will have a one-stop
centre with a rich source of information. But to be effective, the
investigating officers must come at night, and have Punjabi translators
available. If they need tables, chairs and a venue out of which
to conduct interviews on site at night, please let me know and I
will be happy to make the necessary arrangements.</p>

to process the claims. Whilst a few months is okay for personal
injury cases where the plaintiffs are Citizens or PRs, it is a long
time for the foreign workers with no work, no money and are dependent
on charity for food. </p>

track the foreign worker claims, in terms of investigation, evidence
gathering and hearings. There also needs to be coordination with
MOH to expedite the issuance of medical reports and with the insurance
companies for quicker processing and payouts in those cases where
the injuries are covered by insurance. </p>

                  </span> Mr Yeo
Guat Kwang, Mr Seng Han Thong, Ms Indranee Rajah and Mrs Lina Chiam
have spoken about Workplace Safety and Health (WSH), which I will now
address.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8121f5dd-3191-454b-b32f-7bd9d88fb9ba">
                  <a name="budget__id-8121f5dd-3191-454b-b32f-7bd9d88fb9ba"><!--a--></a>I am pleased to note that
Singapore's workplace fatality rate remained low at 2.3 fatalities
per 100,000 workers in 2011. We also achieved a major milestone
in September 2011 with the extension of WSH Act to cover all workplaces
in Singapore. This marks a new beginning, as we strive towards even
better WSH outcomes for all workplaces in Singapore.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a790f88a-4ede-4103-a7ec-b9427e486191">
                  <a name="budget__id-a790f88a-4ede-4103-a7ec-b9427e486191"><!--a--></a>Mrs Lina Chiam expressed
concern for the physical protection of workers collecting refuse.
These workers, who typically work at refuse collection centres and
other workplaces such as roadsides and void decks, are covered under
the WSH Act. Employers are required to take reasonably practicable
measures to ensure that work is carried out safely. They must conduct
risk assessments and ensure that efforts are undertaken to eliminate
or mitigate the risks. In refuse collection, this would include
the risk of falling objects and cut by sharp objects.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-19f17e21-d9d6-4af1-9475-2b1481f8547d">

asked how our regulatory regime compared against other developed
countries and if there were efforts to further improve it. While
the WSH Act stipulates the need for risk assessment and appropriate
measures to be taken, it is not practical for MOM to prescribe in
the law the exact safety equipment and requirements for every job
and for every workplace. Instead, similar to developed countries
like the UK and USA, WSH guidelines were developed for the cleaning
sector by the WSH Council and NTUC in 2009. </p>

the guidelines, which are contained in this booklet which we have
distributed to employers and service buyers, recommend the use of
non-slip safety shoes, boots and gloves to prevent cuts from discarded
rubbish. MOM will continue to consult the industry and the WSH Council
on the need for WSH guidelines in other industry sectors.</p>

about the main causes for fall fatalities and our plans to address
them. We have noticed a worrying trend of falls accounting for almost
half of the workplace fatalities reported to MOM, of which two-thirds
are attributed to falls from heights. Accidents resulting from falls
from heights are often a result of unsafe practices, such as (i)
open sides and lack of barricades in structures; (ii) roof works;
and (iii) unsafe use of ladders. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1952</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-18936912-8356-49c1-a2af-4710097de4a8"><!--a--></a>Over the last few years, we have made
extensive efforts to raise safety standards in this area. In August
2009, MOM and WSH Council formed an industry-led taskforce to drive
industry engagement and raise the capability of industry to ensure
compliance with safety standards of employees working at heights.
The taskforce has made a slew of recommendations, such as establishing
an Approved Code of Practice and having outreach efforts through
Safety Compliance Assistance Visits (SCAV), which we have implemented. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bd67a9b0-b193-47e0-a421-38326144d312">

Council have engaged more than 12,000 workers at over 1,800 worksites,
and trained more than 5,500 supervisors on working at heights safety. Our
efforts have seen some positive results especially in the construction
and marine sectors. Unfortunately, positive results in the marine
and construction sectors alone are insufficient. The number of fall
fatalities in other sectors increased last year. As a result, falls
continued to be the top contributor of workplace fatalities. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cf9a486d-9478-477e-be53-adce616c83f8">
                  <a name="budget__id-cf9a486d-9478-477e-be53-adce616c83f8"><!--a--></a>To bring about further
improvement, MOM will explore introducing legal requirements to
regulate working at heights practices this year. We are currently exploring
whether to mandate the use of fall prevention plans, and "Permit-to-Work system"
where workers will be required to obtain permits before commencing
work at heights, similar to the requirements for other hazardous
work such as work in confined spaces. Stakeholders will be closely
involved in identifying the most efficient and effective solutions.</p>

Kwang that support must be given to help stakeholders build WSH
capabilities and raise WSH standards at the workplace. To achieve
this objective, we set aside a $70 million fund in 2010 to drive
WSH improvements. Through this fund, we have introduced initiatives
to help companies build up their WSH capabilities, for example,
in the areas of risk assessment and building WSH culture. </p>

are trained and competent to manage WSH is a key focus of capability-building
programmes. MOM and the WSH Council regularly reviews our assistance
programmes to help support the training of workers in WSH. For example, we
are currently exploring how we can enhance the training provided
for foreign construction workers with a view of extending the Construction
Safety Orientation Course (CSOC) from the current one day to two
days. We are also piloting a scheme for this safety training to
be conducted at the worker's country of origin. Training at source will
enable companies to bring in workers who are already knowledgeable
in WSH and avoid instances where workers have to be sent back because
they fail the training in Singapore. We will leverage on our connection
and our coordination with the BCA which is already operating skills
training facilities overseas for construction workers before they
come to Singapore. I think we will be able to roll this out fairly
easily in the future. </p>

small and medium enterprises (SMEs), improve safety management capabilities
is another key area which we are focusing on. Just last year, we
topped up the Risk Management Assistance Fund (RMAF), which provides subsidies
for SMEs to seek assistance from approved risk consultant, by an
additional $11 million, bringing the total funding for the programme
to $24 million. To date, more than 2,000 companies have benefited
from the programme.</p>

extend our assistance to SMEs through a new WSH-Assist Programme.
This programme helps SMEs defray up to 80% of the fees incurred
in engaging WSH consultant to provide onsite consultation services,
assess WSH standards
at their workplaces and develop action plans to close identified
gaps. SMEs can also leverage on the programme to identify other
appropriate funding schemes that they can tap on to further improve
their WSH standards. </p>

run for the WSH-Assist Programme since December last year and companies
engaged have provided positive feedback. One such company is Heng Khwee
Heng Poultry Factory Pte Ltd. Through the WSH-Assist programme,
the factory conducted a comprehensive workplace safety review and
identified several areas which required risk mitigation as well
as the appropriate measures to address them. For instance, they
will be installing a machine guard over an exposed pulley belt which could
potentially cause injury to workers who come in contact with it.
In addition, the factory learnt about the RMAF and decided to apply
for it to help them improve their risk management capability. The
WSH Council is targeting to launch WSH Assist by the second half
of this year.</p>

like to address is on Work Injury Compensation (WIC). Ms Indranee
Rajah has raised concerns regarding the extended stay of some foreign workers
who are claiming WIC, and has suggested that MOM fast track the
WIC claim process for foreign workers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-15e8984f-4fab-49c7-80be-3e52d85ffb18">
                  <a name="budget__id-15e8984f-4fab-49c7-80be-3e52d85ffb18"><!--a--></a>Let me first assure the
House that MOM is committed to ensuring that the WIC claim process
is fair and expeditious. Our records show that 80% of all cases
are resolved within three months. The recent amendments to the Work
Injury Compensation (WIC) Act, which will take effect in June this
year, are also intended to further speed up the resolution of WIC
claims, particularly in instances where insurers are involved. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2b29a159-6208-4c68-9301-dfcb648ebe05">
                  <a name="budget__id-2b29a159-6208-4c68-9301-dfcb648ebe05"><!--a--></a>Nevertheless, there will
continue to be some complex cases which may require more time to
resolve, for valid reasons. These include scenarios involving workers
with serious injuries and can only be medically assessed after their
injuries stabilised, or those involving disputes which would require
further hearing at MOM's Labour Court. So, for such cases, it may
take a slightly longer time but, as I said earlier, we resolve to settle
the cases as quickly as possible. While these steps may lengthen
the claim process, they are necessary to ensure that both the employer
and the worker receive a fair outcome. Ms Indranee Rajah asked MOM
to coordinate with MOH on expediting the issuance of medical reports,
and I am glad to say that MOM is already in discussion with some
restructured hospitals to explore how this can be done. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-be6372f8-26e8-408d-8af1-9a8e9df81ca4">
                  <a name="budget__id-be6372f8-26e8-408d-8af1-9a8e9df81ca4"><!--a--></a>I would like to highlight
that foreign workers whose claims are being processed need not stay
in Singapore and may choose to return to their home countries. MOM
will continue to liaise with them directly and process their claims
even after they have left Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-942bd159-984a-4988-8d6c-3479cf0e78cf">

requested that MOM step up enforcement on employers who default
on the upkeep and maintenance of their foreign workers during the
claim process. In addition, to upkeep and maintenance, employers
are required to pay their injured workers medical leave wages while
they are on medical leave during the claim process. Workers who
need help should approach MOM or contact their case officer-in-charge
for assistance. We will investigate and ensure that employers fulfil
their obligations. As Minister of State Tan mentioned in the Work
Injury Compensation Act (WICA)
Second Reading speech last November, MOM is aware of this issue
and is working with various stakeholders to find a practical solution. </p>

process applies equally to all injured workers, both local and foreign.
MOM believes that preferential treatment should not be accorded
to any parties on the basis of nationality. We are cognisant that
injured foreign workers may face greater challenges whilst awaiting
the resolution of their WIC claims and, as I have said earlier,
we are presently working with the stakeholders, including insurers,
healthcare providers, employers and non-governmental organisations

                  </span>: Sir,
while the Government tries to refine its foreign manpower policies,
we must accept that foreign manpower is essential to keep our economy
going and will be needed to complement the local workforce and create
new jobs for locals. It is good that we have thought creatively
about how to maximise our local manpower. For instance, the foreign
spouses of Singaporeans who are now on Long-Term Visit Pass Plus
do not need to obtain a work permit if they want to work. Now, they
only need a letter of consent from MOM that potential employers
can obtain online. They are also not subject to levy and company's
dependency quota. I hope we can help them more by facilitating employers
to employ them, instead of foreign workers from abroad. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-38d48965-37bd-4eaf-bfb5-d18cb33abbb4">
                  <a name="budget__id-38d48965-37bd-4eaf-bfb5-d18cb33abbb4"><!--a--></a>Sir, it would be an added
benefit if we can support these Singaporean spouses, who have Singaporean
children to support, with employability training and skill upgrading. For
example, can we extend e2i employment assistance and WDA training
support to them at the same level as other Singaporeans? </p>

to retain experienced work permit holders, I will again urge MOM
to set the WSQ certification as a pre-condition for the renewal
and application of work permit. Sir, to ensure that they meet the
skills standard required, this will also elevate the service and
productivity standards as well, so as to cut down abuse.</p>

MOM to regularly review and revise the Work Permit conditions under
the Foreign Manpower Employment Act, to better protect the well-being
of the workers. For instance, currently, the work permit conditions
state that employers shall grant adequate rest daily and rest day(s)
for workers. There is no clear definition of this so-called adequate
rest and rest day. If we go by the international labour standard,
the minimum is one rest day per work week. I would like to ask,
with the passing of the new International Labour Organization (ILO)
Convention 189, would MOM make this employment condition more specific?</p>

employment source from overseas, there have also been recent reports
of many workers being exploited. I would like to urge MOM to step
up enforcement and
further strengthen legal measures and penalties against these employer-agencies
and employers who get involved in exploitative practices, such as accepting
kick-backs, giving loans and also being involved in other malpractices.</p>

I will focus on talking about the better management of our foreign

that govern the way we manage this phase. </p>

framework is important for two main reasons. The first reason −
I think it is important to highlight this − the framework was put
in place to make sure that the system works. Companies that bypass
the framework, basically, are trying to get more than their fair
share of foreign worker entitlement. What this means is that when
they violate the rules and regulations, they are essentially depriving
Singaporeans of jobs as well, and this is something that we should
enforce. Secondly, it is also about looking after our workers, both
local and foreign, and that is the right thing to do. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-fbaa5d21-a5fd-4e02-82dd-57898351d779"><!--a--></a>Firstly, let me talk about
the stronger enforcement to uphold the integrity of the work pass
framework. Ms Mary Liew expressed concerns about the effective implementation of
the revised dependency ratio ceiling (DRC), and she asked how we
are enhancing enforcement to ensure compliance. During the Budget
debate, Mr Alex Yam and Dr Teo Ho Pin also raised the possibility
of employers who hire phantom workers. I would like to inform Mr
Zainudin Nordin, who earlier talked about creativity, that now with
the Special Employment Credit (SEC), we will now also have older
phantom workers being introduced into the landscape, as companies
seek to not only just have phantom workers, but older phantom workers,
to benefit from the Special Employment Credit. So we are not short
on creativity, certainly not on this front. With that, we are aware
that this will invariably happen, and we will tighten our work pass
framework, and we know that the temptation for employers to cut
corners and bend rules will increase, but the price will have to
be paid. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e2a21ff-ae59-48d3-a97c-04dd19088582">
                  <a name="budget__id-9e2a21ff-ae59-48d3-a97c-04dd19088582"><!--a--></a>We have a duty to the
majority of responsible employers to be tough on errant employers
who flout the rules and the system in order to get more than their
fair share of foreign labour. Deterring breaches of the work pass
framework will, like I said earlier, enhance the employment opportunities
for local workers. Employers who have to pay the true cost of hiring
a foreign worker would have to consider whether hiring a local worker
would make more sense instead. We also need to take firm action
against foreign workers who themselves also try to get around the
system to get employed here. For example, some will obtain forged
educational qualifications in order to get work passes, and sometimes
with the connivance of their potential employers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-64b12f4b-e4ed-4c91-b60f-ebf48983c370">

MOM has taken stern action against errant employers who over-declare
the salaries of their foreign workers to fraudulently obtain S Passes
and Employment Passes. They collect kickbacks or they pretend to
be employing locals, or what we call the "phantom workers", in order
to boost their foreign worker entitlement. We managed to step up
our enforcement efforts despite the increasing complexity of such cases and the
need for more intensive investigation. Let me highlight this case
that has not been made public or did not come into the public's
attention. In 2011, Lim Meng Fang and Chua Beng Kiong were sentenced
to 43 months and 35 months eight weeks' imprisonment respectively
for various employment offences. They set up a shell company in
the manufacturing sector and falsely declaring CPF contributions
made to 32 "phantom" Singaporean workers. They managed to obtain
work passes for 42 foreign workers. Both also collected kickbacks
from the workers. They had no genuine business and therefore the
workers found themselves being "released" to find their own work.
In addition to being jailed, the duo and their company have also
been blacklisted by the Ministry from hiring foreign workers.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1956</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8822d3ca-f4d9-44b3-adcb-697a60fe4e05">
                  <a name="budget__id-8822d3ca-f4d9-44b3-adcb-697a60fe4e05"><!--a--></a>Apart from increasing
our inspections and enforcement checks, we agree with Mr Yeo Guat
Kwang that we need stronger deterrent measures against employers
that aim to get around our system. We are, therefore, reviewing
the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) to ensure that the
penalties for breaches are adequate, and that we hold errant employers
and other stakeholders accountable.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a970ba39-9f57-4832-b08c-1a5f25ba59ff">
                  <a name="budget__id-a970ba39-9f57-4832-b08c-1a5f25ba59ff"><!--a--></a>MOM intends to strengthen
the EFMA in four ways. Firstly, we will enhance the EFMA to crack
down on serious contraventions. Explicit provisions will be created
to define major contraventions, instead of prosecuting them as part
of other less serious EFMA offences. Some new stand-alone EFMA contraventions
we intend to create include the collection of kickbacks from foreign
workers, the use of local phantom workers to artificially boost
their foreign worker quota as well as the submission for forged educational
certificates. Secondly, we will boost deterrence by increasing the
penalties for serious contraventions, such as the collection of
kickbacks. Our current maximum penalties for breaching the Work
Permit conditions are a $5,000 fine and/or six months' imprisonment.
This is inadequate. They do not reflect the egregious nature of
such acts. Under the revised EFMA, we intend for unscrupulous employers
who collect monies from their foreign workers to get or retain a
job here to be subject to appropriately heavier penalties. Thirdly,
we are designing an appropriate mechanism to complement criminal
prosecution. This should allow the authorities to have a timely
and proportionate response for regulatory breaches of the EFMA.
Finally, we are seeking to expand our powers of investigation to
crack increasingly complex syndicate operations. The proposed powers
will largely be benchmarked to the powers provided to MOM inspectors
under the Workplace Safety and Health Act and the Employment Agencies Act.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f9091bf6-60a4-4b4a-81bb-9424ff819828">
                  <a name="budget__id-f9091bf6-60a4-4b4a-81bb-9424ff819828"><!--a--></a>We will launch a public
consultation for the proposed EFMA changes later this month and
we target to implement the changes to the EFMA this year. Even as
we effect these changes to ensure the integrity of the work pass
framework, we are also committed to ensuring an equitable balance
of rights and responsibilities between employers and workers. We
will therefore separately review the work pass conditions within
the Employment of Foreign Manpower Regulations, with a view to rationalise
and clarify the employment responsibilities of employers, foreign
workers and foreign domestic workers.</p>

rights of foreign workers, I would agree with Mr Christopher de
Souza and Mr Yeo that we need to treat our foreign labour force
decently, particularly to ensure that employment rights are upheld
and that workers are not subject to exploitative conditions. Foreign
workers play an important role in building our infrastructure, caring
for our families and making a difference to our lives in different ways.
We should treat them in a manner that reflects our Singaporean values
of fairness, of
decency and respect for all workers. We have found that, by and
large, the majority of our employers are responsible in fulfilling
their obligations, and that most foreign workers in Singapore are
generally happy and treated fairly. We conducted a fairly extensive
survey in 2011 with 3,000 foreign workers and they indicated that
workers are generally satisfied with working in Singapore, with
the majority intending to continue working in Singapore after their
existing contracts expire. </p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1957</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-95bd9dd5-a037-4754-bffb-5c0c16a93153"><!--a--></a>There are also stories
of exemplary employers who go the extra mile for their staff. For
example, Sing Moh Electrical Engineering maintains its own dormitory
with good conditions for their foreign workers. They provide free
modem and wireless Internet for workers to tap on. They also celebrate
special occasions with their foreign workers, making the efforts
to throw Chinese New Year and Deepavali parties complete with tentages
and entertainers. However, as with every system, there will be a
minority of people who are irresponsible, and we have irresponsible
employers who flout the rules and mistreat their foreign workers.
It is important to understand these are the minority. Of course,
these incidents get amplified, whether in mainstream media or social
media, but it should not colour the employment environment in Singapore.
But notwithstanding that, we have to take action against such employers.
For instance, we will continue to be tough on companies who do not
provide acceptable housing for their workers. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-621846de-27cf-49d3-bfcd-1d817ec30523">
                  <a name="budget__id-621846de-27cf-49d3-bfcd-1d817ec30523"><!--a--></a>In May 2011, the dormitory
operator ST9 Pte Ltd was found guilty of failing to provide acceptable
accommodation to their workers. They crowded more than 1,100 workers into
three factory-converted dormitories that were meant for half that
number. The company was fined $50,000; and that is the highest fine
for that offence to date. </p>

from mistreating their foreign workers, it is important that the
Ministry is informed of possible problems early, whether related
to housing, salary or other issues. We need the information and
we need to be informed. Unfortunately, some cases have had few early
indicators, such as the recent incident cited by Mr Christopher
de Souza involving 200 construction workers whose employers delayed
the payment of their salaries. Nonetheless, once alerted, MOM was
able to follow up quickly with their employers to ensure that all
outstanding salaries were paid and other alleged violations investigated.
I stress again that it is important for us to receive information.
In this particular case, we did not have any prior knowledge of issues.
We did not receive feedback from the workers or NGOs. So it is very
important, whether from the public perspective, from the workers'
perspective, from whistleblowers from within the company and the
NGOs particularly, to work closely with us. Unfortunately, from
time to time, rather than to inform us, they inform the media and the
issue is blown up. But notwithstanding that, we will still follow
up and we will still take action.</p>

role and we need to educate workers to inform them of their rights.
They need to let us know if there are employment issues early so
that we can attend to them, especially when they do not receive
their salaries on time. Feedback from non-Governmental organisations
and the public is critical. As I mentioned earlier, tip-offs are
important. We do have a system of checks and we will step it up.
As with all things, there are many companies out there, it is impossible
to check every one of them. This is where everybody plays a part
and when we do have indicators that there are issues, please let
us know early so that we can follow up. </p>

workers (FDWs). As we uphold laws to ensure the decent treatment
of our foreign labour force, we must not forget that it also includes our
foreign domestic workers. Mr Christopher de Souza raised two issues
related to FDWs. One of the issues is related to a blog with a controversial
Maid Review section, and many like Mr de Christopher Souza find
this distasteful. We would like to highlight that there are civil
routes for redress for the aggrieved party if the comments are defamatory
or in breach of a duty of confidence. </p>

Mr Christopher de Souza raised, also echoed by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang,
is related to the specific provisions for rest days for foreign
domestic workers. Let us be quite honest here. This debate on whether
to implement a weekly rest day for FDWs has been long standing and
contentious. Based on a survey conducted by MOM in 2010, the majority
of our employers currently provide at least one rest day a month, but
many do not. Since Mdm Halimah Yacob raised the issue in June 2011,
we have consulted stakeholders, including FDW employers and FDWs
themselves, extensively and considered their feedback carefully.
And we received a broad spectrum of views.</p>

with Members a sample of what some of these views are. A number
of these views have been edited and not included here because they
are fairly extreme but this would give you a sense. Some employers
felt that their needs should not supersede the needs of their FDW
to rest and recharge, and that they appreciated their FDW more after
taking over her chores on her rest day. Other employers felt that their
FDWs do not need a rest day because they have enough rest on a daily
basis, or that giving FDWs weekly rest day will make it difficult
for employers to cope when they themselves need a break during their
own days off. Fears were raised about forming relationships or potential
comparison of employment terms with other FDWs when the FDWs have
their days off. One oft-repeated concern is the fear that FDWs will
misbehave or become less compliant as a result. Some have claimed
that married couples' relationships would be negatively affected
if the FDW took time off, and that this would lead to a rise in
divorce rates or reluctance to have children. There are many other
emails that we have not talked about here. </p>

the robust debate that FDWs play an important role in the lives
of many families in Singapore. Improving FDWs' well-being has a
direct impact on the quality of care that their loved ones receive.
We need to ask ourselves: how should foreign domestic workers, who
make significant contributions to many of our households, be treated?

internationally as a basic labour right. More than physical rest,
it is an important mental and emotional break from work. We all
can attest to that. Local workers and non-domestic foreign workers
already enjoy this right under the Employment Act. We are currently
one of the very few foreign domestic worker destination countries
worldwide lacking in provisions for weekly rest days. This has led to
us becoming less attractive to FDWs compared to other destinations
in the region that provide weekly rest days, such as Hong Kong and
Taiwan. Malaysia, too, has recently included this provision in a
MOU signed with Indonesia. </p>

agencies currently use a standard employment contract that stipulates
the number of days in a month that the worker wishes to take off and
compensation for that, not all employers use the standard contract
as it is not legally mandated to do so. Employers may also find
that actually improving FDWs' well-being by giving them regular
rest days will have a positive impact on the quality of care that they and their loved
ones receive. Increasing Singapore's attractiveness as an FDW destination
will improve the supply of FDWs for employers. </p>

to better care for employers, fewer management problems and greater
peace of mind. MOM's records and feedback from non-governmental organisations
(NGOs) that provide assistance to FDWs in distress indicate that
the majority of foreign domestic workers with management problems
do not have rest days. Between 2007 and 2010, a significant majority
of foreign domestic workers who suffered work-related injuries or
committed suicide did not receive rest days. Places that shelter foreign
domestic workers reported that those who run away from their employers generally
do not have rest days. </p>

ensure their FDWs have adequate rest on a daily basis, this is not
the same as providing a weekly rest day for a proper emotional and

that a rest day provides them a much needed emotional and mental
break from work and time apart from their employers. </p>

now, but in a balanced and pragmatic fashion. Therefore, we will
legislate a weekly rest day for foreign domestic workers. However,
we will also introduce flexibility in the regulations to respond
to the needs and preferences of foreign domestic workers themselves
and their employers. The family circumstances of some FDW employers
may make it genuinely difficult for them to cope without a FDW for
one day every week. These employers may have elderly or disabled
dependants to care for. We also understand that some FDWs actually,
from their feedback as well, prefer to work on their rest days for
extra pay.</p>

have the option of providing compensation <em class="ph i">in lieu</em> of a rest day,
as long as this is agreed upon in writing by both parties. The employer
and FDW should mutually agree on the number of rest days she will
take each month, and the amount that the FDW will be compensated
for the rest days that she does not take. The compensation for each
rest day must at least be the worker's daily wage, and be paid on top
of her monthly wage. Assuming that the FDW's wage is $400, and she
chooses to take two days off, the amount the employer will have
to pay is at least $31 to compensate for the remaining two days.</p>

this grant comes on top of the existing $95 levy concession for
households with elderly, young children or disabled members, and this
is more than adequate to cover the rise in costs from having to
compensate an FDW for working on her rest days.</p>

that employers have cited is about FDWs' activities on their days
off. I think this is a very common concern, and it has got to do
with the security bond. I would like to emphasise very clearly that
MOM does not forfeit employer's security bonds if the FDW violates
her own Work Permit conditions, for instance, if she moonlights
on a rest day and gets caught, or if she gets pregnant. Even in
extreme cases where the foreign domestic worker absconds and cannot
be located, only half the security bond will be forfeited if the
employer has made reasonable effort to locate the foreign domestic
worker. In reality, MOM forfeits very few security bonds each year.
Last year, 22 security bonds were partially forfeited for missing
FDWs. This is not large considering that we have over 200,000 FDWs
in Singapore.</p>

employers' obligations for medical costs and the cost of sending
FDWs home for exceptional circumstances that employers have little
or no control over. This is part of the second phase of the review
on EFMA which I mentioned earlier.</p>

bond, let me say this. I hope that this would assure all employers,
because the fear and the concern over the security bond do shape
the behaviour of employers. I would suggest that these concerns
are misplaced and I think we should free ourselves of those concerns,
and with that managed, the foreign domestic workers are looked after
appropriately. </p>

a weekly rest day and flexibility for compensation <em class="ph i">in lieu</em>,
I believe we will be taking the correct step. It will be a balanced
and pragmatic step forward to improve the employment conditions
for our FDWs. While some employers may respond to this decision
with apprehension, we really have to ask ourselves what is the right
thing to do. In the course of our consultation, we have spoken to
many employers with pressing needs for an FDW to care for their
children, elderly or disabled dependants. Some have managed to provide
rest days for their FDW. For example, Mr Sulaiman Abdullah who stays
in Jurong. His FDW, Ms Siti Mufidah, has been a big help to his
family, caring for four children with two younger ones in pre-school.
He recognised that Siti needed a day to herself for her own personal
needs. He has better peace of mind knowing that she has a proper
break and would be more motivated to continue caring for his children
for the rest of the week. Mr Sulaiman told us that Siti has been
using her rest days to attend courses and she can even teach his
son English now. </p>

to do this; so our regulations will provide the flexibility for employers
to negotiate different arrangements with their FDW. But as our country develops
economically – I think we have developed quite incredibly on that
front - we should not cease to ask ourselves about the kind of society
we want to build, about the kind of society that we want to live
in. How would we ourselves want to be treated as employees, as workers?
We should strive to embody and uphold the right values to our children.
Because I am not sure whether we are always aware that our children
at home observe our behaviour every day, and they observe the way
we talk to and the way we treat our foreign domestic workers. This
will have an impact on their own value system and in the way they
look at life, the way they look at people and the way they treat people. And we need
to help our children learn how to treat our fellowmen correctly. This
is important because, as a society, these are issues we need to
address.</p>

different note, on the training of foreign workers to address the queries
from Mr Yeo Guat Kwang. Mr Yeo asked if we can help foreign spouses
of Singaporeans on Long Term Social Visit Pass (LTVP) with training
and job facilitation. In line with the Government's intention to
extend more assistance to families of Singapore citizens with foreign
spouses, WDA will provide such services at its career centres to
the new LTVP Plus (LTVP+) holders. They will be eligible for needs-based
course subsidies, following an assessment at the career centre.</p>

suggested making the WSQ (Workforce Skills Qualifications) a criterion
for the renewal of Work Permit (WP) holders. Currently, employers
who hire work permit holders with the relevant skills-based test
qualifications and certificates, including selected WSQ, which is
one of the criteria for assessing work pass upgrades, are considered
skilled and can pay a lower foreign worker levy compared to unskilled Work
Permit holders. This hopes to encourage employers who need foreign
workers to hire those with better qualifications and skills as far
as possible. We believe that is on the right track, but imposing
WSQ as a pre-condition for the renewal of work permit will impose
unnecessary rigidity on employers.</p>

to be put in place by my Ministry this year will help us manage
our foreign workforce better and to preserve the integrity of our
work pass system. I reiterate again that it is important to do this
for two main reasons. First, by making sure that it works correctly
to ensure that Singaporeans have the correct opportunities at work.
If companies bypass the rules, basically, they get more foreign workers
than they are entitled to and, therefore, deprive Singaporeans of
jobs which would otherwise have gone to them. </p>

                  <a name="budget__id-da862ff1-e358-4d1f-aba8-3f6daec0fe36"><!--a--></a>Second, I think by enforcing
and making sure that the system works correctly, we will look after
the workers properly. In this sense, it is not just the foreign
domestic workers, but all foreign and local workers. And that is
something that ought to reflect the kind of society that we have,
and that is the right thing to do. Therefore, these steps will be
taken and we will embark on a consultation. And in the second phase,
we will look at the EFMA in detail and we look to introduce these
new changes during the course of this year.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Low Thia Khiang</strong>: Sir, I have a few
clarifications. First of all, the Minister of State said my suggestion
to relax the dependency ratio ceiling (DRC) in some industries where jobs
are shunned by Singaporeans, will open the flood gates. I think
he conveniently forgot that I also proposed that in some industries
where Singaporeans would want to do the jobs, we should tighten
the DRC. And this calibration is done in the national framework
of a target, which the Minister of State is saying that one third
of the foreign workforce will supplement the Singaporean workforce.
What I am asking is to recalibrate the dependency ratio ceiling
and redistribute the quota based on industry specifics and the productivity
level as well as the level at which they are able to restructure
to minimise the fallout.</span>

the Minister of State be concerned that with the current process
of restructuring in which we have a foreign worker dependency ratio, the
levy plus the quota at the macro level, by using such a macro tool
to tighten the supply of manpower to the industries, it would inadvertently
increase the wage cost of the various industries? Would this eventually
lead to a higher cost of living for all Singaporeans, because the
wage cost will eventually be passed on to the consumers? For instance,
if we continue to tighten the construction industry's dependency
ratio and quota, it will result in one of the sub industries, like
renovation, having manpower supply problems. It will lead to higher
renovation costs for younger Singaporeans who got a flat and want
to renovate their flat. I think it was the hon. Member Mr Heng,
who was concerned that if we continued to tighten the supply of
workers in the cleaning industry, then the tender costs will go
up. And eventually, will we end up increasing the conservancy charges,
and people will have to pay more?</p>

I would like the Minister of State to clarify is this - how sure is
the Minister of State and the Government that the current approach
we have taken in restructuring the economy will not lead to Singapore
losing its competitive advantage, and we might end up with a stagnant
economy like Japan?</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
I would like to thank Mr Low Thia Khiang for his clarifications.
I would say that we share many of the same perspectives with regard
to competitiveness and with regard to some of the views in terms
of how we want to manage the overall workforce.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0776af3f-8570-4fc6-bda8-22c194e4d927">
                  <a name="budget__id-0776af3f-8570-4fc6-bda8-22c194e4d927"><!--a--></a>Let me address the first
issue about opening the flood gates. I think why I raised the point
was that Mr Low did mention that for certain industries where we
feel that perhaps it would be difficult to draw in Singaporeans,
we might think about easing off the dependency ratio ceiling instead
of tightening it. What I highlighted in my speech was that in many
of these industries that claim that they find it difficult to hire
Singaporeans, are the same industries which contribute to a very
large consumption of foreign workers. The construction industry
is a case in point. By easing off the DRCs in these sectors, it
would lead to having more foreign workers coming in, especially
in these industries which require many foreign workers.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-02ec2709-7dad-43f2-880a-4e08ecf3f4d5">
                  <a name="budget__id-02ec2709-7dad-43f2-880a-4e08ecf3f4d5"><!--a--></a>We feel that the system
that we adopt makes sense. Because by comparison, when we look at
the same industry in another country, the productivity level is
completely different. The Member will be correct to say that if
we were to increase the levies and no productivity takes place,
cost would go up. But the key focus of a lot of these efforts really
is about increasing productivity. We have been speaking very closely
with all the different industries in the various sectors, and they
have all fully taken on board the fact that there is space to increase
productivity. They acknowledge that there are things that can be
done. However, having operated for many years with fairly low cost
foreign labour, they have become quite used to it. So, this step
is going to be painful but we think it is necessary. It is exactly
the point mentioned by Mr Low.</p>

but this increase in cost will take place if productivity improvements
do not take place. We have spent a lot of time, both in MOM and
MOF, on many measures to work closely with industries to increase
productivity, so that even as we increase the levies, we hope to
also see that restructuring will take place and productivity increases.</p>

will increase: this is the point that Mr Laurence Lien mentioned
earlier about how we have First World salaries and incomes at the
upper end, but we are consuming services at Third World rates. Especially
at the lower wage levels, for example, with cleaners and security
guards – two groups which form fairly large sectors which employ
our low-wage workers – we feel that we need to restructure the accreditation
system and we expect wages to go up for Singaporean workers there.
We think it is important. We do not believe that the present level
of wages is acceptable. What it would mean is that we must, therefore,
as a society, be prepared to pay for these services. But at the
same time, it is not just about services increasing in cost. It
is also about up-skilling and bringing in more technology and machinery
where possible to increase productivity. </p>

going forward is this: we expect wages to go up for Singaporeans.
Obviously, with wages going up, there will be an increase in cost.
But this will not make sense if it is not accompanied by productivity.
Going forward, our main focus is to increase productivity, force
their restructuring. We know that the industries are responding.
They fully acknowledge that these things should be done. At the
same time, as we increase productivity, we hope that with up-skilling
and training, wages will also go up for Singaporeans. That is how
we intend to approach this.</p>

at length with Mr Low on how detailed we can go in differentiating
the DRCs. In fact, we had a session offline previously. This is
an area where perhaps we need to agree to disagree. We all agree
that we need to manage the overall numbers. We believe that in our
framework today – it is not just a broad instrument – we have gone
down one level to see how to differentiate and, within those sectors,
how to nuance it. That provides the boundaries, and using the levy
system as a pricing mechanism, for companies to decide how much
they want or how much they do not want foreign workers. All this
is accompanied at the same time by the whole effort towards productivity.</p>

to the Member. I think the DRC issue is something that we have slightly
different perspectives. At the broad level, I think we are in agreement. But
in terms of implementation, we feel that having operated the system
and from the feedback from the companies, we find that it is very
difficult to implement his suggestion in a very meaningful way.</p>

wish to thank the Minister of State for giving a very comprehensive
response to the extensive investment the Government is putting into
the training and development of PMEs in Singapore. That is clearly
an area that I think we are doing a lot. I would like to seek a
clarification: under our current Employment Pass (EP) system − which
is unlike the work permit system where there are quotas and levies –
it is basically working on a system where you just need a qualifying
salary and the salary minimum is at $3,000 and the relevant qualifications,
and there would be plenty of these people in the world who would
qualify for that. How do we make sure that even as we absolutely need
to welcome foreign talent, professionals to complement our local workforce,
how can we be sure that Singaporeans with the right skills are first
given the consideration for these best jobs? Also if there are gaps,
how do we make sure under our current system that employers take
proactive steps to train and develop Singaporeans for those jobs?</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">BG [NS] Tan Chuan-Jin</strong>
                  </span>: Sir,
I would like to thank the Member for the question. Largely, there
are two parts to this question. The first I will address is on the
structure of our workforce. We have basically the Work Permit and
the S Pass which forms the rank-and-file of the workforce. Then,
we have Employment Pass, which is treated slightly differently.
As I highlighted earlier, the Work Pass framework basically operates
on a system of DRCs and also levies as a pricing mechanism to manage
the numbers. The Employment Pass framework operates slightly differently,
as we specify the qualifying salaries. We have restructured it quite
significantly last year. Essentially, we have entry level at $3,000,
but it does not remain there. This level of salary will move with
age, meaning that a PME from another country coming in, say, at
40 or 45 years, will not be operating at $3,000. We would expect,
at the equivalent level for a particular industry, his salary would
have to be much higher. That is a fundamental change to the Employment
Pass framework. This would have an impact. In the past, when we
did not have this, we could end up having engineers coming in from
the Philippines who are in their 40s, very experienced, but yet
earning $3,000, $3,100, $3,200. That actually sets our local PMEs
at that same equivalent age at a disadvantage. This was a very fundamental change. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-28ea28fa-1189-43da-a7c8-d5443176fd33">
                  <a name="budget__id-28ea28fa-1189-43da-a7c8-d5443176fd33"><!--a--></a>Secondly, we have also
tightened quite considerably the qualifications criteria, meaning
that for the Employment Pass level, we do want people to come in
who will complement our workforce. We all recognise that we do need
an open and diverse workforce, not just at the Work Permit and S
Pass level, but at the Employment Pass level as well. There are
skill sets that they bring to bear. There are competencies which
we are either short of or sometimes do not have the same level of
maturity in that area or, in some cases, to supplement because we
do need the numbers. The key thing is that even as the Employment
Pass holders come in, what they do is that they create a very dynamic
and attractive labour environment where companies see that it makes
sense to invest here. Because companies come here, they set up their
headquarters here. Because it is a diverse workforce, it makes sense
to have regional headquarters here, and when these companies set
up shop here, they create jobs directly for Singaporeans and also
indirectly because of all the supporting industries that operate
in order to support these companies that are here. So they create
jobs. That is how the system works. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7f2fcf29-5289-4612-be41-1bc79fcd309e">
                  <a name="budget__id-7f2fcf29-5289-4612-be41-1bc79fcd309e"><!--a--></a>The second part of the
question is about how then do we make sure that companies give priority
to local PMEs who are equally qualified. The adjustment to the salary
level will make a difference so that when companies calculate the
costs involved, they would have to calculate the salary levels that
are expected for a particular PME coming in from abroad because
he needs to qualify at that level. For many of these foreign talents
who come here, there are also other allowances that need to be put
in place in their remuneration packages, for example, housing, other
allowances and so on. All these things have to be factored in and
companies will have to decide. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bae42acc-9c21-447b-a37e-851785941abd">
                  <a name="budget__id-bae42acc-9c21-447b-a37e-851785941abd"><!--a--></a>The approach that we are
taking is highlighted through the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment
Practices (TAFEP) which is basically to encourage positive work
spaces, for companies to be much more aware of their hiring practices,
to make sure that, at all times,
we need to have a core of Singaporeans here because Singaporeans
remain here. The EP holders will come and go. It is in the companies'
interest to have a core group of Singaporeans within their employment.
This is something we want to encourage. Right now, we do fully acknowledge
there are not just anecdotal instances but in various industries
we hear stories of perhaps discriminatory practices. This is something
that we are turning the spotlight on. We are following up on feedback
from Singaporeans. As we have highlighted earlier, when TAFEP meets
up with some of these companies, all of them have cooperated quite
significantly and we are encouraged by the feedback so far. So let
us let this system unfold, both in terms of the restructuring of
the Employment Pass framework as well as TAFEP measures. We believe
that as we focus on this emphasis, we would begin to see a movement
on this front.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, can
I clarify with Minister of State on Mr Low's concern. Will MOM be
increasing your Budget to pay for higher wages for cleaners if those
who are consuming their services and those who are concerned about
their welfare are not doing so? In short, Mr Low suggested that
if the cost gets passed on to consumers and consumers are not paying
for them, then, who else would be paying for these services? Mr
Low's contention is that the Government should be paying for the
services, for the higher wages of cleaners, that we consume their
services and we are concerned about their welfare, but we are passing
the costs on to the Government to pay for them.</p>

the cleaners working in MOM, as their wages increase, MOM will pick
up the tab to pay and we will be very happy to do so, both for our
cleaners and our security guards. I think the issue is that as we
look at increasing the wages of our low-wage workers, as I mentioned,
as a society, we need to realise that there is a correct price that
has to be paid for these services, and there are Singaporeans providing those
services. That, invariably, will be a cost that all Singaporeans
need to bear.</p>

clarification. The Minister of State talked about the Employment
Pass changes that will take place in a comparison of apple-to-apple
so that we do not disadvantage our junior graduates compared to
a foreign professional. I would also like to ask the Ministry to
consider if the Employment Pass applicant or the company that is
applying for the Employment Pass, every single time that they apply
for an Employment Pass, when the gap is really identified and exists,
that we work towards filling up those gaps, not just allowing those
to continue to exist by working towards filling up those gaps and,
hopefully, over time, those gaps will become smaller and smaller,
and the dependency will become lesser.</p>

thank the Member for the suggestion. In fact, this is exactly something
that we need to do. As I had highlighted in my earlier speech, WDA and
e2i are making efforts to better match PMEs to jobs, whether fresh
PMEs or PMEs who are already in the market looking for jobs, we
also know employers are also looking for workers. That effort will
go a long way. Today, some PMEs have given us feedback that they
find it difficult. But a lot of it is finding where the gaps are
and to see whether we can match them. This is where, in a sense,
as the middleman, we provide not just training opportunities but
we are now moving into the space of trying to facilitate employment.
This can go quite a long way. Sometimes, companies may not know
where to find the
PMEs. Because we have contact with the PMEs and the workers, we
are able to facilitate that matching and we hope that this will
bear positive fruits.</p>

Mr Chairman, if you permit me, I just wanted to clarify with Mr
Low his position. First, once again, let me say I am glad that the
Member has come to the view that our policy on foreign workers has
to keep a very sharp eye on the issues of competitiveness and cost.
These are relevant concerns. The Minister of State Tan Chuan-Jin
has given our perspective: what we feel we really need to focus
on as the long-term solution to this problem of dependence on foreign
labour and, at the same, weighing it against competitiveness and
cost. But I am intrigued by the Member's position.</p>

the Member agrees with us that competitiveness and costs are serious
issues, and that we have to think through the balance very carefully.
But I am intrigued by the Member's position on how we should go
about deciding which industries should have more foreign labour
and which less. He mentioned looking at productivity. What does
he mean by that? Does the Member mean that industries with lower
productivity should receive foreign labour?</p>

Rather than forcing all the way up by setting a certain productivity

of State Tan Chuan-Jin says, we have to make a transformation in
productivity across the board. Although you have just said we should tighten
gradually, what you were earlier saying was that we should be a

earlier, is quite different from the view you had taken earlier
on, both in your manifesto as well as in your earlier speeches, where
you had, in fact, criticised us for letting in foreign workers in
a way that basically dampened productivity and held Singaporean
workers' wages down. I have explained previously why I think you
were over-simplifying and how, in fact, the dynamic created in our
economy through our policy has led to an uplifting of wages. But
I am just intrigued at your present position, because it is quite
different from what you have stated before. </p>

                  </span>: Sir, two points of clarification.
First of all, even if you try to increase the level of productivity
of all the industries, there will come a point where certain industries'
productivity will not be able to increase to whichever level that
you wish it to be. So, those industries would probably need more
foreign workers to supplement. That was another thought I had in
mind. </p>

explained in this House before, all we have said in the past was
basically that you are letting in too many foreign workers who have
been in competition with Singaporean workers, and there are jobs
that Singaporeans can do that are taken away by the foreign workers.
That is our complaint. We have not said that we do not need foreign
workers in Singapore to complement our workers. We did not say that
before. So I do not think we have changed any position at all.</p>

                  </span>:
One advantage of me being able to sit down while Minister of State
Tan was speaking is that I was able to do a quick check on my PDA,
and I managed to pull out your manifesto, and this is what it said,
"A liberal foreign labour policy has also come at the price of lagging
productivity, forcing low-wage workers to depend on government handouts
to subsist." It also said that "Singapore should reduce its over-reliance
on foreign workers through increased automation and productivity improvements
of our local workers." I think that is a very sensible position
− that we should basically reduce foreign worker dependency through
increased automation, every form of efficiency and upgrading. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-33e0803a-288f-46ff-87f4-faf0dd80251a">
                  <a name="budget__id-33e0803a-288f-46ff-87f4-faf0dd80251a"><!--a--></a>Why not concentrate on
that task and admit that that is the key task, rather than talk of
a situation where eventually you may come to a point where you do
not have any more scope of productivity improvements? Can we agree
that we are very far from that point? Which sectors are you talking
about that you feel should get a more liberal treatment? I can imagine
which ones you are thinking about because these are the ones which
asked for more foreign labour – F&amp;B, retail, construction. I
have explained, and the Minister of State Tan has explained, productivity
is well below international standards. We know it is going to be
quite a difficult path, a very difficult transition, that we have
to make to help them upgrade. We are very well below the standards
that we would like to see and which I am sure you would like to
see so that our local workers can be paid better through higher
productivity operations. So, I think we should focus on that, rather
than pose an issue now which is slightly either misleading or academic.
Let us assume it is academic. I am trying to be very generous here.
Why do we not wait for that day to come when "you" ended up in a
situation where you cannot get any more productivity improvements,
which I do not think it will come by the way because the history
of all developed countries is that there is a continuous improvement
in productivity. That is the first point. </p>

useful, since you take this position, to let us think about which industries
you have in mind that should in fact see a reduced dependency ratio.
And I mean this quite seriously precisely because of what has been
said before that the industries with low productivity are the ones
demanding a lot more foreign workers. In order to achieve the overall
target of a slowdown of the foreign workforce inflows, you need
to be very draconian on the other industries. You get what I mean?
You will have to be very draconian about the industries. So, which
are these industries where you would like to impose much more stringent
dependency ratios?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Chairman,
Sir, I have not gone into specific industries because, as what I
have said, it is a complex issue. But at the broad level, when you
look at it, for
instance, the banking industry and some other industries which possibly
more Singaporeans would want to do the job and work in the industry,
I think we can tighten the dependency ratio. Even the Minister's
own example, for instance, of the aerospace industry which, on one
end, you probably need more high skilled labour, on the other end,
you probably need more foreign workers as it is labour intensive.
For the part of industry which we are producing enough skilled workers
or engineers to do the work, that is the part where you can tighten
the dependency ratio. That is one example. And we can look at different
specific industries. </p>

is talking about is why not we agree on the current measure of the
Government, rather than talking about dependency ratio in the future.
My concern is not only the future. My concern is also the push that
you are making now by setting a target for dependency ratio and
tightening it and, in the process, what will happen to the SMEs?
Many of them may not be able to make it and there will be a lot
of fall outs. I am also concerned with the speed of tightening.
Of course, I am not saying that we should not do that. I agree that
we should move towards the direction of tightening the supply of
foreign labour and improved productivity. But at the rate that we
are looking at, and for certain industries, I am concerned. Yes,
if they are low-productivity industries, you want to push it up,
but at the same time, you cannot do it suddenly. Because, eventually, we
will end up with high cost of living. The low-wage workers' wages
may be increased because of this productivity drive, tightening
of foreign workers, but at the same time, they also end up with
a higher cost of living. So, what is the trade-off?</p>

Sir, on the first point, I do not want to revisit the issue of whether
it is possible to go into some segments of industries, or for the Government,
either as an omniscient agent or through intensive consultation,
in other words, being receptive to lobbying from businessmen, to
be able to decide on who needs more and who needs less, it is a
very complex matter. Minister of State Tan described it as central
planning, and not far from the truth, a very complex matter. </p>

you said that some areas which are skill-intensive, capital-intensive,
and so on, they can do with the low dependency ratio, to begin with, they
have much lower dependency ratios precisely because they are more
capital-intensive, they are more automated, they are more skill-intensive.
So they are already so. In fact, then your position − which you
should come out with quite openly - is that in those areas of the
economy which already have done a good job of becoming less labour-intensive
and depending less on foreign workers, you want them to go even further.
But by the way, it will have to be much, much further because, to
explain to you the arithmetic again, the least productive sectors
are the ones that are leading to a very large increase in foreign
workers. A very large increase. The rest are flat or even declining.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-79be3805-3ae9-4317-aedd-c07de1ea8a16">
                  <a name="budget__id-79be3805-3ae9-4317-aedd-c07de1ea8a16"><!--a--></a>To offset that very large
increase, you need to have a very significant tightening of dependency
ratios in what you feel are non-meritorious industries, in other
words, highly productive. You should come out and say which are
those industries. In other words, do not just say the positive things
in order to gain some credit with groups which you feel you can
appeal to, but say the not-so-positive things to the industries
that will be heard like what you are proposing. That is what I am
saying. This is the way we go about it always.</p>

our objectives. We are quite plain about the pain that has to be
endured. We are quite plain about how we will try our best to help,
and we make clear that
there is no short cut. That is our approach. We are quite open about
it. We do not just try to set things on the positive side. That
is my advice, that be quite clear about it and state where you think
the dependency ratio should be tightened very significantly. There
is no playing around with this, very significantly, in order to
control overall foreign labour supply. I had made this intervention
because I sense that you are changing your position, because you
think that there is now some political credit to be gained by talking about
the SMEs, like we are all talking about the SMEs and you feel that
being as sympathetic as possible to them is a useful line to take.</p>

us instead in recognising that, first, we have to move forward, recognising
that it is going to be an arduous task, but we have to proceed with
this task and not be late, and not pretend that there are easy solutions

are in accord with us now: competitiveness is important, costs are
important, but the specifics of what you are saying are ones where
you are saying the nice part, the part that people like to hear

I can see the difficulty you have. I think it is quite clear that
we all know which are the sectors that want more foreign labour.
We all know. You can read the newspapers. You can read all the feedback.
We all know that the sectors that want more foreign labour are the
ones which are affected by our reduction in dependency ratios, a
moderate reduction. If you were not concerned by that, then nothing
has changed in our policies. The only change in our policies was
that we announced the five percentage point reduction in dependency
ratios, which you have responded to. The sectors which are affected
by that are well known – F&amp;B, retail, precision engineering,
a few sectors like that. That is what you are responding to. I think it
was quite a reasonable reading of what you are saying that you are
calling for us to rethink some of that tightening. You cannot be
calling for us to rethink the tightening of industries that we were
not tightening on, right? So, that was a reasonable inference. </p>

if you feel that that is not what you really meant, to be a little more
specific and straight about the matter. These are the sectors which
I feel because they are low productivity, they should get more workers,
which is a change in the position you originally had advocated,
and these are the sectors which should get less foreign workers because
they are more productive and state how much. It will have to be
quite a significant tightening.</p>

Sir, Deputy Prime Minister mentioned that WDA is doing a wonderful
job, be it training, in terms of WSQ and CET and many more training

every employer, they are forced to look into their productivity
enhancement. In order to really improve overall productivity, we
need to train all the workers in the company or in their establishment.</p>

almost as average, one-third of the population is made up of foreign
workers. At every company - big companies, small companies - there
are some foreign workers. To enhance productivity, you need to train
both local workers as well as foreign workers. Whereas in the WDA
grants, we give only grants to the local workers, but the Skill
Development Levy, which has been collected for Singaporeans, PRs,
casual workers, part-time workers and so on and so forth, including
the foreign workers. The employers are paying for their foreign
workers' Skill Development Levy but they are not getting any grant. </p>

Chairman, I would like to thank Mr Dhinakaran for the question.
I think it is a valid concern. Mr Dhinakaran talked about whether
we could fund the training of foreign workers to improve productivity
as part of our overall effort. In providing direct training subsidies,
our focus should rightfully be on helping our local workforce. Employers
who hire foreign workers should ensure that they come with the requisite
skills as opposed to coming here and then, skill up. Having said
that, nonetheless, employers can still send their foreign workers
for training and benefit from the CET infrastructure that is put
in place. They can also tap on the Productivity and Innovation Credit
Scheme when they send their workers for training and that includes foreign
workers.</p>

to the mandatory day-off for foreign domestic workers. I would like to
ask the Minister of State what are the plans to ensure that employers
do observe the contractual
arrangements. I think it will take some time for employers to internalise
the value of a day-off for foreign domestic workers and the values
that underline this treatment. But more importantly, in the meantime,
we could expect some employers to not observe the contractual arrangements
and the mandatory weekly day-off.</p>

is why I think we have decided that we will kick this in in 2013.
Effectively, we have nine months to get ourselves ready. What we
would expect following this announcement are reactions and responses
from society and various groups, and we would start raising awareness,
to talk this through. The Member is absolutely right. There will
be employers, as we can see from the emails and feedback I have
shared, who will find it difficult and awkward because for the longest
time they have been operating on a certain basis. But it is a mindset
shift that we need to see happen. It is probably a good thing to
start discussing this because it is about how we ought to treat
others, and how we should look after the people who are working
for us and working with us, living with us. And while nine months,
I agree, is not a very long time, I think we expect to see good
conversations taking place and, hopefully, that in itself would
help employers socialise themselves to get ready. But this is mandated
by law.</p>

                  </span>: Sir,
I mentioned the issue of Employment Pass holders in my main speech
in the Budget debate and I also listened to the Minister of State's
answer just now about Employment Pass, which is a different framework
from the S Pass or the Worker Permit. When we talk about the foreign
worker, we refer to the whole group of foreign workers. I wonder
whether the Employment Pass is a loophole which will allow foreign
manpower to come in to compete with Singaporeans. Employment Pass
jobs are the types of jobs that many Singaporeans can perform and
would like to do. There have been complaints in the past that the
Government has allowed Employment Pass holders to be engineers and
depressed the local engineers' wages. I also wonder whether the Employment
Pass framework is within the radar of the Government's economic restructuring
framework with the view of increasing productivity to improve the
overall economic performance of Singapore. </p>

                  </span>: I
would like to thank Mr Low for the question. I would agree that
that is one area that we are looking at. Fixing the wage levels
to qualify for Employment Pass is critical. For example, like I
explained, we raised the Employment Pass entry level to $3,000.
Part of that whole change in framework is not just at the entry level
but at different ages. The issue the Member raised about whether
it is a loophole, whether we can then have cheap engineers coming
in and therefore depressing the wages: that is something that we
will counter through these adjustments. Over time, we will not be
averse to increasing those levels. For example, if we find that
our graduates' entry level pay is increasing, we will take corresponding
steps to raise the entry level for the Employment Pass as well.
The loopholes can also be exploited by employers who then jack up
or claim that they are paying the S Pass or the Work Permit holder
a certain level of pay to qualify for Employment Pass because it
is not subject to the same kind of criteria, and then after that
claw back from a different source. That is why we talked earlier
on about tightening the whole pass framework so that these abuses
will not take place. The measures will be punitive so that companies
will be deterred.</p>

                  </span>: In
terms of whether we want to implement DRCs for the Employment Pass
holders, I would say that as we move the entry level pay higher
– for example, previously this level was lower than $3,000 – but
as we move it up, what it means is that some of the jobs that previously
were drawing $3,000 or those in the range of $3,200, $3,300, $3,500,
if one day we were to raise it to $3,500, it would mean that some
of those jobs that today are deemed as Employment Pass holders,
would then be subject to the S Pass regulations which will be subject
to DRCs. At the lower end, as I have said, that is something we
will track very carefully based on the wages that we expect Singaporeans
to be earning at the entry level when they graduate. We will then use
it as a basis to gauge. If that is required to be increased, we
will increase that. What effectively that means over time, if we
were to increase it from $3,000 to, say, $3,500, what it would mean
would be those who previously were employed as Employment Pass holders
up to that level, will now become equivalent to the S Pass criteria
and that will be subject to those regulations. But at the moment,
we do not envisage ourselves using the DRC across the board for
the Employment Pass levels.</p>

also that for this segment of the population, the Employment Pass
does bring in workers with certain skill-sets, that both supplement and
complement our workforce. We feel it is quite critical because it
brings in good companies because it provides a very diverse, competitive
workforce. This attracts not only foreign companies here, but also
keep our own good local companies here. By doing that, they generate
jobs for Singaporeans. These companies are, by nature of being prepared
to pay that level of wages, productive companies. This is important
for us because if we are not careful, exactly as the concerns that
the Member has raised, we could end up losing competitiveness and
have companies exiting.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-38aaacee-40cb-4a89-b598-bd35f25da9e7">
                  <a name="budget__id-38aaacee-40cb-4a89-b598-bd35f25da9e7"><!--a--></a>It is important for us
to be mindful. Operating costs in Singapore are not cheap. However,
companies choose to come here, and they come here because of the infrastructure,
they come here because we have an open, diverse, competitive workforce.
It still makes sense, despite the costs, to be here. When they are
here, they generate jobs for us. It does not take much for companies
to re-evaluate and go somewhere else. Which is why in the whole
calibration of the Work Pass framework, the Employment Pass framework,
it is very critical to get it right. We need to make sure that the
steps that need to be taken ought to be done. For us, whether at
the Work Permit level or the Employment Pass level, productivity
is one big area that we need to emphasise. In summary, I would say
that in terms of moving into the DRC for the Employment Pass holders,
we think that that is not something very wise to do at the moment.</p>

I would like to seek clarifications. First, Sir, I would like the
Minister of State to clarify how much investments have been made
in training in the workforce since the last recession. Two, would
MOM consider investing in sharper instruments to evaluate the effectiveness
of these trainings other than
the perceived learning that workers get, for example, where workers
say they find the training useful? Those of us with experience in
training are familiar with many instruments that measure learning
at knowledge level, skills level and impact on business. I would
like to seek clarification if MOM would invest more in that.</p>

stronger leadership in the CET (Continuing Education and Training)
for the disabled workforce, just as MOE has played a very active
role in recent years in educating people with special needs? I think
it would be a waste if these good efforts are not followed through
when the disabled persons grow up to become members of the workforce
in Singapore.</p>

                  </span>: Mr
Chairman, I will take the second question first. With regard to
this, I think MCYS will be addressing some of these concerns during
their COS. I think from MOM's perspective, we will be open to discuss
further in terms of the leadership we could take. Certainly, it
is an area that we feel we should support. Presently, we feel that
the subject matter experts should drive this and then WDA can step
in to see how we can resource it and to recognise some of these
qualifications. We will be happy to explore further as to what reasonably
we could do.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8ae935cc-4350-43c3-acb1-abdeb33a4b3a">
                  <a name="budget__id-8ae935cc-4350-43c3-acb1-abdeb33a4b3a"><!--a--></a>With regard to the first
question, I do not have the specific numbers with me now. Certainly,
CET is something that we place a lot of emphasis on and we continue
to put in good money to make sure that we train our people. But
the point is, like I mentioned earlier, it is important to know
what are our returns on investment, not just purely for monetary
analysis, but to find out whether our workers are really benefiting.
Are the wages increasing and so on?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-8841950f-77e7-48bc-83fb-107a30db1409">
                  <a name="budget__id-8841950f-77e7-48bc-83fb-107a30db1409"><!--a--></a>From surveys, we do see
that wages have increased. The numbers may not be as large as perhaps
we would like them to be. But I thought the data on the feedback
from the trainees were very telling: that many of them want to go
back and get more of this training. A lot of them feel more competent,
more capable in terms of what they are doing and I think that is
important.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-61aef2be-8511-4a33-87a0-4a315a48d978">

we have a much more specific measure, a system of measure in terms
of the returns on this investment? I think it is something that
we are continuing to look at. It is very difficult to find something
that can measure that. I suspect it is a combination of both feedback
and raw data in terms of how workers themselves perform. We also
recognise that there is also a lag time because sometimes even while you
have finished your training, it does not necessarily translate to
immediate wage increases. It may take some time. It also depends
on the industry that they are going back to. But this is an area
that I myself, and those within MOM are asking ourselves: we are
doing all this for training, sounds good, feedback is good, but
are we really extracting the maximum benefits from it? That is something
that we will continue to work on.</p>

I would like to ask the Minister of State on the point that he has
just made whether one of the ways he would consider measuring the
impact of CET is by measuring the impact of the retraining on wage
levels of those people who have received training, and not in the
short term but in the long term. Those would be easy measures.</p>

                  </span>: Yes, those are the things that
we are tracking. Whether those are sufficient to give us adequate
analyses on the returns is something that we will continue to examine.
We will also continue to see if there are better measures. We will also
track how the workers are faring when they go back to the workforce.
We would also be quite happy to have suggestions for other measures.
What we are very mindful of is that we have come quite a long way
in encouraging companies to send their workers for training. We
do not want to make it overly cumbersome such that we deter companies from
sending their workers for training. If companies feel that there
are too many things to fulfil and if they are expected to then follow
up to tell us if they are paying their workers more, that might
scare off companies.</p>

century, the events of 911, with the shocking collapse of the twin
towers repeatedly shown on TV screens world-wide and the resultant
heavy loss of lives, heralded the arrival of the global threat of
terrorism and non-traditional security threats. That threat was
brought closer home here when similar plans in Singapore were uncovered.
Fortunately, our intelligence was able to piece together reports
and arrested the would-be perpetrators in December 2001. Failure
to do so would have had dire consequences for Singapore and the
region. This incident underscored the need for Singapore to play
our part in multinational efforts to counter the threat of global terrorism.
The security threat that we are facing now is very different from
the past. How has MINDEF transformed in light of the changing security
threats? Are our current 3-G armed forces capable of handling the
new non-traditional security threats? </p>

in the region in tandem with international security rearrangements
and realignment due to the rise of Asia and the Western powers'
preoccupation with domestic economic woes. The defence spending
of the western powers will be reduced under domestic pressure and
the forward projection of forces and influence will be similarly
reduced. On the other hand, the rise of Asia on the economic front
will provide Asian powers with the necessary resources to expand defence
expenditure and extend their influence in our region. This is evident
by a report in <em class="ph i">The Straits Times' </em>headlines today about China's
defence budget. It is also evident that China has been incrementally
increasing its budget as well as steadily modernising defence-industrial
complex, which has been enabled by comprehensive military modernisation
and integration of innovative operational concepts. The net effect
is expanded and extended capabilities of China's strategic missile
forces. Against this interesting backdrop, what is MINDEF's assessment

Sir, the role of MINDEF has changed exponentially and is visible
to all. Singapore has a strong network of allies around the world.
The SAF is participating in international security and peacekeeping
operations in many parts of the world, notably in Afghanistan since
2007, combating piracy in the Gulf of Aden and providing disaster
relief to countries affected by the tsunami and earthquakes. It
is hard to believe that all these efforts, directly or indirectly,
impact Singapore's safety. As the Deputy Prime Minister and then
Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean once said: "In today's interconnected
world, threats, such as terrorism, piracy and pandemics, can easily
spread from one country to another. Concerted multi-national cooperation
is therefore vital to tackle these threats before they are transmitted
across national borders."</p>

                  <a name="budget__id-781fd3c8-4ce4-430b-94a0-91dbeba10f27"><!--a--></a>One new development in
the region is the entry of US and Russia at last November's 6th
East Asia Summit and the 19th ASEAN Summit. The Chinese viewed this
as America's strategy to contain China's growing influence. For
ASEAN, whose chief concern is peaceful, political and economic cooperation,
the presence of US and Russia contributed to the ideal of ASEAN
centrality, that is, every Member equal in status in discussions
relating to common interests and conscious of the importance of international
laws, especially maritime matters.</p>

is the rising tensions in South China Sea. Shortly after the East
Asia Summit, the Philippines protested the Chinese intrusion into
its territorial waters. Then, early in 2012, India announced its
intention to drill for oil in Vietnamese territorial waters disputed
by China. This was followed by China announcing its intention to
search for oil in South China Sea. Other parties involved in disputes
over the oil-rich South China Sea passage way include Brunei, Malaysia
and Taiwan. Against this backdrop of superpower struggles and South
China Sea disputes, is there a shift in MINDEF's role in contributing towards
the building of the regional security architecture? My second cut,

would be inaccurate. There will be no sailors permanently stationed
in Singapore but there will be facilities for the combat ships,
as he was quoted saying to the press. Can MINDEF now provide an

strong GDP growth through the years
and is a credit to this Government. However, our defence spending
is the largest in Southeast Asia and the 7th largest in Asia. It
is perceived in some quarters as being on the high side and that
this money could be put to use in other developmental areas. Can
the Ministry provide some insights to assure us that this expenditure
is absolutely necessary? Also, 96% of the defence budget is for
upgrading expenditure and the balance of 4% is for developmental
expenditure. Can the Ministry provide some insights as to the nature

Sir, in view of our ageing population and additional pressure to
spend on social security in the years to come, there is a growing
perception that the defence budget would require some moderation
in future. The security architecture in the region, in particular
ASEAN, and the relationship between militaries in the region gives
reason to be relatively positive about the low probability of outright military
conflict breaking out in the region. This is especially in view
of the national resources expended towards defence diplomacy in
particular. Most recently, the establishment of the ADMM, the ASEAN
Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus 8 in 2010, gives ASEAN an additional
dialogue mechanism with the key players in our region – the US,
China, India, Russia, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea.</p>

with Malaysia has taken on a completely new dimension over the last
few years in particular, especially with the Iskandar region in Johore
promoting greater interconnectedness between the two countries,
so much so that a train line and even passport-less travel between
the two jurisdictions have been proposed. This is a far cry from
the atmospherics in the 1990s when the security of PUB water resources
in Johore prospectively necessitated the action by the SAF to secure these
assets in the event access to them was cut by Malaysia.</p>

                  </span>: Sir, in the
Committee of Supply debate on Ministry of Home Affairs, several
Members spoke on the continuing threat of terrorism in the region.
The Home Team clearly plays a frontline role in the fight against
terrorism, but our SAF also has a pivotal role in the battle, as
it seeks to protect Singapore from threats external to Singapore
as well as from within. In particular regard, our long coastline
is a potential point of vulnerability, temptation for would-be insurgents
to enter into Singapore to commit acts which threaten the security
of our nation. I would like to ask the Minister as to how he sees
the SAF's role in homeland security and, in particular, on the protection of
our maritime waters and long coastline.</p>

Sir, the 3G SAF is supposed to be more lean and potent, utilising
new operating concepts and systems. It encompasses areas, such as
peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, administration, resource management, training,
advanced networks and also unmanned systems. The transformation
has been ongoing. These are all necessary for the SAF to evolve
and keep up with the trends and times. Tri-service coordination
and integration is also very important. The SAF has older as well
as younger new generation staff, covering a whole range of different
areas and activities from strategic duties, operations, logistics
and even intelligentsia. There will certainly be a range of learning
and pedagogy to be applied. How does the SAF plan the training programmes?
Are there online learning and courses available besides the more practical
hands-on approach? Does it utilise simulation-based learning which
is a very powerful and current learning mode? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5c4db5e7-3f35-475c-bc00-e7a11ffeb3d8">
                  <a name="budget__id-5c4db5e7-3f35-475c-bc00-e7a11ffeb3d8"><!--a--></a>With recruitment of the
younger generation, that is, Generation Y, and subsequently Generation
Z, they may have a different attitude towards learning with different
learning strategies and preferences. How does the SAF ensure that
their professional engagement and learning go on? How does it assess
continuous learning and professional
development in every soldier we have? Finally, Sir, what proportion
of MINDEF's budget goes into training, continuous learning and professional development?</p>
