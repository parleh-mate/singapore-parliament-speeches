its requirements and pay closer attention to pilots in the light

of  the recent revelation by the investigators of the SilkAir MI

185 crash.

Communications and Information Technology whether he will give a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2266</b></font><br><br>

latest report on the details of the crash of SilkAir MI 185.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and  Information Technology if he will tell the House what steps

the  Government and Singapore Airlines intend to take  regarding

the SilkAir accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications and Information Technology

(Mr  Yeo  Cheow Tong):  Sir, may I have your permission to  take

the first three Questions together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, in accordance with international

practice, the investigations into the crash of SilkAir Flight MI

185  are led by Indonesia, the state of occurrence of the crash.

They are being conducted by a competent and independent team  of

professional air accident investigators.  The investigators  are

from  Indonesia,  Singapore, the US and  Australia.   They  have

access  to  the best investigation facilities, laboratories  and

expertise   in   these   countries.    The   Aircraft   Accident

Investigation Commission has been constituted according to well-established  practices  laid  down by  the  International  Civil

Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out its investigation, this multi-national team

is  looking  into  all  relevant aspects  in  a  systematic  and

holistic manner.  This includes investigating the human  factor.

In  fact,  a sub-group of the investigation team is specifically

tasked  with  that  responsibility.  Members of  this  sub-group

include  pilots, psychologists, a psychiatrist,  and  a  medical

doctor.    The   investigation  team  has  access  to   relevant

information  on  human factors in Singapore  as  well  as  other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the team has also been looking into the

relevant  operational procedures of SilkAir and  will  certainly

report on any shortcomings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon completion of its investigations, the investigation

team will submit its final

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2267</b></font><br><br>

report  to  ICAO  and  concerned states.  ICAO  will  study  the

recommendations  and  propose  improvements  where   applicable.

Singapore  would  certainly  adopt any  ICAO  recommendation  to

enhance aviation safety.

<br><br><i>Singapore Police Investigation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware, the Indonesian Minister of

Communications, Mr Giri Hadihardjono, informed me on 25th August

1999  that  the  team investigating the SilkAir  Flight  MI  185

accident  has found indications raising suspicions that unlawful

interference may have been a factor in the accident.   Based  on

this suspicion, the Singapore Government has referred the matter

to  the  Singapore Police.  The Police is conducting a  separate

police  investigation into the matter in consultation  with  the

Public  Prosecutor  to ascertain if there  is  evidence  of  any

criminal offence.  I can assure Members that the Police will  be

thorough and professional and will also examine all the relevant

details, including the financial records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore await the findings of the Accident

Investigation  Team  and  the Police  Investigation,  especially

since the Accident Investigation Team is now in the final stages

of its investigations.  There is no necessity to appoint another

inquiry into the matter, and we should not complicate matters by

doing so.

<br><br><i>Aviation Standards and Procedures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked whether the authority will review

its pilot requirements in the light of the recent findings.  The

Civil  Aviation Authority of Singapore or CAAS ensures that  our

aviation  regulations and operational procedures of our airlines

conform  fully to international norms stipulated  by  ICAO.   As

such,  the  CAAS  continuously monitors and reviews  the  flight

operations and engineering procedures of both SilkAir and SIA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both pilots of MI 185 satisfied the licensing requirements

based on international norms stipulated by ICAO.  CAAS has  also

looked into the three disciplinary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2268</b></font><br><br>

cases  involving  the  pilot, Captain Tsu  Way  Ming.   CAAS  is

satisfied  that the safety of the aircraft or persons  on  board

was never compromised in each case, and that there was no reason

for SilkAir to ground Captain Tsu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the interim update confirms that "both pilots

were  properly trained, licensed, and qualified to  conduct  the

flight."   In fact, the Airline Pilots Association of  Singapore

has  issued a statement on 29th August 1999 to say that "In  our

professional   opinion,   these  (3)  incidents,   when   viewed

singularly  or  collectively do not  constitute  operational  or

performance-related incompetence."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our airlines also benchmark their standards against that of

international airlines in leading aviation countries  to  ensure

that  they  are  in line with ICAO guidelines and  international

best  practice.  Nonetheless, we cannot be complacent.  We  will

continue  to  review  and  upgrade our  aviation  standards  and

procedures as the best international practices evolve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me state that the Government fully

appreciates the anguish of the next-of-kins and their anxiety to

learn  the  cause of the MI 185 crash.  While the  investigation

team  has  made  further progress, it has yet to  establish  the

cause of the accident.  The team needs to carry out further work

to  analyse  the facts and findings before it can  conclude  the

investigation.   The  Government will  continue  to  participate

actively  in the investigations and will extend our fullest  co-operation to the investigation team.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Will the Minister be

able  to  tell  us  whether there is any  coroner's  inquiry  in

Singapore on this matter?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we have sought the advice of the

Attorney-General and we have been advised that in this case, the

coroner has no jurisdiction because under the Criminal Procedure

Code,  he  can  only inquire into the death of a person  or  the

finding of a dead body in suspicious circumstances in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2269</b></font><br><br>

and which is within the territorial jurisdiction of the coroner.

In  the present case, the death occurred in Palembang, Indonesia

when  the aircraft crashed into the River Musi.  The remains  of

the passengers and crew were also buried there and therefore  it

is not possible for the coroner's inquiry to be conducted here.

<div align="center"><b>NET INVESTMENT INCOME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance, since

Net  Investment  Income (NII) is considered as part  of  current

reserves, whether governments can run budget deficits up to  the

magnitude of NII (which has been about S$3-5 billion a year) for

that year, without drawing on past reserves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, as

all   NII  is  current  reserves  under  the  Constitution,  the

government of the day can use NII to fund deficits and  can  run

budget  deficits up to the magnitude of the NII without  drawing

on  past reserves.  However, this Government has not had to fall

back on NII at all for any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2270</b></font><br><br>



purpose, as it had accumulated sufficient budget

surpluses within its current term of office.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, will the Minister

consider a review of the NII?  Instead of allowing for the  full

portion to be put into current reserves, limit a certain portion

of  it  into  current reserves, since NII is accrued  from  past

reserves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I believe I have said in an earlier

sitting of Parliament that we are considering the possibility of

locking  up  part of NII, and we are studying this  possibility.

If  we  should  decide to do so, there will be a change  to  the

Constitution next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister says that investment income

forms part of the current reserves because they are provided for

in  the Constitution.  Would he be good enough to draw us to the

Article or provision in the Constitution which says this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I suggest he looks it up himself.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> The Minister stated

that  he  would consider changing the Constitution in  order  to

define  NII  or  the part of NII that goes to  current  or  past

reserves.   Would the Minister also consider at  the  same  time

changing the Constitution in order to incorporate the definition

of past reserves in the Constitution?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> NII is defined in accordance with

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  These Principles  are

well established and used universally not only in Singapore  but

in  many other jurisdictions.  So the question of the definition

is not difficult.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Clarification, Minister. I think my

question  was  really regarding the last part  of  your  comment

which  said that you would change the Constitution in  order  to

state whether what part of NII would belong to past reserves and

to current reserves.  Perhaps I was wrong in this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> What we meant was we

would try and decide what portion of NII should be locked up,

however we define it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> As I see it, Minister, if the change of

the Constitution is to define the portion of NII that belongs to

past reserves, then would the Minister also consider at the same

time  including in the Constitution the definition of "reserves"

that was stated in the White Paper?  Because right now it is not

in the Constitution.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I am sure we would do whatever is

necessary.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether there has been an increase in recent years in the number

of  corruption cases within the Police Force and,  if  so,  what

steps have been taken to solve the problem.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho</b>

<b>Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, there is no

upward trend in the number of corruption cases within the Police

Force in recent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st August this year, there were five corruption

cases where 10 officers were charged in court as compared to six

cases (involving eight officers) in 1998, three cases (involving

three  officers) in 1997, eight cases (involving nine  officers)

in 1996 and three cases (involving three officers) in 1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Police officers charged in court for

corruption averaged about 5.75 per year from 1995 to 1998.  This

makes up less than 0.08% of the Police Force strength.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Police has given the assurance that

corrupt  officers will be systematically weeded-out.  They  will

be  held  fully accountable for their actions even if  it  means

having to make their acts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2272</b></font><br><br>



public.  Such transparency clearly demonstrates

SPF's determination to eradicate corruption.  We will not allow

public confidence in the Police to be eroded because of the acts

of a few rogue officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Police has implemented a range of enhanced

measures  aimed at eradicating corruption and criminal  acts  in

the Force.  These include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, more effective preventive measures;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, stronger detection mechanisms; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, proactive co-operation with CPIB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police is fully conscious of the trust and respect

accorded  to  them  by  the public.  The exemplary  conduct  and

behaviour of officers contribute to this trust and respect.   We

will  continue to uphold the high standards and values  that  we

have set for our police officers.

<div align="center"><b>SPEED LIMIT ON EXPRESSWAYS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if

he will consider raising the speed limit on expressways.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home</b>

<b>Affairs):</b> Sir, Police and LTA regularly review speed limits on

our  roads and expressways.  In June last year, the speed limits

of  nine  roads  were raised from 50 kmh to 60 kmh.   The  speed

limit  of  10 more roads will similarly be raised to 60  kmh  in

October this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, there have been improvements made to a

number of roads and expressways and also to vehicle engineering.

Some  of  the  expressways  can therefore  accommodate  vehicles

travelling  at  higher  speeds.  Traffic  Police  and  LTA  have

conducted  a  preliminary study of the eight  expressways.   The

studies  indicate that various stretches of our expressways  can

support  a  safe speed of 90 kmh.  We have therefore decided  to

raise  the speed limit of two stretches of expressways  from  80

kmh to 90 kmh.  After three months, if drivers' behaviour,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2273</b></font><br><br>



traffic situation and accident rates are

satisfactory, we can extend the higher speed limit to other

expressways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two expressways where the speed limits will be

raised from 80 kmh to 90 kmh from October this year are the East

Coast  Parkway  (ECP)  from Benjamin Sheares  Bridge  to  Changi

Airport, and the Kranji Expressway (KJE).

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, will the Minister of State also

consider  taking  action  against slow  moving  traffic  on  the

overtaking lanes?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think the Member is referring

to  road hogging.  Sir, road hogging is an offence in Singapore.

But  Traffic  Police tells me that it is not a serious  problem.

Indeed, offenders who have been apprehended have come down.   In

1995,  there were 1,200 and last year, there were  600.   But  I

would agree with the Member that there is a continuous need  for

education and also continuous enforcement because this way,  our

expressways will flow even more smoothly.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> In the light of the fact

that traffic is light during off peak hours between 10 pm and  6

am,  would the Ministry also consider increasing the speed limit

on the expressways during the off peak hours to, say, 100 kmh?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the fact that traffic is

light and you are all alone on the road or you are with few cars

may  in fact lull you into a sense of complacency.  Indeed, cars

that go at excessive speeds at these times have resulted in very

serious accidents.  We should leave it as that.  We will monitor

the situation.  By bringing up to 90 kmh, it is still within the

safe limit.  That is important.

Ministry will review existing Housing and

Development Board (HDB) planning methodology and consider new

measures to better co-ordinate the timely provision of various

facilities and services in new HDB estates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Government's objective is to make  every  new

HDB  town  as  self-sufficient  as  possible.   In  addition  to

building new HDB flats, HDB also carries out comprehensive  town

planning for new HDB towns.  It safeguards lands for a  host  of

commercial, educational, social, recreational/sports,  religious

and   institutional  facilities  based  on  planning  norms  and

guidelines  provided by the relevant authorities.  The  planning

norms  are reviewed regularly to take into account the  changing

profile of residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commercial facilities are built in tandem with the

completion of flats to cater to residents' needs.  Each town  is

planned  with a town centre, which is developed by  the  private

sector.   It  will  also have neighbourhood centres  which  will

serve a neighbourhood of between 6,000 and 8,000 households.  At

the  precinct level, HDB will also provide some shops  to  serve

the  daily  needs  of residents. It will, as  far  as  possible,

locate  these  shops within walking distance of  the  residents'

flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these facilities have to be built in stages in tandem

with  the  increasing catchment of the new  towns  in  order  to

maximise the use of the facilities. While it is feasible for HDB

to build the facilities in advance, the shopkeepers are unlikely

to  commence operation before sufficient residents have moved in

as their business would not be viable.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Prime Minister whether

former  Presidents are entitled to some form  of  financial  and

personnel  support from the Government in order to maintain  the

stature of their former office; and in particular,

whether they receive (i) a pension; (ii) medical benefits; (iii)

secretarial support; and (iv) a small office.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   Constitution  does  not  provide  for  former   Presidents

automatically to receive pension and medical benefits.  However,

the Civil List and Pension Act provide for any person who ceases

to  be President to be granted a pension for such amount and  on

such  terms  as  Parliament may, by resolution,  determine.   In

determining  the  terms  for granting  a  pension  to  a  former

President,  Parliament  may  also decide  to  accord  him  post-retirement medical benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Parliament had passed a resolution granting a

pension  of $2,000 per month to the widow of the late  Mr  Yusof

bin  Ishak and $500 per annum jointly to his two children  until

the  younger child attains the age of 21 years.  As a pensioner,

the widow is also receiving medical benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament had also passed a resolution granting Mr Devan

Nair  a  pension  of  $5,000  per month  on  condition  that  he

continued  to  receive, and abide by, such  medical  advice  and

treatment  as may be prescribed for him by a panel  of  doctors.

Mr Nair declined the pension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No provisions for pension were made for the widow of Mr

Benjamin  Sheares, and for Mr Wee Kim Wee.  The Prime  Minister,

however, had approved as a special case, medical benefits for Mr

Wee and his wife.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Teng Cheong will not be receiving any pension as a

former  President.  However, he is receiving pension as a former

office-holding  Member of Parliament.  As for medical  benefits,

he will continue to be on the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient

(MSO) Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former Presidents are not provided with secretarial support

or an office as they cease to perform any official function when

they step down.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> May I ask the Prime Minister

whether it is possible now for Parliament to approve a pension

for the former President, Mr Wee?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we decided on not

giving  pension to former Presidents, it was with a view of  not

putting  unnecessary  pressure  on  the  budget  or  strain   on

taxpayers.  We normally look for somebody who has retired or  is

about  to  retire  to become the President, and  normally,  such

person  would  have  some  savings  of  his  own.   And  as  the

President,  the pay would not be insubstantial.  So  we  decided

not  to  have  pension for former Presidents.  This  would  also

apply to Mr Wee.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Would the Prime Minister consider to err

on the generous side because I think former Presidents are under

some  obligation  to  maintain the dignity and  stature  of  the

office.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained, the pay

of  a President is not insubstantial and the dignity of a former

President  does not depend on his financial wealth.  It  depends

very much on how the former President carries himself.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  how many students dropped out of  the  education

chain  in  1998  and the first half of 1999;  (b)  what  is  the

profile  of  the  school leavers; (c) what  measures  are  being

undertaken to keep them in school; (d) among the 5,640  students

who  dropped  out  between  1995 and 1997,  how  many  had  been

counselled  and  allowed to return to schools; and  (e)  whether

there  was  any  attempt to reach the rest of the  drop-outs  to

monitor their educational and personal development.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the number of students who drop out of our schools

has  been  on  a downward trend over the years.  At the  primary

level, the number of such students decreased from 1,022 or  2.6%

of  the  Primary 1 cohort in 1988, to 183 or 0.4% in  1998.   So

that was the difference over those 10 years, from 2.6% of cohort

in  1988  to 0.4% of cohort in 1998.  That is the drop-out  rate

from primary schools.  At the secondary level, it decreased from

1,844 or 4.3% of the Primary 1 cohort to 1,400 or 3.5% over  the

same period of time.  The figures for the first 8 months of 1999

was  114  or 0.2% of the Primary 1 cohort at the primary  level,

and  612 or 1.6% of the Primary 1 cohort at the secondary level.

The  Member  asked for the profile of the school leavers.   More

than  half  of the students who left at the primary  level  were

Primary  6  students, while a third of those  who  left  at  the

secondary level were in Secondary 3.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when students show signs of dropping out, principals

and  teachers  strenuously try to dissuade them from  doing  so.

Their efforts include counselling the students, monitoring their

attendance rate and contacting their homes when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2278</b></font><br><br>



they are absent, inviting the parents to school, and

making home visits to discuss the matter with the parents.  In

some cases, school inspectors, cluster superintendents and

educational psychologists are also involved in the counselling

process.  Where the reason for dropping out is financial,

schools are prepared to extend financial aid to the students

like our various community organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the students are not dissuaded from dropping out,

despite  all the efforts of the schools and Ministry  officials,

the help of external agencies, for example, the Self-Help Groups

and the Voluntary Welfare Organisations, is also sought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 5,757 students, this is the second last part of the

Member's  question, who dropped out at the primary and secondary

levels  between 1995 and 1997, 8% have returned to  school.   As

for  the  last part of the Member's question, the Ministry  does

not  track  the  educational or personal development  of  pupils

after  they have dropped out of school.  Instead, the Ministry's

focus  and the focus of the schools are to try and counsel  them

so  that  they do not drop out or leave school and that they  do

remain in school.

being taken to encourage these children to return to school; and

(d)  whether  Patricia Chay is now back in school and,  if  not,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline Wong):

Minister Teo  had earlier addressed the question on the trend in

dropout  rates,  and  the measures taken by our  principals  and

teachers when students show signs of dropping out from school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Patricia Chay, the school has been working

1995  and  July 1999 on (a) how many were expelled and for  what

reasons;  (b)  how many voluntarily withdrew and what  were  the

causes;  (c) how many eventually got readmitted to schools;  and

(d) how many overaged children are currently on waiting list for

readmission to schools.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the period

January 1995 to August 1999, an average of 24 students per  year

were expelled from primary or secondary schools.  As you can see

from  the  numbers, schools rarely expel pupils, and only  as  a

last  resort,  when  these  pupils  are  recalcitrant  and  have

committed  serious  offences.  Before  this  stage  is  reached,

however,  schools  would have counselled such pupils  and  their

parents, and put in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2280</b></font><br><br>



the utmost effort to correct pupils' behaviour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already addressed the issue of how many voluntarily

withdraw from school, and the proportion who are eventually  re-admitted, in my response to a question on the previous occasion.

The  Ministry of Education allows students who have dropped  out

from  school  to return, so long as they are not more  than  two

years above the correct age for the particular level.  This rule

is  put in place because children who are much older than  their

classmates often have great difficulty fitting in socially.  But

as  I  explained  at  the last sitting, we  also  do  make  some

exceptions  and  these  exceptions are made  on  a  case-by-case

basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our schools do not keep a waiting list for

overaged  students  who want to be re-admitted.   In  any  case,

there  is  no real shortage of school places and those  who  can

gain admission or re-admission will be admitted.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Could the Minister consider,

instead  of adopting an ad-hoc approach, broadening and relaxing

the  two years overage limit if VWOs and schools are willing  to

help and admit these students to mainstream schools; and if  the

Ministry is willing to relax this as a policy, could we  try  to

implement this in the year 2000 to arrest the attrition rate?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two years is actually

quite  reasonable and, as I explained earlier and  also  at  the

last  sitting, we do make exceptions for such cases.   In  fact,

because  of  our streaming system, we do actually have  quite  a

variety  of  ages  at  particular  levels.  For  example,  those

students who need four years to take their 'O' levels take it in

four  years;  those who need five years take five years.   Those

who  need  two years to do their 'A' levels do it in two  years;

those  who  need  three years do it in three  years.   In  fact,

within  the  school  system already, there is a  differentiation

possible within each course of study that the student takes  for

different  ages to be there. And on top of that, there  is  also

the possibility for students who are two years above that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2281</b></font><br><br>



age to be admitted into the system and we do make

exceptions as well if there are good reasons for those students

to be back in school. So there is a considerable amount of

flexibility already built into the system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Goh Choon

Kang -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. To ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether Pulau

Ubin  has  become  a  temporary hideout for  illegal  immigrants

intending to smuggle into the main island of Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Question No. 14, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home</b>

<b>Affairs):</b> Sir, there is no indication that Pulau Ubin is being

used  as  a  temporary hideout by illegal immigrants wanting  to

come into the main island of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were only three occasions when illegal immigrants

landed  on  Pulau  Ubin in recent years, one  case  involving  a

single  illegal  immigrant in 1998 and two  cases  involving  10

illegal  immigrants  in  August  this  year.   All  the  illegal

immigrants  were arrested by the Police Coast Guard  (PCG)  soon

after landing on Pulau Ubin.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police investigations revealed that these illegal

immigrants were left to fend for themselves on the island by the

smugglers.  Police have also ascertained that the smugglers

landed the illegal immigrants on the island by deceiving them

that it was part of Singapore island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Coast Guard will continue to maintain close

watch  over  Pulau  Ubin.  Through its Pulau Ubin  Police  Post,

Police  will  continue  to work closely with  the  residents  to

detect  any  suspicious characters there.  Given the terrain  of

the  island  and the close co-operation between the  Pulau  Ubin

islanders  and Police, illegal immigrants will not find  a  safe

haven there.

<div align="center"><b>KRA CANAL IN THAILAND</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on viability of Singapore ports)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and Information Technology whether the development and operation

of  the  Kra  Canal in Thailand is likely to have a  substantial

impact on the viability of ports in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications and Information Technology

(Mr  Yeo  Cheow  Tong):  Sir, the idea to build a  canal  across

Southern  Thailand  linking the Andaman Sea  with  the  Gulf  of

Thailand was apparently first conceived in Thailand as far  back

as  the 18th century. Since then, the proposal has been reviewed

from  time  to time.  One main issue surrounding the project  is

its  high cost, recently estimated at 810 billion baht or  about

S$35  billion.  There are also concerns about the impact of such

a project on the environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there has been renewed discussion on the Kra Canal

project  recently, the Thai government has yet to  come  to  any

decision.   According to a report in the Business Times on  28th

August,  Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told reporters  that,

and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There is no plan to build the canal for now. It is still

being studied and it is not a simple issue."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2283</b></font><br><br>



However, if the project were to finally proceed and

a shipping route across Southern Thailand established, the Canal

would undoubtedly divert some shipping away from the Malacca

Straits and Singapore Straits. These would be mainly ships which

transit the Straits without intending to call at our port.

However, as Singapore is a major shipping hub, the majority of

vessels at our port come here to discharge and load cargo,

undergo repairs and take bunkers, ship stores, water and other

materials.  Hence, the challenge for PSA depends not on whether

there is a Kra Canal, but on whether we remain competitive as a

shipping hub which ships choose to come to because it makes good

economic and business sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without the Kra Canal, PSA faces intense regional and

international  competition.  Therefore, we never  take  our  hub

port  status  for granted. Our port must always be  prepared  to

face  new  challenges  and  be  proactive  in  maintaining   its

competitiveness. This is why PSA continually strives  to  ensure

that  it  delivers the highest level of service  at  competitive

rates,  and  that it has excellent connections to ports  in  the

region  and  worldwide.  In  addition,  the  Maritime  and  Port

Authority  of  Singapore is also working with relevant  agencies

such  as  the Trade Development Board to see how we can  further

develop Singapore as an international maritime centre.

<div align="center"><b>(Socio-economic disparity)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development  (a) what is the assessment of his Ministry  on  the

socio-economic   disparity   between   the   cosmopolitans   and

heartlanders  of our population; (b) whether this socio-economic

disparity  is fast growing as a result of our globalisation  and

injection  of  foreign  talent into our society;  and  (c)  what

strategic  measures are being taken by his Ministry  to  counter

this disintegrating factor of our multi-racial society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2284</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr

Abdullah Tarmugi):  Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Prime Minister

used the terms "cosmopolitans" and "heartlanders" of our

population, he was referring to the outlook of two broad

categories of people and reiterated that both were important to

Singapore's well being.  Each has its own distinct contribution

to our society.  For example, the heartlanders play a major role

in maintaining the core values and our social stability and give

us our Singapore brand name. Cosmopolitans, on the other hand,

extend our economic reach and help Singapore to run as an

efficient, high performance society.  We should not look at

cosmopolitans and heartlanders in terms of socio-economic status

as this is not an issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important is that we must pay attention to

community  bonding and help all Singaporeans to understand  each

other  and their contributions.  The promotion of social harmony

must be the concern of all sectors of Singapore society and  not

just  the  Government.  We want all Singaporeans of  all  income

groups,  races  or religions to be one people  and  have  common

shared  values.  Some of the ways that are in place  to  promote

integration  in  our society already exist such as  volunteerism

and mutual help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry, CDCs, grassroots and self help organisations

and  voluntary welfare organsations have various programmes that

bring  our  people together to care and share with one  another,

their  time, resources and expertise, and in the process  foster

and strengthen ties.  Our National Education Programme will also

develop  better  understanding and  instinctive  bonding  across

races  starting  from the young.  All these  will  work  towards

strengthening community bonding.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Is the Minister aware that

by   the  way  the  heartlanders  and  cosmopolitans  are  being

portrayed and reported in the mass media, it has given  rise  to

the perception or impression that cosmopolitans and heartlanders

are two different classes of Singapore citizens in our society?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, as the Member states,

the media portrays them as such, not the Government.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Would the Minister

disclose,  by the Government's definition, how many  percent  of

Singaporeans  fall in the class of heartlanders;  and  how  many

percent consider themselves cosmopolitans?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I am sure when the Prime

Minister  made  that  statement, he was  not  referring  to  any

proportion  of  the Singapore society which falls  under  either

category.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that there is

a  recent  survey,  a  gallup  poll  survey,  that  65%  of  the

respondents    considered    themselves    heartlanders     and,

interestingly  enough, 35% considered themselves  cosmopolitans.

Would he comment on this?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I am not too familiar with that

survey.   But if 65% call themselves heartlanders and  35%  call

themselves cosmopolitans, so?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2286</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the 12 companies which qualified for

the scheme before May this year, incremental sales turnover

resulting from approved brand projects is estimated at about

S$42 million for the period 1997 to 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One successful story of a Singapore company which has used

aggressive  branding to gain market share is Tat  Hui  Food  Pte

Ltd.  With the assistance provided by BRANDAS, Tat Hui  launched

its own range of instant noodles, "Yummy Yoodles", in Australia.

"Yummy  Yoodles"  today has become the third best-selling  brand

among  its class of products in Australia with about 15%  market

share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to see more success stories in time, as brand

development is a time-consuming effort.  Currently, 14 of the 17

approved  applicants are only within their first  two  years  of

<div align="center"><b>MOVING TO NEW CHAMBER</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, at its last meeting before it moves

to  its  new Chamber across the yard, (1) notes the progress  in

establishing  the  system of parliamentary democracy  since  its

early beginnings in this Chamber on 22nd April 1955; (2) records

its  appreciation for the contributions made by past Members  in

establishing the confidence the electorate has in its  integrity

and  the openness of its proceedings; and (3) urges present  and

future  Members  to  build  on  the  accomplishments  of   their

predecessors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's move to the new Parliament building not only

reflects  Singapore's  success and progress  as  an  independent

country,  it also symbolises the entrenchment of our  system  of

parliamentary democracy as a key institution of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relocation of Parliament to the new Chamber at the

adjoining  site is born out of necessity.  This old Chamber  has

been  the seat of Singapore's Legislature since 1955.  The  1955

Legislative  Assembly consisted of only 25  elected  Members,  4

Nominated Members, 3 ex-officio Members and the Speaker,  making

a  total of 33.  By 1997, Parliament has increased in size to 93

Members, including 9 Nominated and 1 Non-Constituency Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present building, over a period of time, had undergone

several renovations to accommodate the increase in the number of

Members  and the accompanying support services, such as  library

and  administration, as well as increased space for TV  and  the

press.   It  was  not possible to expand this  elegant  but  old

building  to meet the needs of our future growth, including  the

use of information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2288</b></font><br><br>



technology in the Chamber.  Hence, the Government

decided to build a bigger Parliament House in 1992.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Parliament House has a Chamber for 100 Members,

with room for another 20, if needed.  It will also be a place of

interest  for students and the general public.  It has amenities

to bring Parliament closer to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the standards of modern buildings in Singapore today,

the   new   Parliament  building  is  modest   with   functional

furnishing.   It is certainly not a monument to  feed  our  ego.

Nevertheless,  it  has captured the dignity of  the  institution

that  it  symbolizes.   It  is a worthy  successor  to  the  old

Parliament House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take this opportunity to record the Government's

appreciation  to  everyone  involved  in  this  major   national

project,  especially  the  architects,  engineers,  contractors,

clerks   of   work,  technicians,  workers  and  the  Parliament

Secretariat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will no doubt miss this old Chamber. I am happy

that  we  will not be leaving everything in this Chamber  behind

when  we  leave  this place.  One small but  symbolic  piece  of

heritage we will bring along to the new building is the Mace  of

Parliament.   We  have inherited it from the  First  Legislative

Assembly.   It will continue to be the symbol of the  inviolable

authority  of Parliament and the Speaker, and remind us  of  our

Parliamentary roots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking for myself, I must say that I am leaving this

place with fond memories.  When I first entered this Chamber  23

years  ago, I sat in the far corner where Chuang Shaw  Peng  now

sits.   Next  to me were Rahmat Kenap from Geylang Serai  and  N

Govindasamy  from  Radin Mas.  Both good men have  since  passed

away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were 11 of us in the 1976 class of new MPs. Now,

only four of us are left  -  the Speaker, Dr Ow Chin Hock, Sidek

Saniff  and  myself.   We are quickly acquiring  the  status  of

senior citizens, politically speaking that is.  Among the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>93&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members in Parliament today, only Senior Minister

has been in this House for a longer period than the four of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My maiden speech on the Motion of Thanks to the President

for  his  Address at the Opening of Parliament in February  1977

was  heavy  on  economics.  Coming from  a  "technocrat"  turned

politician,  this was to be expected.  I spoke on  the  need  to

increase  our  domestic exports, the problem of job-hopping  and

shipping.   I  argued that Singapore should aim to  be  a  world

transhipment centre instead of just a "regional warehousing  and

transhipment   centre"   which  was   what   the   Ministry   of

Communications wanted.   This basic theme, that we need to  look

beyond the region, and go global, has become even more important

now that the global economy is one single, seamless marketplace.

This was indeed my focus in this year's National Day Rally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same session, I was enthralled by Prime Minister

Lee's 3 1/2-hour marathon speech on a range of political issues.

At  the end of his speech, he posed a riddle on psephology.   He

compared the election result of Marine Parade with Buona Vista's

and asked why the PAP's performance in Marine Parade, a new town

with  the "mostest" number of 5- and 4-room flats and no  1-room

flats,  was  not  as good as that  in Buona Vista,  another  new

estate  with more than a thousand 1-room flats.  Both  the  late

Ang  Kok  Peng  and  I  had weak opposition candidates.   Marine

Parade  received 76% of the total votes cast while  Buona  Vista

received  80%.   That was my first lesson in  understanding  the

factors, including race, of why Singaporeans voted the way  they

did.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, forging a strong nation out of our multi-ethnicity

and diversity is an even greater challenge for us than

Singapore's economic competitiveness.  We have learned valuable

lessons from the racial riots of the 1960s.  Parliament has

incorporated various safeguards into our laws to preserve

religious and racial harmony.  But social cohesion and managing

differences between different racial, religious and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2290</b></font><br><br>



income groups in society are something we have to

work assiduously for.  Our fundamental challenge is to build

ties among the people and emotional bonds to this country.  So,

when I spoke on the Motion of Thanks to the President, 20 years

later, at the 1997 Opening of Parliament, my focus was on the

need for Singapore to develop "heartware", not just economic

competitiveness.  I am glad that this has led to the adoption of

the Singapore 21 vision for making Singapore our best home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in 1953, the Rendel Commission recommended a

Legislative  Assembly with an elected majority and a ministerial

form  of  government  to  pave the way  for  self-government  in

Singapore.  This led to the first multi-party elections for  the

Legislative  Assembly in 1955.  It was the birth of  Singapore's

system of parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, this Chamber has hosted 3 Legislative

Assemblies  and 9 Parliaments.  Among us today, Senior  Minister

is the only Member who has been in this Chamber since 1955.  The

many  speeches that he has made in this House, spanning a period

of  44  years, are a record of the political history  of  modern

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for the first Legislative Assembly from 1955 to

1959,  the PAP has been the ruling party in the Legislature  for

an uninterrupted period of 40 years.  In fact, for 16 long years

between  1965  and 1981, there was not even a single  Opposition

Member  in  Parliament.   After  13  Members  from  the  Barisan

Sosialis  boycotted  Parliament  in  1965,  the  PAP  won   four

successive  general elections between 1968  and  1980  in  clean

sweeps.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This extraordinary situation came about because the PAP

governed  in  the best interests of Singapore and  Singaporeans.

The  people trusted the PAP and the PAP, in turn, returned their

trust by delivering results for the country and the people.   We

must never betray the trust the people have reposed in us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong support of the people for the PAP Government

provided the political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2291</b></font><br><br>



stability so crucial for economic growth and nation

building, especially in our early days of independence.  We were

able to consolidate our young nation and build a strong

foundation for the future.  It has also enabled the ruling party

to take a long-term view in planning and implementing public

policies and programmes.  This is an advantage which most

Governments in other democracies do not enjoy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this historic occasion, when we move from the old

building  to  the new, permit me to make some observations  from

our  experience  of parliamentary democracy, which  the  British

established  by three Orders of the Queen in Council,  in  1955,

1959   and   1963.   After  we  separated  from  Malaysia,   our

Constitution  has  been  based on the provisions  of  the  State

Constitution  prescribed  by the 1963  Order  by  the  Queen  in

Council  and  many of the fundamental articles of the  Malaysian

Constitution that we had adopted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first observation: clean general elections are critical

to  the  political governance of Singapore.  The electorate  has

confidence  that  all  our  elections  were  fairly  and  openly

conducted.   There  was  no money politics.   They  trusted  the

system.  As a result, every MP is seen by the electorate  to  be

not  only  his  legal but also his legitimate representative  in

Parliament.  He is respected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep our politics clean for so long is no mean

achievement.  The ruling party has not gone corrupt despite  the

absence  of  a  strong  opposition.   In  some  countries  which

professed   to  be  parliamentary  democracies,  elections   are

frequently marred by violence, money politics, and all sorts  of

political chicanery.  The result is what the Indonesians  called

KKN - corruption, cronyism and nepotism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the ruling party's policy to self-renew its MPs at

every  general election has made Parliament relevant to changing

circumstances  and  the expectations of each new  generation  of

Singaporeans.   Self-renewal  has become  an  accepted  fact  in

Singapore, not just in Parliament but also in the Civil Service,

SAF and the Singapore Police Force.  We consciously



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2292</b></font><br><br>



and systematically head-hunt for younger people with

promise to nurture, develop and take over from us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe a big debt here to the Old Guard PAP Ministers and

MPs.   They  risked  their lives in the  struggles  against  the

communists  and  communalists, planted  the  metaphorical  tree,

looked after it, but did not stay on to enjoy the fruits.  Their

dedication, sacrifice and commitment to the long-term  interests

of Singapore are values which present and future Members of this

House must emulate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a key strength of democracy can also turn out to be

a  major  weakness.   Almost  anyone  above  21  can  stand  for

election.   But  it  never ceases to amaze me  that  people  are

prepared  to entrust their and their country's destiny  to  some

unknowns,   regardless  of  their  competence,  commitment   and

character.   To  be a SAF officer, a lawyer, an  accountant,  an

engineer,  or  an  economist, you have to pass stringent  tests.

But  there  are  no qualifying tests, no legal requirements  for

quality  control,  for  anyone who  aspires  to  be  a  people's

representative.  That this Parliament has a high reputation  for

efficiency,  effectiveness and integrity,  is  not  the  natural

order  of  things.  It is the result of the PAP's high standards

and  its stringent screening of its candidates.  Even then, from

time to time, a mistake is made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In politics, either the good keeps out the bad or the bad,

like a bad currency, will drive out the good.  Mr Chiam See Tong

is  living proof of this adage.  He has been driven out  of  his

former  party  by a bad currency.  Woe betide the day  when  bad

currencies  get  into  Parliament.  Never think  it  will  never

happen.   Hence, in anticipation of this doomsday  scenario,  we

have put in place the institution of the elected Presidency with

custodial  powers  over our past reserves and  key  appointments

made  by  the  Government  to  safeguard  Singapore's  long-term

interests.   But  the  best safeguard is  within  the  political

parties  themselves.  They must set high standards so that  only

competent,  honest and deserving candidates are put  before  the

voters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2293</b></font><br><br>



Finally, let me stress that our parliamentary

democracy has worked because, over the years, we have carefully

made adaptations and modifications to the system which we had

inherited.  Let me recap some of these changes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1969: We introduced the institution of the Presidential

Council  for  Minority Rights to ensure that there  will  be  no

discriminatory legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1984: We introduced the concept of Non-Constituency MP

to  ensure that whatever the outcome of Parliamentary Elections,

there will be some opposition MPs in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1987: We introduced the Government Parliamentary

Committees (GPCs), and the GPCs, backed by resource panels, have

brought a sharper focus to debates in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1988: We established the concept of Group

Representation  Constituency  to  ensure  that  Parliament  will

always have elected representatives from minority groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1990: We established the concept of Nominated MPs.

NMPs  bring  to  Parliament  debates viewpoints  different  from

Government  MPs  and  Opposition MPs.   In  the  same  year,  we

established the institution of Elected President with  custodial

powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, Mr Speaker, while the British gave us a good

political  system, we have not hesitated to shape and mould  our

parliamentary democracy, our procedures and our institutions  to

take into account our political, cultural, social and democratic

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These innovations are complemented by similar steps outside

Parliament  which enable Singaporeans to be part  of  the  civic

society  and  the  body politic.  Grassroots organisations  like

CDCs, CCCs, RCs, Neighbourhood Committees, Town Councils and the

Feedback Unit give



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2294</b></font><br><br>



thousands of Singaporeans a role to make Singapore a

better place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Government, I want to

express  our appreciation to past and present Members,  PAP  and

non-PAP,  for their contributions to our system of parliamentary

democracy.  I also urge present and future Members to  build  on

the   accomplishments  of  their  predecessors.    Parliamentary

democracy  has  worked  well  in  Singapore.   It  has  won  the

confidence of the electorate because of the integrity,  openness

and  effectiveness  of  its  proceedings  and  the  honesty  and

competence of MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of this House, we must continue to strengthen it

as  a  key  political  institution in Singapore.   We  have  the

responsibility  to  ensure that the system  not  only  functions

effectively  but  also serves the needs of our  people.   Public

respect  for  Parliament will be preserved  only  if  we,  their

representatives, are worthy of their trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. [Applause]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you also for giving me this opportunity to speak

because  I  am  only five months after the PM  in  joining  this

Parliament 22 years ago, and I guess this says a lot about that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years since our independence in 1965, this House has

witnessed  debates  of  all  major policies  introduced  by  the

Government  and legislation that gave effect to these  policies.

They  include  national service, health, education and  housing.

From time to time, we had to grapple with economic problems.  On

each  occasion,  there was full debate not only on  the  general

principles but also on details, much of which were dealt with by

the Select Committees set up for this purpose.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2295</b></font><br><br>

One outstanding feature of all these debates is that PAP

backbenchers took the initiatives to query Government Ministers

on all major aspects of these policies.  The lack of opposition

in Parliament, which is no fault of the PAP, did not make the

debates less lively or substantial. Who can forget Mr Ho See

Beng and the late Mr Fong Sip Chee who engaged virtually every

Minister and made them work extra hard to answer their

questions.  Members may know that Mr Ng Kah Ting was the

champion for filing questions across all Ministries during

Budget time.  Dr Augustine Tan regaled the House with his

discourse on economics.  There was also Mr Lawrence Sia who took

on Dr Goh Keng Swee on matters of education.  Lucky for him, he

was always mistaken for Mr Sia Kah Hui.  That is why he stayed

on long after Mr Sia Kah Hui retired.  Even our Speaker, Sir,

yourself, when you were a backbencher, was also noted for your

contributions until you were asked not to speak when you took on

this appointment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1990s, we are not short of outspoken MPs either. Dr

Tan  Cheng  Bock is a shining example.  Mr Peh Chin Hua  and  Mr

Heng  Chiang  Meng  made  their marks and  took  the  Ministers'

"dressing down" in their stride.  On the lighter side,  who  can

forget  Members who were trying not to fall asleep in the House,

and  for  those  who  did, were caught  by  the  very  efficient

microphones in the sound system.  I hope the sound system in the

new  Parliament  would  not  be as good.   The  introduction  of

television, thankfully, put paid to this practice.   Although  a

few Members, I am told, still could not resist the urge and were

caught on the camera.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, though, the debates in the House demonstrate

without  a doubt that democracy is practised and is seen  to  be

practised.   PAP  MPs have not been afraid to speak  out.   More

than  that,  they  have contributed fully to the  deliberations,

regardless of the presence of Opposition MPs, NMPs or NCMPs.  As

the Prime Minister has said, I am very confident that all of  us

would  take  with  us fond memories of this House  and  we  will

reinforce our commitment to carry on this fine tradition to  the

new Chamber.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2296</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to speak on this motion moved by the

Prime Minister which I fully support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its exalted 44 years of existence, this Chamber has

witnessed numerous tumultuous periods in Singapore's history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recognised that great and significant personalities,

such  as past and present Speakers, Prime Ministers such  as  Mr

Lee  Kuan  Yew  and  Mr Goh Chok Tong, Ministers  and  MPs  have

honoured  this House with their memorable and historic speeches.

Every  single word uttered in this House was faithfully recorded

in the Hansard.  This occasion of the "Moving to New Chamber" is

indeed an appropriate occasion to honour all of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I thought it would also be quite meaningful for me, as

a  backbencher,  to take this occasion to speak briefly  on  two

issues.   The  first  is  the excellent parliamentary  democracy

evolved and established in the past 44 years, and the second  is

to  speak  in honour of the many backbenchers, past and present,

who  have  done  their fair share towards the  creation  of  our

unique Singapore parliamentary process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As PAP MPs, in the typical tradition of Westminster

Parliamentary system, it should be our primary task to help  PAP

Ministers  to  take on the Opposition MPs.  But because  of  the

lack  in  number of Opposition MPs in this House in the past  25

years,  PAP backbenchers had the unusual task on many  occasions

to   join  the  Opposition  side,  and  play  a  major  role  to

scrutinise, and sometimes even critically comment on  Government

policies and Bills presented by Government Ministers.  In  fact,

due to the lack of seating places, the PAP MPs of Singapore have

this very un-Westminster format of sitting opposite and face-off

our own Government Ministers.  Moreover, to allow for more focus

on  debates of the Ministerial portfolios, as the Prime Minister

has  said,  the  Government created the Government Parliamentary

Committees (GPC) so that PAP MPs can form into small  groups  to

shadow various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2297</b></font><br><br>



different Ministries.  In addition, we also created

non-elected MPs such as NCMPs and NMPs to provide more avenues

for debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our parliamentary structure has indeed become a unique

Singapore-style  parliamentary democracy.   These  changes  have

contributed to the confidence of the electorate to the  openness

and  integrity of proceedings, as stated in the Prime Minister's

motion.   It  is  a  proud Singapore tradition  that  should  be

carried through to the new Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Frontbench Prime Minister, Ministers and

Parliamentary Secretaries are the initiators of the Government's

programmes and improvements, therefore they rightly deserve  the

recognition,  I  feel that it is also very meaningful  for  this

motion  to record our appreciation for the contributions of  all

past  Backbenchers,  both  from the  PAP  and  Opposition.   The

Backbenchers are the unsung heroes who have equally  contributed

to the exemplary and honourable image of this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from my past 15 years of membership of this august

Chamber,  I can recall many notable and memorable speeches  made

by Backbenchers and Ministers.  In fact, my first year as Member

of   this  House  in  March  1985  (some  14  years  ago),   the

Presidential Debate was led by our colleague, Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

He  made  a remark that is still etched very deeply in my  mind.

Dr Tan advised us, novice Backbenchers then, "to speak our minds

and  let  conscience be our guide", and never mind if you  incur

"parliamentary wounds".  True to his words, Dr Tan has, to  this

day, spoken his mind.  He has raised many significant issues for

debate  in  this  House.   He  has suffered  many  parliamentary

wounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Dr Tan, many Backbenchers have also spoken honestly

and  boldly in this Chamber.  Mr Speaker, Sir, you yourself have

been noted as a vocal Backbencher while you were sitting here on

this  side of the floor with us.  For PAP Backbenchers, in fact,

it has not been an easy task



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2298</b></font><br><br>



speaking in this House as we have to do a fine

balancing act in crafting our speech, so as not to score "own

goals".  Sir, I feel that this aspect, which is for our

Backbenchers to speak our mind, boldly ask questions and let

conscience be our guide, has become an integral part of this

unique and honourable parliamentary democracy created and

institutionalised by all the past and present MPs in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the impending move to the new and modern Chamber next

door, I am sure that the excellent traditions will continue  and

prevail.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Prime Minister said that he has been in this House  for

23  years.  I belong to the 1997 batch of MPs who are  here  for

less  than three years.  In about three hours' time, all  of  us

will move from this Chamber to the one next door.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many Singaporeans, moving house is not new.

Singaporeans are used to moving house - they can make  money  in

the  process.  But to Parliament, this is the first time  in  40

years.   We  are  moving,  and we will bring  our  parliamentary

democracy  to  the  new Chamber and continue our  debate  there.

Over  the  last  few  decades, every Bill, every  motion,  every

debate  that  took  place in this House  has  deeply  influenced

Singapore.  The thought of this makes us realise how  heavy  our

responsibilities  are.  I support the Prime Minister's  move  to

record  our sincere appreciation to the many MPs before  us  who

had contributed to our parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we march into the next millennium, let us review our

history. Take a look at the world around us and we will discover

that  whether it was in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or even the  90s,

at  all  times there has always been the alternate emergence  of

crisis and opportunity, turmoil and stability, construction  and

destruction contrasting, yet co-existing with each other.   Some

events  took  place in remote corners of the  world  while  many

other events took place right in front of us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, 40 years ago, in the self-governing State

of Singapore, when Mr Lee Kuan Yew led the new batch of

Assemblymen from City Hall to this House, the thing which was

uppermost in the minds of  Singaporeans then  was to obtain our

independence, to create employment and to overcome social

turmoil.  The reason why we could turn crisis to opportunity,

that we could avoid turmoil and achieve stability, that we could

choose construction and avoid destruction, is because for the

last 40 years, we have debated thoroughly all policies in this

House.  We have looked at all aspects of the policies and built

up a healthy system of parliamentary democracy.  As MPs, we are

glad that under this healthy system, we have confidently and

conscientiously expressed our views.  In the last three years,

we  debated what we should be in the future - the Singapore 21

programme.  With the sudden emergence of the economic crisis,

our attention was diverted to how to protect the rice bowl of

our workers and how to reduce costs.  In the face of unfriendly

political development, we have not shied away from speaking our

minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new House, we will face new challenges in the new

century.   We  will  debate on foreign  talents,  on  our  aging

population,  on  how  to  deal  with  the  unfriendly   regional

environment  and  how to tackle the ever changing  international

circumstances.   We will debate to protect our self-respect  and

in  the  interest of Singaporeans.  We should practise  what  we

preach.  We should execute what we plan.  And we should not  say

something  that we cannot carry out.  In this way, we will  have

greater confidence in the process of parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we sit in the new House, we must not

forget  the  great  contributions by the past  Members  of  this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people do not know where Parliament House is. They do

not realise that this very important Chamber is situated in such

an  inconspicuous  building tucked away  at  a  corner  of  High

Street.  In fact, many people thought that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2300</b></font><br><br>



this Chamber was inside City Hall, a much more

prominent building.   When we pointed out this building to them,

they would remark, "Wah, so small!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, indeed we started from small. It was from this

Chamber   in  this  inconspicuous  Parliament  House  that   our

parliamentary  democracy  started.  Over  the  years,   we  have

evolved  a  system  of  parliamentary  democracy  that  is  well

respected   by   all.   For  this,  we  must  not   forget   the

contributions made by all those Members of this House  who  came

before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Prime Minister's motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, democracy denotes openness, transparency and

accountability.  An authoritarian system does not  have  any  of

these  features.  I believe that a country must opt for  one  or

the  other  system, then we know what direction that country  is

heading.  In the case of Singapore, we are uncertain whether  we

are  taking the path towards democracy or towards a more  closed

authoritarian  system.  On the one hand,  we  say  that  we  are

working  towards  a more democratic system as our  children  are

taught  in  the  Pledge which they have to  take  every  day  at

school.   On  the other hand, we see that in actuality,  we  are

building a system that is more closed.  If we want to have  more

openness,  more transparency, and more accountability,  we  must

have  more Opposition in Parliament.  If the Opposition is weak,

less than 5% representation in Parliament, the Government simply

ignores them.  The Government's attitude is "what can they  do",

as  there  are  so  few  in  number.  The  Government  can  ride

roughshod  over  a  weak Opposition and can get  away  with  it.

However,  if  the  Opposition  is  strong,  say,  40%   or   45%

representation in Parliament, the Government will really have to

be on its toes.  It shall account for every detail of Government

policy  when  asked  to  do  so by the Opposition,  because  the

Opposition has every chance of winning the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2301</b></font><br><br>



next election if the Government does not perform as

it is asked to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, in all developed countries, the electorate

make   sure  that  there  is  a  sizeable  Opposition  in  their

parliaments  to check on the government and to keep  it  on  its

toes and to make sure that it performs well and efficiently  and

not to waste the country's resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we pay lip-service to the desire to build a

democratic  society.  But in reality, we  do  not  see  it.   An

important  aspect of a democratic society is to  have  effective

Opposition  in  Parliament.  Without this important  element  in

Parliament,   a  country  cannot  be  said  to  be   democratic.

Effective Opposition implies that there must be a core number of

Opposition  Members in the House.  In Singapore, at the  moment,

there  are three Opposition Members - two elected and one  NCMP.

In   our  Singapore's  context,  three  Opposition  Members   in

Parliament are not enough, since politicians in Singapore, other

than  office-bearers, are part-timers.  And as such, they cannot

devote  as  much time as they would like to their  parliamentary

work or to probe or investigate thoroughly into the affairs of a

government.  In our context, after 34 years of independence,  it

is  sad  to see that there are only three Opposition Members  in

Parliament.  I would say that to have an effective Opposition in

Parliament  today,  we  must  have  at  least  another  12  more

Opposition Members.  The question is why there is an absence  or

even  a  core number of Opposition Members in Parliament.    The

answer  is  obvious.   The  Government's  policy  is  never   to

encourage   more  Opposition  in  Parliament.   In   fact,   the

Government  is  trying  hard  to  keep  the  Opposition  out  of

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what happened after Anson in 1981. By-elections

were  never  called again, because normally at by-elections  the

Opposition  has  a  better  chance of  winning.   Not  only  by-elections  were never called but they are permanently banned  in

GRCs.  The law has been changed to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2302</b></font><br><br>



it unnecessary to hold by-elections in GRCs in case

any of their Members leave Parliament for whatever reason.

Then, again, there is a change of election laws to bring in GRCs

which is a great obstacle for the Opposition to overcome.  The

Opposition so far has not been able to win any GRC seats because

they are unable to gather a group of candidates to match that of

the PAP's.  I believe that this obstacle put up by the PAP shall

not last long.  The Opposition needs only to capture one GRC and

the myth of the invincibility of the GRC shall be demolished

after that and more GRCs shall fall to the Opposition.  Then the

PAP shall have to change the electoral laws again to keep the

Opposition at bay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another device of the PAP to keep the Opposition out of

Parliament is to change the electoral boundaries.  We have  seen

that  done in many constituencies when the Opposition gets  high

votes  in  those constituencies.  The constituency  of  Braddell

Heights  is  a  good  example.  Sin Kek Tong  of  the  Singapore

People's Party stood in that constituency in 1988 and 1991.  His

votes went as high as 48% in 1991.  He hoped to win the next  GE

in  1997.   But  suddenly  that constituency  disappeared.   Its

boundaries  were redrawn for it to be included in Marine  Parade

GRC.  The Opposition is thus unable really to prepare the ground

for  the  next  election,  because the boundaries  can  suddenly

change  without  prior warning.  The Opposition  has  to  hit  a

moving target.  The PAP does not make it easy for the Opposition

to win seats in Parliament.  If that is really the policy of the

PAP  Government,  how can we say that we have made  progress  in

building  a  system of parliamentary democracy?   We  must  have

greater  number of Opposition Members in Parliament to establish

more effective checks and balances on the Government.  When this

is  done,  then we can really say that we have established  true

parliamentary democracy.  The Government must take steps not  to

impede   the  growth  of  Opposition  in  Singapore.   Let   the

Opposition  grow.   Let  it take root.  Let  the  Opposition  be

institutionalised in Singapore.  So far, I cannot see such steps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2303</b></font><br><br>



being taken.  And, therefore, I cannot support the

motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this is my last

speech in the House, I would like to begin by thanking the House

and  the  Special  Select  Committee  Members  involved  in   my

appointment for these slightly more than four years that I  have

been  here.   It  has  been a privilege to  be  appointed  as  a

Nominated  Member and to be given the opportunity to  contribute

to  the debate on a wide range of issues.  It has indeed been  a

rich and rewarding experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to congratulate my five colleagues who have

been  re-appointed as well as the four new appointees and I wish

them all the best in the carrying out of their duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also particularly happy that I can participate in this

historic move from the old to the new Chamber.  In my view,  the

new  Chamber is simply great.  It has a dignified elegance  that

is  befitting Parliament.  I would also like to congratulate all

those,  including the Speaker, who had a hand in the development

of the building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to focus on is how the overwhelming

majority  of the PAP has affected the functioning of  Parliament

and  parliamentary democracy in Singapore.  Unlike some in  this

House,  I  only have a limited personal experience of  the  last

four  years  and  I  would  like to  speak  from  this  personal

experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first function of the Legislature is to pass Bills and

enact  laws.   In my view, this has been efficiently  performed.

Laws  and budget are expeditiously passed and the majority  that

the  Government has in the House ensures that it will carry  the

vote  on  all  Bills and budgets.  That is the  very  nature  of

parliamentary democracy itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second function is to act as an integrated focus for

society.  Again, I feel that this has also been well performed.

Successive PAP Governments have taken great pains to ensure

minority racial representation in Parliament by means of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2304</b></font><br><br>



the GRC system.  Members also come from all walks of

life - Chinese-educated, English-educated, rich and poor family

backgrounds, professionals, entrepreneurs, corporate executives,

academics, young and old - the oldest Member is more than twice

the age of the youngest in the House.  What is only lacking is

greater female representation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is in the performance of the third function of

Parliament  as  a  forum for general debate  and  expression  of

views,  that  while there has been significant improvement  over

these  last  years, much more can still be done.   Increasingly,

people  in Singapore want a more consultative government.   This

is  a natural consequence of the very economic success that  the

PAP  has  helped  to  achieve  a more  educated  population  and

globalisation.   People  today want to  see  a  contestation  of

ideas, of alternatives, of different views expressed.  They  are

no  longer content with top-down decision-making made by a small

elite and implemented with the most perfunctory of explanations.

If  a certain course of policy is decided on, they would want to

know  why  or  why  not.   For example, why  the  need  for  the

Electronic Road Pricing system? Why not compulsory education for

children?  Why market the salaries for Ministers and  top  civil

servants?   In  addition, they would like to  be  consulted  and

given  inputs before and not after a policy decision.   Just  as

the  Government has responded to people's material needs in  the

past, and has fulfilled them in proactive fashion, I would  urge

the  Government  to meet this intangible but, nonetheless,  very

real political need for greater consultation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways to do so. Allow me just to

focus  on Parliament during this specific occasion.  Parliament,

comprising  the people's elected representatives, is indeed  the

central  forum for open debate and expression of diverse  views.

As  a  result  of  the rich diversity of representation  in  the

House,  views expressed by Members represent a microcosm of  the

broad spectrum of views in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2305</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does one need to have more Opposition Members for

Parliament to better fulfil this role?  The answer surely

depends on the quality of the Opposition, of existing

backbenchers and of the NMPs.  The Government backbenchers have,

in the past, played the role of the loyal opposition.  Indeed,

many have asked good questions or offered useful suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Opposition, there is only so much that three

Opposition Members can do.  And in fact, the number of  NMPs  is

triple  that of the Opposition Members.  The NMPs, as  a  group,

have  also been active.  For example, from the beginning of  the

current  NMP  term  to  this  sitting,  NMPs  accounted  for   a

disproportionate 38% of the 712 Questions filed, PAP  MPs  filed

44%  of the Questions and Opposition MPs, 18%.  My view is  that

so  long  as  the Opposition MPs, as a group, do not  offer  the

range and quality of constructive dissent and alternative policy

proposals that are desired, NMPs can, and have, served a  useful

role by filling this void.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is another aspect: that of the effectiveness of

parliamentary proceedings in facilitating such debate.  I  would

like to offer three proposals as to how to improve Parliamentary

proceedings  so  that Parliament can be an even  more  effective

channel for the voicing of alternative views in the future.  The

first  proposal  I have is to increase the length  of  the  time

allotted  for  Oral  Answers to Questions.  Questions  for  Oral

Answer serve an important purpose.  They enable Members to  seek

clarification  on  issues of the day.  The one  hour  is  almost

invariably  not  enough to cover all the  questions  asked.   In

fact,  I think that today is an exception, rather than the rule.

Members  can  file Questions for Written Answer.  But,  however,

this  does not allow opportunity for debate, to pursue the issue

further  by asking supplementary questions, and so on.   Another

alternative is to file a motion.  But, for example, how does one

file  a  motion  on the SilkAir crash?  Members  can  also  seek

clarification  during the Committee of Supply  debate  but  that

occurs only once a year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2306</b></font><br><br>



I would therefore like to propose that the time

allotted for Oral Answer be increased from one hour to one and a

half hours in the first instance.  While this might still not

enable all Questions filed to be answered, that would at least

allow, on average, 50% more Questions to be covered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second proposal is that Parliament allows for speeches

to  be  supplemented by audio-visual aids.  This has become  the

norm   in   the   business  world  as  well  as  in  educational

institutions.   I am glad that the new Chamber  is  fitted  with

electric sockets for computer notebooks to be plugged in as well

as  screens.  And surely, the House would agree with me  that  a

speech   accompanied  by  a  PowerPoint  presentation  is   more

interesting, easier to absorb and more effective than  just  the

speech alone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third proposal is that the GPCs play a more active role

in  the consultation and feedback process.  These views can then

be  aired  in  the House during the relevant policy  debate,  as

indeed has been done in the case of the Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point and, perhaps, the most important, is that the

fundamental  tenet  of  democracy is  that  it  must  bring  the

greatest  good  to  the  greatest number  of  people.   The  PAP

Government has, without doubt, progressively raised the standard

of  living of ordinary people, of the man-in-the-street, and has

created  opportunities for self-advancement because of education

and  economic growth.  Having observed proceedings in the  House

at first hand, I can say that I have full trust in the integrity

of  its  proceedings.  This is certainly an important legacy  to

bring  to  the new Chamber.  What I would like to  see  is  that

fuller  expression  be  given  to people's  desire  for  greater

consultation and feedback and the airing of alternative views in

the  House.   My  wish is that in the first decade  of  the  new

millennium there is an even more significant shift towards  more

consultative government in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have, as you know, an

amendment to the motion.  But as I did at the last sitting,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2307</b></font><br><br>



I would like to say a few words before I move my

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, did I misread the motion on the Order

Paper?    I  thought  we  were  going  to  debate  parliamentary

democracy.  But we heard this afternoon, Mr Speaker, Sir, hardly

anything about parliamentary democracy.  We have been treated to

speeches  after  speeches of how good the  previous  Parliaments

have  been,  how effective, how they have had men of  integrity,

and  so on, but not a word about parliamentary democracy except,

I must hasten to say, for the speech from Mr Chiam See Tong from

the Opposition bench.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion is wrong for two reasons.

Firstly, it displays and, I am sorry that I have to ascribe this

to  the  Prime  Minister who has moved the  motion,  a  complete

ignorance   or   inability  to  understand  what   parliamentary

democracy is all about.  As I listened to him, I began to  think

what  the  Prime  Minister was saying is that we  have  our  own

parliamentary  democracy, parliamentary democracy ala  Singapore

and we are not interested in what others mean when they talk  of

parliamentary democracy.  So I say this motion is wrong because,

if  he  intended  it to be the Singapore style of  parliamentary

democracy, then it should have said so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that a House consisting almost

entirely  of PAP Members is the wrong place to debate  a  motion

praising  the  previous Governments and Members  of  Parliament.

You  will get your pat on the back, there is no doubt about  it.

No  one  will  imagine  for a minute that this  motion  will  be

defeated.  You will get your pat.  But this is not the place  to

come for an appraisal.  If you want an appraisal, I say, let  us

have  an open debate outside where Singaporeans will be able  to

attend and pass their judgement.  If you are seriously concerned

and  interested  in  this question, may  I  say  that  the  Open

Singapore  Centre will only be too pleased to arrange  a  public

debate  on the question of parliamentary democracy in Singapore.

Would you accept it and would you come and speak there so that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2308</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans can then make their judgement?  I have

not got very much time, Mr Speaker, Sir, so I better move my

amendment and speak on the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that the motion before the

House  be  amended  by  deleting all words following  the  words

"across the yard", and in place of those words, to insert -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"regrets the persistent attempts and measures of the

governments  since  1965  to  impede  the  growth   of   genuine

parliamentary democracy and urges the present government to take

such  measures as may be necessary to facilitate the  growth  of

genuine parliamentary democracy in Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that this speech of the Prime

Minister and the motion itself display stark ignorance  of  what

parliamentary  democracy  is.   Parliamentary  democracy  is   a

concept that we have borrowed from other countries, particularly

from  the  United Kingdom whose style of government we chose  to

adopt  in 1955.  And so we have to look to them as to what  they

understood  as  parliamentary democracy.  If  we  are  going  to

redefine  that term, then we should make it quite clear  to  the

world  at large that parliamentary democracy, as they understand

it,  is not what we understand it. Singapore's understanding  of

parliamentary democracy is this, this and this.  Then,  we  will

be at least making ourselves plain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, parliamentary democracy implies and

presupposes that Parliament is the centre of power.  It  is  the

supreme  authority in the country representing the people.   Let

us  not  forget, and we will be reminding our people  again  and

again  in the years to come, that they are the masters and  this

House is a gathering of their representatives.  The sine qua non

of   parliamentary   democracy  is  that  the   executive,   the

Government, is answerable and accountable to Parliament.  May  I

quote   from  the  International  Encyclopedia  of  the   Social

Sciences:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parliamentary government is the form of constitutional

democracy  in  which  executive authority emerges  from  and  is

responsible to legislative authority."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quoted a writer, a Frenchman, who wrote in the

Journal British Political System in London in 1958 but it is

worth quoting it again.  I quoted it the last sitting and this

is what he has to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If asked to give a single criterion of the democratic

government,  I  should say that it depended  on  the  status  of

opposition."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book on Opposition by a professor of government in

Manchester  University, Ghita Ionescu and  a  reader  at  London

University, Isabel de Madariaga have this to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Political opposition thus becomes the crowning institution

of  a fully institutionalised political society and the hallmark

of   those  political  societies  which  are  variously   called

democratic,  liberal, parliamentary, constitutional, pluralistic

constitutional  or  even open or free.   Thus  the  presence  or

absence of institutionalised political opposition can become the

criterion for the classification of any political society in one

of  two  categories  -   liberal or dictatorial,  democratic  or

authoritarian, pluralistic constitutional or monolithic?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do we place Singapore in that classification? Can we

truly  say  that  Singapore is liberal, democratic,  pluralistic

constitutional,  if you accept the criterion  for  a  democratic

society?   Or  is  Singapore, on the  other  hand,  dictatorial,

authoritarian,  monolithic?   The  authors  of  that  book,   in

reference  to the change in societies mention another quotation,

that  the  transition  from an archaic  society  into  a  modern

society  began  sometime in the 18th century.  Is  Singapore  an

archaic  society  or  a modern society?  An archaic  society  is

where  it  still  retains the feudal system of  government  with

authority  being the key plank in the government.   Can  we,  in

Singapore, say that we are a parliamentary democracy?  If it is,

as  we say about justice, government must be and must manifestly

be  seen to be answerable and accountable to Parliament.  How is

this  possible - manifestly seen to be answerable to  Parliament

when Parliament consists of almost 95% of the ruling party?   It

is just nonsense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we say that in Singapore, all these years, the

Government  has accounted itself to Parliament?   We  only  had,

some months ago, the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2310</b></font><br><br>



saying that he did not have to report a loan to

Indonesia to Parliament, promising to give away some millions of

Singapore dollars as Parliament did not have to be told about

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the factors that have prevented the growth of

parliamentary democracy in Singapore?  I will list them and,  if

time permits, say a few words on each of them.  First of all, it

is  the  climate  of  fear in Singapore of  which  I  have  been

speaking more than once, the fear generated through the Internal

Security Act (ISA) and victimisation of those who would dare  to

stand  up and take the Government to task.  It is also generated

through  the  numbering of the ballot papers  and  entering  the

serial numbers on the counterfoils.  Secondly, the denial of the

freedoms  vital  to the growth of parliamentary  democracy,  the

denial  of  the  freedom of expression and assembly,  making  it

difficult  for  democratic institutions to  grow  and  function.

Thirdly,  denying  a  level playing  field  in  the  conduct  of

elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all countries, and particularly in the

Commonwealth  countries, which have inherited the  system,  they

have  an elections commission.  We in the Opposition called  for

an elections commission way back in the 70s, and to this day, we

still  do  not  have an elections commission.   The  conduct  of

elections  has  remained  and  is  still  the  monopoly  of  the

Government.   And so we have had gerrymandering  at  its  worst.

The altering and redrawing of electoral boundaries, creation  of

GRCs  at  just the will of the Prime Minister or the leaders  of

the  PAP  without  any  consultation  with  the  people  or  the

Opposition parties.  Making it difficult for the ordinary person

to  stand  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  if  he  can  meet  the

qualifications, by raising the deposits for candidates  so  that

only  the  wealthy  and  the  rich can  stand  for  election  to

Parliament.   The persecution of opposition leaders and  parties

denying  them  a  place  in the sun in  Singapore.   Prosecuting

Opposition  leaders  if  they wish to address  the  public,  the

audience, denying them licences to hold any public meetings.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2311</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then curtailing the freedom of Members of

Parliament.  After my presence in this House from 1981 to 1986,

or following it, Bills were introduced to curtail the freedom of

the Members in this House, introducing even the power to commit

Members to prison if they dare to step out of line and abuse

their privileges in the view of the majority of the Members,

something which the UK Parliament has now abolished.  It has

never resorted to this but we have it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not flatter ourselves that we as a society have

consciously  sought  to  encourage the growth  of  parliamentary

democracy in this country.  There are steps necessary that  have

to be taken for the growth of parliamentary democracy. Time does

not  permit me to go into them at length, but clearly  it  calls

for  the abolition of the power to detain persons without  trial

for  political  activities and equally, a need to  look  at  the

Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act to see whether  that  is

necessary. Secondly, we need to consider whether there should be

a  restriction on public meetings especially called by political

parties,  whether that is still necessary. Thirdly, we have  got

to consider whether we should continue with the numbering of the

ballot  papers  and  the  requirement  for  serial  numbers   on

counterfoils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say all this is necessary because they will then, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, remove the fear that is acting as a paralysis  on

our  people  preventing  the growth of parliamentary  democracy.

These  are measures that cannot be taken immediately. They would

have  to  be taken over a period of time and it would  be  quite

some  time before our people are disabused of fear, assured that

it  is  their bounden duty and right to take an interest and  to

take  part  in the affairs of the country.  But may I  tell  the

Prime  Minister,  if  I may, before I sit down,  that  there  is

something  he  can do immediately so that we,  the  citizens  of

Singapore,  can go into 21st century saying we  are  or  we  are

beginning  to  be a parliamentary democracy.  We  can  hold  our

heads  high.   This  can be done if the Prime  Minister  decides

after all that there should be a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2312</b></font><br><br>



by-election now before we run into the next century.

There is a vacancy and if this Government believes that it has

the trust and confidence of the people which has led to it being

elected election after election, then why hold back now?  Now is

the time for this Government to show Singaporeans and the world

that this Government is serious.  This Government means business

when it says that we want to be a parliamentary democracy.  If

you, Mr Prime Minister, will take that step now and call for a

by-election, I tell you that the world will salute you, as a

believer in parliamentary democracy.  If you do not, you will go

down in history as one who is frightened to introduce

parliamentary democracy, and still  holding on to your power to

see that the PAP is not eventually replaced.  Because, in a

parliamentary democracy, it goes without saying that the people

have the right and it should be seen that they do have the right

to replace a government, through the ballot box.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members have talked of fair elections. I could go on

at  length  about the kind of elections we have had in Singapore

since  1971, when I entered into politics.  We have never had  a

level playing field.  And it is a pretence to talk that we are a

parliamentary  democracy  when  you  go  all  out  to  deny  the

opposition  a place in Parliament.  As these authors have  said,

it  is  only  when  you have a sufficient number  of  Opposition

Members   in   Parliament,  then  you  become  a   parliamentary

democracy.  Without Opposition Members in sufficient number, you

are  nothing  but an authoritarian government, passing  measures

and  policies, not with consultation of the people, but  because

you  think  it is right for the people.  This denies the  people

their  place.  It is the people who have to make the judgements,

and  that  is  only possible if you have Opposition  Members  in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been suggestions from the Nominated MP that the

Opposition has to be effective.  Of course, it has  to  be.   No

one denies that.  But if you, the ruling party, go all out using

extra parliamentary measures to keep Opposition Members out, how

can you claim praise for your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2313</b></font><br><br>



party?  It is only by a fair battle won by  you  by

fair  and  lawful  means that you can claim to be  a  democratic

government.  Until that happens, I am afraid, Singapore will  be

classified, as they have said, as an archaic society.   We  have

made great progress in other fields  -  information,  technology

-  but as a political society, we are still in the 18th century.

Is  it  not  time   we moved forward and began  the  journey  to

becoming a full parliamentary democracy?

<br>3.35 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question before the House is the amendment

moved  by  Mr J B Jeyaretnam.  The Question is, "That the  words

proposed to be left out be left out."

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak on the

amended Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the amended motion standing in the name of the Secretary-General  of  the Workers' Party, and I take this opportunity  to

congratulate Parliament for its moving to a new Complex.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to see that as Singapore steps into the

21st  century,   Parliament,  as  an  important  pillar  in  the

political system of Singapore, has a brand-new,  modern and well-equipped building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in terms of the progress of parliamentary

democracy over the past 30-odd years since independence, I  must

say I am disappointed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation of the system of parliamentary democracy is

focused  on   the  separation of power  of  the  Judiciary,  the

Legislature  and the Executive, with mutual checks and  balances

among  themselves,   so that it will not  be  possible  for  the

Government  in power to possess absolute powers  and  do  as  it

wishes  to  invade into the rights of the people or do  anything

detrimental to the country and the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2314</b></font><br><br>



In any parliamentary democracy, the fundamental

principle is that the  main power must be with the people.  The

people must have the ultimate right to choose their

parliamentary representatives and the people to form the

government, through the process of election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representatives elected by the people shall form

Parliament  which  is the legislative body of  the  State.   The

political  party that wins the most seats in a General  Election

will  form the Government to rule the country. The ruling  party

can  only implement policies or carry out resolutions which have

been  passed by Parliament.   Parliament is the main  pillar  to

carry  out  checks  and  balances on the  Government  under  the

framework  of division of the three powers under the  system  of

parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the system of parliamentary democracy to be effectively

implemented,  three important pre-conditions must be present:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the people must be able to elect the people

according  to their own wishes, without being subjected  to  any

threat of losing any of their benefits.  They must be allowed to

exercise  their  own free choices without any  psychological  or

mental pressure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the elections, the people should have

different candidates from whom they can exercise their right  of

selection.   Most  importantly,  the  media,  particularly   the

television,  should accord fair coverage of the candidates  from

the   various  parties,  so  that  the  voters  will  have   the

opportunity  to  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the  various

candidates  through  introduction by the media and other  means,

and hence make informed decisions when they cast their votes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there must be enough number of Members from the

various  parties in Parliament, with full power to vote  for  or

against  the  motions introduced by the Government, particularly

when  the  Government is seeking to amend the Constitution.   At

the same time, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2315</b></font><br><br>



should be enough non-ruling party Members  in

Parliament  with enough influence to challenge the ruling

parties during voting, to ensure that  the ruling party will not

sacrifice the interest of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any country that professes to practise parliamentary

democracy,  if  it  does  not possess  all  these  three  above-mentioned   pre-conditions,  then  the  so-called  parliamentary

democracy   exists   in   name   only.    Unfortunately,   since

independence, Singapore's parliamentary democracy is actually in

a "partly-nominal, partly-solid" state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we do have the parliamentary democracy system, and

the  three key institutions: the Judiciary, the  Legislature and

the  Executive,  and  the  people do have  the  right  to  elect

Members to form  Parliament, the actual situation is that during

the  election,  we do not have enough opposition  candidates  to

contest  the  election,  and  the  PAP  can  actually  form  the

Government even before the polling date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party firmly believes in the importance of

Parliament  exercising its power of checks and balances  on  the

Government under the system of parliamentary democracy.  We also

understand  that  under  the system of parliamentary  democracy,

the voters must have a choice of candidates to give full play to

the  elections.  For this reason,  the Workers' Party  has  been

fielding   candidates   in   every   General   Election    since

independence.  Although we lost again and again, we have carried

on contesting, and we never gave up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the contested constituencies, almost 40% of the voters

supported  the  opposition, but the vast majority of  opposition

candidates  were not returned.  As a result, the  PAP  has  been

dominating Parliament and, at the same time, controls  the  main

pillars   of  Legislative  and  Executive  in  the   system   of

parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of today, the system of parliamentary democracy has been

practised in Singapore for more than 30 years.   Why is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2316</b></font><br><br>



it that we are still in such a situation?  Why is it

that Parliament has not been able to perform the role of checks

and balances on the Government to see to it that the Government

would not have its own way all the time, and thereby protect the

overall interest of the nation and the people?    There is even

the need for the Government to introduce this nondescript system

of Elected Presidency, which is not guaranteed to be effective,

to safeguard the national reserves.  I feel that this is

something which anyone who is concerned with the future of

Singapore should ponder over seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of parliamentary democracy has been in force in

Singapore for more than 30 years, and we are still having a one-party  rule in Singapore.  The Secretary-General of the Workers'

Party has already made some analysis on the matter just now.   I

do  not  want to repeat his points.  But here, I would  like  to

make  the  point that a legitimate government which is generated

under a system of parliamentary democracy has the obligation  to

ensure   the   existence   of  the  three   pre-conditions   for

parliamentary  democracy, to give full play  to  the  system  of

parliamentary  democracy.  At the same time,  this  will  ensure

the legitimacy of the Government as generated under this system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a time, people have asked me whether the PAP had

cheated  in  the general elections.  I said that as far  as  the

votes  are concerned, the PAP had not cheated.  If they  had,  I

would  not  have  participated in politics through  the  General

Elections.   However,  the  PAP has  earned  for  itself  a  bad

reputation  by  unfairly  changing  the   election  rules,   and

threatening  the people during the elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important characteristic of the system of

parliamentary democracy is that we must have representatives  of

the  people  from the various quarters to voice their  views  in

Parliament,  so that the Government, in ruling the nation,  will

look  after the interest of the entire society.  In this  system

of  parliamentary democracy, it is a presumption that there will

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2317</b></font><br><br>



a ruling party and an opposition in Parliament.  But

if the ruling party can make good use of the feedback and

alternative views from the various opposition parties, I think

it will make a more effective government.  On top of that, if it

is subjected to the pressure of the opposition, it will be more

prudent when it implements its policies to show that it is a

good government.  As such, the effect of parliamentary democracy

is not just a confrontation between political parties.  In fact,

this system has substantial effects in promoting a good

government which takes good care of its people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dwelt at length on our parliamentary democracy,

and  it  may  appear as though I am "displaying my little  skill

before  the grand-masters".  However, at this historical  moment

of  the  moving of our Parliament, there is no harm in reviewing

our  past, with the hope that we may draw some inspiration  from

there  to improve ourselves, so that the system of parliamentary

democracy  in Singapore may develop in a more healthy manner  in

the new Parliament House, to protect the future happiness of our

people.   At  the  same time, let the academics in  the  western

society  know that even after the autocratic Prime Minister  Lee

Kuan  Yew  has left us, Singapore can still continue to  survive

and develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out,

be left out."

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I call for a division.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of today, we will say good-bye to a 172-year old

building;  to  the familiar Members' Room where  MPs  gather  to

exchange  information and seek clarification before a debate  in

the House; and for some of us,  to  a comfortable ladies' lounge

and  restroom which is not frequented enough as we have yet  too

few  female  Members of Parliament; and to the many corners  and

artifacts  in  and around this building and its  hallways  which

each of us is uniquely drawn to. We shall miss all these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what lives on are the many memories of the debates

left  by  batches  of  MPs in the last 30  over  years  who  had

cumulatively   struggled   to  define   and   hone   Singapore's

parliamentary  framework.   Some of us had the good  fortune  of

hearing some of these debates orally shared, but  most of us had

to read the Hansard to access the rich historical records of who

said what, when, how and why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What endured out of the copious textual testimonies was a

spirit,   call  it  the  Singapore  Spirit,   which   vigorously

questioned the Western view of democracy and called  for  a  re-reading  of democratic principles based on our own understanding

of  what  fitted  better the development of  our  multi-cultural

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As separate individuals we may debate the claims of

democracy,  but we must all recognise that under the stewardship

of  this  Government, and as a people,  we  have  achieved  many

things  that  we  are  all proud of - public housing,  universal

education, equal opportunity, and  meritocracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policies of good governance did not happen overnight; they

were  carefully deliberated inside and outside of this House  as

well  as arduously tested outside of this Parliament by each  MP

serving  as  a champion, an articulator, a feedback  channel,  a

facilitator and a custodian of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2319</b></font><br><br>



the interests of  his or her constituents.   It is

this democratizing process of political persuasion, of having to

win the consent of Singaporeans at all levels, that makes our

system of parliamentary democracy tick.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure having more political parties or NMPs will

create  more  accountability  and necessarily  enrich  political

life.   In  abstraction, opposition is a good check and balance.

In  practice,  it is not self-evident.  We have  many  countries

around us that show that dissonance.  Having said that, I  think

it  is  important that future leaders listen to dissenting views

and  give  time  to  process, explain,  persuade  and  sometimes

instead  be  persuaded.  For me, this respect and tolerance  for

differences  and  providing channels  for  negotiations  form  a

fundamental democractic ethos.  Future Members have to  continue

this  grave  responsibility of  governance  by  deepening   this

democratic  ethos.  They need new solutions to meet  the  rising

demands  among the emerging voters who have grown accustomed  to

democratic  expectations.  They need fresh strategies  to  reach

out  to  the Y generation, the Internet "click" generation  born

after l977 who are both cosmopolitan and heartlander in outlook.

Their   horizons  span the world for material  gains  but  their

emotions  are  deeply rooted in Singapore and its  cultural  and

culinary  diversity, including  "singlish", "mee pok",  "laksa",

and "roti prata".  They are restless and seek new definitions of

what  matters  and what counts in  "a good life".   Promises  of

material  gains are no longer sufficient for community building,

our   future  MPs  have  to  nurture  heartware  components   in

relationship building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the mix of paternalistic and consultative

leadership style, I hope to see  a greater co-partnering form of

democracy   characterised  by  various   stakeholders   actively

learning  to  decide and act together as equal  partners.   This

would  mean  minimising  power play and enhancing   constructive

exchanges   that  are  unfettered  by  officious  postures   and

bureaucratic  practices.   Citizens  do  not  just  want  to  be

consulted.  They  want  to work together  with  state  agencies.

Maybe, even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2320</b></font><br><br>



take charge.  Are our future leaders ready to let up

without letting go?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The millennium leadership of MPs calls for a blend of

reason  and  intuition,  where rationality  and  creativity  can

merge to produce positive synergies.  Our pioneers have given us

many pointers and a  legacy to follow -  the challenge to future

leaders  is: what can we do more  to enhance Singaporeans' sense

of relevance and citizenship?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people sector may not have definitive proposals just

yet,  but a dynamic mindset on the part of  the leaders who  are

responsive to  diversity and change is a good start.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will always treasure this moment of being part of

the  history of this House.  I hope more women will step forward

in  the  new millennium to serve  in the new Chamber across  the

yard.    I  urge  future Members to continue to  address  issues

affecting the family and women just as seriously as they  debate

economic issues, and identify appropriate policies for promoting

a  balance  in maximising  the potential of  men and  women  for

nation-building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that as a people we will pull our minds,

hearts  and spirit together to make the Singapore pulse tick  in

unison.   This  confidence is built on credible achievements  of

past Members.  I once  again register my gratitude to them   and

I  hereby  also  pledge my commitment to serve our  people  with

honour and integrity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  rise  to  support the motion made in the name  of  the  Prime

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I speak on the motion, I would like to say that

I  am  rather puzzled by Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam's approach  to  our

parliamentary  debate.  He and Mr Low  Thia Khiang  have  chosen

the  occasion  of this debate to introduce an amendment  to  the

Prime  Minister's motion to trot out all his old grievances  and

allegations against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2321</b></font><br><br>



the Government and PAP, for example, the ISA,

numbered ballot votes, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the amendment is totally unnecessary and

appropriately  defeated a moment ago.  I say it  is  unnecessary

because  he could have made his points and comments by  speaking

on the main motion.  Mr Chiam did just that and had achieved his

objective  without having to introduce any amendment.   All  his

comments  would have been made in the context of the  debate  on

the main motion.  It appears to me that his amendment is another

of  his  attempts  to play to the gallery.  So  I  think  it  is

appropriate that this Chamber dismisses his theatrics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parliamentary democracy was introduced to Singapore

about  44  years  ago.   Compared  to  many  other  Commonwealth

countries which had adopted the Westminster parliamentary system

as   their   model,  Singapore's  experience  in   parliamentary

democracy  is quite recent, yet we have turned it into something

unique.  Within this short period, we have succeeded in evolving

a  parliamentary  democracy system into an institution  that  is

able  to  meet our needs and bring Singapore into  the  path  of

rapid progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying reason that made our parliamentary

system  workable is quite straightforward.  The  system  enables

our  political leaders to apply their creative mind,  anticipate

challenges  and  introduce changes.  In  other  words,  we  have

turned  the  system  to  something that  is  responsive  to  the

changing circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, an institution is a neutral vehicle for man to

achieve  progress.   The  same applies  to  the  institution  of

parliamentary democracy.  However, institution per se,  left  in

the hands of non-creative, unimaginative minds, would not be  of

much   use  or  much  benefit.   Experience  in  many  countries

practising  parliamentary  democracy  had  shown  that   social,

historical  and  other man-made constraints  had  inhibited  the

constructive  growth of the system, thus leaving  the  countries

concerned struggling.  Some are even 'condemned'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2322</b></font><br><br>



to live in poverty while others are making very slow

progress towards development.  The political benefits that are

expected to be delivered by the system of parliamentary

democracy for countries mentioned above came in drips.  In this

respect, whether the institution of parliamentary democracy is

able to raise the status of the country very much depends on

whether there are right men and women to manage the institution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally disagree with the views expressed by the

Opposition  that you need to have more opposition in  Parliament

to  make it democratically operational.  An institution  can  be

very  powerful,  constructive and effective  because  there  are

individuals  who have chosen to use the institution  creatively,

honourably  and wisely.  For us in Singapore, the  parliamentary

democracy institution has been used by our leaders as a means to

implement  their ideas and to promote values that  will  enhance

progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, other countries have similar institution but

due to their poor understanding of its potential or shackled  by

their historical, social or cultural conditions, the institution

itself is turned into a platform for ideological conflicts  with

adversaries using it as a platform for contention rather than as

a  means  to achieve consensus and pave the way towards progress

and development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore is concerned, we have chosen the

parliamentary  democratic system as a means  to  provide  higher

standard  of living to Singaporeans.  Critics may say  that  our

parliamentary system appears to them as very much  dominated  by

the  government  of the day, ie, the PAP.  This is  quite  true.

They  have  also claimed further that such dominance may  result

with a declining scrutiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me answer this question. Those of us who have

been  involved with this Parliament can bear witness that  there

is  no  lacking  of legislative scrutiny as far as  the  budget,

introduction of policies and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2323</b></font><br><br>



measures or programmes that affect our people are

concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the three Readings of the Bills in Parliament

and  the  debates  that accompanied them, our  Select  Committee

provides  the mechanism for interested members of the public  or

the   affected  parties  to  make  representation.   The  Select

Committee   has   been   instrumental  in  clarifying   matters,

collecting  feedback,  hearing views and inclusion  of  relevant

suggestions  from members of the public, thus further  improving

some  of our Bills.  Over and above that, a number of committees

such  as the Public Accounts Committee, which is given power  to

probe  and examine every Government department and office budget

to ensure that money is properly spent, is there.  Every item in

the  budget is examined thoroughly by this Committee.   We  have

also introduced the Elected President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics had lamented the absence of an Upper House

mechanism  for  the  checks and balances  in  our  parliamentary

system.  Indeed, there was a question on this matter today.   In

my  view,  the  creation  of a second  chamber  or  a  bicameral

parliament  is not the only way in which the legislative  checks

can  be achieved.  We have successfully implemented a number  of

changes  to  our parliamentary system.  We had strengthened  the

multi-racial representation in our Parliament through the  Group

Representation  Constituency  (GRC).   We  had  introduced   the

Nominated   Members  of  Parliament  scheme  in  which   people,

representative  of  certain bodies of opinions  or  groups,  are

invited  to  sit in Parliament so that they can give their  non-partisan   views  on  issues,  Bills,  policies  or   programmes

introduced by the Government.  We even have the Non-Constituency

Member  of Parliament (NCMP) scheme to ensure the voice  of  the

opposition parties is heard in this Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These indeed are our innovative ways in which we improve

the  working  ability of our parliamentary system.  Changes  are

introduced;  existing mechanisms are fine-tuned to  achieve  the

maximum result.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today is a milestone in our experience in

parliamentary system.  As we move to a new and bigger Chamber - and this debate is symbolic of our desire for continuity and

change - we must also do so with a new resolution: to make our

parliamentary system a beacon of hope and progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we have succeeded in achieving our objective but we

must never rest on our laurels.  We must forever be seeking ways

and   means  of  sustaining  and  deepening  the  roots  of  our

democratic parliamentary system.  This necessitates the  present

generation and the future generation of Singaporeans to be fully

cognizant  of  the  strength  and the  potential  found  in  our

parliamentary system.  They should endeavour to further  develop

our  representative democratic values that everyone of us  holds

dear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this desirous end, we need to encourage our

young  people  to  participate in the  nation's  decision-making

process,  strengthen our system of parliamentary  democracy  and

turn our Parliament as a platform that represents the conscience

of our citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I am heartened to learn that the new

Parliament  House has the facilities to bring in  our  young  to

involve  in  "mini"  parliament debates.  This  would  certainly

enhance  their knowledge of our parliamentary system and develop

interest among our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the day when our parliamentary system is

seen  by  our  people, both young and old, as  their  great  and

highly cherished institution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Parliament will be moving to  its  new  premises

today  and  I  am  privileged to be a witness to this  important

event,  and  I am somewhat overcome by a multitude of  emotions.

Although I have been a Nominated MP for just two years, deep  in

my  heart  I fully realise that Singapore's political  stability

and prosperity depend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2325</b></font><br><br>



entirely on the sound operation and development of

our system of parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the incisive speech by the Prime Minister, my

conviction   is   further  enhanced.    With   regard   to   the

contributions  by the past Members, we have not only  to  record

our appreciation to them, but also to take them as our model, so

that  we can all put in concerted efforts to carry on perfecting

the existing system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our parliamentary democracy is derived

from  the British system.  Yet we are able to adapt it  to  suit

our  multi-racial society and to perform even better.   This  is

indeed   remarkable.    In  our  various   amendments   to   the

Constitution, the Government introduced quite a number of highly

controversial  systems such as the GRC, NCMP, Nominated  MP  and

Elected  Presidency.   These have not only  added  life  to  our

political arena but also attracted the interest and esteem  from

the  international communities.  However, with the  persistently

pragmatic approach, the Government has been able to explain  all

these  issues  to  the  people  through  this  House  and  other

channels, and eventually won  the support of this House and  the

people  so  that  the  various  systems  or  policies  could  be

implemented smoothly and effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process, sometimes the people may feel that the

Government is too hasty in pushing through some of its  policies

and  find  it difficult to accept these policies, or  have  some

complaints over them.  I hope that the Government will also keep

in mind this saying that "even the wise are not always free from

error".   In introducing policies affecting the daily  lives  of

the people, the Government should listen more to the feedback of

the  people, pool the collective wisdom of the masses to  ensure

that the new policies or measures may be perfected.  As such,  I

suggest  that after the Second Reading of a Bill in  Parliament,

the  Minister  in charge should take more time to  consider  the

views  presented by MPs before taking the Bill through its Third

Reading.  If this can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2326</b></font><br><br>



done, I am sure the people will have more confidence

in the legislative process of Parliament and in the Government's

sincerity in wanting to listen to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having gone through the practice and

developments  all these years, the Parliament of  Singapore  has

evolved  into  a unique model.  This model is no longer  just  a

representation of arguments or confrontation between the  ruling

Party  and the Opposition.  With the establishment of  NCMP  and

NMP,  no  matter what the outcome of a General Election may  be,

there  will  always  be Members from the ruling  Party  and  the

Opposition  party or parties in this House.  In addition,  there

will  also  be  non-partisan  representatives  of  the  business

community,  professionals, trade union movement  and  grassroots

organisations.   This  multi-channel  system  of   parliamentary

democracy  has instilled in this House a vital new force  and  a

new  flavour  of  life.   At the same  time,  it  has  increased

participation  from the people sector of society,  so  that  the

relevant non-governmental organisations will be more active  and

more  systematic in collecting feedback from the people, thereby

making even greater contributions to our system of parliamentary

democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, generally, the people of Singapore are

more  willing  to  divulge their personal feelings  on  national

issues, under the non-partisan circumstances.  These personal or

"inner"  feelings are a reflection of the real feelings  of  the

people.  As an NMP, I feel that my most important mission is  to

reflect these real feelings of the people in an objective and an

unbiased manner to Parliament, to enable the Ministers  to  give

detailed explanation or clarification on the relevant issues  or

policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with more Members in this House, the one-hour allocated for Questions for Oral Answers is clearly

inadequate to deal with the great number of questions raised  by

the  Members.  I concur with what Dr Lee Tsao Yuan has said just

now.   I suggest that the time for Oral Answers be increased  by

another hour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2327</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, Sir, the new Parliament House is not

only dignified and stately, but it is also equipped with state-of-the-art communications facilities.  I firmly believe that

with the continued efforts and cooperation among all Members of

this House and the secretariat, our system of parliamentary

democracy will be further developed as we step into the new

millennium, to make greater contributions to the people of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion standing in the name of the Prime

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the motion by the Prime Minister.

Last year I had moved a motion on our founding fathers.  Today's

motion is timely and historic.  The Prime Minister has done  the

House proud by moving this motion himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Second World War changed the history of colonies.

India and other colonies became independent.  In Singapore,  the

Colonial   Government   introduced  elected   members   to   the

Legislative Council.  But the power remained in the hands of the

Governor and his officials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955 the Rendel Commission came into force. For the

first  time,  local Ministers were appointed  with  the  British

Governor  still in charge.  Mr David Marshall became  the  first

Chief  Minister.   Later on, we had the constitutional  talk  in

London which led to self-government in 1959.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1959 when the PAP won the election

under  self-government, there was talk that there would be  riot

and  chaos, as PAP was considered extremely left-wing.   It  had

among its members some communist sympathisers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PAP won 43 seats. Opposition had 8 seats in the 1959

election.   The  Government had to tackle massive  unemployment.

HDB  was formed to tackle housing.  Most of the people lived  in

attap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2328</b></font><br><br>



houses.  And the Government made rapid progress in

all areas.  Then came, in 1961, the struggle within the PAP.

Thirteen Members of the Legislative Assembly belonging to the

PAP walked out and formed Barisan Sosiaslis led by Dr Lee Siew

Choh and Lim Chin Siong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House used to be packed both in the Chamber as well as

in  the  public  gallery.  Ghost writers worked  hard  at  their

typewriters.  The battle for Merger took centre stage.   Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew went on air to give a series of talks.  He exposed  the

communists  and  their sympathisers.  Then came  referendum  and

merger which was short-lived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1963 General Election was a watershed. Many felt that

the  PAP days were numbered as the Barisan had drawn huge crowds

at  its  rallies.  But the PAP leadership convinced and won  the

hearts  and minds of the people.  The Barisan Sosiaslis, instead

of  reviewing its electoral loss, decided to boycott Parliament.

This was indeed sad.  Had Barisan Sosialis played the role of  a

constructive  opposition in Parliament, parliamentary  democracy

would have taken a different path.  As a result of this boycott,

the  PAP Members had to play the de facto role of an opposition.

And it is to their credit that they had done well.  They used to

question Ministers and they do still question.  Therefore, I  am

a  little surprised at some of the allegations made by  some  of

the Opposition Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From independence in 1965 till today, we have achieved

economic  progress, social and political stability  because  the

people and Government have worked together in unison.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when President Ong paid tribute to the Government, he

was not just being polite.  He was stating facts and reaffirming

the political culture of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in many countries in Afro-Asia, they

started  building national symbols.  They built huge  parliament

houses, many with two Houses (Upper and Lower).  But only  in  a

few countries, the Westminster system has survived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2329</b></font><br><br>



Democracy has survived in Singapore because of the

maturity of the electorate and the clean and honest Government

we have.  Whether the democratic system will survive in

Singapore will depend on our people and the political

leadership.  We must teach the values of the democratic system

from very young to our children both in schools and

universities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy that the Prime Minister has moved this

motion  and  acknowledged the former MPs for their contribution.

Many  of these MPs have sacrificed a great deal of time to serve

the  country.   They were not adequately paid but they  had  one

mission,  ie,  to  serve.  And I hope there  will  be  the  same

passion in our youths to serve the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I congratulate you for your foresight for having a

moot  Parliament.  I hope the Members will spare  some  time  to

teach  the young the practices and procedures of this House,  if

they have the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I move to the area which my

colleagues,  Dr  Lee  Tsao  Yuan and Mr  Tay  Beng  Chuan,  have

touched.   I agree with them that parliamentary time  should  be

increased  for  Questions for Oral Answer.  Allow  me,  Sir,  to

offer some suggestions to improve our parliamentary system.  Our

parliamentary system and procedure should be changed to suit our

needs.   Members  should be encouraged to put in  Questions  for

Written Answer and these Questions and Answers could be released

at  intervals  so that the press and the public  could  gain  an

opportunity to note the reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the questions asked by the Members do not reach the

Members  till  the  House  is in session.   Similarly,  as  most

Ministers  have their replies in writing which are read  in  the

House,  it  would  be helpful if the Ministers  could  give  the

Members the replies at least one hour before the session starts.

In  this  way, Members would be in a position to scrutinise  the

answers and they can frame their supplementary questions.   Sir,

Questions for Oral Answer session forms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2330</b></font><br><br>



an important part of parliamentary proceedings all

over the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area is that the public should have direct

participation in our parliamentary democracy.  Like  the  Select

Committee,  Sir,  we should encourage the public  to  put  their

proposals  in writing to the Clerk of Parliament who could  then

send them to the Minister concerned for his consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that the GPC does play a very important and

consultative  role.  But it does not come under the  purview  of

this  Parliament.  It is the PAP's own setup.  The  public  must

feel that they too can contribute and I am sure the consultative

process  which  the Prime Minister has started  can  be  further

improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our founding fathers have built sound democratic

principles.  I have every confidence that the coming  generation

will do their best to enhance parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on a personal note, I would like to thank

Parliament and the Special Select Committee for giving  me  this

opportunity  to be a Member of this House.  It has been  a  rich

experience.  To you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am thankful for all your

guidance and consideration.  The Clerk and his secretariat staff

have  been very helpful.  I join my colleague, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan,

in wishing the nine MPs "Good Luck".

thank  you for giving me the opportunity to speak in support  of

the Prime Minister's motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2331</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two years ago, when the then President of

the Republic of South Africa, Mr Nelson Mandela, visited

Singapore, he was asked a question whether he thought Singapore

was a democratic country. Mr Mandela, without hesitation said,

and I paraphrase him, that there is no universal definition of

democracy. The people of each country must decide their own

destiny and how they want to shape their own political

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Mandela's words are apposite for today's motion.

Singapore  has  evolved its own form of parliamentary  democracy

and  we  stand today at the threshold of a new beginning in  the

new  Chamber to recognise the contribution of this House to this

unique development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt when this House first sat in 1965, the Members

were imbued with much enthusiasm and anxiety to make Singapore a

bastion  of  democracy.  Singaporeans  then,  as  they  do  now,

embraced  the  democratic ideals of the popular vote,  free  and

fair   elections  and,  above  all,  the  constitutionality   of

government.  While  we know that democracy must  express  itself

through  the popular vote and fair elections, we too  know  that

beyond  these  basic  principles,  we  must  determine  how  our

democracy must necessarily evolve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to differ from the Member for Potong Pasir and

the  NCMP  in  what  they said earlier in this  House.  The  two

Members  said that we are not a parliamentary democracy  because

there  are  not  enough Opposition Members in this  House.   The

simple question is:  is it our fault that the Opposition Members

are  not  elected?  Is it then the responsibility of the  ruling

party  to  nurture  the Opposition party?  If the  Member  truly

thinks  he can represent the interests of the people,  then  let

him  take  it  to the people to decide.  If he thinks  that  the

popularity of the Opposition is rising, then why is it that  his

percentage  of votes at his constituency is declining  with  the

passing  years?   The  changing of  electoral  boundaries  is  a

prerogative of the Government of the day.  In fact, it came from

western democracy.  If the PAP Government was not performing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2332</b></font><br><br>



or if the PAP Government was dishonest and was out

to cheat the people, then no amount of electoral boundary

changing is going to prevent the people from voting the PAP out

of Parliament.  So, Mr Chiam, do not blame the PAP for the

dismal and lamentable performance of the Opposition parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, this House has never failed in its duty to

develop  our  political system.  In the manner described  by  Mr

Mandela,  we have evolved our own parliamentary democracy  which

is  unique and which reflects truly what the people of Singapore

want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House has, indeed through the years, seen the

milestones of constitutional change which strengthened democracy

in  Singapore. We have ensured minority representation  in  this

Chamber  through  the  GRC  system.  We  have  established   the

Presidential Council for Minority Rights to ensure that  we  are

not faced with the greater evil of the majority trampling on the

rights  of  the minority. We have guarded against the  potential

weakness of a dominant one party parliament by providing for the

NCMPs   and  the  NMPs.   We  have  ensured  that  a  profligate

government   will  not  squander  the  people's  resources,   by

subterfuge or otherwise, by putting in place the institution  of

the  Elected  President. Sir, these developments make  Singapore

unique in the democratic world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time, this House has risen to the occasion to decide

how our political system should develop in this country. We have

never  failed  in  our duty.  That we are able  to  achieve  the

democratic milestones is largely attributable to the  brave  men

and  women  of  this  House  who have  never  failed  to  debate

fearlessly,  whatever their conscience dictated.   We  must  not

forget  that the challenge was even greater in the early  years.

Singapore  as a young nation then was lifted from  the  womb  of

turbulent  and  troubled  times which  saw  the  communists  and

communalists creating mayhem and riots on the streets.  The core

of  politics  then  was indeed a call to do  battle  with  these

elements.  All too often, these brave men and women had to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2333</b></font><br><br>



endure verbal abuse and at times, the threat of

physical abuse to do what they thought was right.  For every

brave and dedicated Member, Singapore owes them an immense debt

of gratitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my past two years here in this House, I have never had

the  occasion to doubt that any of my backbench colleagues  here

would  be afraid to ask questions or to seek answers to anything

which  they  thought was not right.  And to the  credit  of  our

Government, they have never failed to provide answers no  matter

how  unpleasant the subject matter is, if only because they know

they  owe a duty and a responsibility to account to the  people.

Ours  is truly a system of accountability which all Singaporeans

must jealously guard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We owe a duty not only to the people of Singapore but also

to  all  those  brave men and women before us in this  House  to

continue  with  the fine tradition which began earlier.   As  we

walk through the portals of the new Chamber, let us continue  to

carry  the  torch  of  honest devotion  and  dedication  to  the

protection  and  promotion of the interests  of  the  people  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the above reasons, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Member by way of

clarification of his speech. The Member says he does  not  agree

with the Opposition's definition of parliamentary democracy  but

he  has  not  given  us  what  his definition  of  parliamentary

democracy is.  Secondly, would he agree that the question  asked

of  Nelson Mandela, because I asked the question, was not  about

democracy in Singapore but about the democracy that his  country

was  practising?  Does he agree there is democracy there and  do

we have that here in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I would take the second question first. I

think  the substance of Mr Mandela's answer is essentially  that

democracy is to be defined by each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2334</b></font><br><br>



country based on its own national circumstance and

it is not for him to provide a universal definition.  In

response to the first question on the definition of

parliamentary democracy, I do not think this is the appropriate

occasion for us to engage in an extensive debate on what

parliamentary democracy is beyond reaffirming what I have stated

earlier, that the process of parliamentary democracy is

important and that in this country, we must recognise that we

have a free and fair election and that the people are given the

right to choose, and that is important.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name  of  the

Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British parliamentary system has been recognised as the

model  for  all democratic countries in the world. As  a  former

British   colony,  Singapore  first  adopted   the   system   of

Legislative  Assembly  under the British Westminister  model  in

1955,  but  democracy was apparently lacking then. In 1959,  the

PAP won an overwhelming victory at the General Election, winning

43  out of 51 seats, and   became the ruling party in the  self-governing State of Singapore.  It was then that we began to  see

some  form  of  parliamentary democracy. In 1965, when  we  were

separated from Malaysia and became an independent republic,  our

parliamentary system was fully established.  Today in Singapore,

we  enjoy  racial  harmony and the various ethnic  cultures  are

allowed to flourish and prosper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the new Parliament House, we would

be  able to accommodate most of the modern-day requirements.  It

is  much bigger than the present House.  Apart from the spacious

Chamber,  we  have  also many committee rooms  with  the  latest

communications  facilities.  It is  a  dignified,  stately,  yet

practical  building. Today we will be using the new Chamber  for

the  first  time.   It  is  a symbol  of  our  progress  in  the

development  of  our parliamentary democracy.  It  is  a  moment

which all of us in Singapore should be proud of.  As a Nominated

MP,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2335</b></font><br><br>



I would like to thank the present parliamentary

system which has enabled me to come into Parliament without

having to contest  a General Election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan and Mr Tay Beng Chuan have

already pointed out the contributions made by the Nominated  MPs

in  this  House.   It  is  my hope that   in  this  House  where

Opposition Members are clearly lacking, we will continue to have

Nominated MPs  to serve their useful purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is an important

day in the history of Parliament as we move into the new Chamber

after the House suspends its sitting this afternoon.  It is  not

just  that we are occupying a more spacious and modern building,

but  the  significance is that the transformation of  a  rundown

hawker  centre  into  a  new  Parliament  building  mirrors  the

transformation of Singapore from a sleepy colonial outpost to  a

bustling modern city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I first became a Member of this House in

December  1984.  I remember several major Bills and  debates  in

this  House  that  had  changed the landscape  of  parliamentary

democracy in Singapore. These include the Town Councils Act, the

Nominated MP Amendment, the GRC Amendment, the Elected President

Amendment, and the debate on Ministers' salaries.  In  my  view,

these are all improvements on the democracy in Singapore and  we

are  all better off as a result of their implementation.   I  am

glad to have contributed to these debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old Parliament building is a simple building but a

building  with  character, a building rich in history.   Through

its  portals had passed all the movers and shakers of  Singapore

politics.  It was pointed out to me, when I was a young MP, that

a certain room was used when the then Prime Minister Lee met the

Plen. We even have a piece of Westminister parliament set in one

of the walls in this building.  It is the Tudor Rose from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2336</b></font><br><br>



debris of Westminister building that fell to the

ground after the bombing raid in World War II.  It was presented

to this Chamber upon the establishment of parliamentary

democracy, patterned after the Westminister model here.  It is a

symbol of the linkage between the Singapore Parliament and the

UK Parliament.  Hopefully, besides the mace it would also find a

rightful place in the new building as well.  I also appreciate

several of the art pieces displayed along the building.  I

particularly like the various bronze cast human heads by Dora

Gordine.  I hope they too would find their rightful place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move into the new Chamber and enjoy all the new

facilities, I would like to remind Members that you, Mr Speaker,

Sir, have played a pivotal role in the planning, design and  the

construction of the new Parliament building.  I was a member  of

the  original team formed in 1990 to carry out the design of the

new  Parliament building.  The study team went on several  study

tours   of   Parliament  buildings  in  several  countries.    I

participated  in  the  1990  visit  to  the  Australian  Federal

Parliament in Canberra and several state parliaments.  It was  a

working  tour.  The team visited three cities in five  days.   I

think  we  spent more time travelling than anything  else.   The

other members of the team, also led by yourself, visited several

European Parliaments to acquaint themselves with the designs and

features.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that the first item of business then was to

deliberate on the seating arrangement. There are several  models

in   the   world  -  the  circular  arrangement,  the  horseshoe

arrangement,   the  rectangular  arrangement  or  the   existing

Westminister   arrangement.   As  Members  are  aware,   seating

arrangements  go  beyond physical arrangements.   It  implies  a

fundamental  belief  in the nature of parliamentary  proceedings

and,  that  is  to  say,  whether  politics  in  Parliament   is

confrontational or by consensus.  For instance, in the  European

Parliament, the seating is a circular one which tends to  foster

consensus building in parliamentary debates.  As the majority of

MPs  in Parliament since Singapore's independence had been  from

the PAP party and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2337</b></font><br><br>



the trend looks likely to continue in the

foreseeable future, it is arguable that one of the other seating

arrangements I mentioned might be more appropriate for our new

Chamber.  This is so because the Westminster model tends to

foster confrontational debates in Parliament.  It is therefore

of paramount importance that the Cabinet has decided to retain

the existing seating arrangement.  It reflects the wisdom of the

decision makers and the desire of most MPs to retain the fine

parliamentary tradition we have established to date.  It also

does not preclude the emergence of stronger opposition

representation in Parliament.  Whether they will be here or not

would depend on how they perform in the elections.  Wise men

have also decided not to accept some of the more restrictive

features recommended on security considerations, such as bullet

proof windows for the public galleries.  Hence, the close and

intimate atmosphere of the old Chamber will be retained in the

new Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Parliament is a building with a lot of new features

and  amenities.   However,  it is also  simple  and  functional,

without  the  excesses and opulence found  in  other  Parliament

buildings.  For instance, there is no elaborate arrangement  for

the  Members  such as individual Member's rooms  or  a  swimming

pool,  as is found in the Australian Parliament building.   This

is befitting as it reflects the basic philosophy of our founding

fathers.   I  understand that you, Mr Speaker, Sir,  have  spent

innumerable hours in recent weeks to decide on the proper  level

of  furnishing,  pitching just at the  right  level  of  quality

without  being opulent.  I can see the imprint you have left  in

the building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regardless of how impressive or functional

is  the  new  Parliament  building,  we  all  recognise  that  a

Parliament does not a building make.  What is important are  the

deliberations being conducted in the Chamber and the conduct  of

Members  in  such debates.  Therefore, it is of great importance

that  the excellent traditions of Parliament be retained.  Here,

I echo the Prime Minister's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2338</b></font><br><br>



wish that present and future Members will continue

to build on past traditions to ensure that parliamentary

democracy with the unique Singapore characteristics lives on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik

Sidek  bin  Saniff): Mr Speaker, Sir, moving  house  has  always

been,  to me, a time of rediscovery and reflection. Often times,

whilst  packing  for the move, I would chance  upon  some  long-forgotten  item  and  the memories that it  has  evoked   -   an

experience that many here would have shared before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentous move today of this House has likewise evoked

many  precious  memories for me, having spent  almost  23  years

serving in Parliament.  I remember how the ruling party saw  the

need  then  to extend its reach to include those with  differing

opinions,  so  that a wide spectrum of views was represented  in

the process of nation building.  That incidentally was how I   - a  teacher and critic of the educational system then  -   became

involved in politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister and the Old Guard also saw the need to

gradually  hand over the reins to a new generation  of  leaders,

and  they were always on the lookout for fresh talent.   In  the

1976  elections, there were 11 new candidates including, myself.

Of  that batch, one is yourself, the Speaker of the House today,

another is a Mayor of a CDC and three became Ministers,  one  of

whom  is  PM Goh Chok Tong.  I am glad to note that this process

of  self-renewal  is still on-going today, as evidenced  by  the

many  young and promising Ministers and parliamentarians in  our

ranks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a lighter note, I remember there was no opposition back

then  and  the  Leader  of the House, Mr  E.W.  Barker,  had  to

encourage us, the backbenchers, to take on this unpleasant role.

Some  of  us were even appointed to speak when important  issues

were being debated, including what language to use.  It ended up

with  three  of us  -  Dr Lau Teik Soon in English, Dr  Ow  Chin

Hock   in   Mandarin   and  myself  in   Malay.    The   younger

parliamentarians



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2339</b></font><br><br>



certainly have it easier today and, ironically, they

have the opposition, NMPs and NCMP to thank for that!  Seriously

though, I think they also have an unenviable task, as they now

have to compete with the opposition, NMPs and NCMP to put forth

their views.  With the introduction of NCMPs, there is a

possibility that the ruling party may lose some seats in future

if the NCMPs did a good job.  However, this is worth it as it

shows that democracy works.  In the end, democracy should be the

winner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when one moves, one does not have to discard

everything  he had before that.  Likewise, as we make  the  move

today,  let us hold on to that which was good.  One of these  is

the multi-racial and multi-religious representation that we have

in  Parliament  today.   The  recent  conflicts  in  Serbia  and

Indonesia  serve  to highlight the fragility of  non-homogeneous

societies.   I  am glad that the Government had long  recognised

this  and had implemented various measures over the years,  such

as the GRC concept to ensure adequate minority representation in

Parliament.   The  introduction  of  legislation  such  as   the

Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act has also helped  to  ensure

peace in our multi-religious society.  These two Acts alone have

served Singapore well, especially the minorities  -  the Indians

and the Malays.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving also foreshadows the resolve to meet new

challenges.  There will be many such new challenges in the  next

millennium.    Time  magazine  reported  that  some   of   these

challenges  are  the  need  for  leadership,  the  use  of   IT,

globalisation,  ethnicity, the rise of  fundamentalism  and  the

environment.   Indeed,  as issues become  more  complex,  strong

leadership  is  crucial  to steer our  nation  into  a  brighter

future.   SM  and PM have set the pace as well as the  style  of

leadership.   Our  future leaders may require a  combination  of

both  or may even need to develop a completely new style to cope

with  the changing times.  It is my hope that our move into  the

new  complex  will signify both a continuation of what  we  have

done  so  well in the past and a new starting point for tackling

the challenges ahead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2340</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, regardless of how vigorous the

debates may be, let us do so with the primary objective of

making issues clear in our minds first, so that sound decisions

can be made for the good of the nation.  Let us continue to

carry out our duties and responsibilities faithfully as we move

forward into the future, bearing the weight of our people's

trust with sure and steadfast steps.  A final note - let us

remember that at the beginning of civilisation, Tribes such as

the Incas, Mayas, Aztecs and Greco-Romans were at the forefront

of progress.  By the 20th century, Joel Kotkin, the author of

Tribes, named the following new set of Tribes that have changed

the map of the world, namely, the Jews, British, Japanese,

Chinese and Indians.  Let us therefore strive together with

commitment to make the "Singapore Tribe" one of the Tribes that

makes a difference in the 21st century  -  the next millennium

-  in the same way that our SM has raised our nation's

international profile and put us on the global map this century.

<br>4.55 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for giving me the opportunity to participate in  this

debate on the Prime Minister's motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our House and its predecessor, the Legislative Assembly,

have  been sitting here for the past 45 years, since  1955.   In

this period of nearly half a century, Singapore has evolved from

a  British  colony  to self-government, into  Malaysia,  out  of

Malaysia  and  as  an independent country.   Socially,  we  have

developed  from  a  loose, migrant society into  a  tightly-knit

multi-racial,   multi-religious   and   multi-lingual   society.

Economically,  we  have  developed  from  a  port  dependent  on

entrepot  trade  to  an  industrialized  economy,  dependent  on

exports   and  then  further  developed  into  an  open  economy

characterised by services and high technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in our policies have been decided during the

debates in this august Chamber before they are implemented.  Our

Parliament has witnessed all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2341</b></font><br><br>



important decision-making on the policies of our

country.  It is an important  source of the history of

Singapore.  Our House has fully demonstrated the decision-making

process of democracy, whether you are a Member of the Government

party or a Member of the Opposition party,  in the cut and

thrust of parliamentary debates.  The beauty is, even after

heated arguments, we have abided by the decision of the

majority.  Unlike parliaments elsewhere, where physical violence

takes place regularly, our Members, under the able guidance of

you, Mr Speaker, have fully participated in the process and

demonstrated the spirit of parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to mention a historical

incident  which  could  have  changed  the  development  of  our

history.   In 1961, when the Government proposed the  motion  to

merge with Malaysia, heated debates took place.  There were many

different  views.   Led  by  Dr Lee Siew  Choh,  eight  PAP  MPs

announced on 14th July that they disagreed with the party policy

and decided to leave the party.  In the Anson by-election, David

Marshall  defeated  the PAP candidate.  The  circumstances  then

were certainly unfavourable to the PAP.  On 20th July 1961,  the

then  Prime  Minister Lee Kuan Yew, moved a motion of confidence

in  the  House.   The debate started at half  past  two  in  the

afternoon  and  went  on till 4 o'clock  the following  morning.

The  motion  was  won by the PAP Government with  a  very  small

margin.  The confidence motion was passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the House had not passed the confidence motion then, the

PAP  Government would have to resign and hold another  election.

Perhaps the history of Singapore would have completely been  re-written.   Although  the history of parliamentary  democracy  in

Singapore was still very short, it played its effective role  at

the  critical  moment  and  resolved a  very  serious  political

crisis,  enabling the Government to give full play to its  moral

authority and power, thereby bringing Singapore to the track  of

rapid development and progress. It is because of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2342</b></font><br><br>



that Singapore has arrived where we are.  This is a

very important contribution by parliamentary democracy to the

development of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will soon leave this Chamber to move to the new

Chamber in the modern Parliament House, and continue our  debate

there.   In  the  last 45 years, this Chamber has witnessed  the

Prime  Minister,  the  Ministers and the MPs  engaging  in  many

debates.    It  has  enabled  the  public  to  have   a   better

understanding of  the process of legislation. We must  recognize

and  confirm the contributions by MPs in the past, and  we  hope

that our present and future  MPs will emulate the spirit of  our

predecessors   in   this  House  to  carry  out   their   duties

outstandingly, as  representatives of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's motion.

<br>5.02 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  the only Member here, only one of the 25 elected Assemblymen

in  this Chamber, when the first Legislative Assembly met in its

first Session in April 1955, 44 years ago.  It may be useful  to

recapture, if only partially, the atmosphere of that period.  We

had  met  for the first time and the first order of business  of

the new elected Chief Minister was to move a Motion of Thanks to

the  Queen.   The  Chief Minister, Mr David Marshall,  rose  and

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House conveys its humble duty and thanks to Her

Majesty the Queen for her gracious message."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message was:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That I look forward with every confidence to the faithful

discharge  of this trust for I am sure that those on  whom  this

responsibility  falls will carry it out with foresight,  courage

and honesty of purpose."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was then sitting in the Opposition leading three other

Assemblymen out of the 25.  I decided that we would let it pass,

as a matter of courtesy to Her Majesty the Queen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second order of business was the motion by Mr

Marshall's number 2,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2343</b></font><br><br>



Mr Lim Yew Hock.  He rose to convey to the

Secretary of State for the Colonies, Alan Lenox Boyd, an

expression of warm appreciation for his message.  That message

was a political message.  I decided I would not let it pass.

After it was seconded by Mr M.P.D. Nair, who was one of the new

Ministers, I rose to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Speaker, Sir, we are asked on this motion to associate

ourselves  with the Government to thank the Secretary  of  State

for  the  Colonies for having sent us this message.  Far  be  it

from the People's Action Party not to observe the civilities and

courtesies of life, but I think it is important that  we  should

take  this  occasion  to remind ourselves what  we  have  to  be

grateful for."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his message, the Secretary of State for the Colonies

said:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It gives me great pleasure to send a message of greetings

and  goodwill  to the Legislative Assembly of Singapore  on  the

historic   occasion  of  its  first  meeting   under   the   new

Constitution.  My only regret is that neither I nor  any  of  my

Ministerial Colleagues can be present in person to deliver it."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he went on, and this is where he gave me the opening.

He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I must first of all congratulate all those who have taken

part  in the working out of this New Constitution, the Committee

under  the  Chairmanship of Sir George Rendel who  now  see  the

fulfilment of their labours and His Excellency the Governor  and

his  officers who have devoted much time to framing and bringing

the Constitution into operation."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gave me a golden hammer to bang the table with, because

of  the mood outside.  It is important if you are going to  make

an  impact, that what you say inside must resonate outside.   It

is not enough to resonate in this Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I moved and waded into the Chief Minister with youthful

relish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, in all these pious hopes, [we join with the Chief

Minister]  and  we thank him for his good wishes,  but  we  take

exception  when  he saiys "I must first of all congratulate  all

those  who  have  taken  part in the working  out  of  this  New

Constitution, the Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir George

Rendel."   Sir,  the  authors of this  constitution,  with  some

exceptions,  were  not  representatives  of  the  people.    Its

Chairman [Sir George Rendel] was a man with a very distinguished

career   in   the   diplomatic  service,  amongst   whose   many

achievements  in  life was a trip across  Saudi  Arabia  at  the

invitation  of  King  Ibn   Saud.  No  doubt  that  gave  him  a

sufficient understanding of our political and economic problems,

but  the  people of Singapore on 2nd April did not  congratulate

these  men and they decisively showed, with one exception,  that

they would not have the authors of this phoney

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2344</b></font><br><br>

constitution.   [They were all voted out.]  That one  exception,

Sir,  is because the Member concerned is a man who is versatile,

a  man  of  many sides and many colours, a man who was agile  at

some  later  date to dissociate himself from some very  spurious

provisions of that recommendation.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That man was Lim Yew Hock.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then said, I quoted the Chief Minister what he had been

saying  in  the hustings, "that this constitution  was  outmoded

even  before  it started, and if men of stature  were  asked  to

operate the constitution it would not work."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said he never expected himself to be the Chief Minister.

So I quoted him.  The Chief Minister rose to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Correction. That is an inaccurate report of what was

indicated.  I said that men of stature, [that's him] if  elected

[and  he  was]  could conflict very sharply  with  the  Official

Ministers designated in that constitution.  I did not say it was

unworkable."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reply was:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very well, Sir. I am afraid I must apologise to the Hon.

the  Chief  Minister for having so inaccurately  summarised  it;

.Now,  Sir,  I  think  the People's Action Party  is  charitable

enough  to believe that there are men of stature on the  Benches

opposite  and we look forward with great anticipation, and  even

with  some  amusement,  to the conflicts that  would  inevitably

arise."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned to another Member of the Front bench and said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Only a few days ago an eminent supporter of the Government

Benches,  who was in Bandoeng, (there was a great conference  in

the city of Bandoeng where Afro-Asian leaders gathered in 1955),

no  doubt exhilarated by the high rarified mountain air in those

parts, was moved to say that this Constitution was nothing but a

cloak for colonialism."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is another one of them. They gave me openings. I

took  them and rammed through.  The Chief Minister was  not  one

who  would  take things lying down.  He stood up  and  tried  to

explain his position.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have clearly indicated in our policy which will be

debated  in  our motion of thanks to His Excellency's   Address,

the  Government is of the view that the present constitution  is

inadequate, but it is not of the view that it is unworkable  and

never has been.  There will be conflicts, Sir, there is no doubt

about   it,   but  the  policy,  the  doctrine,  of   collective

Ministerial  responsibility  will,  I  think,  prevail  in   all

circumstances.  [Now he is telling his Ministers and  the  three

officials - Chief

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2345</b></font><br><br>

Secretary, Financial Secretary and the Attorney-General, three

British officials], . will make it workable where there is

goodwill.  Whatever the conflicts within the ministerial ranks,

it must be remembered that the people have the majority

representation in the Council of Ministers [that is, he and his

Ministers], and the majority decision will prevail."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very different world. There was a nominated Member

of  Parliament  who was a Scotsman, a banker of  Chartered  Bank

called  Mr  Sutherland.  He represented the  British  commercial

interests.  He rose to speak and said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, I had no idea that I should rise so early in the

House, but I now do so because I am delighted to learn from  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) that I only represent

myself.  So I think I have every right to say something."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I put him on the defensive right from the word go: we

represent the people outside, he represented himself.   He  then

quoted his Foreign Secretary, Sir Anthony Eden:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I should like to remind the House of the conditions the

British  Prime Minister (Sir Anthony Eden had become  the  Prime

Minister)  when he was Foreign Secretary laid down ...  firstly,

to suppress terrorism;  secondly, to see that the people were on

guard against Communist infiltration and aggression; thirdly, to

develop  a  sound economy and administration and  to  achieve  a

durable accord between races; and fourthly, to provide a  secure

system of defence."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then said:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speaking as a native of a country that has experienced

seven  centuries  of  freedom since Magna Carter,  I  thoroughly

sympathise  with the feelings of the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar,

but  I  agree with the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon  Teck,

who was a banker and a Member of the Progressive Party) that the

time is not yet ripe."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

We were not ready for independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it was not possible to predict how, from that

very  controlled,  modulated beginning,  this  House  went  into

rambunctious  tumult, as strikes, go-slows  and  riots  overtook

Singapore.   Because for several years before  that,  since  the

Declaration of Emergency in 1948, all was quiet.  That  election

period  let  off tremendous forces that were at  work,  and  the

communist organisations directed the secret cadres in the  trade

unions, the Old Boys' Associations and the newspapers to come to

life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2346</b></font><br><br>



They generated enormous excitement and political

agitation.  We were taking our first steps away from direct rule

by a Governor who presided over a mainly nominated Legislative

Councillors to a partially self-governing Singapore.  The Chief

Minister was supposed to be in charge of the Government but key

subjects, like foreign affairs and defence, were controlled by

London and in Singapore, the Chief Secretary, the Financial

Secretary and the Attorney-General were all ex-officio British

appointed officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-reading Hansard, I was reminded of the light-hearted

irreverence  of  the proceedings in this House because  we  were

educated   about  the  underground  forces  at  work   and   how

comprehensive   was   the  hold  of  the  communists   on   that

dissatisfied ground.  We thought it was fun and games.   It  was

not.   It is a world that has vanished.  Not quite.  Some  areas

where  communist supporters had been resettled, I notice,  still

voted  against  the  Government.  People  do  not  change  their

loyalties  so easily, in spite of prosperity.  That  period  can

only  be partially recaptured by those who were present and  who

will refresh their memory with these records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in those first four years, 1955 to 1959, this House

provided  me  with a forum.  It was the days before  television.

The  newspapers  were dead set against the PAP because  we  were

identified  as  pro-communists or likely to be  stooges  of  the

communists  and therefore a danger and a menace to democracy  in

Singapore.   But they could not ignore what took place  in  this

Chamber because they reflected what was going on outside -  Hock

Lee  bus  riots, series of strikes, go-slows which had  erupted.

By  the  end of the second year, 1955 to 1957, tumultuous events

took  place  outside  this Chamber.  Late in  1956  after  David

Marshall  had resigned and Lim Yew Hock took over,  Lim  made  a

terrible mistake of ordering the Singapore Police Force, led  by

British  officers, to clear up stay-in students of Chinese  High

School and Chung Cheng High School.  He never recovered.  He was

portrayed as having destroyed Chinese language,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2347</b></font><br><br>



education, culture.  We learned some elementary

lessons on politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the second year (1957) after a second sweep

of  pro-communist union workers, after their front line  leaders

were  removed, the second front line - when Lim Chin  Siong  was

taken  in,  his brother Lim Chin Joo took over - not as  bright,

not  as  charismatic,  but he carried  his  brother's  name  and

regrouped  the  forces.   This time it was  portrayed  as  being

against  the workers.  By the end of 1957, the ground  sentiment

had gone solidly against the Government and the other parties in

this  Assembly that supported the Government, and in  favour  of

the  PAP.   The elections in 1959 was ours to lose.  I  made  no

mistakes  between 1957 and 1959 and we swept to victory  in  the

1959  elections,  winning 43 out of the 51 seats.   Without  the

platform  that  this Chamber provided, the PAP  could  not  have

built up its support so quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those four years also educated my colleagues and me on the

realities  of  the problems we were going to face once  we  took

power.  Chinese chauvinism exploited by the communists - Chinese

education,  language,  culture  -  the  dissatisfaction  of  the

workers  who  felt  that  they  were  shortchanged.   Tremendous

housing  shortage,  unemployment,  lack  of  schools,  lack   of

opportunities.  It was a toss-up between taking  over  since  it

was  ours to lose or letting a bunch of incompetents and corrupt

Ministers carry on for a second term, while we built up  outside

and  became stronger, but ran the risk of the whole system - the

civil  service, all its institutions - becoming  corrupted.   We

decided we had to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next four years, from 1959 to 1963, turned out to be

even  more momentous.  Several crises played themselves  out  in

this House.  The most important was the day we decided to have a

motion  of  confidence,  which Ker Sin Tze  had  recounted.   We

wanted to separate the goats from the sheep.  It is difficult to

capture   the  atmosphere  because  today  the  communists   are

nobodies.   But  at that time, they believed,  and  many  people

believed,  that they were the tide of history.  And  Assemblymen

had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2348</b></font><br><br>



to decide whether you go against that tide of

history and get swept away or you ride the surf.  We took a

vote.  Thirteen of them decided to ride the surf.  The biggest

surf rider of all was Dr Lee Siew Choh.  He was no communist.

We had fielded him as a candidate because Dr Goh Keng Swee knew

him as a fellow student, he was in medical college, and as a

chess player and a gambler.  He gambled in his moves.  And we

said, why not, he spoke Chinese.  He was promised by the

Communists that he would become the Prime Minister.  And one

doctor who was no communist also joined them.  I do not know how

old Dr Ker was then.  Maybe he remembered reading it in the

newspapers or perhaps he looked up Hansard that after the

debate, at 4.00 am, after the votes were counted, we were still

the Government, and the battle began in earnest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time we had shrugged the albatross off our necks.

We  expelled  the  13  pro-communist  PAP  Assemblymen  who  had

abstained from voting.  They did not vote against us.  They were

still hoping that somehow they would find a way to stay in power

with  us.   We  expelled  them.  They went  into  opposition  as

Barisan Sosialis, with Dr Lee Siew Choh as their leader.   Quite

a  few  Members  in  this  House will remember  Dr  Lee  in  his

interlude as a Non-Constituency MP from 1988 to 1991.  But  what

they  saw was a shadow of Dr Lee, an older, much chastened  man;

this  time without the aura and the sense of imminent  power  of

the  communists  behind  him.  We saw a man,  who  Members  will

remember,  found  it  difficult to take himself  seriously.   He

would make a statement, then he would giggle at himself, because

he  knew  it was ridiculous to say these things.  He  could  not

take  himself seriously.  But I remember him in the 1960s  as  a

defiant  figure, ranting at the Government Frontbenches, fervent

in  the  belief that he was destined for greatness as  the  next

Prime Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those in this House who have not experienced those

times,  let  me  say  why  I call this House  something  like  a

theatre.   Whenever there is a crisis, the crowd would  fill  up

the  Strangers' Gallery.  It happened when there were  riots  in

June



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2349</b></font><br><br>



1955 when I was denounced by Mr David Marshall, and

from time to time when there was great disorder outside and the

Government was under pressure.  And, of course, the most

momentous was on 21st July 1961 when 13 PAP Assemblymen had

moved across.  The opposition, we were not sure how they would

vote.  And Dr Lee Siew Choh went great guns for seven hours with

a team of script writers inside the Opposition Members' room,

providing him with material that he read for the first time.  My

colleagues and I rose on points of order, but the Speaker, Sir

George Oehlers, leaned over backwards, and allowed this

filibustering to go on.  I do not know what they hoped to gain

by that filibuster, perhaps time to win over more PAP

Assemblymen, then knock out the Government, but they did not

succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an even more memorable occasion when we had

debates on the Referendum Bill that they tried to procrastinate.

But  by  then, we knew that the dice had been thrown,  and  they

could not overthrow us.  Although it was 25-25 across the aisle,

we  were never voted out.  I calculated rightly that the  Tengku

would  never allow Mr Lim Yew Hock to vote us out and  face  the

prospect of having to deal with the Barisan Sosialis government.

So  we  have  never  sullied our position by taking  in  corrupt

people into our ranks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Malaysia, in September 1963, the drama moved away

from  this Chamber.  Because law and order, the police and armed

forces, were subjects under the central government, so two  race

riots  in  July  and September 1964 could not be  debated  here.

When  the  centre of gravity returned after 9th August 1965,  Dr

Lee was not in this Chamber, because he had lost his election to

Dr  Toh  Chin  Chye by some 91 votes.  They were critical  votes

because had he been in this Chamber, he would never have allowed

his  Barisan MPs to boycott it.  As he was not here, he  decided

on  their  behalf that the 13 of them should boycott Parliament.

It  was  a  fateful mistake.  For 16 years from 1965 till  1981,

without  any  Opposition  in this Chamber,  in  four  successive

general elections that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2350</b></font><br><br>



we won, 1968, 1972, 1976 and 1980.  We reshaped the

political landscape of Singapore.  Crucial was that we never

abused the trust the people placed on us.  We maintained

rigorous standards of propriety and honesty.  There was no more

exciting drama, no crowds in the Strangers' Gallery.  I do not

miss an audience when there is none.  I know that that means

there is calm, peace, confidence outside.  The only time it was

filled up was on ceremonial occasions, like the Opening of

Parliament or, perhaps, today, on the final session of this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they were important years because in the calm, quiet

and  sober  mood  of  deliberation, we laid the  foundation  for

Singapore's future.  We consolidated our young nation.   I  hope

that  for a long while yet the House will not attract the  press

and  the public because they smell blood.  It is when they smell

blood  -  a government about to be thrown out when it loses  the

vote - that they would come to watch the kill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when writing my memoirs to recapture those years, I

scanned  the Addresses made by the Head of State, the  Yang  Di-Pertuan Negara, and, after 1965, the President, to this Chamber.

They  were  all  crafted by my colleagues and  me,  and  were  a

barometer of our concerns over the 30 years I was in charge from

1959  to  1990.  They break neatly into three distinct  periods:

1959  to  1965 where we had a hectic political situation wrecked

by  spasms  of  violence  and tension and  when  grave  economic

problems  were  piling  up,  but not given  full  attention  to,

because Ministers were too distracted.  Then a second period  of

intense  stress from 1965 to 1971.  Then it was a deep sense  of

urgency, an urgency that  enveloped us as we knew we had to cope

on our own to build an army to defend ourselves, rushed to build

an air force before the British withdrew after they announced it

in  1968  for 1971, that was when it reached crisis proportions.

1968  to  1971, between the time they announced it and the  time

they  withdrew,  those four years were critical  years  for  our

young republic.  We knew we either made it or we would fail.  We

worked hard, we worked smart, and, most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2351</b></font><br><br>



important, we worked as a team.  By the time the

British withdrew in October 1971, we had avoided massive

unemployment which we had feared because some 30,000 civilian

employees, about 12% to 15% of the workforce, were discharged

with redundancy benefits.  And some 40,000 outside - shopkeepers, bartenders, laundrymen, those maids who serviced

the families of the British servicemen - were also affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our defence, I think we were fortunate because,

although  we  had an incipient, a budding little  nucleus  of  a

defence  force,  the British, together with the Australians  and

New Zealanders, decided after all, because there was a change in

Government  in Britain in 1970 - Labour was out, Prime  Minister

Edward Heath's Conservative came in - they would stay on, but in

a  reduced capacity.  And that bought us another four years till

1975.    After  we  rode the oil crisis in 1973,  we  were  more

confident  that we could survive on our own.  The  final  period

for  me,  1972  to 1990, was a time for qualitative improvements

across the board, with our concerns shifting over the years  and

moving from fundamentals to the finer qualities of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my speeches in this House mirrored the changes in mood

and challenge of the time.  As I said, the first two years (1955

to  1957), it was light-hearted and quite enjoyable, the cut and

thrust of parliamentary debate with David Marshall providing  me

with the sparring partner.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise on a point of order

to  ask if the Senior Minister has not exceeded the time allowed

for speeches.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He has not exceeded the time. Your point of

order is irrelevant.  Please be seated.  Please continue, Senior

Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I sympathise with the Member, once upon a

time  for Anson, now Non-Constituency.  He reminds me of  people

in   the  constituencies.   Whenever  the  Prime  Minister  goes

walkabout, somebody would say, "Come on, join in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>



They are taking a photograph."  It is a photo

opportunity.  Unless it is a point of order, I would ask ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No. There are plenty of moments for him

to clarify his thoughts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member having the floor is not

giving way to you, Mr Jeyaretnam.  Please resume your speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> One photo opportunity is enough.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You say that it is not relevant and then he

goes on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You allow him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, when we realised how deep and all-embracing was the grip of the communists on the ground and their

determination to seize power, my mood changed.  I lost my

youthful innocence.  The seriousness of the threat and the high

stakes involved brought a more sombre tone to my speeches,

reflecting my deep concerns for the future.  Politics was a

deadly serious business, in which all the parties, all the

players, including us, were playing for keeps.  Make no mistake

about this.  In this Chamber, we are playing for keeps.  The

future of Singapore and its three-plus million people is not a

question for light-hearted banter.  We are seeing before our

eyes today what has happened in the last two years in Indonesia

and what is happening right at this moment in East Timor, and

yet if you cast your mind back to 1997, all was peaceful.  So

when I hear these speeches about liberties, freedoms, and so on,

I said that is a luxury we, by our tough, hard-headed policies,

have afforded them to talk about.  But for us, nobody would be

here today.  Imagine what this place would be like.  So I make

no apologies either to the people, to my opponents here or to my

critics abroad.  Nobody believed we could make it, but we have.

But there is no reason to believe that we will continue to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2353</b></font><br><br>



make it. We will continue to make it only if there

are tough-minded people who know the difference between the

froth and the substance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as people in Singapore became better educated, our MPs

reflected this change.  In 1955, there were four of us.   I  was

the only one with a university education.  Goh Chew Chua, an old

man,  had made his way up in the world as a building contractor.

Lim  Chin  Siong did not finish Chinese high school.  And  Ahmad

Ibrahim, a trade unionist from the Naval Base Labour Union,  did

not  complete  standard  six.   In  1959,  43  PAP  Assemblymen,

competent  politically,  were not highly  educated,  grassroots,

trade  unionists, two barbers, one farmer, journalists and  many

non-graduate  teachers.  With  each  successive  election,   the

educational  level improved, as it must.  Unless this  House  is

able  to  reflect the different population that  is  growing  up

outside, it will not remain relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voters expect their MPs to be better educated, more

energetic and effective than they themselves are, and humble and

grateful  that they have been voted in once every four  to  five

years.   But  that is the way it is.  This trend will  continue.

It  means that MPs will have to be more knowledgeable and debate

issues at a higher intellectual level.  That is happening, and I

am  proud  to say that I have contributed to this process.   But

all  said  and  done, each batch of MPs met the needs  of  their

generation  of  voters or the PAP MPs would not  have  been  re-elected the next time round.  Because if you have an MP who does

not  tend to his constituents and does not represent them  well,

that  is a problem at the next election.  Because they did, they

enabled the Government to implement tough but sound policies and

got  us  to  where  we  now are.  They were  men  and  women  of

integrity.  During the 40 years, since 1959, only four MPs  have

smudged  this record of clean and honest government,  only  four

out of over 100 MPs over a space of 40 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the absence of the opposition, we encouraged our

backbenchers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>



to play a critical role; their questioning has

helped to ventilate issues which otherwise would not have been

brought forward.  The critical period, as I said, for our

foundation was three years of intense stress, 1968 to 1971, when

we reshaped our industrial relations.  If we carried on the way

we did previously with irresponsible unions calling strikes and

go-slows, we would have perished.  The union leaders knew that.

Although they made powerful speeches why we should not go so

far, nobody, no trade unionist in this House voted against

amendments to the Employment Act, Trade Unions Act and the

Industrial Relations Act. They have created the foundation on

which our industrial relations have produced benefits for

workers, in their homes, CPF, schools, clinics, hospitals, for

the employers in the businesses that they have expanded, and for

the Government in their repeated good returns at successive

elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no more moments of high drama because the

Government's majority was never at risk.  Even when we lost  one

seat in Anson to Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam in 1981, the excitement was

momentary  because no one expected major change.  Mr  Chiam  See

Tong  created  a bigger wave in Singapore when he won  a  second

time  in 1988 with a total of three seats.  It carried long-term

implications  if  the trend had continued.   Unfortunately,  for

him, he fumbled and he got expelled from his own party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: will this House see the return of an

Opposition  that can pose a serious challenge to  the  PAP?   My

answer:  that  depends  on whether the  governing  party  allows

itself  to  go soft and flabby, and ceases to respond creatively

to  changing  circumstances, and loses  its  standing  with  the

people.   This will surely happen if the PAP does not self-renew

by  attracting some of the brightest and the best of each year's

cohort  to  become  MPs  and  later  Ministers,  men  and  women

committed to improving the lives of their fellow citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important is that the PAP must never be foolish

in refusing, or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>



failing to include on its side, able and dedicated

men of strong political convictions, whether because of

differences of personality or unwillingness to adjust to PAP

policies, and that drives them to the Opposition benches.

Because a few sincere and capable leaders could be the spearhead

of a group of men and women, able in one or two election terms,

to present the voters with a shadow cabinet, an alternative team

that can match the PAP's.  I was able to build up a credible

team in one election term, four years after getting elected into

this Chamber in 1955, just four years, because I had a group of

talented colleagues outside the Chamber to plan and implement

our strategy and I could present at election time a credible

government of people with experience in administration and

business who could be trusted to govern the country.  Apart from

barbers, farmers and trade unionists for grassroots support, we

presented a team with a programme that is still available in

print called The Tasks Ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such a turn of events were to happen, where the PAP is

displaced  by a leaner, keener and shrewder team,  I  would  not

shed  any  tears  over such an ouster.  I would  say  that  they

deserved  to be ousted.  For this would be one way to renew  the

political  leadership of Singapore.  What  would  be  cause  for

despair, and this is the reason for the Elected Presidency, if a

transient mood of disappointment among the people as a result of

some  setback or mishap just before an election and it  were  to

lead  them  to  reject  the PAP and vote in  a  motley  crew  of

incompetents  and adventurers.  That could end  up  in  tragedy.

Hence  it  is  important  for  us  to  expose  opportunists  and

incompetents  before they can pass themselves  off  as  possible

replacements for the PAP.   There is a reason behind  the  sharp

replies  that  we  give.   If  you  allow  someone  who  is   an

adventurer, who is incompetent, who is a liar, to pass off as  a

credible  person, then we are in trouble.  And for that  reason,

when I look at Dr Vasoo there, I feel proud that we have such  a

Member  because  when Dr Chee came out in the 1992  by-elections

and I found that he was his subordinate, I asked Vasoo what sort

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>



man he was.  He said, "Well, so-so, not so bad."

But after Dr Chee's conduct in the elections, he decided, on his

own, that he would expose the man as a charlatan, a petty liar

and a thief.  You can imagine the amount of problems we would

have once he is elected and allowed to become a Minister.  The

spin doctors that would be at work that have surrounded

themselves around his office.  So there is a serious purpose

which the foreign press of course thinks is dictatorial and

authoritarian.  But look at their countries. They do not

discover the character of their leader until after he has gone

into office, then they wring their hands.  Is that wise?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament's chamber does not stand unchallenged as a

pulpit  to  get  your views across.  With television,  the  pre-eminence of this Chamber as a forum, has been challenged by many

other  settings.  It is not just for Singapore.  You will notice

that  in Britain, Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, regularly uses

television    settings   outside   Parliament,    because    his

parliamentary setting is too raucous, too noisy, too disorderly,

everybody  wants to catch the eyes of the Speaker to  appear  on

television, a television opportunity to project themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a reception you gave, Mr Speaker, Sir, a few years ago,

you  invited  a  former Speaker of the House of Commons,  George

Thomas  (later  Lord  Tonypandy).  And over  drinks,  the  Prime

Minister  and I asked him whether the introduction of television

was  a good thing for Parliament. He said it was inevitable  but

he  did  not  think  so,  because it had  lowered  standards  of

behaviour  in  Parliament and standards of  debate.   They  were

speaking  for  a wider audience.  But it has to happen,  and  we

have to live with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However Parliament as an arena for the contest of wits and

wills  over  matters  of policies will always  remain  important

because  of  our  system of parliamentary democracy,  where  the

Prime  Minister  has to command the support of the  majority  in

this  House,  not  outside.  He is elected not  by  the  general

electorate but by Members of this House, and there is a profound

difference.  As a voter outside, you only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>



know Mr Chiam or Mr Low Thia Khiang from his

speeches in print or from the bits you catch of him on

television or from listening to him at mass rallies. But in this

House, with constant interaction, you get the measure of the

man, his character, his ability, his integrity, the quickness

with which he is able to seize a point or the charm with which

he laughs away and says, "Well, I am not very good in

arithmetic."  And for that reason, Mr Chiam got re-elected.  Had

he tried to pretend that he was a mathematician, Potong Pasir

would have written him off; but Potong Pasir liked the sincerity

of this man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is a better system for choosing a

leader  because  the selectors have a better  knowledge  of  the

person  they  will  support  as  against  those  voting  for   a

presidential candidate whom they know little about  except  what

they  see on television and what the mass media reports  him  to

have   said.   Therefore,  Parliamentary  debates  will   remain

important, not just as a forum for the clash of ideas,  but  the

frequent  exchanges  that allow Members  to  get  insights  into

whether this or that MP will make a good leader and deserves  to

lead  them in the next elections, because the leader in the next

elections  will  decide  whether you win  your  seat  easily  or

whether you are clinging to the ledge of the cliff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we close our proceedings in this old Chamber, allow

me, as the oldest Member, a moment of nostalgia.  When I came up

the  stairs  today,  probably for the last time,  I  recall  the

different era when so much depended on how the votes would go at

the  division, the temper of the fierce opponents  who  used  to

frequent  this Chamber and the Members' Room.  They  all  played

their part in keeping Singapore's parliamentary system alive and

well.  I do not just remember the people who are now before  me,

but  more  vividly  in  my mind's eyes are  those  who,  by  the

accident  of  circumstances and the  speeches  they  have  made,

etched  themselves indelibly in my memory. They are ghosts  that

only  I see.  But when I go to the Members' Room or what is  now

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>



Members' Room and used to be the Select Committee

room, I am reminded of the time in March 1958 when I took a

communist underground leader, the Plen as I call him, into that

same room, for our first encounter.  It played a not

insignificant part in the history of Singapore, as did many

other encounters I have had in this Chamber, but none more

momentous and more exciting than that one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a message from a pro-communist trade unionist who

used  to  converse with me in Mandarin to improve  my  Mandarin.

This  was  in  1958  and he said, "Would  I  meet  an  important

person?"   I said, "Yes."  He said, "It had to be very  secret."

I  said,  "Why?"  Because he was wanted and he had  to  be  very

careful.  So I thought, "What if I am caught with him?"  I said,

"Yes, I will meet him if he will meet me at the road between the

Victoria  Memorial Hall and Empress Place."  And we agreed  that

we  would meet there at half-past eleven.  He said that the  man

would  have  his glasses placed in his shirt pocket.   He  would

hold  a Chinese newspaper.  I said fine.  He was there.  I said,

"Come with me." We came up and I took him to the Committee Room.

The staff allowed him in because I brought him in. If the police

were  to descend on me, I would have said, "He is a constituent.

He  wants to see me."  The staff did not know who he was.  So  I

had prepared what I thought was a credible defence.  He said, "I

am  the leader."  I said, "How do I know?"  He said, "You've got

to  take my word for it."  I said, "Well, if you are the leader,

then  you  order  Chan Yuen Tong, who is a Workers'  Party  City

Councillor,  to resign.  Then I'll believe you are the  leader."

He said to me, "Give me time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six weeks later in April, in London, when I attended a

constitutional conference, I opened the Straits  Times,  and  Mr

Chan  Yuen Tong had resigned.  I thought, God, a man, wanted  by

the  police,  hiding  somewhere, is  able,  without  messengers,

telephones, office, no bells, to get this man to resign.  I  was

dealing  with a real leader.  We were to meet again three  times

before  the  elections.  They were momentous  meetings,  because

they decided how the Communists would act



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>



against the PAP, when it formed the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was privileged to be present at the opening of this

Assembly  and fortunate to be present today at our last sitting.

Like  much of Singapore, we have to move out and on.   But  with

this change, something is lost, and not just for me.  There is a

reason  why  the British, and other people with long  histories,

keep  a  certain sense of continuity of place.  So people  never

allow  a  city to be completely demolished and forgotten.   When

Warsaw  was bombed and destroyed in World War II, first  by  the

Germans,  and then by the Russians coming back, they laboriously

rebuilt  Warsaw on their old plans that they dug up,  because  a

people must have a certain sense of place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have the privilege of rebuilding around this

Chamber  to  keep  our  sense of place.   The  building  is  not

capacious  enough, or sturdy enough, to allow us that privilege.

Remember,  when the British House of Commons was  bombed  during

the  War, they decided to rebuild it in exactly the same  place,

and  kept  as much of the old as was possible, so that they  can

say  there  Lloyd  George,  Gladstone or  Disraeli,  made  their

momentous speeches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we became an independent republic in 1965, my

colleagues  and  I considered whether we should move  Parliament

into  a  more handsome building like the City Hall.  We  decided

against  it.   We  wanted to keep our sense of proportion.   The

importance  of this Chamber did not, and does not,  depend  upon

its  size and its grandeur, but upon the quality of the men  and

women  who occupy it as representatives of the people.  We  must

have that sense of proportion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard Sidek Saniff saying that perhaps we should be

one  of the memorable tribes that Kotkin wrote about, I say,  if

only  that were true.  It is beyond our reach.  But the premises

we  are  moving  to  is within our sense of proportion.   It  is

better furnished, more spacious, but not the magnificent and awe

inspiring edifice that many new nations put up.  By the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>



standards of other public and private buildings in

Singapore, it is modest by comparison.  But that is a virtue.

Behind the understatement lie great strengths of character,

integrity and determination.  That is what will see Singapore

through, not the grand statements and monuments in brick and

mortar or steel and concrete, with which so many other new

nations try to impress themselves and their followers.

[Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, by way of

clarification, put one question to the Senior Minister?  Will he

tell  us, within the few minutes left, after he came into power,

why  he jettisoned many of the things that he had stood for when

he was in the opposition?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not find any profit in this exchange.

If  I  had  not  lived  and learned, I would  have  failed,  and

Singapore  would have failed.  Every day that I  live,  I  learn

something new.  The world changes.  I keep abreast of  it.   And

we  are abreast of it because I have never stopped learning.   I

am  not  static and I hope never will be.  The trouble with  the

Non-Constituency Member is that his mind froze.  I  have  ceased

to  want  to  listen to him because I hear nothing new.   It  is

frozen  in time, which is a pity for him and for those who  have

to report him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have another question. Will he tell us ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are running out of time. I suggest

that if you want to discuss this, save it for another occasion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Will the Senior Minister be present at the

next debate?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members, in a short while, we will be

leaving  this Chamber and we will be making our move  to  a  new

House.   I hope you will bear with me if I take this opportunity

to say a few words.  [Applause.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your encouragement, I think I will now say more than a

few words!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>, this building is the oldest Government

building in Singapore.  In 1819, when Stamford Raffles landed in

Singapore, the site of this building was occupied by the

Temenggong of Singapore and his followers.  Raffles purchased

the site from the Temenggong.  But by an administrative

oversight, a permit was issued to J A Maxwell to build a two-storey mansion on the site in 1826.  Maxwell did not occupy the

building when it was completed but instead rented it to the

Government which bought it back in an auction in 1841.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then used as a court house and subsequently as

public offices.  It housed the Supreme Court of the Colony until

1939, and after World War II, it continued to be used by various

Government departments.  In 1953, extensive works took place  to

transform  it into Assembly House which was officially  declared

open  by  the Governor, Sir John Nicoll, on 7th July 1954.   The

Legislative  Council, which hitherto held  its  meeting  at  the

Victoria  Memorial  Hall,  had its  first  sitting  in  the  new

Assembly  House  on  20th July 1954.  On 22nd  April  1955,  the

Legislative Assembly of Singapore held its first meeting here in

this Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After independence in 1965, the building was renamed

Parliament  House.  In late 1988, this Chamber was renovated  to

seat 90 Members in the enlarged Seventh Parliament, and even  as

recent  as  two  years ago, with the increase in the  number  of

Nominated Members, minor adjustments had to be made to  increase

the seating capacity to its full complement of 93.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 32 seats in the first days of the Legislative Assembly

to 93 seats in the Ninth Parliament, this Chamber has housed the

legislature for forty-five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be appropriate for me to say a few words about

some   of  the  people  who  have  made  contributions  to   our

legislative history and who have served the House for  the  past

forty-five years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has had five Speakers from 1955 to 1989. They were:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Oehlers, who served in that position from 22nd April

1955 to 21st October 1963;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E W Barker, from 22nd October 1963 to 31st October 1964;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A P Rajah, from 2nd November 1964 to 5th August 1966;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P Coomaraswamy, from 17th August 1966 to 18th January 1970;

and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh Ghim Seng, from 27th January 1970 to 8th January 1989.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 12 Deputy Speakers served in that position from

1955 to 1993.  They were:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R C H Lim, 1955 to 1959;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G Kandasamy, 1959 to 1961;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Mammen, 1961 to 1963;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fong Kim Heng, 1963 to 1965;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P Coomaraswamy, 1966;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeoh Ghim Seng, 1968 to 1970;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tang See Chim, 1972 to 1981;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hwang Soo Jin, 1981 to 1985;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan Soo Khoon (myself), 1985 to 1989;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim Boon Heng, 1989 to 1991; and Abdullah Tarmugi, 1989 to

1993, at a time when the House had two Deputy Speakers; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eugene Yap, since 1993.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will, of course, be cognizant of the fact that one

amongst  us,  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, has that  singularly

rare  distinction of having served in this House since its first

sitting day as the Legislative Assembly in 1955.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also want to briefly mention the Clerks who have

served  the House.  L W Donough was the Clerk of the Legislative

Assembly until 31st March 1956.  He was succeeded by P  R  Lewis

who served as Clerk from 1st April 1956 to 5th March 1957.  Loke

Weng  Chee succeeded him from March 1957 till May 1965.   Abilio

Lopez succeeded Loke Weng Chee and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2363</b></font><br><br>



served as Clerk until 31st March 1995.  He, in all,

worked in this building for over forty years.  Another figure

some of us will fondly remember was the Sergeant-at-Arms, Sidek

bin Allang, who served from 22nd March 1972 till his untimely

death on 17th January 1991.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these officers, as well as others, too many for me to

mention  here  today,  as well as the present  officers  of  the

House,  will  be  remembered for the part  they  played  in  its

history.   There  are  many  others who  have  made  significant

contributions  to  our  legislative history  and  on  behalf  of

Honourable  Members,  I  want to thank all  of  them  for  their

contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you may not have noticed it, but since the last

sitting  of  the  House on 18th August 1999, we have  moved  the

Table  of  the House (made when this Chamber underwent extensive

renovations in 1988) to the new Chamber.  In its place  here  is

the  original  Table of the House.  It appears fitting  that  at

this  final sitting in this Chamber, we bring back the  original

Table together with the old despatch boxes, which were given  by

the New Zealand Government on 16th September 1963.  One may well

say that it was on this original Table that the future of modern

Singapore was laid out.  Those with a tinge of nostalgia will be

pleased  to know that this very Table, which has been  kept  for

the  past ten years in the Committee Room will be brought to the

new  building  along with several other items.  I, myself,  have

been  moved to retain in the new Chamber the Chair that  I  have

used  for many years in presiding over our sittings.  It is,  as

they say, bringing along something old with something new.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a few moments we will close the doors of this Chamber

for  the  last  time.  Unaccustomed silence will then  fill  the

Chamber, but this silence might not be for too long if,  as  has

been  reported, the Singapore Symphony Orchestra decides to  use

this  place  for chamber music.  Within these four  walls,  many

speeches have been made in over four decades, speeches that have

helped shape the history of our country and the destinies of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2364</b></font><br><br>



our people.  Across this floor many have crossed

their verbal swords, but wit and humour have also flowed even as

Members pressed home their points with force of argument and

passion.  These four walls have witnessed poignant moments of

excitement and drama, of hope and fear, of joy and tears, and of

laughter and sadness.  There were the moments to remember, as

have been vividly recalled, such as in 1963, when the House had

to listen to a Member who spoke for a record of 7 hours and 16

minutes, a feat which mercifully will not be surpassed because

of the constraints of time on speeches which were adopted by the

House after that.  Or of special sitting days which were called,

such as the one on 20th July 1961, when the Legislative Assembly

met to debate the Prime Minister's motion of confidence on the

Government,  a debate that did not end till almost 4 am the next

day.  And again when the time the House had to meet on a

Saturday and a Sunday (12th to 13th December 1959) in order to

pass the budget on time before the financial year ended.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I reflect the sentiments of hon. Members

when  I  say that it is with some sadness as well as  with  fond

memories  that we leave this building that we have all grown  so

attached to.  Like each and every one of you, I remember vividly

the first time I stepped into this chamber as a new MP.  But  we

are happily looking forward to our new premises.  Some things we

have  to leave behind, but we will carry along with us the  many

parliamentary  traditions  and  practices  that  have  been  and

continue to be the hallmark of this fine institution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank hon. Members for their kind patience and

indulgence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I will suspend the sitting and invite hon. Members

and  our  guests to join me downstairs in a simple  ceremony  to

symbolise  our move to the new Parliament House.  I will  resume

the  Chair at 7.00 pm and look forward to welcoming you  in  our

new Chamber. [Applause.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Honourable Members, I extend to all of

you  a  very  warm  welcome  to  the  new  Parliament  House  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was ten years ago that the idea of a new Parliament

House was first discussed.  As I had related to Members earlier,

accommodation in the Chamber of the old building had reached its

maximum   capacity   and   further  expansion   was   physically

impossible.   In  1989,  I  announced that  the  old  Parliament

Building,  together  with its annexe as well  as  the  Attorney-General's   Chambers,  would  undergo  major   restoration   and

renovations to create a new Parliament complex.  Since then much

of  what  we had originally thought of has changed and today  we

have  built three new blocks and renovated the AG's Chambers  to

create this new Parliament House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An article in the Straits Times of 3rd April 1991 perhaps

best  summarises  the  feelings of some  of  us  at  that  time.

Recalling that some decades ago, many countries had gained their

independence and freedom from their colonial masters, the writer

of  the article stated that at some stage in their post-colonial

development,  these  countries  had  found  it  appropriate   to

construct   a   new  Parliament  building  to  symbolise   their

independence.  But not Singapore, he wrote.  Instead, it used an

old  townhouse built in 1826.  Describing the old  building,  he

wrote, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For Mr Lee Kuan Yew's government, it seemed a suitable

symbol - frugal, unostentatious, powerful but subdued, linked to

the  colonial  roots  of Singapore, but in  no  way  assuming  a

dominating form ..."

<br><br>He continued:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Parliament Chamber is rather cramped. In an

increasingly participatory democracy, there is little space  for

the  public,  and  the press gallery is restricted.   Television

cameras  are conspicuously present.  The Speaker's   Chamber  is

not generous; the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>

library is not extensive for its function; individual Members of

Parliament   have  no  space  in  which  they  can  meet   their

constituents or the press; they do not have a dining  room;  and

the chamber for select committees is inappropriate."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for a new building was therefore motivated by

sheer  necessity for more working space and the need to  provide

for  Parliamentarians well into the future, rather than  by  any

desire to have a symbol of grandeur and glory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past ten years, many have contributed to the

planning and construction of this new building.  In 1990, I  led

a  study team comprising Mr Lim Boon Heng, Dr John Chen, Dr Wang

Kai Yuen and Mr Chandra Das and architects from the Public Works

Department  to study Parliament buildings in various  countries.

We brought back many ideas and sought feedback and further ideas

from our colleagues.  In 1993, a Committee on Parliament Complex

Development  Project chaired by me, together with  Mr  Wong  Kan

Seng, Dr Lee Boon Yang and Mr Lim Hng Kiang, and a Parliamentary

Officer, Ms Ng Sheau Jiuan, as Secretary, was formed to formally

liaise  with  the  architects in its planning  and  construction

stages.   Piling work started in 1994 and construction began  in

1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new building occupies a site area of 2.2 hectares with

a  total  gross floor area (excluding the car parks)  of  19,765

square  metres.   For good measure that stretch of  High  Street

which flanks the eastern side of the building, and which we  had

just  walked  along,  has been appropriately renamed  Parliament

Place.   Our new building has been designed to give it  a  civic

character  as  a  state  building  with  consideration  of   the

historical  and  architectural significance of  the  surrounding

buildings.   It is in fact a blend of the old and new,  as  care

has been taken to restore the old AG's Chambers to serve present-day needs, but together with the new blocks, it is without doubt

a  modern  complex.  We have ensured that it will be a  building

that will enhance the dignity of Parliament but at the same time

it is not ostentatious and luxurious.  If it is large, it is not

because  we  want it to be a dominating building but because  we

need



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>



more space, perhaps not all of it right away but

certainly in the future.  Simplicity in style and practicality

in its functions have been our guiding principles in determining

the final shape of this new Parliament House.  It is a building

we want all Singaporeans to be proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have no doubt begun to feel the difference

between  this  Chamber and the old one.  For one thing,  we  now

have seats for up to 100 Members, with the possibility of adding

another  20  in the future.  The galleries are larger  and  will

hold  more members of the public and the media.  There is a  new

sound-proof  Education Gallery that will allow  students  to  be

briefed  by  their  teachers  while  our  proceedings  are   on.

Together   with  the  programme  which  Parliament's   Education

Department  has drawn up for schools, it is our way of  reaching

out  to  a younger generation.  For those of us who cherish  the

institution  of  parliamentary  democracy,  it  is  our  way  of

ensuring  that future generations inherit our beliefs, practices

and traditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new Chamber, too, many Members would have noticed

that   the   television  cameras  are  less   conspicuous,   but

nevertheless they are still here, well-hidden behind the  walls.

Electronic voting has been provided for and in future, divisions

of  votes  will be over in less than a minute.  It  is  not  too

often  that  we have a division but if we do have  one,  Members

will,  I  am  sure,  appreciate  this  new  time-saving  device.

Computer terminals have been provided for each seat but  I  must

add that Members will not be able to activate these as the House

has  not  made a decision to allow the use of computers  in  the

Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, this new building is fitted with the latest

information  technology links and computerisation facilities  to

allow  Members  to  have  access to  information  databases  and

electronic   forms   of  communication,   and   to   allow   the

administrative   machinery  of  Parliament  to   discharge   its

functions and work more effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some things remain as they are in this new House. We have

brought over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>



Table that was made in 1988 and as I fondly told you

earlier, I have also brought over my old Chair.  The Mace, which

was made in 1959 at the then princely sum of 1,000 English

guineas, continues to serve us as the symbol of the authority of

the Speaker and Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing must not change. Physical improvements alone

cannot make for a better Parliament.  It is the Members who  are

the  life  and  soul of Parliament and they  are  the  ones  who

determine what Parliament will be like.  It is here that we must

continue  to reflect the aspirations of our fellow citizens  and

re-affirm  the confidence that they have placed in us  as  their

representatives.  We will continue to debate and argue, to probe

and  query, to criticize and rebut but we must remember  not  to

abuse  the  powers and privileges that membership in this  House

confers  upon  us.   We  must preserve the fine  traditions  and

dignity of this House, and continue to observe the high standard

of  decorum  that is expected of us as Parliamentarians.   These

have  been  guiding  principles that have been  the  bedrock  of

legislative history in Singapore and must continue to be  so  in

the years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members here today have that rare distinction of

being  the first to sit in this new House.  I myself am honoured

by  the  equally rare opportunity of overseeing the building  of

this  new House and presiding over the move from the old to  the

new.   Few  Speakers anywhere or anytime can claim  this  unique

privilege that you have bestowed on me and I am humbled  by  the

confidence that you have placed in me.  I thank each  and  every

one  of  you,  and  the many others, including  the  architects,

engineers,  interior designers and the staff of Parliament,  who

have  contributed towards the realization of this new Parliament

House.  [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for

this  rather unexpected honour of being the first to resume  the

debate here in this new House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the motion standing in the name of the

Prime Minister, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>



I would like to focus on the key contribution of our

founding fathers and past Members of this House, our unwavering

commitment to the principles of meritocracy and multi-racialism.

In doing so, I draw on my experience as a young parliamentarian

and also on my discussions with young Singaporeans.  For young

Singaporeans, the events of the past two years have been a crash

course in politics, governance and economics.  It has had a

profound impact on young Singaporeans.  It has vividly imparted

lessons that no lecture or textbook on politics or economics

can.  For many, it caused intense emotional and financial strain

at the personal and family levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crisis has also had a salutary effect on our

youth.   Singapore youth have acquired a deeper appreciation  of

the  need for good governance.  In a recent survey conducted  by

the  Feedback  Unit, more than 85% of our youth  felt  that  our

Government's performance in helping Singaporeans affected by the

economic  crisis has been good or very good, and more  than  90%

felt   that  the  Government-people  relationship  has  remained

strong, if not going stronger.  These results are comparable  to

those  for  older  Singaporeans  and  indicate  that  our  young

Singaporeans,  like their elders, appreciate the value  of  good

government, especially in a crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crisis has imbued young Singaporeans, in my view,

with  the renewed respect for commitment to multi-racialism  and

meritocracy.  In the course of the recent convulsions,  we  have

seen  countries compelled to re-examine their core  beliefs  and

principles  by  both external forces and internal  developments.

In  observing these transitions, young Singaporeans have  learnt

one  important lesson.  It requires moral courage and commitment

to  adopt  and  defend core principles such as  meritocracy  and

multi-racialism - even when we know these principles to be self-evident. It is not easy even in the best of times, what more  at

the birth of a nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2370</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, Singapore and Singaporeans are

indebted to our forefathers and past Members of this House for

looking beyond the pressing challenges of a newly independent

country to focus on the key organising principles of our nation,

for their steadfast commitment to meritocracy and multi-racialism even during the toughest of times.  They have also put

in place several institutions and processes to uphold these

principles in practice.  The Public Service Commission selects

recruits for the civil service on the basis of merit.  We have

transparent criteria for admission into our schools and tertiary

education institutions.  The Presidential Council on Minority

Rights and the GRC system emphasise the need to ensure that all

Singaporeans are engaged in the mainstream of our country, and

that all their concerns are also addressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, this House has not shied away from open and

vigorous  debates  when it was felt that these principles  might

perhaps be compromised.  Neither has the Government shirked  its

responsibility to act.  The recent debate on bias in the  labour

market based on gender, ethnicity or age comes to mind.  Another

was the vigorous debate on SAP schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the move of this House to its new

premises,  I  wish  to  place  on  record,  on  behalf  of   all

Singaporeans, our deep appreciation of our founding fathers  and

past   Members'  steadfast  adherence  and  defence   of   these

fundamental tenets of meritocracy and multi-racialism.   I  also

hope  that  current and future Members of this  House  would  be

equally  firm  in  their  commitment  to  these  principles  and

resolute in its defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  today  is  a  day of historical  importance  for

Singapore  Parliament.  The old Chamber  which  was  founded  45

years  ago  had  been  nurturing parliamentary  democracy  in  a

consistent manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has been functioning with integrity and

openness.  It has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2371</b></font><br><br>



debating the country's laws in depth, providing

pragmatic suggestions and solutions.  It has earned the people's

trust, respect and praise.  It must be stressed that the basic

reason for Parliament to have earned the highest regard of the

people is the excellent performance and moral uprightness of the

first generation leaders.  Some of the best leaders of our

country have been Members of this Parliament, especially our

Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in this House

since its early days till today for about 44 years.  This really

adds dignity to this august Chamber.  The old building was built

in 1826 with bricks from Malacca and China and Indian chunnam or

plaster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, Members of the various ethnic groups,

including  Indians,  have  been serving  in  this  Chamber.   It

reflects  Singapore's present multi-racial society.  Apart  from

the  present Indian MPs, 18 other Indians had served as  Members

of   this  Parliament.   Among  the  former  Indian  Members  of

Parliament,  Mr  A  P  Rajah, Mr Punch  Coomaraswamy  served  as

Speakers and Mr G. Kandasamy and Mr John Mammen served as Deputy

Speakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us at the new Chamber continue to play

our part for the development and progress of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr  Speaker  Sir,

thank  you  for allowing me to speak on the motion by the  Prime

Minister.  I rise in support of the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before that, Sir, I could not resist just to mention that

it  is  indeed  an  honour for us that the session  at  the  old

Parliament  House  ended with the most  senior  speaker  in  our

Senior  Minister Lee Kuan Yew and that we start the new  Chamber

with  the  youngest speaker this evening.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I

think  it  bears well for multi-racialism that the  first  three

speakers in the new Chamber are all from the minority group.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2372</b></font><br><br>



Sir, this motion today and the historic move from

the old faithful High Street Parliament House to the modest, yet

high-tech, spankingly new Parliament House at North Bridge Road

give us an opportunity to remind ourselves and Singaporeans just

how far we have come since the embryonic years of parliamentary

democracy.  In the words of our PM, not just the lesson of how

people vote at general elections and democracy, but also the

progression from hardware to heartware.  But yet 45 years are

still "budding", in terms of an evolving democracy and, indeed,

nation building.  Lessons however are plenty, as a guide for us

and future generations to avoid the dangerous rocks that could

sink us asunder.  Yes, we have weathered many trials and

tribulations in the chart of parliamentary democracy.  But the

journey is never complete.  While we have to continue to keep a

lookout for the OB markers, let us also not be too keen to see

pebbles for the rocks and reel back with over reaction when

meeting future challenges.  Our road ahead in this more open,

global and interdependent world to build on the accomplishments

of our predecessors requires a firm but passionate hand and

heart.  This might sound contradictory to some.  But to me, that

is tomorrow's reality today, that is, a balance between the

clarion call for the strong-willed, the lion-hearted and the

care for the weak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, this motion today is also like a call for a vote of

confidence  on  our  parliamentary system  of  democracy.   This

reminds  me  of the fateful debate in Parliament  on  20th  July

1961.   It  was then a battle between the PAP non-communist  and

the  pro-communist  elements.  In the words of  the  then  Prime

Minister, now our Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, it was a motion,

as  the Senior Minister said it earlier today, "to sort out  the

goats  from  the  sheep".   To achieve their  agenda,  the  pro-communists  had  even  consorted  with  their  arch-enemy,   the

British.  That is how complex the situation was.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An American scholar, Prof. Robert Tilman, who had studied

South East Asia for 25 years, once wrote in his book, South East

Asia and the Enemy Beyond, said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>



"how geography, history, language and culture had

all conspired against the countries of ASEAN to make their task

of nation building and economic development more difficult."

Luckily for us today, we do not have to bring an MP on a

stretcher by a hospital ambulance to muster a simple majority

vote for this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happened in that Parliamentary debate in 1961. Mdm

Sahorah  bte  Ahmat  made  that difference  by  delivering  that

deciding  vote  for the non-communist PAP.  For those  who  have

read  The  Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew  will  learn

that   even   securing  her  vote  was  like   a   parliamentary

cliffhanger.  Mdm Sahorah was holding back her vote, not because

she  liked  the  pro-communists, nor was she a communalist,  but

rather  because her other Malay colleagues were ostracising  her

and thus she refused to give them her support.  So we can see it

was  not just ideology and race but also human feelings, if  not

ego,  coming  into play in deciding the fate of our  efforts  at

establishing   parliamentary  democracy.    But   common   sense

prevailed and thanks to former MP, Mr Chan Chee Seng's power  of

persuasion,  Mdm Sahorah voted for the motion and  history  took

its  course to bring us to where we are today for prosperity and

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the swamps of Jurong to a world-class model industrial

estate,  to  a  wealth  we can bank on in Shenton  Way,  to  the

futuristic  Marina Bay hotels, Millenia Walk  and  Suntec  City,

Singapore  has shown what can be done when we have a stable  and

workable parliamentary democracy.  This is especially true  when

the Government and the people can work together in harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our parliamentary democracy to continue to work, social

cohesion is critical.  We cannot take it for granted.  Singapore

Parliament  recognises this and this is evident in the  Acts  it

has  passed  to  enhance  racial harmony  and  social  cohesion.

Whether  the  establishment  of  the  Presidential  Council  for

Minority Rights, Islamic Religious Council (MUIS),



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>



the Hindu Endowments Board, the Maintenance of

Religious Harmony Act and the GRC, it shows a Singapore well

grounded for racial and religious harmony.  But even then, we

cannot take that for granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to enhance the parliamentary democracy we

now  enjoy,  may I propose two points.  One, we need  to  ensure

that  multi-racialism  continues to  be  a  critical  pillar  to

parliamentary democracy.  We must also continue to be  bold  and

creative to strengthen that position.  The more pillars we  have

to  strengthen  the  base  for democracy,  the  better  we  are.

Institutions which we now have for nation building and community

upliftment  and  which  have  been a  source  of  irritation  or

controversy  among  some quarters, for example,  the  community-based  self-help  groups and the SAP schools, will  have  to  be

continually monitored to provide more opportunities for cohesive

and  harmonious  relations.   Similarly,  the  present  creative

parliamentary democratic institutions unique to Singapore,  such

as  the  GRC  and the Presidential Council for Minority  Rights,

need   to   be  periodically  reviewed  and  refined,   whenever

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, more opportunities should be created for Singaporeans,

especially the younger and succeeding generations, to appreciate

the  trials and tribulations of our efforts at establishing  and

enhancing parliamentary democracy.  Our school's effort at civic

education and understanding Singapore's post-war history  should

include such highlights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I conclude by saying that we at

Punggol  East,  Cheng  San GRC, have a slogan  which  emphasises

progress  in harmony.  That, to me, sums up the case  in  point.

For  democracy is nothing without progress in harmony.   In  the

spirit  of that important pillar of our parliamentary democracy,

multi-racialism, allow me to close my comment by repeating  that

slogan  in  three languages: majulah dalam harmoni, inakkathudan

munneru and he xie qian jin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion in the name of the Prime Minister,

Sir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

challenges confronting Members of this House have been vastly

different in each of the last four decades.  We went from

creating an economy virtually from scratch to building it to

what it is today, a well diversified composition of

manufacturing and services.  We achieved this in spite of our

lack of natural resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we started off then by catering to a migrant

population of different races and cultures with different needs,

leanings  and  aspirations.   We now  have  a  population  whose

cohesion  as  a  people has been manifestly evident  during  the

current downturn.  We enjoy racial harmony and high standards of

living, something which we know did not happen by chance, and we

have  achieved this in spite of our short history as  a  nation.

The  common thread running through the decades can be  found  in

the  confidence the electorate has in the integrity and openness

of  our  parliamentary  system.  This  has  been  fulfilled  and

established by the unequivocal commitment of past Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will continue to sail in uncharted seas. But the

key is to mark out the reefs and rocks and to avoid them as best

as we can.  The challenges will continue to be different even as

we  strive  to  build a first world economy in an  era  that  is

marked  by  intensifying  competition  and  borderless  business

dynamics.   Singaporeans will increasingly  cater  to  a  global

economy  and  be  forced  to  adopt  the  necessary  skills  and

perspectives.  Demands on the family unit will be ever  present.

Whilst we can never be sure how challenges will be shaped in the

future, we can be certain of our responsibilities as Members  of

this House as the same qualities and attributes are required  of

us.   Our  responsibility  is to guard against  complacency,  to

embrace  a  willingness  and  the  moral  courage  to  make  the

necessary  changes  and,  most  importantly,  to  preserve   the

integrity of this House in order to maintain at least  the  same

level  of  confidence.   Only  then  can  we  move  ahead   with

conviction and commitment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>



Sir, whilst I may be short on experience in this

House, I intend to be long on my sense of duty and

responsibility to the people of Singapore.  On that wish, Sir, I

support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for  allowing me to join in the debate. It is indeed interesting

to  speak after the younger speakers because they could urge  me

on and, at the same time, we could provide an anchor for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as SM Lee was speaking, my mind went back when I was a

secondary  school  student in the 50s.   I  did  not  know  what

democracy  was  then.  All I knew was the common rhetorics  that

have  been  said by some of these Opposition Members,  rhetorics

about  good  life, democracy and various other things.   What  I

remember was that I was looking forward for the supply of  piped

water and electricity to my village and proper shelter.  But  it

did  not come as there was an inefficient and corrupt government

under Lim Yew Hock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our villagers voted for change in 1959 and supported the

PAP  government.  They hoped for better social  conditions.   In

the  late  60s,  people in my village saw the arrival  of  piped

water  and  electricity  and  some improvements  in  the  social

conditions of the village. That was Nee Soon where I lived as  a

young secondary school student.  The village comprised a lot  of

corrupt  officials, corrupt middle community  leaders  and  they

supported all the corrupt practices of the government then.   It

was a change for me and my villagers after 1959.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that people in my village were very discerning.

They  were  very  sharp  and  could see  what  good  and  honest

government  was  then, and they attributed the improvements  and

the change to honest government and capable leadership.  I could

vividly  remember this as a young person then,  because  all  of

them were looking for better life, for change, and I recall many

of them saying that we could not just go on with democracy on an

empty  stomach.   All  the  sayings  under  the  Lim  Yew   Hock

Government did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>



produce any results. We hoped that the PAP

government would bring progress and good life for all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the capable leadership of SM Lee, then the PM, the

village  transformed.   People can see through  if  we  have  an

honest  government and they have voted election  after  election

for  an  honest  government and capable  leaders.   Sir,  honest

government and capable leadership is a good premium which we now

also  enjoy  the  leadership of PM Goh. So I  hope  Singaporeans

would  be  mindful  to  vote honest and  effective  people  into

government  in  the  future  so that  the  social  premium  will

continue  to  pay dividends to enhance the quality  of  life  of

Singaporeans further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one major challenge we are likely to face in future is

the  task of tackling the dangers of social divide between those

who have and those who have a little.  It is important for us to

encourage those who are able, to assist those who are less able.

The   able  cannot  isolate  themselves  and  have  a  parochial

interest, for if they do, they will not enhance social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that we would be able to nurture many good

people  and attract them into Parliament and the various  social

institutions  to  carry out the very good work of  our  founding

fathers, including mothers, who have contributed to the  healthy

development of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that call, I support the motion of PM Goh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I clarify with the Member who has just

spoken?   He  mentioned about the rhetoric calls  for  democracy

made in the 50s.  Does he realise who were making the calls  for

democracy  and  does  he  say they were purely  rhetoric  to  be

forgotten soon after the Party took power?

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> I do not want to engage in a debate with the

Member because he comes back like an old record all the time  on

these issues.  But they all sound the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>



same all the time, same music, same tone all the

time that I have heard.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Answer that question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, there is no need to engage in a debate with

him because he has been saying the same old thing since 1980.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Answer the question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for this opportunity to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to support the motion by the Prime Minister, Mr Goh

Chok  Tong.  Parliament had just sat for the very last  time  in

the  old  Chamber before it moved here to its new  home  a  very

short  while  ago.  It has much to be proud of during  its  stay

there  since  22nd April 1955.  Much has been achieved  in  that

august Chamber.  As a country and a people, we have much  to  be

grateful  for.  Its occupants have risen to the many  challenges

and their decisions had led to the impressive development of our

nation  and the good living that we, its citizens, enjoy  today.

We must continue with the good work here in this new Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our parliamentary system is based on the Westminster model

as  with other Commonwealth countries.  However, over time, each

Parliament  has  evolved  in its own  way  in  response  to  the

characteristics and needs of the country and its people.  We  do

likewise.   The major factors that dictate our actions  are  the

short  history  of our country, our small size  and  the  multi-racial,  multi-cultural  and  multi-religious  aspects  of   our

society.  These  are some constraints that we  have  to  manage.

Many  countries with such constraints have found  out  at  great

cost   how   potent  they  can  be  if  not  handled  carefully,

sensitively  and appropriately.  We have therefore evolved,  for

example,  the  Group Representation Constituency (GRC)  to  take

care  of  the  multi-racial nature of our society and  the  Non-Constituency MP and the Nominated MP to allow for a wider  range

of views to be reflected in its debates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, not everyone, especially

critics in the developed countries, understands, appreciates,

agrees or is convinced of what we have done or our objectives

for doing so.  They would prefer our institutions and systems to

be like theirs.  But we cannot do what they wish.  At the end of

the day, we must decide for ourselves and do things the way that

fits our circumstances and meets our needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things that the larger and older nations have, we may

eventually also have.  But we would have them in good  time  and

at  our pace if these are good for us and we, as a society,  are

ready  for  them. We must not allow ourselves to be  pressed  to

change,  to conform or to be misled into believing that we  must

have  them. As a society, we must decide for ourselves  what  is

good for us and to stand firm in the belief that we are the best

judges of this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of Parliament is to help manage the country for

the  good  of  its people.  Its Members represent the  citizens.

The  success  of the Members of Parliament is a collective  one,

reflected in the development and growth of the country, the well-being  of  its people and the respect that the people accord  to

Parliament   as   an   institution  and   the   MPs   as   their

representatives.  If this is the criterion, then  I  believe  we

have  done well.  I am therefore happy and proud that our people

understand and appreciate what Parliament has achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be in Parliament is a serious matter. The development

of  a  nation  and the well-being of the people  depend  on  its

deliberation and decisions.  Members of Parliament see it  as  a

forum  to  input  their  knowledge,  skills  and  experience  to

rationally and effectively debate the issues of the nation so as

to  arrive  at  decisions that are in the best interest  of  the

nation  and  the  people.   As  a  result,  the  proceedings  in

Parliament are carried out efficiently and effectively with  the

earnest  and  decorum that the august Chamber deserves  and  the

people expect of the representatives.  This must continue.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a young country. Singapore will face

yet many new and demanding challenges.  As Singapore evolves, so

has Parliament to do likewise.  We must seek not only to

maintain the progress and good work done and the high standards

set by those before us, but wherever and whenever possible, to

improve them further. We have to ensure that we remain relevant

and useful to the lives and needs of our nation and our people

that the decorum and respect of Parliament is maintained.  We

must bravely do what we believe is good for our country and our

people.  This is a demanding responsibility that we, as

parliamentarians, must persevere to fulfil, never let go off or

forget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I look around this

new  Chamber, it reminds me very much of the old. The layout  is

the  same, the furnishing is just as modest and even the  colour

of  the seat cover is the same dark maroon.  I only wish my seat

was as deep as the one in the old Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Chamber, however, is more spacious. It should serve

our  needs for at least another 100 years, if not forever.   The

seating layout can even be re-configured into a horseshoe  shape

or circular shape if some future Parliament chooses to do so. We

can now also vote electronically.  But just as a house is not  a

home, a new Parliament building alone does not guarantee a  good

Parliament. Whether this Parliament building becomes a respected

home for parliamentary democracy will depend on the present  and

future  Members of this House.  We must therefore continue  with

the  tradition  of  the  old Chamber,  upholding  standards  and

working for the benefit of the people whom we represent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members who have spoken in support of the motion. I

want to thank Senior Minister in particular.  He has recalled  a

bit  of  history  with  his speech and  added  meaning  to  this

nostalgic occasion. I do not intend to respond to every  comment

made by those who spoke.  It is not necessary and time does  not

permit me to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan said that there is an excess

demand for political participation and policy consultation in

Singapore.  I disagree.  Yes, many people want to have their

views and comments heard or seen in print but they also want to

have the safety of staying out of the political arena plus the

luxury of being able to carp or shoot from the hip without

attracting Government counterfire.  Meaningful political

participation must mean joining or supporting a political party,

advancing its cause and work, attending to constituents and if

invited, take part in elections, win and serve as an MP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many upcoming successful Singaporeans want to sacrifice

their   careers,  privacy  and  time  with  their  families   to

participate actively in politics?  I invite Dr Lee  to  find  me

five  suitable women candidates for the next general  elections.

She has two or three years to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam and Mr Jeyaretnam, as we must expect, will always

take the opposite view.  They must not blame the Government,  or

blame  us, for their own failure to increase the number of seats

for Opposition Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam has fought five general and three by-elections since 1972. He lost six times, won only twice. He

may  criticise us for impeding parliamentary democracy, but  the

truth  is  that the people have rejected him, the last  time  in

Cheng San.  He owes his presence here today to the pragmatism of

Singapore's parliamentary democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> I want to remind him that in 1984, he

vigorously  opposed the concept of Non-Constituency  MP  (NCMP).

Now, he must be grateful for such a scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for NMPs and NCMPs, we are all elected by the

people.   We  owe it to them to look after their interests.   We

best do this by leading and taking a principled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>



stand on issues, and not merely following popular

sentiments.  MPs will come under pressure from the public

whenever tough, painful policies and measures are introduced.

Our job is to lead, to explain, to persuade.  This is not to say

that we ignore public sentiments.  They are important.  We must

understand them, be sensitive and responsive.  Wherever

possible, we must consult people  -  people who can contribute

to the formulation of public policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultation does not mean taking a straw poll and

following  the  majority view.  Our response must  be  based  on

longer-term national interest, even if it means short-term pain,

and  on  larger  collective  interests  rather  than  individual

interests.   We  must explain our policies and  persuade  people

that  they  are  right.  This is the meaning of leadership,  and

this is the key role of MPs, as the people's representatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new building, our eyes must be cast on the future

rather than on the past.  What new challenges will confront  us?

Can  we  overcome  them?  Expectations of a  new  generation  of

Singaporeans   -   can  we meet them?  Will  future  generations

throw  up  strong and able leaders to protect, defend  and  lead

Singapore to more good years?  This and future Parliaments  will

have to find the answers to these questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we continue to increase the quality of representation in

this  House,  we  will maximise our chances of perpetuating  the

virtuous  cycle  we  have created, good  MPs,  strong  and  good

Government, political stability, sustained economic growth, good

living  environment  and  comfortable  homes,  a  cohesive   and

supportive people, committed leaders, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has played a key role in the development of

Singapore.  In time to come, this new Parliament House will have

its own history to tell and its own memories to recall.  May the

spirit   of   Singapore's  parliamentary  democracy   live   on.

[Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Prime Minister, by way of

clarification?  He has,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>



speaking for the first time in this new House, again

mentioned that Singaporeans wanting to take part to join

political parties.  May I ask him now, as Prime Minister,

whether he will give an assurance from this House that

henceforth, persecution of people who take part in politics will

stop?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is any

prosecution  in court, I think the candidates or the  opposition

MPs  deserve it.  Mr Chiam has not been prosecuted.  Mr Low Thia

Khiang has not been prosecuted.  And so long as they stay within

the law, they are free to stand for elections, and to make their

points of view known to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Vasoo has said, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think we

should  engage in a debate with the Non-Constituency MP on  this

occasion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask him, by way of clarification, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, I think you are using this right

to  make clarification by engaging in a constant debate.   If  I

allow you to continue, it seems it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>



never end.  Again, I have to ask you that if you

have anything else to say, to save it for another occasion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will table another motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, at its last meeting before it moves

to  its  new Chamber across the yard, (1) notes the progress  in

establishing  the  system of parliamentary democracy  since  its

early beginnings in this chamber on 22nd April 1955; (2) records

its  appreciation for the contributions made by past members  in

establishing the confidence the electorate has in its  integrity

and  the openness of its proceedings; and (3) urges present  and

future  Members  to  build  on  the  accomplishments  of   their

predecessors.

<div align="center"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>TEMPORARY OCCUPATION LICENCE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc Prof Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Assoc Prof Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Law

whether the piece of disused land next to Block 173, Hougang Ave

1,  will  be given a Temporary Occupation Licence at  a  nominal

rate to the Aljunied Constituency Sports Club.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacant State lands not required for immediate development

are  let  out  for interim uses on either Tenancy  Agreement  or

Temporary  Occupation  Licence  (TOL)  through  public   tender.

However,  direct allocation of State Land for use  by  voluntary

welfare  and  community organisations may be allowed  if  it  is

supported and rental/fees are funded by the relevant Ministries.

Government's policy is to charge market rates for use  of  State

land/buildings by all users to reflect the true  cost  of  their

operations. If there are grounds for subsidising the  operations

of  an organisation, the relevant Ministry should consider doing

so. The subsidy should not be in the form of nominal TOL fee for

use of State land/buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piece of vacant land in question is managed by the

Housing  and  Development Board (HDB) as agent of  Land  Office.

Land  Office is prepared to consider interim use by the Aljunied

Constituency Sports Club on TOL pending the development  of  the

site.  However, the Club has to pay market rate for the  use  of

the  land.  If  subsidy  is required, the Club  should  approach

Singapore   Sports   Council  or  the  Ministry   of   Community

Development for a grant to pay the market rate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Information and

the Arts if he will consider allocating a building for an Indian

Heritage Centre in Little India if the Indian community wants to

set up such a Centre.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government supports the various communities' efforts to

establish their own heritage centres and the promotion of  their

culture,  history, traditions and values. In 1992 the Government

agreed  to  provide premises to the Chinese, Malay,  Indian  and

Eurasian  communities  for use as heritage  centres  at  nominal

rental.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese Heritage Centre was set up by the Singapore

Federation  of  Chinese Clan Associations at the  former  Nantah

Administration  Block. Preparatory work for the  Malay  Heritage

Centre at Kampong Glam is now in progress. The National Heritage

Board  is  similarly prepared to assist the Indian community  in

its  efforts to set up an Indian Heritage Centre in Little India

or other suitable location.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Sports Council has inspected the site

suggested by Assoc Prof Toh See Kiat and found that it  requires

about $120,000 to $150,000 to level and returf the ground. As it

is  close to the road, a high fence will need to be installed to

contain  stray balls. Aljunied CSC can work with SSC to approach

Land Office to request the use of the field.
