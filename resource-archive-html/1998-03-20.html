<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head L -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [19th March, 1998],

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100. - [Mr Loh Meng See].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, at the end of the debate

yesterday, we heard Mr Lim Swee Say eloquently giving his story



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>



of how schools have, because of the ranking system, given up the

idea  of creative teaching, so that they can attain good  grades

for  the  students and thus get a higher ranking.  We  have  had

complaints about ranking.  The system is too strung up,  and  it

causes too much stress on our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, at the Committee of Supply debate, I remember

Mrs  Lim  Hwee Hua raised this point, and asked the Ministry  of

Education  to  reconsider  its  emphasis  on  grades.   And  she

referred to the MSG factor which, in the eyes of the Ministry of

Education, refers to mean subject grade, but MSG, Mrs Lim  said,

is  not good for our health and we should remove it.  I am  glad

to  say  that  MSG  was indeed removed.  But  I  would  like  to

continue  this call for the Ministry of Education to  take  away

this over emphasis on grades in the evaluation of a school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have talked to principals who have, perhaps

wishfully, perhaps regretfully, said that even though they  have

given  very high value added to the students, if only they could

get  better students to start off with, then they could get even

higher  ranking.  I think it is important for us  to  know  that

ranking  is good if done properly.  It is good because it  keeps

schools  on  their  toes.   It  helps  them  to  evaluate  their

programmes so that at the end of the day, they know what is weak

and  what  is  strong, and so they can improve  themselves.   Of

course,  it  is  good  for parents to know  what  are  the  good

schools.  They can choose schools in an informed manner, so that

the  talents, skills and inclinations of their children  can  be

matched better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Ministry of Education to think of

fine   tuning   the  ranking  system.   For  example,  we  could

emphasise  on  value added.  I know that after the Committee  of

Supply debate last year, the Ministry of Education has begun  to

look  at  other factors like value added in a more focused  way.

But  I  would  say  that, currently, there  is  still  too  much

weightage  given to academic grades per se.  I  would  urge  the

Ministry,  for example, to look at giving value added  the  same

weightage as academic grades.   Because at the end of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>



the day if I send my child to school, I want to know what she is

capable  of, and the school will make her an even better person.

So value added, 30% perhaps, and academic grades, 30%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also look at other factors like the school has a

good  community service programme.  The ECA programme  is  good.

It  builds  compassion in the students.  It  builds  leadership.

These  are  all the other outcomes of education and,  therefore,

that is 10%.  As Mr Chiam said yesterday, the playing fields are

important.  The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields

of  Eton.   So playing fields, sports, physical programmes,  are

important  too.   We  could give some  weightage  to  that  too,

perhaps another 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for schools to have a record of

character building, teaching values in their progammes  and  the

success  must  be evident.  And if it is evident, I  think  they

should  deserve 5% for that.  Facilities of the school  will  be

important and that, however, should not be over emphasised.   We

can  give it another 5%.  I think there can be a catch-all  kind

of  category to which we give a 10% weightage, and this category

could  involve  peer ranking of the school by the  teachers  and

students from other schools.  We look at how the school develops

its teachers, the quality of its teachers, the school's "spirit"

and  perhaps  how hard they work to make sure that the  students

get an all-round education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Ministry to think along these lines.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on planning and

design of schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbourhood schools provide much convenience to pupils

and  parents.  They help parents to save on transport costs, and

facilitate  the  ferrying  of  children  to  and  from  schools,

especially  for  parents who have more than one child  attending

school.   Thus, I would like to urge the Ministry to place  more

emphasis  to  ensure that there are adequate  school  places  in

neighbourhood schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make the following suggestions for the

Minister to consider:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Register all Primary One pupils two or three years

before  they  start school.  This will enable  the  Ministry  to

collect  exact  demand data for the planning of  schools.   With

this  information,  the  Ministry can  proceed  to  develop  new

schools  immediately or refurbish existing schools to  cater  to

the  demand.   According to the PWD contract, it is possible  to

build a school within 18 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Revise the 1 km policy for neighbourhood schools.

Children staying 1 km must be given higher priority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide extra capacities when designing primary

schools.   At present, many principals are conducting tutorials,

remedial  and  ECA classes during school hours,  thus  utilising

many classrooms.  This has made it difficult for schools to have

the  flexibility  to increase its enrolment  to  cater  for  the

increased demand.  We should build schools with more classrooms,

so as to cope with the fluctuating demand yearly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Kentucky Department of Education has introduced

the  Consolidated Planning Process, a joint effort  between  the

Department  of  Education,  local school  council  and  district

stakeholders.  In this process, school councils are  responsible

in   providing  an  environment  in  their  schools  to  enhance

students'  achievement.  I would urge the Education Ministry  to

involve school staff, School Advisory Committee members, parents

and community leaders in the planning of schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the design of schools, PWD should adopt a

different  approach  in  producing a  conducive  environment  in

schools  to  facilitate  innovative and creative  learning.   In

addition,  schools should also be designed to accommodate  adult

evening classes, public lectures, civil and community functions,

and  cultural activities to serve the community.  In  this  way,

schools can be better utilised for the benefit of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To save resources, we should build primary and secondary

schools at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>



same site.  This would facilitate the sharing of facilities such

as  school fields, sports facilities, canteen and civil  defence

shelter.   A  joint  primary and secondary school  can  then  be

managed  by  one principal for better coordination  and  control

purposes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I am going to talk

about discipline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, we are seeing a spate of youth violence and

juvenile delinquencies in public places.  There is also a rising

trend  of  teenage girls getting into trouble with  the  law.  I

wonder whether the situation is as serious in our schools.  I am

sure  the  Education  Ministry is  equally  concerned  with  the

behaviour of students, both inside and outside school.  We  have

to  nip  the problem of young offenders in the bud.  This  would

require  the  support  and  cooperation  of  parents,  teachers,

community  leaders,  neighbours  and  friends  to  reverse  this

unhealthy trend before it gets worse and out of control.  We are

already  facing  problems  with  illegal  immigrants,   and   we

certainly  do not wish to aggravate the situation with  our  own

citizens, especially from our youths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Italian educator and a pioneer in early childhood

education, Maria Montessori, believed that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The first idea that the child must acquire, in order to be

actively disciplined is that of the difference between good  and

evil, and the task of the educator lies in seeing that the child

does not confound good with immobility, and evil with activity.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, early childhood education is very important. I am not

sure that we should be satisfied with the present state of early

childhood  education in Singapore.  I wish to urge the  Ministry

to  take  concrete  steps  to  improve  the  standard  of  early

childhood education.  We need better trained and better  quality

care-givers in our nursery schools, kindergartens and child care

centres.  The Government can be more generous by setting aside a

portion  of  the  foreign maid levy to support  early  childhood

education for our toddlers and young children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should spare no efforts in whatever ways possible to

bring  up  healthy  children  of  good  character.   This  would

minimise the incidence of our young getting into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>



disciplinary  problems in schools and breaking the  law.   Every

child  who goes astray and gets into trouble with the law  is  a

loss to the family and society.  This, in Singapore, we can  ill

afford.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a characteristic of a good school is one that enforces

strict  discipline  on  its pupils.   Parents  share  this  view

because they believe that a high standard of discipline is  good

for  their  children.   It  is true that  "for  the  moment  all

discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; later  it  yields

the  peaceful  fruit  of righteousness to those  who  have  been

trained by it."  But discipline can only come when students have

respect  for  their  teachers and  fear  the  authority  of  the

teachers.   Here,  I  would  urge all  parents  to  support  the

teachers in their work, especially when the child   deserves  to

be disciplined.  All our teachers are well-trained professionals

who are able to deal with their pupils appropriately.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to commend the Ministry for increasing the number of

coordinators  for the pastoral care and guidance programme  from

476  in FY97 to 1,014 in FY98.  This shows that the Ministry  is

aware of the problems faced by our students and the need to help

them overcome their difficulties in school work and relationship

with others.  The pastoral care and counselling services offered

in  our  schools  will go a long way to help  students  maintain

their  self-esteem and motivate them to strive to achieve  their

fullest potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This pastoral care and guidance programme can also tie in

with  the after school care programme to facilitate the  success

of  the single session schools.  The schools can tap the alumni,

parents and even get grandparents as "student-minding" resources

and  facilitators in the after school care programme.   This  is

also  an area where the Community Development Councils can  play

an active role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Straits Times recently reported a survey finding

that  less  than  a quarter of our youths would  turn  to  their

parents for advice.  They would rather confide in their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>



friends  and  get advice from their buddies.  Our  schools  must

reinforce the importance of parents as partners in the education

of  their children.  The schools now arrange for the parents  to

meet  with  the teachers regularly to obtain feedback  on  their

children's  performance and behaviour in school.  It would  help

if  seminars are organised for parents to meet among  themselves

to  share  experience and to learn from one  another  the  time-tested  parenting methods.  I think Mr Iswaran  spoke  about  it

yesterday.    The  school  can  facilitate  better  parent-child

relationship  and  encouraging them to spend  as  much  time  as

possible  together.  It is when the family develops  the  strong

bonds  that  there is less likelihood for children to misconduct

themselves  inside and outside school.  We can easily  take  the

attitude  that  family relationship is outside  the  purview  of

teachers  and the ministry but, unfortunately, we cannot  easily

segregate one part from the other.  Parents are indeed  partners

in  the education of their children.  I hope more can be done in

school to foster closer family ties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over

the  past  few  years, I have been talking about  discipline  in

schools and on juvenile delinquency.  Today, I am going to speak

again on the same topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reported that the problems of poor discipline and

juvenile  delinquency  in  schools are  getting  more  and  more

serious  nowadays.  There were a number of newspaper reports  on

youngsters  committing  crimes  ranging  from  petty  theft   to

fighting, robbery, and even drug addiction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the conversations I had with my residents, I

discovered that in the neighbourhood schools, these problems are

more serious, for example, smoking, fighting and even collecting

protection money, etc.  They use both inducement and threats  to

force their fellow students into joining their secret society. I

have  even  heard that some 14-15 year old students were  coaxed

into working as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>



bar-waitresses  to  earn money so that they  would  buy  branded

dresses, cosmetics and even drugs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In school, these students show no respect at all to their

teachers.  They have even scratched and damaged the car of their

teachers.   I  sincerely  hope  that  these  incidents  are  the

exceptions  rather than the norm. Because if this  gets  out  of

hand  and juvenile delinquency in schools becomes a very serious

problem,  we  have  to  ask ourselves what  kind  of  a  society

Singapore has become and what our schools are becoming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether the Ministry of Education has

kept records of such incidents and whether such records could be

publicised so that we know how serious these problems are in the

schools.   I  would like to know what solutions the Ministry  of

Education has to resolve these problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Loh Meng See also mentioned that parents form

a  very  important link in our whole education system.  I  fully

agree  with that.  But times are different now because  nowadays

most  parents  are working.  For those who are well-to-do,  they

have  maids  at home to help look after the children.   But  the

basic foundation of the family would be affected resulting in  a

lack  of  discipline  in the families.   No  doubt  the  parents

themselves  have to bear certain responsibilities  in  educating

their  children, but the schools should also be involved in  the

discipline of the students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is very regrettable. Some 20-30 years

ago,  when  we  were schooling, we were very respectful  of  our

teachers  and  we remember them all our lives.  I  can  remember

that  in  the past when the naughty students saw their  teachers

they would try to hide themselves.  But now, even when they have

done  something wrong or have misbehaved, they do not  care  two

hoots  about it, and they do not see the need to hide from their

teachers.  So I feel that the Ministry of Education should  look

into this matter - how to raise the status of the teachers, give

them  more authority so that they can play a very important part

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>



disciplining the students.  If the students show no respect  for

their teachers, then even with all the good plans going all  the

way  to  the  next century, which the Minister had  informed  us

yesterday, will be meaningless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is: "Has the discipline in our schools

really  gone to the point of disaster?"  If so, then  we  should

form a multi-departmental committee to look into this matter and

to resolve this problem of juvenile delinquency.  I am sure that

over the past few days the Minister for Education had heard  the

views  of  many of our Members here.  I hope that he would  take

this  opportunity today to enlighten us on the problems of  poor

discipline in schools.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to

reinforce  what  Mr  Loh Meng See has highlighted.   As  he  has

mentioned,  recent statistics continue to point  to  an  adverse

trend  in  the  making  - that of the rise in  participation  of

females   in  juvenile  related  crimes.   Teenage   girls   now

reportedly  account  for more than 10% of youths  jailed,  about

double  the  5% rate in 1989.  There is also anecdotal  evidence

that  a  number  seems to be running away from their  homes  and

frequently  end up involving themselves in gang-fights  or  drug

abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a disturbing trend that requires immediate

attention.   Whilst  remedial  action  is  obviously  important,

preventive  measures would be far better.  At a forum  organised

by  the  PAP  Women's  Wing,  participants  made  the  following

suggestions,  which I would like to forward for  the  Minister's

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that schools complement parental efforts by

providing  the necessary discipline, especially with  regard  to

those  who  have  wilfully misbehaved.  Secondly,  that  schools

provide  more pastoral care, especially for girls  who  find  it

difficult to cope with either the school or home environment  or

relationships.   Counselling by teachers  or  professionals  can

help  prevent  problems from emerging if troubled  students  can

have someone outside the home to talk to as well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the school can indeed be an extremely effective medium

for identifying potential delinquency and, more importantly, for

reducing the incidence of such delinquency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

glad  to  know  that the Public Service Commission is  providing

equal  opportunities  for holders of overseas  Chinese  language

scholarship  to  upgrade themselves.   At  the  same  time,  any

scholarship holder who wishes to pursue further studies  leading

to  a Masters degree would be allowed to defer service of his or

her  bond.   This  is indeed encouraging, particularly  for  the

Chinese scholars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently mother tongue education has once again become a

hot  talking  point among those who are concerned  with  Chinese

Mandarin.   There are many insiders speaking with authority,  as

well as many laymen, posing as experts.  The main emphasis is on

how   to   augment  the  curriculum  of  today's  mother  tongue

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Singaporeans who know Chinese are of the view

that, at the moment, the use of Chinese Mandarin is getting more

and  more  popular in Singapore.  Almost all Chinese  can  speak

Mandarin, especially the younger generation of Singaporeans  who

not  only  speak  Mandarin but read and write Chinese  as  well.

This is the result of our Government's past efforts in promoting

mother  tongue  education and the Speak  Mandarin  Campaign  has

attained its social objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with the economic reform and open door policy of

China,  learning  mother tongue Chinese will not  only  help  to

maintain the traditional Chinese culture and enhance our  social

cohesion  but will also be of great economic benefit.  As  such,

even those who are not proficient in Chinese are beginning to be

concerned with their children's standard of Chinese.  This is  a

good sign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Education recruited a batch of

students  who  obtained only "B3" grade in Chinese  at  the  "O"

level  examination for training to become primary school Chinese

language



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>



teachers.   These parents who are not too proficient in  Chinese

are  worried that the progress and standard of their  children's

learning  of the mother tongue may be affected if these students

with  "B3"  grade  in  Chinese were to become  their  children's

Chinese language teachers after their training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my children scored "As" in their "O" level for both

Chinese and English, but look at the notes they wrote to  me  in

Chinese.   They are just unreadable rubbish.  This  is  a  fact.

This  shows the difference between the standards of Chinese  and

English  languages in the "O" level examinations.   In  view  of

that, may I suggest to the Ministry of Education that this batch

of  "B3"  grade Chinese trainee teachers be sent to the relevant

colleges  in  China  and Taiwan for training  to  improve  their

ability to teach the Chinese language.  I believe this will help

to  alleviate the worries of some of these parents.  I hope  the

Ministry of Education will consider this suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Toh See Kiat suggested that the Singapore

Management University should relax the requirement of Chinese in

their  admission  criteria.  On the contrary, I  hope  that  the

Singapore   Management   University   will   consider   allowing

Singaporeans who are proficient in Chinese to do their  business

administration   courses in Chinese so as to contribute  to  the

economic development in the Asia-Pacific region.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support the

Government's policy in promoting the teaching of mother  tongue.

Our  bilingual policy has done well and the fact  that  we  have

evolved  a  language  policy peacefully speaks  volumes  of  the

Government's policy because in many parts of the world, Sir, the

language issue is fraught with danger and often results in civil

conflict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while English will remain the language of Government

and  business,  the  learning of mother tongue  will  allow  our

children to preserve our cultural heritage and our roots.  It is

very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>



important.  No matter how proficient we are in English, Sir,  in

order  to  understand  our cultural background,  whether  it  is

Malay,  Indian or Chinese, some knowledge of the language  is  a

prerequisite.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the values that these children will learn will enable

them  to meet the onslaught of Western influence.  And if I  may

digress, my colleagues, Mr Loh, Mrs Lim, Mr Choo and others have

spoken  earlier  of the diminishing regard and respect  for  the

teachers.   I wonder if it has to do with the Western  influence

on  our television.  When we were young, we respected a teacher,

whether he was in the school or outside the school, he was still

a  Cikgu.  Probably the teachers are too over-friendly.  In this

modern  age,  many of them are on "Hi-hi" basis.  In  our  time,

whether he was in the school or outside the school, we respected

him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been involved in the move to get some Indian

languages  recognised.  When I first wrote to the  Minister  for

Education,  then  Dr  Tony Tan, in 1996,  for  Hindi  and  other

languages  to  be  taught, I never thought that  the  Government

would  so  easily  agree  to this, but  this  was  a  long  gone

struggle.   But  thanks  to the generosity  of  the  Government,

today, besides Tamil, which is one of the official languages  of

Singapore, Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi are being taught by

the community themselves.  The Minister would be pleased to know

that  one  of the reasons many expatriate parents are  attracted

here is that these languages can be learned.  And I do not think

any  other  part  of  the  world outside Singapore  offers  such

facilities.   I speak for the community that this has  been  the

most generous help the Government has given for these sub-ethnic

groups to preserve their cultural roots.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area of concern is the standard of Tamil in

schools.  In the past, whenever we in SINDA visited a school,  a

STEP  centre  or  met with parents, one of the areas  which  was

often  raised was the lack of Tamil teaching in certain schools,

but I do not think this is an issue now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>



because  many schools, in fairness to the Ministry, are offering

it.  But one area which is of concern to the Indian community is

the  very  high  standard of Tamil.  I am not suggesting  for  a

moment that we should lower the grade but I think the choice  of

words  and  vocabulary should be done in such  a  way  that  the

students will find it enjoyable and attractive.  I am told of  a

Primary One kid, whose mother did Tamil in school, but she found

it difficult teaching her son.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Ministry to examine this problem. And I

would  urge  the  Tamil  teachers, in  particular,  to  help  in

creating  an  atmosphere  where  the  students  will   find   it

enjoyable.   I am very pleased to read today's Life  section  of

the  Straits  Times that Tamil Murasu has started a section  for

the   students.   I  think  the  Tamil  Section  of  the   Radio

Corporation of Singapore is also helping.  It is very important,

Sir,  in  learning the simple words of Tamil.  And I am reminded

of the Senior Minister of State, Encik Sidek Saniff's remarks in

this House many years ago about Lord Denning who wrote in simple

English.   Our  Tamil teachers and Tamil scholars  may  want  to

emulate this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would end by urging the Ministry also to examine

another policy.  Our bright students - I am not referring to the

gifted,  but  other students - 10% of the core who are  good  in

language  should do an optional language, ie, a third  language,

which could be any of the languages.  I would urge them to  take

Malay as an additional language, if possible, because we in this

part of the world need to have some knowledge of Malay.  And  if

you  know Malay, you can learn Bahasa Indonesia easily.  At  the

moment,  one  Asian language which is popular  is  Japanese.   I

think Japanese is important to us and we should also, if we want

to  have our windows open to the world, learn other languages  - Thai,  Nepalese,  and what have you.  And I  am  not  suggesting

there  should  be  a concerted and forced effort,  but  children

should be encouraged, especially those who have got a flair  for

languages.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the mother tongue

policy was implemented



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>



for  a  very specific social objective, and that is,  to  ensure

that our  children retain the language of our forefathers and we

continue  to  transmit  our  traditional  culture  to  the  next

generation.   However, for those children  from  families  whose

working  language is not the mother tongue, they  have  to  work

extra hard just to make the grade.  I am envious of Mr Peh  Chin

Hua  in  the sense that his son is effectively bilingual at  the

"A" grade level.  I have also three school-going children and  I

must  report  that they have to struggle very hard to  make  the

grade.   But, nonetheless, I think the mother tongue  policy  is

appropriate, it is necessary in our social context and I support

the policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I would like to address the mother tongue policy

and  its  consequential policy in the context of our  effort  to

attract  foreign talents.  Not all foreign talents that we  want

to  attract are single, or married, without children.  Would the

second  language requirement which sprang from the mother tongue

policy  become a hindrance if it is enforced strictly  on  these

children  of  foreign  talents?  Here I am  referring  to  those

foreign  professionals whose mother tongue is basically English.

And  that could be of any ethnic origin and they could come from

any part of the world, including UK and United States.  In fact,

it  is not uncommon today to find Caucasians who have become PRs

or even citizens of Singapore.  So when the mother tongue policy

is  applied to them and their children, their children  studying

in  our school system will be required to study another language

which  is  not their mother tongue.  In this respect, some  take

German  or French and others take Malay.  They probably  do  not

have  the  family environment to support learning and using  the

languages.   To  this group of children, all those  languages  I

have  mentioned are actually all foreign languages.   So  it  is

just  as  difficult  for them, if not more difficult,  to  learn

these  foreign  languages versus our  own  children  or  my  own

children learning the mother tongue.  This is especially  so  if

the  child  is already at the secondary level when  the  parents

come to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Sir, and to inject some human

interest  in  this  debate, I would like to  give  a  real  life

example.  A British couple, Mr and Mrs Davies, came to my  meet-the-people   session  about  three  weeks  ago   regarding   the

tremendous difficulties their son, who is enrolled in our school

system, is encountering in learning French.  The husband who was

engaged as a English Language consultant came to Singapore  with

the  family  several  years ago.  At that time,  their  son  was

already  a teenager.  The wife, Sheila Ruth Davies, was born  in

Singapore when her father was serving in the British Army during

the  Second World War.  Interestingly enough, this qualified her

to claim Singapore citizenship which she subsequently did.  As a

result, the husband and the son are now both Singapore PRs.  And

they  later  have  two  daughters  born  in  Singapore  and  are

Singapore  citizens.   This is a case of  foreign  professionals

coming to work in Singapore, fell in love with the country,  and

decided  to stay.  They put their son through our school  system

which  by the way they praised highly, compared to their schools

in  UK.   The son did very well in most subjects, except French,

which  is the second language required and which he only started

learning  for  the first time when he joined our school  system.

By  then he was already in the secondary school years.   So  the

son failed repeatedly, despite his best effort.  So much so that

he  was  asked  to  leave the Jurong Institute before  he  could

complete his Pre-U education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my appeal, I am happy to report that the MOE is very

flexible.   It  is  now  allowing  him  to  complete  the  Pre-U

education  but  MOE is still insisting that  he  must  take  his

French at the coming "0" level examination and must pass with at

least  a  D7 in order to fulfil the second language requirement.

I believe, Sir, it would not be easy for this young man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having learned their lessons, the Davies are selecting

Malay as the second language for their two younger daughters.  I

understand they are doing very well in that language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to review whether the mother

tongue  language  for children of foreign talents  that  we  are

trying to attract is necessary.  To me, it seems unnecessary  to

be  too  strict  in imposing the second language requirement  on

such  families.  Such families are not the target of our  mother

tongue policy and I believe we should be more flexible in  those

cases.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua:</b> Sir, please let me declare my interest as

a publisher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, the Ministry of Education has decided

that  with  effect from this year the textbook  market  will  be

further open to private publishers.  I welcome the move.   As  a

matter  of  fact,  over the past 10 to 20  years,  I  have  been

wondering  why the Ministry of Education decided to set  up  the

CDIS.   What  was  the  objective of  CDIS  and   what  was  the

background leading to its establishment?  I have always  thought

that  the  setting  up of CDIS  was against the  philosophy  and

policy of the PAP.  It was some kind of a welfare scheme.   With

CDIS   dominating   the   market  for   school   textbooks   and

supplementary  reading materials under the very  lowest  prices,

the  private  publishers cannot gain access  to  this  lucrative

market.   Many  of  them  found  it  difficult  to  survive   in

Singapore.  Many foreign publishers lost a lot of money,  closed

shop, packed up and returned to UK or the USA.  Meanwhile, there

were  a  lot  of  complaints against the  quality  of  textbooks

published by  CDIS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Ministry of Education is beginning to farm out the

publication  work to private sector publishers.   I  think  this

will  give more publishers to display their talent and expertise

and  it  will enhance the inspirational values of the books  and

make  them  more interesting.  This shows that the  Ministry  of

Education wants to introduce the competition mechanism to remedy

the  shortcomings  of CDIS so as to give our  schools  a  larger

variety  of choices of high quality textbooks, and this will  in

turn benefit the students. .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also happy to note that the Ministry of Education has

assured us that there will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>



be  a  very good authentication procedure to monitor the quality

and price of textbooks.  What I am worried about is that if they

want   to  produce  good  textbooks,  do  they  understand  that

compiling them is a very time-consuming process?  From  my  past

experience,  the senior officials in the Ministry  of  Education

have very often overlooked the actual amount of time needed from

writing to delivery of a set of textbooks.    In the past,  CDIS

had  3  to  4  years  to complete the production  of  a  set  of

textbooks.   On  the  other  hand, the private  publishers  were

given only 6 to 9 months to do the job.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, it takes between 12 and 16 months to write and

edit a set of textbooks, and another 4 to 6 months to print  and

produce  them.  The Ministry  of Education would  take  2  to  3

months  to examine and approve them.  Then, the publishers  will

have to promote and introduce the textbooks to the schools.  The

schools will select the set they prefer.  This will take another

2 to 3 months.  Finally, the publishers will print the textbooks

and  supply  them  to  the schools, hopefully  before  the  term

starts.   This again will take another 2 months.   All  in  all,

some  22  to  30  months are needed.   Therefore,  whenever  the

Ministry  of  Education announces the new curricula,  publishers

should  be  given  ample time to go through the  syllabuses  and

curricula and  prepare the new sets of  textbooks accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Education can pay attention to the

time  factor  and give the publishers more time to  prepare,  to

ensure  that  we  can  meet  the  quality  requirements  of  our

textbooks.    Otherwise,   the  open   door   policy   for   the

participation  of  private publishers will also  be  a  case  of

"still  born", that is, something similar to the CDIS   kind  of

situation,  where  creativity   is  lacking  in  the   textbooks

produced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying all these things from my own experience because

I  have  spent about 20 to 30 years in this business and I  know

that  to ensure the availability of good and creative textbooks,

we  must  realise  that  we are not like  the  other  developing

countries.  In China, children by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>



millions  are fighting for places in the schools.   So  long  as

they can find places in the school and there is a textbook, they

are  more  than happy.  One set of textbooks is good enough  for

everyone.   Everyone will be happy.  We are a developed country.

We  are looking at creativity and thinking schools.  So we  must

have  creative  materials.   We must  have  a  variety  of  good

textbooks  available  for our schools to  select.   I  hope  the

Ministry of Education can consider my proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, like Mr Peh Chin Hua, I applaud the

recent  move  by  the Ministry to liberalise the  publishing  of

school  textbooks.  This should allow yet more  innovation  into

the education process and enrich learning in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, two key issues for which I would like

the  Minister to consider.  The first is whether textbooks would

become  more  costly  as a result of the move,  and  the  second

pertains to quality control of supplementary materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern over possible upward pressure on the cost

of  textbooks stems from two observations.  Firstly, the  burden

of developing and publishing textbooks hitherto is shouldered by

the  Ministry, providing therefore an indirect subsidy.  Private

sector  publishers will naturally find it difficult not to  pass

on  the associated developmental cost.  Secondly, there is every

possibility  that niche groups of textbooks may  emerge  in  due

course.  These, however, given the size of our market, will  not

be able to enjoy the economies of scale necessary to check price

pressures.   How would the Minister ensure that textbooks  would

not become too costly for the school-going population?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the second issue, we are aware of a

continuous proliferation of supplementary materials  in  use  by

schools.   With  the advent of yet more multi-media  educational

aids  for  schools,  will  the Minister  endeavour  to  exercise

similar quality control to ensure consistency?

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, with a rapidly

changing world, knowledge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>



has  become  the  buzzword  for education  and  business  alike.

Knowledge  is the asset that provides the competitive  advantage

for  any individual or corporation.  It is with this realisation

that we see the urgency in cramming knowledge into students  and

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is no doubt that Singaporean students have a

wide knowledge base.  Just look at the number of GCE `O' and `A'

level  subjects that they have to study and be examined in.   To

prepare students for the long gruelling process of achieving  an

education  based  on  a large number of subjects,  the  cramming

begins at an early age.  I am relieved to hear the Minister  say

that  there  has been a revamp of the curriculum  and  that  the

workload  of students is being reduced.  Up till now, Primary  1

pupils are taught a wide range of subjects.  This is being  done

while  they  learn to read, write and develop their arithmetical

sense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst being grounded on a foundation for learning, Primary

1  pupils have to cope with learning a wide variety of subjects.

Under  such circumstances, there are a number who will only  get

by   with  some  skills  in  reading  and  writing  and  without

developing   their   arithmetical  sense.   Such   pupils   will

eventually  find  themselves unable to cope  with  the  learning

process and eventually drop out of the school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know of a number of pupils who left the school

system after Primary 5 who cannot read.  There is a need  to  go

back  to fundamentals.  Primary 1 must be the place where pupils

are  given the foundation for learning.  It is too easy  to  say

that  many children already go to kindergarten where they  learn

to read.  Whilst children in kindergarten do learn their ABC and

some can read reasonably well, they do not have the maturity  to

master  such  skills.  Their vocabulary will remain limited  and

they  are  unable  to  express themselves.   Those  kindergarten

children  who  progress in reading and writing,  generally  have

strong home support and supplementary tutoring.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without proper development of the three `R's - reading,

writing  and  arithmetical sense - a pupil will face  an  uphill

task  in  learning other subjects.  It comes  a  time  when  the

subjects  are learned without understanding, merely by rote  and

with  the one aim of passing the examination with little  or  no

understanding.  There is a saying which is also a truism,  "When

we  are young, we learn to read.  When we are older, we read  to

learn."  The greatest skill to master in school must be that  of

reading, writing and arithmetics.  With the three `R's, one  can

engage in self-study in any subject.  When mastered at an  early

age,  the  rest  of  the school curriculum would  be  merely  an

extension  of  knowledge.  Add to this the  thinking  skill  and

creativity, learning becomes an experience to be enjoyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that Primary 1 pupils are made to master the

three  `R's.  The curriculum should be focused towards achieving

this objective.  With a proper foundation for learning, not only

will  the pupils do well in school, but they will be capable  of

keeping pace with the rapid changes around them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Sir, for giving me

this opportunity.  Sir, may I now be permitted to deal with  the

History  textbooks in Singapore.  It is important for youth  and

our  young  to  learn  about the process  of  how  we  became  a

Republic, how we have succeeded and what were the pitfalls.   We

could  draw  richly on our oral history and in  this  regard,  I

think  the  schools  should take advantage of numerous  projects

taken  by  the  Oral History Department.  Perhaps, the  Ministry

should  also consider the teaching of History in a more friendly

and  living  way.   I am pleased to say that sometimes,  when  I

visited  either  Chinatown or even Little  India,  I  see  young

students  visiting the temple or mosque, and see  how  sireh  is

being made or sold.  This is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also use television as a tool to teach History.

Many  students  may not know of the various transport  modes  we

had, the mosquito buses and various other things which are dying

off.   It  is very important for us to preserve these historical

roots.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many countries, it is compulsory for students to

learn  the culture of the country, the government, and a  little

bit  of history of the country.  Even in the university,  it  is

compulsory.   I  am not suggesting that History should  be  made

compulsory  but  I  hope that we should give some  weightage  to

modern  History.   I  am not talking of History  which  is  just

confined from 1959, the post-PAP era.  I am thinking of 1940  to

1955  which  was  a  crucial period, how we  lived  through  the

Japanese  Occupation, how we lived after the Japanese  war,  the

struggle and the chaos we were in.  It is very important for  us

to learn and know about this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to single out one personality who I think

deserves  greater study by our historians and I am referring  to

Mr David Marshall who was not only the first Chief Minister but,

in   his  political  lifetime,  he  carried  the  struggle   for

independence, and multi-lingualism was his idea.  He transformed

the  CPF  and gave it a new life.  He introduced legal  aid  and

various  things.   I  think Mr David Marshall  deserves  greater

study than that we have hitherto given to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was very pleased to learn this morning that my

charming  friend, Mdm Claire Chiang, had written a book together

with  another  writer,  Mr Chan Kwok Bun, called  Stepping  Out.

This deals with the business entrepreneurs in Singapore and I am

very  glad that TCS is making a series out of this.  I hope this

will  be the beginning, and TCS will take the trouble to go  and

make  a  study of other pioneers from various other communities,

as  I  said,  David  Marshall, and let the  students  know  that

without history, without the past heritage, we will be nowhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to probably consider forming

a  committee  to  study how history could be taught  in  a  more

living  and meaningful way and I am emphasising that it  is  not

the colonial history alone, it is history from 1940 to 1955, one

phase,  and  from 1955 to now.  And the students will  have  the

curiosity perhaps to go back and study on them.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my topic is on extra-curricular

activities.  As Singaporeans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>



become  more  affluent,  we  aspire  to  live  in  condominiums,

waterfront housing, such as Punggol 21 or landed properties with

swimming  pools.   But many may not be able to enjoy  waterfront

housing  or  their  water facilities if they or  their  children

cannot  swim.  In fact, some may even fear to let their children

play near the water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to encourage all Singaporeans, in particular

school  children, to learn swimming, life saving  and  first-aid

skills.   Let  me  highlight the importance for Singaporeans  to

learn  swimming.  According to the Straits Times' report on  6th

December 1997, 83 people drowned in Singapore last year,  52  at

sea,  10  in swimming pools, 8 in rivers and the rest in  canals

and  other places.  Out of the 83 drowned, some of them may  not

have  died if they can swim or understand water safety or people

around them know life saving skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a qualified life guard myself, it saddens me each

time  I  read  in  the  papers  of  drowning  cases,  especially

involving school children.  Over the last 20 years, I have saved

four persons.  Two of them would not have been alive today if  I

could  not  swim or did not know any life saving  skills.   This

clearly  shows  the  usefulness of learning  swimming  and  life

saving skills.  Learning swimming and life saving is not only to

keep  one  healthy.   But  it  is a  skill  which  will  make  a

difference  to  one's  life or other  people's  life.   As  life

savers,  we live by this motto: "Whosoever you see in  distress,

recognise in him a fellow man."  We are always on the alert  and

ready to save anyone who encounters difficulty in water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased to note that most schools have

incorporated swimming programmes for their Primary 4 and Primary

6  pupils.   However, pupils of other levels are not given  much

opportunity in schools to take up swimming lessons.  In fact,  a

survey  by  one school shows that 50% of Primary Three  students

have never been to a swimming pool.  There is an urgent need  to

implement a structured programme to ensure that all our students

achieve a certain level of proficiency in swimming, life  saving

and first-aid skills.  The Ministry should place more emphasis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>



on  these  ECAs  and  work  closely with  the  Singapore  Sports

Council  and swimming and life saving associations   to  further

encourage  such activities.  Swimming, life saving and first-aid

courses  should be made compulsory for all students, except  for

medical or religious reasons.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, I am going to speak on information

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is spending a total sum of $1,091 million

for  the IT Masterplan in Education.  For FY98, an estimated sum

of  $349 million has been provided as development expenditure on

the  provision of information technology resources  for  primary

schools,  secondary schools and junior colleges.  As  the  large

proportion  of the expenditure on IT is development  in  nature,

what  would the likely recurring expenditure be?  We  know  from

the experience of the financial services industry that IT incurs

very  high overhead cost if the operations were to be maintained

at  the full level of efficiency.   May I ask the Minister  what

would  the parents then be asked to pay for the high cost of  IT

applications in school?  Will it pose a burden to  them  if  the

school fees are to be increased, because of IT cost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Educational Technology Division has been tasked to

implement  MOE's Information Technology Masterplan  and  provide

direction on the use of education technology in schools.  May we

know  from  the  Minister how IT will change  the  teaching  and

learning  in the classrooms.  Will the classrooms of the  future

be  re-configured?   Maybe the Minister can shed some  light  on

this, though the Minister has touched briefly on it yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indicated that the Ministry will be developing less

educational  technology materials from 501 in  FY97  to  127  in

FY98.   I  would like to ask the Minister why is it so. Does  it

mean that there would be less development work done in-house and

more are being out-sourced to multimedia publishing houses?   Or

has the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>



already   developed  the  bulk  of  the  educational  technology

materials  and, therefore, there is less need for  developmental

work in the year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, also, the number of training hours provided has

increased  from  3,722  hours in FY97 to 4,782  hours  in  FY98.

This,  translated  into an 8-hour working day,  means  that  the

training hours provided has increased from 471  man-days to  597

man-days.   When this is compared to the number of  teachers  in

the education service, the number of training hours appears very

little.  Perhaps the Minister can clarify on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale in which we have invested in the use of IT in

education and the direction in which we are taking is pioneering

in  nature.  In fact, I am glad to read about the agreement that

the  Education  Ministry has with Microsoft  in  developing  the

educational software.  This is because few governments have done

this before.  The journey we have chosen is an exciting and even

a  precarious one.  Many organisations have, in the  past,  made

mistakes in the investment on computers and IT which had  turned

out  badly.  We have to tread on this carefully, and be prepared

for  some  mistakes along the way.  However, I am optimistic  in

where  we are heading.  Our children will benefit the most  when

our investment in IT bears fruit in later years.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I applaud the

Ministry  of Education for embarking on programmes in school  to

develop  thinking skills and promote creativity.   I  understand

that, for example, in the past 10 years or so, more schools have

implemented  Edward De Bono's thinking strategies.  The  reports

which  I have seen in the newspapers seem to suggest that school

children find such programmes more enjoyable and enriching.  And

teachers   too  find  these  programmes  useful  in  encouraging

students   to  pursue  self-learning.   The  need  to  encourage

independent thinking and a spirit of innovation have been  spelt

out  in  the  list of Desired Outcomes also known as the  `8888'

list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the education system, as it stands now and in the

future, will have a large



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>



impact  on  the type of society and the position that  Singapore

achieves  at  the  international level.  Many  Members  in  this

House, including myself, have argued that for Singapore to  make

the  next  grade, we need innovations and creative ouputs  which

can  match the best in the world.  Creativity will determine how

our  companies compete in the age of ideas.  Hence, we  need  to

mould  creative  minds  and innovative spirits  from  among  our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, what exactly is creativity? American psychologist,

Howard  Gardner,  defined the exemplary creator  as  "a  strong-minded  individual who often retains child-like  characteristics

such  as  self-centredness."  Ms Wu Yee-Ping, CEO of  Music  Pen

Inc., a New York based company, believes that "creativity begins

with a child-like curious mind which is not afraid to take risks

and  experiment."   Ms Wu received the Award for  Excellence  in

Science and Technology from New York.   And she runs her company

by  encouraging her designers to be creative and bold.  If these

are the characteristics of a creative mind, then how do we teach

it?   Studies have shown that gifted children often  lose  their

spark  after  going to a mainstream school.  Can we,  therefore,

teach creativity in our schools today?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important feature of creativity, as seen in the above

descriptions,  is experimentation, discovery, and  a  child-like

curiosity to check things out.  Imagine a child learning to feed

himself  with a spoon.  He will fail several times.  But through

the  experience, he will learn something about how to  grip  the

spoon,  about the consistency of the food which is all over  his

body,  about  his hand-eye coordination, and about dealing  with

the  frustration  of  not being able  to  have  his  food.   But

perhaps,  most  importantly,  he will  experience  the  ultimate

thrill of being able to do something for himself.  All this  may

not come about if he is spoon-fed all of the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the nature of creativity to experiment. But

experiments  can lead to success or failure.  Are  our  students

prepared  to  deal with failure?  Is our system  sympathetic  to

failures so that, like the child



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>



learning  to feed himself, the student can pick himself  up  and

achieve  his  objective?  Many tertiary students I met  recently

spoke  about  the  need  for stable jobs.   I  sense  that  this

preference could be due to a fear of failure.  Why is  this  so?

Howard Gardner again observed that the US system is a system  of

"infinite second chances".  Perhaps the perception is  that  our

system does not provide enough second chances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that we have to create opportunities in

schools for our children to explore and innovate.  We can  teach

some  basic  skills.   But we have to  leave  the  rest  to  the

students  to  discover, but we must also counsel them  and  tell

them  that  failure  is not a bad thing.  Failure  is  part  and

parcel  of  the  process of discovery and  innovation.   Through

failure, we will learn what works and what does not work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the inventor of the plastic soda bottle was one person

by  the  name  of  Nathaniel  C. Wyeth.   The  invention,  as  I

discovered, did not come very easy.  His initial search  yielded

a very terrible-looking bottle. But he persisted, and used, "all

his  failures and knowledge of things that wouldn't  work  as  a

springboard to new approaches."  He also said, "if I hadn't used

those  mistakes as stepping stones, I would never have  invented

anything?"   By the way, Sir, the success of the plastic  bottle

has  created an environmental problem for modern researchers  to

deal with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, all inventors share some common traits. They

thrive  no matter what the odds are and they are always dreaming

of  perfecting an imperfect world.  Perhaps we may want to allow

our school children to dream.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the Members' speeches

yesterday,  to  a  certain extent, echo the sentiment  that  our

children  in  school  suffer from very high  levels  of  stress.

Stress  may  be seen in two senses: first of all,  as  a  mental

state,  wherein a person who is under stress feels  a  sense  of

tension and unease; secondly, as an agent or source which serves

as  a  stimulus against which the body is forced to react  in  a

certain way to the demand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first example of the kind of stress that I have talked

about  would be one which results in a feeling of distress,  eg,

having  failed in examination.  In the second instance,  stress,

as  an agent or as a source, would, for example, be examination,

parental expectation of a child's performance in school or  peer

pressure.   These forms of stress can, in turn, lead  to  stress

being a sense of mental state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we implicitly recognise that a child's misery really

begins  from  the  time he takes cognizance of  his  surrounding

environment.  As anxious parents concerned with giving a child a

head start in life, we bombard the child with all forms of books

and learning aids and toys the minute the child is able to utter

his  first sound.  When a child is barely able to walk,  anxious

parents will rush him off to all manner of classes, from  junior

gymnastics to speech and drama, and, yes, even creative  writing

when  a child has even hardly mastered basic words.  In schools,

we  recognise that the child faces much pressure.  This pressure

is  especially  intense  from schools  seeking  to  maintain  or

achieve a reputation as a school of standing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, additionally, as we have heard earlier, our policy on

second  language  has  also contributed much  to  the  stressful

environment  that  the  child has to labour  under.   It  is  my

understanding that most children are not able to cope  with  the

learning of two languages effectively.  On the average, a  child

either  masters one language well or acquire an average  ability

in  two  languages.   Only  a  minority  of  children  have  the

exceptional ability to master both languages well.  The  outcome

then  is  that  for most students, they spend a disproportionate

amount  of  time learning the second language.  It  becomes,  as

they  say, the albatross which the children have to wear  around

their  necks  for many years, in primary and secondary  schools.

And,  indeed,  for  many, the sad outcome has  been  that  these

students  who struggle with the second language would have  done

well  in  the PSLE examinations if the second language  had  not

pulled down their grade average.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a 1985 study on stress and school children, Dr

Alvin  Thomas confirmed that three sources of stress  come  from

homework, parents and peers.  In that study, Dr Thomas said that

50%  of  students sampled indicated they were under stress  from

homework overload.  24% of the students sampled said they suffer

from  depressant effect of homework.  Understandably, the  child

tries  to  measure  up  to expectations, either  a  self-induced

expectation or expectation set by others.  For those who rise to

the occasion, well, they get a pat on the back and they move on.

Those  who do not, suffer from a sense of failure.  This affects

the  sense of self-esteem, and perhaps explains why we see  more

outlandishly dressed delinquent children smoking and hanging out

at  public  places.   Sometimes I  wonder  whether  a  child  is

stressed for its own sake or for the sake of the parent's  pride

and the school's position in the ranking system.  The priorities

must be clear, and perspective must be balanced.  All too often,

we  lose  sight of our objectives and we miss the wood  for  the

trees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe in educational excellence. However,

educational  excellence does not always  have to  be  synonymous

with  the high stress levels of the children.  Indeed, I am  not

sure  whether we can link stress and educational performance  in

schools.  By stressing our children to excel in school, which in

this case is measured by the performance output of the child, we

are  indeed paying a very high price in the process.  We rob our

children of their childhood, of the  joys of living life to  the

full  and of the life of sweet memories of childhood, as we  all

know  it.  In the end we produce children who are so preoccupied

with  performance and results that we end up with  children  who

are very self-centered.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to note from yesterday's announcement that the

Education  Ministry has decided to cut down the curriculum  load

of  students by 10-20%.  This decision is indeed consistent with

the  idea  of  getting our children to focus  more  on  thinking

skills and less on knowledge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>



acquisition.  The lighter load will presumably free up a child's

time for other forms of constructive pursuits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I welcome the idea of a reduced curriculum, I am

not  sure  whether this has the effect of substantially reducing

the  stress  level  of children.  Reducing the curriculum  could

also  mean,  for the anxious parents, that the child  will  have

more   time,  relatively  speaking,  to  spend  on  the  reduced

curriculum.   In other words, the child could well  be  spending

the  same number of hours on fewer topics, with the result  that

the stress level may not necessarily be reduced correspondingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides reducing the curriculum load of a child in

school,  I  would like to ask the Minister whether the Education

Ministry  is at the same time looking at other ways of  reducing

stress in our children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I heard Mr Sim

Boon Ann's speech about students suffering from stress from  the

learning  of  the  second  language.   When  my  children  learn

English,  they  also  find it stressful.  So  shall  I  ask  the

Minister  for  Education  to lower the standard  of  English  in

school?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Minister for Education spoke in this House

yesterday,  he  painted a very idealistic educational  objective

for  us.   He  also  said that in achieving such  an  objective,

teachers  play  a  decisive role.  The Minister also  introduced

certain  measures  to lighten the teachers'  workload,  such  as

restructuring the curricula, cutting down the course content and

syllabi.  But all these can be implemented only in a few  years'

time.  In the meantime, upon the implementation of new education

policies,  teachers immediately face extra workload  and  mental

stress.  For example, in the application of IT in teaching,  the

Ministry of Education stipulates that by the year 2000,  30%  of

the teaching content must apply IT.  Many teachers have gone for

training in software application - Internet, Powerpoint, Chinese

Star,  etc.  But knowing how to use the software and using  them

for the design of teaching materials require two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>



different levels of proficiency in IT.  At the moment, there are

not many CD-ROMs available, especially for Chinese language, and

not  much suitable materials on the Internet.  Yet, the Ministry

of Education keeps exerting pressure on the teachers to apply IT

in their teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In creative teaching, the teacher's dilemma is how to carry

out  creative teaching in class and at the same time ensure that

the  academic  results of his students will not be  compromised.

The  Minister  for Education said that academic  performance  is

part  of  a holistic education and that the pursuit of  holistic

education    will    not    compromise    academic    standards.

Theoretically,  this  may  be so, but when  the  measurement  of

success  or  failure  of  education is  based  on  results,  the

teachers  would still have to be more realistic  to  go  by  the

standards by which they are measured.  I am not against creative

teaching  and  the emphasis on the thinking skills of  students,

but  when  we  are emphasizing so much on marks and  scores,  on

results and performance, where do we get the support point?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, will the Ministry of Education consider the

ways of setting questions so as to ensure that creative thinking

will  also have a place to play in examination?  At the  moment,

the  way of teaching is centred around questions set at previous

examinations  and  the  school curricula.   If  the  examination

questions  are  the  same, but the teachers  focus  on  creative

thinking, and the results are therefore affected, will  this  be

acceptable   to  parents,  the  schools  and  the  Ministry   of

Education?   If the Ministry of Education decides to change  the

contents and styles of the questions set for the national  level

examination, what form will it take and when will it start?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers feel puzzled about creative teaching. What is

meant  by  creative teaching?  What percentage of  the  teaching

time should be devoted to creativity and critical thinking?  How

much  of  the teaching must be tailored to impart knowledge  and

understanding of the subjects that the students are studying?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the Ministry's intention is that the teachers

will still have to ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>



that  the  students pass all their examinations  and  pass  them

well,  with good results, and at the same time MOE also requires

students to have thinking skills, creativity and to achieve  the

desired  educational results set by the Ministry  of  Education,

then  a different system of evaluation to include the objectives

should  be formulated to assess the performance results  of  the

students.  We all know that our education system is based on the

marks of students to measure results.  The success or failure of

students  is also measured by academic results.  So whatever  it

is,  it   is  examination  results! So parents  follow  it,  MOE

follows it, everybody follows it, and the whole society goes  by

the  same standard for incentives and awards.  The whole society

has  this  kind  of attitude.  Therefore, if you  have  creative

teaching  to  achieve the higher objective of education  but  it

will  not be measured as part of their performance, then I doubt

very  much  whether we can achieve much from creative  teaching,

and  how  much  can  be  achieved in the teaching  goals  beyond

examination subjects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if, on the one hand, teachers are required to proceed

with  creative  teaching  and  devote  time  to  non-examination

subjects  to  expand  the  students' general  knowledge  and  to

strengthen their thinking skills to achieve the higher objective

of  education,  but  on  the other hand, continue  to  rank  our

schools based on the students' academic results obtained through

faithful  reproduction of knowledge they have  learnt  from  the

textbooks  and lecture  notes,  then what does the  Ministry  of

Education think that the school principals and teachers will do?

Will  they  focus  on examination results by which  schools  are

measured  or  creative  thinking to achieve  higher  educational

objectives?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, once

again  I  thank Members for their suggestions and  views.   They

come  from a number of very different perspectives.  I  think  I

would suggest that some of the Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>



discuss  with each other and try and resolve some of the  issues

that they have brought up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, allow me to address the issue of universities

which is a subject I left over from yesterday.  Mr Loh Meng See,

Prof.  Chin Tet Yung, Dr Toh See Kiat, Mr Ee, Mr Zainul  and  Dr

Teo Ho Pin spoke about this.  DPM, Dr Tony Tan, has outlined the

key  changes  to university education at a speech  at  NTU  last

month.  To recap, NUS and NTU are working to double their  post-graduate  intake  by  the  year  2000.   Both  are  working   on

broadening   undergraduate   education.    Tertiary    education

opportunities  will  be expanded with the establishment  of  the

Singapore  Management University whilst Arts education  will  be

boosted by impending changes to LaSalle/SIA College of the  Arts

and  the  Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.  These changes  will  be

announced sometime next month by Dr Tan Chin Nam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be enough places for Singaporeans? Has there

been  an impact from the currency crisis?  No, we have not  seen

any  discernible  impact from the currency crisis.   I  wish  to

assure  Mr  Loh that there will be enough university places  for

Singaporeans  who,  in  Mr Loh's words,  make  the  grade.   The

increase  in  intake of foreign students will be  undertaken  as

part of the university's overall expansion plans and will not be

at the expense of Singaporeans.  There is flexibility to enlarge

the intake in most courses if there is demand.  In fact, for the

coming  academic  year, 1998/1999, there will  be  increases  in

intakes  in  almost all the faculties, ranging from 1%  to  11%,

except  for Dentistry, Law and Business, where the intakes  will

remain about the same.  Members will understand the reasons  for

Dentistry  and Law.  For Business, we are making adjustments  as

well.   The  total intake will increase by about 4�%.   For  the

academic year 1999-2000, a further 4�% increase in undergraduate

intake has been projected.  We will refine this number as we  go

along.  So there is no shortage of places for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has broadening affected professional disciplines? Prof.

Chin asked about this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>



yesterday.  For professional degrees, there is a need to  strike

a  balance between broadening and attaining sufficient depth  of

knowledge to satisfy professional bodies.  This can be  achieved

through  changes  in the curriculum as well as by  other  means.

For  example, in the Law Faculty, as Prof. Chin knows, there are

plans  to take in a more diverse student body instead of relying

on  those who have completed their "A" levels.  This is good for

providing more diverse academic preparation for lawyers who  may

need to go into specialist areas like patents and trade law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the SMU and OUDP which were raised by Mr

Loh  and Dr Toh.  The establishment of the Management University

in  2000 will result in an increase in the number of places  for

students  wishing  to pursue an undergraduate  business  course.

While  NUS will reduce its undergraduate Business Administration

intake  slightly from the current 600 to 500 in the  year  2000,

and NTU will stop offering its undergraduate Business programme,

there  will be more places available in SMU to make up for these

changes.   So in fact the Business intake will increase overall.

The   facilities  given  up  by  NTU's  undergraduate   Business

programmes  will be used for an expansion of NTU's post-graduate

Business  programmes and increase in the number  of  engineering

students  taking  Business  minors  and  to  house  the  overall

expansion in post-graduate students in all disciplines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a private university, SMU will have some flexibility in

setting  fees  and  entry requirements.  However,  as  SMU  will

receive  Government funding, we do not expect  its  fees  to  be

significantly higher than NUS or NTU.  We do not expect them  to

be  lower either.  As announced by the SIM Governing Council  in

January,  SMU will require both "A" level results and SATs  from

those  applying  in 2000 and beyond.  SMU will be  making  other

innovations in curriculum, campus design and other areas  and  I

think this will be good for the university sector in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother tongue requirement for SMU. Bilingualism is a

cornerstone of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>



Singapore's  education system.  SMU has stated  that  applicants

will need to satisfy the minimum grade in the mother tongue,  as

in  the case for admission into NUS and NTU.  There is no change

to  this  policy and we do not intend to make any changes.   The

minimum requirement to apply for NUS and NTU is a grade of D7 in

mother  tongue,  either as a second language taken  at  the  "A"

level  examination or as a first language taken at the "O" level

examination.  Currently, candidates who do not satisfy the above

requirements  for mother tongue may still submit an  application

for  NTU  or  NUS.   If selected, they will  be  admitted  on  a

provisional basis.  During the course of their study, they  will

be  required to meet the requisite minimum language requirements

before  they are allowed to graduate.  I am sure SMU will  apply

the same flexibility for deserving candidates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMU and OUDP serve different purposes. The establishment

of  SMU  expands  tertiary education opportunities  for  school-leavers   as  well  as  for  some  working  adults.   OUDP   was

established to provide opportunities mainly for working  adults.

How  successful has OUDP been?  The OUDP took in its first batch

of  students  in  1994  and will see  its  first  batch  of  332

graduates  this  year,  even though the average  time  taken  to

complete  the  degree  programme is six  years.   I  have  great

admiration for those who have taken the programme.  It  requires

a  lot  of commitment and effort.  Its current enrolment in  the

five   fields   of   English,  Mathematics,  Computer   Science,

Technology  and Psychology, stands at 5,100.  OUDP started  with

three   degree  programmes,  English  Language  and  Literature,

Mathematics  and Computer Science and has since expanded  to  15

programmes.  It will continue to review its course offerings  to

meet the needs of working adults.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUDP's minimum admission requirement was raised by Mr

Gerard Ee and Mr Zainul.  They are already quite flexible.   The

academic requirement is 2 GCE "A" level passes or its equivalent

or  an  acceptable  local  diploma.   Other  qualifications  are

considered on a case-by-case basis.  These requirements are less

stringent than those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>



for  applications to NUS or NTU, for example, the two "A"  level

passes that are required do not have to be at one sitting.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, applicants need to have a minimum work

experience,  including NS, of two years and to be  at  least  21

years  old.   The requirement takes into account the applicant's

work experience, life skills and maturity.  I think we must  all

understand that some minimum academic requirement is  needed  to

ensure  that  those who take up the programme have a  reasonable

chance   of  success.   This  will  also  give  employers   more

confidence about the quality of OUDP and its graduates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accreditation of private educational institutions is a

point  raised  by  Mr Loh and Dr Teo Ho Pin.   The  Ministry  of

Education  does  not  regulate the offer  of  distance  learning

programmes originating from overseas tertiary institutions.   It

will become even more difficult to do so in the future when  you

have   electronic   communication  and   so   on.    The   local

organisations  representing the overseas  tertiary  institutions

have   to  seek  the  Ministry's  authorisation  to  offer   the

programmes.  The Ministry examines proposals, focusing attention

on  areas  including  the  standing  of  the  overseas  tertiary

institution and the programme to be offered.  The prerogative of

selecting a course of study, however, rests completely with  the

students.  Prospective students would thus need to have  a  full

understanding of what is being offered, including  the  cost  of

the  programme  and match it with his or her capacity,  aptitude

and  resources  available  to pursue  such  studies.   The  best

protection would be to conduct a careful and thorough evaluation

prior to enrolling in a programme.  Students owe themselves this

responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the OUDP setting the benchmark standards for

distance   learning  courses  set  up  by  private   educational

institutions, I think it is already playing quite a useful  role

by providing another avenue for upgrading.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the University's admission system. Mr Chew

Heng Ching, Mr Sinnakaruppan, Prof. Chin Tet Yung, all have made

impassioned  appeals  for  what they consider  to  be  important

qualities to be taken into account and hope that this  will  not

distort the motivations of students when they take on all  these

important qualities in their school life.  I just want  to  make

one  comment  here.   What  we do in the University's  admission

system, as correctly pointed out by many Members, does not  only

have  an impact on what type of students enter the universities.

What we do in the University's admission system has a big impact

on  the whole school system because students who aspire to go to

University will focus their attention and efforts on this.   The

Committee that is looking at this is cognizant of this point and

will  take  all  these  into account.  I will  forward  all  the

suggestions  that  Members have raised  to  Prof.  Shih  who  is

chairing  this  Committee.   We do  not  want  to  prejudge  the

conclusions of this Committee.  So I will leave it at that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the discussion on University's admission and

ranking,  I  see two interesting trends in the whole discussion.

On  the  one hand, there is a desire to say, "Okay, if  you  say

this  is  important, then you should count it.  If  you  do  not

count  it, that means you are not giving importance to it."   On

the other hand, there is another argument raised by many Members

here  to say that, "Well, if you count it, then you distort  the

students'  motivations in doing this.  So  you  shouldn't  count

it."   So on the one hand, you should count all the things  that

are  important;  on  the other hand, you  should  not  count  it

because,  if it is important, the person really should be  doing

it  for  the love of it, and not because he gets points for  it.

So this is an interesting dilemma.  I think basically we have to

be  realistic.  If it is important, we should try and count  it.

And that is the approach which I think we have to take.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same dilemma exists in ranking. This is a subject

which has been brought up by a number of people here.  They say,

"Well, you rank schools, it creates all kinds of distortions  in

the  system."  Dr Toh, I think, referred to the question  raised

at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>



last  year's debate.  I can also refer him to the answer I  gave

in  last year's debate.  Ranking is something which we will  not

do away with in Singapore.  I am open to ideas on how to improve

the  system but it is something which is valuable.  It  provides

very  valuable  benchmarking for schools, for  the  Ministry  of

Education  as a whole and for schools themselves to  know  where

they  stand.  If the intake of students in School A  is  roughly

the  same  as the intake of students in School B, and  School  A

does  better than School B, remarkably better than School  B,  I

think the principals themselves would want to know why, what  is

it  in  School A which is interesting and useful which School  B

can  take  on for the benefit of School B's students.   I  think

that  is quite a reasonable objective of ranking and comparison.

And  all  over the world, in the UK, in the US, in many  states,

ranking is now accepted as something useful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that two days ago, I read an interesting article

in  the UK.  They now rank schools quite avidly in UK, a lot  of

tests  and a lot of ranking.  And, in fact, I was very happy  to

see  that  they have just started value-added ranking  which  is

something  which we have done in our schools for  several  years

already.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what Dr Toh See Kiat has proposed with regard to

ranking  will  make  things even worse.   He  suggested  putting

weights  on  various kinds of things.  In fact, we  do  not  put

weights  today.   What Dr Toh See Kiat is  doing  is  trying  to

convert a vector into a scalar - a multi-factored description of

a  school, by assigning weights into a single number.  In  fact,

we  do not do that.  I have a book here which addresses what  Dr

Toh  was talking about.  If you are selecting a school for  your

child,  I  have a book here which is produced in four languages,

and  it  describes all kinds of things: ECA highlights, physical

fitness  level, aggregate range of pupils posted to that school,

and  a  short write-up on the emphasis, achievements and  awards

which  the schools write themselves to tell you what the  school

is  like,  what  the  school believes in.  The   publication  is

available.  This provides a broader representation of  what  the

school does when parents are selecting secondary schools



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>



for their children.  It is also not true that the Ministry gives

greater  weightage to the pure academic performance of a  school

than   its  value-added.   But  the  public  may  give   greater

weightage.  The Ministry provides little cash prizes for  value-added  schools.  We do not provide cash prizes for schools which

do  well purely by their subject grades.  So I think what Dr Toh

is  proposing, which is to assign little weights  to  all  these

things, is, in fact, going to be quite counter-productive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franchising and the quality of schools - Dr Michael Lim

spoke about taking "good" schools and "replicating" them.   This

is one method of replicating good schools.  But replicating good

schools is not just a matter of transferring the brand name.  Dr

Lim, I think, has some brand names in mind.  To produce a school

of the same quality will require the right school leadership and

mix  of  teachers.   More  importantly, this  assumes  that  the

student body is the same.  A different student body is likely to

require  different  teaching strategies and a  different  school

ethos.   A  direct clone of a school, like Raffles  Institution,

for  example, which tailors its programmes and methods  for  the

very best of our students is unlikely to be suitable for all the

students in Singapore.  So we must be quite aware of this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out to Dr Lim that while he has

cited  certain  schools, we should not be overly enamoured  with

brand  names.  These are schools which do extremely  well.   But

there are also other schools which do extremely well which  have

names that are not instantly recognisable to the public or to Dr

Lim.   And  by this, I do not just mean schools who have  scored

the  best  results.   But, more importantly, the  schools  which

produce  the most value-added.  These are schools which  parents

should be looking for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do agree with Dr Lim that good school practices and

management know-how should be replicated so that we can  improve

our  schools.  And this is, in fact, one of the main reasons why

we  have  done  cluster  schools.  These are  headed  by  senior

principals  with  a  proven  track record.   Leadership  in  the

schools is important.  Principals are important



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>



people.   If you have a good principal, how do you increase  his

influence,  how do you make better use of him.  He can  run  one

very  good school, but if he has run it for half a dozen  years,

he  has  a  very  good school there.  How do  you  increase  his

influence?   One way is to have him as a head of  a  cluster  in

which the same principal, the same dynamism, his experience, can

be  extended to several other schools.  So this is  one  of  the

reasons why we have cluster schools.  Clusters will also  enable

schools  to exchange best practices and so forth.  And  we  also

have  a regular rotation of principals so that there is a steady

flow of fresh ideas and energy in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin suggested ISO 9000 for our schools. We do

have quality control measures in place in our schools.  They are

visited  by inspectors.  First of all, within the school,  there

is  a quality control structure.  The teachers are supervised by

heads  of departments and subject and level heads, and its vice-principal  and  principal.  The inspectors of  schools  and  the

senior  inspectors of schools, the curriculum  specialists  will

visit  the  school, and so forth.  There are school evaluations.

There   is   ranking.    And  we  also  compare   ourselves   in

international  mathematics and science studies and  so  on  with

educational systems in other countries.  So there are  a  number

of  quality control structures in place already.  I am  open  to

the  idea  of  seeing how we can improve this and  we  will  see

whether Dr Teo's suggestion has merit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat wondered whether or not the schools and the

HQ are in sync, whether the policies that are promulgated in the

headquarters actually get executed in the schools.  And I  think

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang also echoes some of these sentiments:</b> whether

or  not  the things that we do and say in headquarters  actually

are done in schools, and whether what happens in the schools  is

actually  known in the headquarters.  I have been visiting  many

schools  myself and talking to many teachers.  But I would  just

like to let the Members of the House know that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>



senior officers in my headquarters - it is not something that  I

asked  them  to  do but something which they decided  themselves

that  they want to do - the Permanent Secretaries, the Director-General  of Education, the Deputy Secretaries, and 11  Directors

(16  of them in all) visit schools once every two weeks and talk

to  the  teachers to find out what is happening, to  explain  to

them the policies, to get feedback from them directly.  They  do

not  go altogether, they go individually.  And in this way  each

of the schools, every one of our schools, will be visited by one

of them every year.  This is one of the ways in which we try and

make  sure  that the headquarters and the schools have  a  close

link together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the subject of miscellaneous fees. Several

Members - Mr Loh Meng See, Mr Hawazi and Dr Teo Ho Pin and other

MPs  - have commented that the cost of education has gone up  by

something like 30%, that operating budgets are tight and we must

not  compromise on the quality of education and they ask how the

Ministry will handle the situation.  Perhaps I can ask the Clerk

to distribute a Table (Cols. 1883-1884) that I have.  [Copies of

Table distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980320/19980320-HA-0681883.htm">Table - School Fees and Miscellaneous Fees (Cols. 1883-1884)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General education is almost fully subsidised by Government.

Although  the average annual cost per pupil increased  61%  from

$2,600 in 1992 to $4,200 in 1997, citizen pupils pay a token sum

of  school fees at the rate of $5 per month for secondary school

and  $6  per  month for junior colleges.  At primary  level,  no

school fees are charged and we have no intention to raise school

fees.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, parents now pay miscellaneous fees. These

miscellaneous  fees  are  a contribution  towards  the  cost  of

materials used by pupils in the schools.  In recent years, there

had   been  many  innovative  ideas,  curriculum  changes,   the

availability  of  more materials and programmes.   In  order  to

expose pupils to the myriad of innovative materials available in

the  market,  schools have been making ad-hoc  cash  collections

from  pupils.   Those of you who have children in  schools  will

know  this.  And these ad-hoc cash collections add to the amount

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>



parents  need to spend for the education of their children.   To

manage the increase in cost, we need to do two things:  first of

all,  we  must  make sure that any increase in cost,  any  extra

expenditure  is  really  worthwhile,  cost  effective  and  cost

efficient.   But secondly, we also have to provide  a  framework

for  schools  to  continue to spend on those  things  which  are

necessary, particularly enrichment materials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present miscellaneous fee is a token sum which

comprises two components: a standard component and a second-tier

component.  The standard component is fixed by my Ministry at $5

a  month  for primary level, $7 a month for secondary and  $9  a

month  for junior college level.  That is the standard component

of  miscellaneous fees.  The second-tier component is  currently

capped  at  30% of the standard component.  The School  Advisory

Committee  or School Management Committee (SAC/SMC)  decides  on

the  need  for  the second-tier fees and parents can  use  their

children's  Edusave  Accounts to pay for  the  second-tier  fee.

Most  schools already find it necessary to collect close to  the

full  amount  for  the second-tier fees.  As a  result,  if  the

schools  wish  to  do  more,  they  often  have  to  make   cash

collections  on an ad-hoc basis from students.   This  makes  it

more  difficult  for parents to budget for such expenditure  and

these  payments are often made in cash rather than from  Edusave

due to the inconvenience of making Edusave withdrawals on an ad-hoc  basis,  if  parents  do want to use  Edusave.   These  cash

collections  also  place  an  extra  administrative  burden   on

teachers  and schools because they have to collect the cash  and

make  sure  it is all accounted for properly.  My Ministry  will

put  in  place  a  framework to give schools the flexibility  to

reduce the ad-hoc cash collections from their pupils by allowing

them to raise the second-tier component of miscellaneous fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 1999, the Ministry of Education will allow

the  SAC/SMC to charge second-tier miscellaneous fees up to  the

same  amount as the standard miscellaneous fees instead  of  the

30% of standard miscellaneous fees.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>



SAC/SMC will continue to decide on when and how much second-tier

miscellaneous  fees  should be increased  for  their  respective

schools depending on the needs of that school and the programmes

that the school is undertaking.  Parents can continue to use the

Edusave  Accounts to pay for the full amount of the  second-tier

fees,  so  there should be no need for additional  cash  outlays

from parents if they choose to use Edusave.  Parents who wish to

use  the Edusave Accounts to pay the second-tier fees will  also

be  required  to pay school fees and the standard  miscellaneous

fees  by  GIRO.   This again will streamline the fee  collection

system  of  schools  and  reduce the  administrative  burden  on

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lifting of the 30% cap, the maximum increase in

monthly miscellaneous fees will be $3.50 for primary, $4.90  for

secondary  and $6.30 for junior college, all of which  I  stress

can be met by using the Edusave Accounts.  For the vast majority

of  parents, there will be no increase in cash outlay  therefore

if  they choose to use Edusave for the second-tier miscellaneous

fees.  The total maximum miscellaneous fees chargeable, ie, both

the  standard  and the second-tier component, will  be  $10  for

primary,  $14 for secondary and $18 for junior college  and  the

schools will decide when they need to make adjustments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single session schools. This is a subject raised by Dr Lee

Tsao  Yuan.   There are indeed many benefits from having  single

session schools.  The question really is one of resources.   The

Ministry  of  Education is already fully stretched  implementing

the  single  session programme to all secondary schools  by  the

year  2000.  This is quite a massive building programme  because

we  have  to  build many new schools as well as build  extension

blocks in many of the existing secondary schools.  Members  will

probably  have  noticed this in the secondary schools  in  their

constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the secondary school enrolment is projected to increase

beyond the year 2000, more new secondary schools will have to be

built  to  sustain the single session programme.   So  extending

single



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>



session  to  primary schools would place further strain  on  our

resources and it is not something which we are able to do  right

now.   And  for primary schools, we need to also study carefully

the  pros  and  cons of going single session.   The  pupils  are

younger.   It  is not clear that all parents would  welcome  the

idea of them staying in school till about 3.30 pm each day.   We

must  also  remember  that  single  session  schools  should  be

developed for their educational value and not because  it  is  a

convenient means of child care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the subject of mother tongue. I was very tempted

to  ask  Mr Rai and Mr Peh Chin Hua to have a discussion on  the

standard that we should achieve in our mother tongue in schools.

Mr  Peh  Chin Hua expressed concern about the `O' level  holders

whom  we  have recruited as teachers for Chinese Language.   The

introduction of the diploma in mother tongue language  education

for  `O'  level  holders  in 1997 was one  of  several  measures

implemented  to augment the supply of Chinese Language  teachers

for  primary  schools.  Mr Peh has expressed  concern  that  the

recruitment  of  `O' level holders might lower the  standard  of

Chinese Language teaching in our primary schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry would like to assure Mr Peh that it will not

lead  to  a  lowering  of standards given the  strict  selection

criteria.  Candidates must have good grades in their Chinese  at

`O' levels and must meet the minimum criteria for pre-university

courses.   Short-listed  candidates  must  then  go  through  an

interview by Chinese Language specialists from both the Ministry

and  the National Institute of Education.  During the interview,

candidates are assessed for their language fluency, knowledge of

classical  literature and their aptitude and keenness  to  teach

young   children.    I  think  this  is  also  very   important.

Successful  applicants  would be  enrolled  in  the  diploma  in

Chinese  Language education programme conducted by the  National

Institute  of Education and this is a four-year long  programme.

The  trainees would be exposed to classical literature, language

and cultural training that will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>



bring  the Chinese Language standard and appreciation of Chinese

culture  to  a  level comparable to the GCE `A'  level,  if  not

higher.  They will also be equipped with pedagogy skills so that

they are able to impart their knowledge and inherent passion for

the language to their pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is therefore confident that the Chinese

Language teachers from the diploma in Chinese Language education

programme  will  not  lead to any lowering of  Chinese  Language

standards  in  our  primary schools.   Like  all  other  Chinese

Language teachers, they can attend in-service courses on Chinese

Language  and  Chinese Language teaching conducted regularly  by

the  Ministry.   They  can also apply to enrol  in  an  on-going

annual teacher attachment programme in the People's Republic  of

China.   The programme is four weeks long during which  teachers

will undergo a series of classes conducted at the Beijing Normal

University  as  well as attachment in schools in Beijing.   This

programme  helps  teachers find new ideas with  respect  to  the

teaching of the Chinese Language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on Chinese Language, I will take up the point that Mr

Lim  Swee  Say  mentioned yesterday.  In fact,  the  purpose  of

having  such  passages in the Chinese Language textbooks  is  to

convey  the  moral education messages.  Perhaps, we  can  do  it

better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tamil Language, Mr Rai feels that the standard of Tamil

Language is too high.  Mr Peh feels that the standard of Chinese

Language is too low.  Somewhere in between, they should meet and

have a discussion.  The current Tamil Language syllabuses in our

schools   have   been  developed  to  meet  the  objectives   of

transmitting  cultural  and  traditional  values  and  providing

pupils  with  proficiency in their mother tongue.  We  recognise

that  pupils who do not come from Tamil speaking homes may  have

difficulties  in  learning  the  language.   We  will  see  what

adjustments can be made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also agree that our bright pupils should be given the

opportunity  to learn Malay and, in fact, the Ministry  conducts

lessons in Malay as a third language at its language centre  for

those pupils who wish to study the language.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked about foreign talent and mother tongue as

second  language.  In fact, the example that Dr Wang brought  up

actually illustrates the flexibility with which the Ministry  of

Education  approaches  the  issue of mother  tongue  and  second

language for those foreigners who choose to settle in Singapore.

What  Dr Wang described was that, in fact, the Ministry has made

many adaptations, exercised a lot of flexibility and allowed the

children  of  this  particular parent to do quite  a  number  of

different  things - different languages, Malay  or  French,  and

several opportunities to take and retake the examination.  So we

do  provide a considerable amount of flexibility already  and  I

think  the  learning of mother tongue as second language  is  in

fact good for the students in the long term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional training of teachers is a subject that was

brought  up  by  Mr Loh yesterday.  He suggested  a  Principals'

College.  Mr Loh also asked about English Language teachers.  We

do  not see a need for a Principals' College right now.  What we

would  want  to  do  is to make sure that  the  NIE  becomes  an

excellent  place, an institution which is renowned for  research

in  education and for teaching teachers how to teach.   This  is

something which we would like to see NIE become.  It is  already

quite  a  well-established  institution  and  it  also  conducts

courses  in  educational administration, and so  on.   In  fact,

there  is  a  principals'  course and  a  course  for  Heads  of

Department.  They go by names which I always find very difficult

to  remember.  But basically, it is a principals' course  and  a

Heads of Department's course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh also asked about English Language teachers and

vacancies, and so forth.  We had a good recruitment in the  last

two  years  and the vacancies for English Language teachers  are

not  very  significant now.  We expect to be able  to  fill  the

existing  vacancies  by  May 1998 this  year  when  the  freshly

trained teachers from NIE come out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee lamented about the large number of subjects

that  Primary 1 students take.  I am not sure where he got  this

idea from.  In fact, our primary school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>



syllabus is very, very focused.  In Primary 1, we concentrate on

just three subjects: English, mother tongue and Mathematics.  We

do  not  just teach three subjects because the children also  do

PE,  art, moral education, civics, and so forth.  But the  basic

emphasis is on these three subjects.  So I am not sure where  Mr

Ee  has  got  his information from.  In fact, we  do  not  teach

Science until Primary 3.  That is one of the reasons why at  the

Third International Mathematics and Science Study, when our kids

were tested in Science at Primary 4, they came out somewhere  in

the  middle  of the table.  So we are extremely focused  in  our

primary school curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also expressed concern, which is a valid one, about

language  training  and ability at a young  age.   In  fact,  my

Ministry has a learning support programme for students who  have

difficulties  coping with the first couple of years  in  school.

And this language support programme, which is in a number of our

schools, is very well received by parents whose children need  a

little bit more support to adapt to primary school.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to Mr Shriniwas Rai who spoke about history. I

agree that history can be enlivened.  Information technology and

TV  provide a lot of opportunities, and we will see how  we  can

make use of Mr Rai's suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh Meng See asked a number of penetrating questions

about  information technology.  We have this IT Masterplan.   He

asked:  what is going to happen after this Masterplan?  How  are

we  going to replace the computers and so on?  The Minister  for

Finance  is here.  It is quite clear.  When we provide for  this

Masterplan,  we understand and know that this is not  a  one-off

exercise  where we spend $2 billion over five or six years,  and

put  computers in the schools.  There are many other things that

we  need  to do.   After that, we have to replace the  computers

once  every  three  or four years and so on.   The  Ministry  of

Finance is cognizant of that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked how information technology would change the

way  our  classrooms  would look, how we use  IT  for  teaching.

There  are   three basic things.  Firstly, we can use  computers

for  very  basic functions, which is drilling.  This  is  fairly

well established.  It is like doing homework, practising and  so

forth.   But  that is very basic.  Second, it can  be  used  for

teaching and learning in the classroom to enliven classes,  like

what Mr Rai has suggested, for history.  And beyond that, we can

do  free form sorts of exercises requiring creativity.  Students

can  have interchanges with students in other countries  and  so

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh also asked about training hours and material

production.   The reason the numbers have come down  is  because

most  of  them are multimedia.  Instead of producing many,  many

items  in  different media, they are all produced in multimedia.

And  the  training  hours will go up as  the  IT  Masterplan  is

implemented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, I agree with all that he has

said.  I really have nothing to add.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Sin Boon Ann, many of the points that he has

raised  about stress, I have already addressed yesterday  in  my

response.   I would just like to reiterate that parents  have  a

lot to do with expectations, which is one of the major causes of

stress on their kids.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked a number of questions about

curriculum, restructuring of assessment and so forth.   He asked

about  questions.   I  think  I  have  addressed  most  of  them

yesterday in my response.  I can read it to him again or  I  can

refer  him to Hansard.  But, yesterday, I addressed most of  the

points   that  he  has  raised.   If  Mr  Low  has  any   useful

suggestions, other than the questions, I will be happy  to  hear

him, and see how we can implement them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that is all that I would like to respond to.

I  would now like to invite Dr Wong, Mr Peter Chen and Mr Maidin

to take up the other points.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>

<b>Wong):</b> Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Choo Wee Khiang talked about the

state  of discipline in our schools.  I wish to assure  both  of

them  that  the  state  of discipline in our  schools  is  under

control.   Serious cases which have been reported in  the  press

from  time  to time are very infrequent occurrences.  The  great

majority  of our students are very hardworking.  They  are  well

behaved, and they are responsible students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995, MOE has implemented a behaviour tracking and

analysis  system in schools.  This system allows us  to  collect

data systematically on all the discipline cases in school.  They

range  from  the rather light infringements like not handing  in

assignments,  coming  late to school, to the  serious  offences.

For  primary students, misconduct, such as not doing assignments

and  disruptive behaviour in class, is the top offence category,

followed  by  attendance,  such  as  late  coming  and  truancy.

Together,  they  constitute about 84% of  the  total  number  of

offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no significant change in the distribution of

offence  categories  over the last three years.   Increases  for

serious offences were marginal, with the increase in gangsterism

being more noticeable, from 11 cases in 1996 to 34 last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For secondary pupils, top offences are also attendance

related and various forms of misconduct, such as improper attire

and grooming, open defiance, rudeness and not doing assignments.

Although very serious offences remain relatively infrequent, two

types  of  cases  ought  to receive our  attention.   These  are

substance abuse and gangsterism.  They have been on the rise  in

the  last three years.  Substance abuse, from 33 cases in  1995,

shot up to 272 in 1997.  Gangsterism, from 101 cases in 1995  to

159  in 1997.  This trend has also been receiving attention from

the  Ministry  of  Home Affairs.  MOE and MHA are  working  very

closely together to try to contain this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the incidence of offences rises with age, and

offences are more likely to be found among the less academically

inclined students than among those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>



who are more academically inclined.  We should bear in mind that

since  we implemented the 10-year general education system,  the

less  academically inclined students are now going  through  the

school  system, who previously might have dropped out of  school

already.   However, there is some positive sign and  reason  for

optimism.   This is because, although the offence rate generally

rises with age, the rates for secondary one and two pupils  have

declined  over the last three years.  We will monitor  this  and

see  if  the same positive trend would be extended to the  upper

secondary levels in the coming years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am afraid I would not have much time to talk about

the  kinds  of  measures we take in the schools to tackle  these

problems.   Generally speaking, they include  civics  and  moral

education,   uniformed  groups  and  the  community  involvement

programme  we  have  now introduced.  We  have  also  introduced

specific  measures  such as the Volunteer  Special  Constabulary

scheme  in the schools which is popularly known as the  "teacher

cops".  We also have trained teachers to be counsellors, and  we

have  appointed  discipline masters and mistresses  in  all  the

schools.   We place a great deal of importance on pastoral  care

and  counselling, as Mr Loh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua also suggested,

especially to offer counselling and advice to at-risk pupils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has rightly pointed out, there is a

rising  trend of juvenile delinquency among girls, and this  has

been  noticed also by Prof. Ho Peng Kee when he dealt  with  the

matter during the debate on the Ministry of Home Affairs.   Even

though the number of female juvenile offenders arrested has been

falling over the last three years,  at the present level, it  is

still more than double what it was like in 1991, and so this  is

a  worrying  trend. Similarly, we have spotted  an  increase  in

discipline cases among girl students in our schools.   Generally

speaking,  about  80%  of the total number of  discipline  cases

among  girls in secondary schools are offences comprising  late-coming, truancy, skipping of classes and leaving school without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>



permission.   The  more  serious  offences  committed  by  girls

include  smoking, open defiance, assault and fighting, substance

abuse  as  well as gangsterism.  These serious cases constituted

about  3% of the total number of offences among girls last year.

We  are  well aware that if we do not arrest the problem  early,

then  this may develop into juvenile delinquency.  We  are  also

aware  that  disciplinary problems and juvenile delinquency  are

multi-faceted, and we must work together with various  community

groups, MHA, the Central Narcotics Bureau and other agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April 1996, we have been working with Prof. Ho Peng

Kee's Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile Delinquency to tackle

this  problem.  But as I said, this rising trend of disciplinary

problem among girls is cause for some concern.  It may very well

be that the nature of offences among girls differs somewhat from

that  among  boys,  and  we  may not yet  fully  understand  the

peculiar characteristics of female delinquents or offenders,  as

well  as the reasons why they commit these offences.  Therefore,

my  Ministry has decided to form a committee to look  into  this

problem  of  discipline  among  female  students.   I  shall  be

chairing  this  committee.  We will take a closer  look  at  the

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me respond to the points raised by both Mr David Lim

and Mr Loh Meng See on early childhood education.  I do not know

if  I  could  give  an answer to Mr David Lim that  would  fully

satisfy him, for it is obvious that he is an ardent believer and

advocate   of   early  childhood  education.   Early   childhood

education actually spans a variety of programmes, including play

groups,  nursery  classes,  kindergartens  and  various  special

programmes  such as dance, music and drama that aim  to  develop

different  aspects  of  a  child's  growth.   Some  people   are

advocating  foetal education as well.  So the question  is:  how

early  is early childhood education?  MOE's policy is to provide

formal  education from primary 1 onwards, when the child reaches

six  or six plus years of age.  Pre-school education is left  to

the  private  sector  to  play  a  role.   This  allows  greater

flexibility  and  innovation, and provides for different  models

with  different  programmes according to  different  schools  of

thought.  Parents can freely choose from among these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>



according to their inclinations, beliefs and affordability.  But

this  does not mean that MOE does not keep a watchful  eye  over

the  set-up  and  programmes of private  centres.   We  do  have

guidelines on the educational programmes and curriculum.  And to

raise the quality of kindergarten education further, we are,  at

present, reviewing this set of guidelines to make them more user

friendly  and to prepare children properly for formal  schooling

at primary one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, NIE is the main provider of kindergarten

teacher  training.  Together with NIE, the Ministry has recently

formed  a pre-school teacher accreditation committee to accredit

the  kindergarten teacher training programmes  provided  by  the

private training centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state that I believe in early childhood education.

I think it is useful. In this day and age, no responsible parent

would  take  this lightly, whether this is done at  home  or  at

education  centres.   But I must point  out  that  there  is  no

consensus  yet  on  the extent of benefit  of  structured  early

childhood  education, or on how long would the head-start  last.

The  well-known TV programme in the United States, some  Members

may  well  have  watched it too, Sesame Street was  pinned  with

great hope in the beginning years.  Later, it was found that the

head-start  it  gave to the children would not  last  well  into

elementary  school.   This  is because  home  support  given  to

children's  learning is equally important,  and  if  it  is  not

there,  then  the children cannot sustain the initial  gains  in

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither are there clear-cut conclusions in the literature

on  early  childhood  education.   Yes,  there  have  been  some

significant   breakthroughs  in  the  recent   decade   on   the

functioning  of  the  brain.   We  understand  the  learning  of

languages  better  now.  But what makes for emotions,  attitudes

and  motivation,  which  are  equally  important  for  learning?

Experts in brain research often say that the biggest thing  they

know about the brain is how little they still know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When research findings are translated into the running of

early childhood



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>



education programmes, the picture is even more mixed.   This  is

because  there  can  be  very different interpretations  of  how

research results should be put into practice.  Hence, you see  a

great   variety  of  early  childhood  centres  with   different

programmes  that are in the market, especially in the  developed

countries,  and this situation makes it extremely  difficult  to

compare the results.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim suggested that a research and teaching centre for

early  childhood education could be set up and that  the  centre

could  work  with a number of prototype schools in  the  private

sector.   We  can  encourage NIE to look into  this  suggestion,

together   with   other   early   childhood   teacher   training

institutions.  They could partner some private pre-schools to do

the  research,  to see what practices would be  better  for  our

local population.  But I must say that the research will have to

be a longitudinal one.  It will take many years to complete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Constitutional Amendment Bill contains three groups of

amendments:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Those to amalgamate the Public Service Commission

(PSC), the Education Service Commission (ESC) and the Police and

Civil   Defence  Services  Commission  (PCDSC)  into  a   single

Commission, the PSC;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Those to enable the Ministry of Defence and the

Singapore  Armed  Forces to implement the Savings  and  Employee

Retirement Plan, known as SAVER Plan; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Those to safeguard the appointment of the Chief

Valuer.

<br><br><i>The Amalgamation of the PSC, ESC and PCDSC</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the first category of amendments. The

ESC  and  PCDSC  were established in 1990.  At  that  time,  the

duties of the PSC were extremely onerous, because the Government

operated  a highly centralised personnel system.  The  formation

of  the  Education Service Commission and the Police  and  Civil

Defence Services Commission helped to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>



reduce  the workload of the PSC.  It also enabled more attention

to  be  given  to  the Education and Ministry  of  Home  Affairs

uniformed  services,  the  two largest  services  in  the  Civil

Service.   However,  it  did  not  solve  the  more  fundamental

problems   of   the   personnel  system  -  over-centralisation,

rigidity, slowness in adapting to market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in 1994, the Government made more fundamental

changes  to the Civil Service personnel management system.   The

functions  of  promotion and recruitment, which came  under  the

purview  of  the  Public Service Commission,  Education  Service

Commission  and the Police and Civil Defence Services Commission

were  devolved  to Personnel Boards, except for  recruitment  of

Administrative Officers, formal appeals against decisions of the

Personnel  Boards,  and  promotion at the  very  senior  levels,

namely,  at Superscale `D' and above.  These included  Permanent

Secretaries,   Senior  Deputy  Secretaries,   and   high-ranking

officers in the Education and Ministry of Home Affairs uniformed

services.   The devolution of powers meant that the  Commissions

could  focus  on the top talent under their respective  purview,

while the Personnel Boards took care of the personnel management

of the rest of the Civil Service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devolution was fully effected on 1st January 1995. It has

made  Ministries more flexible and responsive, and hence  better

employers.   It has also significantly reduced the workloads  of

the  Education  Service  Commission and  the  Police  and  Civil

Defence  Services Commission.  The Education Service  Commission

and  the  Police and Civil Defence Services Commission now  meet

only  once or twice a year, primarily to consider officers under

their  respective  purview for promotion  to  Superscale  D  and

above.   The number of such officers is small.  In view of  this

new  situation, it has again become both feasible and  desirable

for  a  single Commission, namely the Public Service Commission,

to  appoint,  assess  and promote the top  officers  across  the

public sector.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members of the Education Service Commission and the

Police  and  Civil  Defence Services Commission  have  performed

their duties conscientiously and admirably.  They supervised the

advancement  of personnel in the Education Service and  the  MHA

Uniformed  Services at a time when the personnel  system  placed

heavy  demands on the Commissions.  They have been  diligent  in

promoting  deserving  officers and  pro-active  in  recruitment.

Their efforts have been appreciated by the Ministry of Education

teachers and the Ministry of Home Affairs uniformed staff.   The

Government  places  on  record its gratitude  to  the  Education

Service  Commission  and the Police and Civil  Defence  Services

Commission for their significant contributions to the  personnel

management of the Civil Service since 1990.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides for the amalgamation of the three

Commissions  through  the dissolution of the  Education  Service

Commission and the Police and Civil Defence Services Commission,

and the transfer of their functions to the PSC.   The amendments

to  effect this are contained in clauses 1 to 6 of this Bill  as

well as clauses 8 and 9.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following subsidiary legislation, namely, the Education

Service   Commission  (Delegation  of  Disciplinary   Functions)

Directions  1997,  and  the Police and  Civil  Defence  Services

Commission  (Delegation  of Disciplinary  Functions)  Directions

1997,  will  lapse once the two Commissions are  dissolved.   In

addition,   there  will  be  consequential  change   to   remove

references  to  the two Commissions in the following  subsidiary

legislation:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings)

Regulations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Public Service (Personnel Boards and Appeals

Board) Regulations; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Public Service (Special and Senior Personnel

Boards) Order.

<br><br><i>The Savings and Employee Retirement Plan (SAVER)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the second category of amendments at

clause 7 which amends Article 114 of the Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is to enable the Ministry of Defence and the

Singapore  Armed  Forces to implement its Savings  and  Employee

Retirement Plan, known as the SAVER Plan.  The SAVER  Plan  will

be  established  under  the Singapore Armed  Forces  (Amendment)

Bill,  1998.   The  SAVER  Plan will  replace  the  Pension  and

Contract  schemes  that  are currently  open  to  SAF  uniformed

officers.  The retirement benefits of SAF officers who join  the

SAVER Plan will no longer be charged on the Pension Fund or  the

Consolidated Fund, but on a new fund known as the SAVER Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of setting up the SAVER Fund to pay for the

retirement   benefits  of  SAF  officers,  there   will   be   a

consequential  amendment to the Pension  Fund  Act,  Cap.  224A.

This  amendment  is  contained in  the  Singapore  Armed  Forces

(Amendment)  Bill, 1998.  The Second Minister for Defence,  RAdm

Teo Chee Hean, will be explaining further on the SAVER Plan when

he  moves  the  Second  Reading of the  Singapore  Armed  Forces

(Amendment) Bill, 1998.

<br><br><i>Appointment of the Chief Valuer</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn to the third category of amendments

at  clause  2 which amends Article 22(1) of the Constitution  to

include   the   Chief   Valuer  in  the  list   of   safeguarded

appointments,  namely  those  for  which  the  office-holder  is

appointed with the concurrence of the President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State lands form a substantial part of Singapore's past

reserves  which are to be protected under the Constitution.   An

important  aspect  of  protecting  land  as  past  reserves   is

determining its fair market value.  Where land is sold  by  open

tender,  this  is  less of an issue.  But where  state  land  is

alienated  directly, for example, to statutory boards  like  JTC

and  HDB, rather than by open tender, it is the Chief Valuer who

decides what is the fair market value



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>



of  these  State lands.  If the Chief Valuer does not render  an

honest, unbiased opinion, reserves may be surreptitiously  drawn

down by this route.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President had expressed his concern last year to the

Prime  Minister  over  this issue.  The Government  studied  the

matter  and agreed with the President's observation.  It decided

to  amend  the  Constitution to make the Chief Valuer's  post  a

safeguarded appointment.  This amendment is provided  for  under

clause 2.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consequential amendment to the State Lands Act, to make

the  Chief Valuer a statutory office, is contained in a separate

Bill which will be taken up later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I wholeheartedly support the Bill.

It  is  gratifying to note that the Chief Valuer will be another

position that will be safeguarded in the Constitution.  My  only

concern  is that the proposed State Lands (Amendment) Bill  does

not  have details about his removal from the office in  case  we

find  that the person who is appointed is not suitable  for  the

job.   Because all we have is his remuneration and  other  terms

would  not  be altered to his disadvantage.  That  is  the  only

concern I have, Sir.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Chief Valuer's

appointment is a departmental appointment.  He is appointed like

any  other departmental officer in the civil service.  It is not

an  appointment for life.  If there is any reason  to  post  the

Chief  Valuer to some other appointment, we can do so,  but  the

President will have to concur.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Division will be taken to ascertain that the Second

Reading  of the Bill is supported by the votes of not less  than

two-thirds of the total number of elected Members of Parliament,

which   is  56  Members,  pursuant  to  Article  5(2)   of   the

Constitution.  Ring the Division Bells.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE ARMED FORCES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is the guarantor of

Singapore's  national  security.   A  strong  SAF   will   deter

potential aggressors and enhance our security,  thus providing a

stable  environment  for  the economy  to  thrive.   It  is  the

foundation  upon  which  Singapore  continues  to  prosper   and

progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capable SAF we have today is the result of years of

investment in people, doctrines and equipment.  We must continue

to  invest  in the development of the SAF if we are to  continue

peace, prosperity and economic progress in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, we must continue to attract good people to

join  the  SAF.   It  is with this objective in  mind  that  the

Ministry  of Defence commissioned a study by Towers  Perrin,  an

international  consultancy firm, to review the  entire  manpower

management system of the SAF uniformed officers.  Together  with

MINDEF,  Towers  Perrin  has looked into the  career  structure,

remuneration   package,   career  management   and   performance

management  of  the officers.  Arising from the  review,  MINDEF

will  implement a total revamp of the SAF career,  offering  our

officers  a first career that is both challenging and rewarding.

Amongst others, MINDEF will be establishing the new Savings  and

Employee  Retirement  Plan (SAVER Plan).  The  SAVER  Plan  will

replace the Pension and Contract schemes that are currently open

to  SAF uniformed officers.  Let me explain the rationale of the

SAVER Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the need to maintain a dynamic armed forces, the

SAF  adopts a policy to keep the SAF young.  A full career  with

the  SAF  spans  about 22 years.  This is long  enough  for  the

officers  to make a meaningful contribution to the  SAF  and  to

realise their full potential.  At the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>



time, it ensures a healthy turnover of leadership at every level

of  the SAF and ensures that the SAF has a sufficient number  of

officers  with the right training and experience to support  the

full  range  of  operational  requirements.   We  do  recognise,

however, that it can be very daunting for an officer to start  a

new  career in his mid-40s, particularly when there are  housing

commitments and the education of children to contend with.  This

deters  potential  recruits from joining  the  SAF.   Those  who

initially joined the SAF for the challenge and exciting  careers

it  has to offer are also tempted to leave earlier in their late

20s  and early 30s when they are better able to adjust to a  new

career outside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can never remove all the concerns associated with the

transition to a second career.  But we can make it less daunting

for  the SAF officers by minimising these concerns.  The current

SAF  Pension  Scheme, which was adapted from the  civil  service

Pension Scheme was designed to reward people who stay in service

until  they  reach  the age of 55 years or  above.   It  is  not

suitable  for  the SAF because of the shorter SAF  career.   The

SAVER  Plan  will give uniformed officers financial security  so

that they can concentrate on the professional development of the

SAF without having to worry about their second careers.  Through

this  Plan, we hope to attract good quality people to  join  the

SAF and to remain in the SAF for a full career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the SAVER Plan, MINDEF will contribute an amount,

based  on a percentage of the officer's monthly salary, into  an

account kept for the officer.  The funds in the account will  be

pooled  with other accounts to form an investment fund known  as

the  SAVER  Fund.    The  SAVER Fund will  be  managed  by  fund

managers  appointed  for the purpose.   Based  on  returns  from

investments,  dividends  will be credited  into  the  individual

accounts of each officer.  A SAVER Board of Trustees, chaired by

the  Permanent Secretary, and comprising senior MINDEF  and  SAF

personnel  and  successful people with relevant experience  from

the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>



and  private  sectors, will oversee the fund managers  with  the

help of investment advisors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAVER Plan will meet the varying needs of SAF officers

at  different stages of their careers.  The accumulated  amounts

in  the  SAVER  accounts will be made available to the  officers

progressively.  The longer an officer stays in service, the more

he  stands to benefit from his SAVER account.  By the end of the

officer's  career,  his SAVER account will provide  him  with  a

significant  lump  sum  to enable him to  transit  to  a  second

career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAVER Plan will be implemented with effect from 1st

April  1998 for all new uniformed officers.  Existing  uniformed

officers will be offered an option to convert to the SAVER  Plan

and have their accumulated benefits under their existing schemes

transferred to the new Plan.  The benefits they have chalked  up

will be transferred from Pension Fund to the SAVER Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will provide the legislative framework to

implement the SAVER Plan.  The Bill will also make consequential

amendments to the Pension Fund Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I rise in support of

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is the bedrock and indeed the vanguard of our

national defence policy and strategy.  Without a strong SAF, all

our defence planning will come to nothing.  The core or critical

element  in  the  SAF  is manpower, in particular,  the  officer

corps.   We must, therefore, ensure that at all times,  the  SAF

personnel  are  well motivated, ready and able  to  deliver  the

knock-out punch when the chips are down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF must, therefore, have good terms and conditions of

service  to attract and retain the best to shoulder the  awesome

responsibility  of being in the forefront of  our  defence,  and

being  entrusted with the training and command of  our  national

servicemen.  Over time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>



circumstances,  perceptions and expectations change.    And  the

SAF  must,  from time to time, review and adjust the  employment

schemes  to  bring  them  in  line with  the  prevailing  market

practices.   It is, therefore, timely as we move into  the  21st

century  that MINDEF is revamping the SAF employment system  and

introducing the Savings and Employee Retirement (SAVER) plan.  I

am  sure  it will be a real saver and will be very much welcomed

by  the officer corps.  The new scheme, I am sure, will keep the

SAF  young  and will, at the same time, meet the aspirations  of

the  younger  officers for a more defined and focused  route  of

advancement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to seek

some  clarifications and amplification from the Minister.   Will

the  officers  continue  to enjoy medical  benefits  upon  their

retirement  under  the SAVER scheme?  Will the savings  accounts

and  retirement accounts of the SAVER scheme be subject  to  tax

upon  withdrawal  of  the sums?  Will MINDEF  allow  progressive

withdrawals  from the various savings accounts  for  payment  of

housing instalments, as in the CPF accounts?  Will MINDEF extend

the SAVER scheme to the regular NCOs in future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the pension scheme is funded directly by the

Government.    The SAVER Fund is a separate fund established  by

the  Government  with its own set of accounts.  The  SAVER  Fund

will be managed, as announced, by a Board of Trustees, appointed

by   the  Armed  Forces  Council.   My  question  is:  will  the

Government ensure that these funds are well managed in terms  of

investments and returns, and the officers will enjoy good  rates

of  returns from the SAVER Fund, no less but, hopefully,  better

than the CPF rates?  Sir, if, unfortunately, the officer dies in

service,  will his family be given the benefits under the  SAVER

scheme?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I too support the

Bill.   I have a very simple question for the Minister.  I would

like  to find out whether there is a minimum service the officer

must  fulfill before he can enjoy the benefits under  the  SAVER

Plan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, I thank the GPC Chairman, Dr Ong,

for the support that he has given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has asked several questions. He asked whether the

officers  will  continue to enjoy medical  benefits  upon  their

retirement.  The existing medical benefits will not be  changed.

Existing  officers  will  continue to  enjoy  the  same  medical

benefits  while they are in service and when they  retire.   New

officers will also enjoy the same medical benefits that are open

to them now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the savings and retirement

accounts will be subject to tax.  The sum in the savings account

is a form of gratuity.  Like the present contract gratuity given

to  officers when they complete their contract with the SAF,  it

can  be withdrawn in full after 10 years of service.  Therefore,

like contract gratuities, it will be taxable when withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirement account is similar to the present commuted

lump  sum pension that is given out to retiring officers  today.

It  will, therefore, be treated like the pension today and  will

not  be  taxed if officers withdraw this when they  retire,  ie,

when  they leave the SAF after age 40 with at least 10 years  of

continuous  service.   If withdrawn prematurely,  the  money  is

treated like a contract gratuity and will be taxed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked about withdrawals from the SAVER accounts

for  payment of housing instalments.  Under the scheme, officers

may  withdraw  their money in the savings account  progressively

after  the  sixth year.  They can use the money as  down-payment

for  properties they wish to purchase.  When the SAVER  Plan  is

fully operational, MINDEF will further consider whether to allow

withdrawal  from  the retirement account to  help  officers  buy

their  homes.   MINDEF thinks that it is a good idea  to  unlock

some  of  the money in the SAVER accounts to help our servicemen

buy  their  homes.  It will provide security for  officers  when

they retire and will encourage more people to join and remain in

the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked whether the SAVER scheme will be extended

to regular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>



Warrant  Officers and specialists in future.  We  will  consider

this  when  we have gained sufficient experience after operating

the scheme for officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked how the Government will ensure that the funds

are  well  managed in terms of investments and that the officers

will enjoy good rates of return for the SAVER Fund.  The purpose

of  investing  the funds independently is to try   to  obtain  a

reasonable  rate of return for the funds and thereby making  the

scheme  even  more  attractive to  officers.   While  we  cannot

guarantee  a  minimum rate of return, we will invest  prudently.

To  this  end,  we  will  work with the professional  investment

advisor  who  will  help  MINDEF  to  work  out  the  investment

strategy,  advise  on the selection of fund  managers  and  help

monitor  the performance of fund managers.  We have also invited

several  top-level executives from the banking  sector  and  the

Monetary  Authority of Singapore to sit on the  SAVER  Board  of

Trustees.    This  is  to  inject  professional  expertise   and

experience in guiding investment and management of the money  in

the SAVER Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked about the minimum period of engagement. The

structure of the SAVER system is such that the longer you  stay,

the more is accumulated in the various accounts and the more you

can  withdraw.  And the shorter you stay, the less you get.   So

if  you  stay  for  a  very  short time,  you  get  very  little

additional benefit from that.  You basically get benefits  which

are equivalent to something like the full CPF  system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, Dr Ong asked whether the family of the

officer will be given the benefits under the SAVER scheme if the

officer  dies in service.  The answer is yes, the entire  amount

in his SAVER account will go to his estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THE CHAIR</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, the Budget

and the Committee of Supply debates have finally come to an end.

In  all  my  years in Parliament since 1984, this  must  be  the

longest  Committee of Supply debate that we  have  had  so  far.

Sixty-one  Members  have moved 465 cuts  in  this  Committee  of

Supply.  As a result, we had to extend our sitting days and time

by  more than two hours each day and also sat for an extra  day.

Two  Members accounted for 14% of the cuts,  although they  only

made  up 3% of those who have moved the amendments.   I want  to

congratulate them for their efforts which they have  put  in  to

make this Parliament session a memorable one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other Members who have made this session a

memorable  one,  and  I  leave it to you to  remember  them  for

whatever  reasons that you want to remember them  for.   Anyway,

let  me  assure Members that no prize would be given for  anyone

trying to break the record next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of this House, Sir, may I express our thanks to

you and the Deputy Speaker for having been so patient with us in

the  last two weeks.  For all of us sitting on two sides of this

Chamber, we have the option of leaving this Chamber whenever  we

think  of  a reason to do so, but that is not the case  for  the

Speaker  and  the Deputy Speaker when they are  sitting  in  the

Chair.   Once  again,  Sir,  thank you,  and  thank  the  Deputy

Speaker, for your indulgence and your patience.  [Applause.]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I put the question, may I just thank

the Leader for his words of comfort.  My Deputy and I would like

to thank hon. Members for their kind cooperation during the past

two  weeks.  I assure you that we have listened to your speeches

with great attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that several of you have had to suffer the pain of

the guillotine coming down on you rather unceremoniously mid-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>



way  during your speeches.  But let me, in turn, comfort you  by

saying  that no matter what the pain, the suffering you  endured

was  actually for the common good of all of us.  Thank you  very

much.

<div align="center"><b>PROJECTED DEMAND FOR UNIVERSITY GRADUATES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry   whether  he  will  make  available  the  methodology,

assumptions   and  computations  resulting  in   the   projected

requirement of 17,000 university graduates per year by Year 2000

to sustain economic growth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council on Professional and Technical Education (CPTE)

is   responsible  for  projecting  the  demand  for  university,

polytechnic   and  ITE  graduates.   It  adopts  a  demand-based

econometric model to project skilled manpower needs in the short

to  medium term, based on projected GDP growth rates and  labour

productivity.  Projections on demand and supply are derived from

production  functions and industry/occupation/education  profile

matrices.  The model is regularly refined to meet changing macro-economic  conditions. New variables and data are  considered  as

and when they are available and relevant to the model.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPTE uses the manpower projections as a planning guide to

identify  broad  trends  in the demand  and  supply  of  skilled

manpower.  This  is  validated by  feedback  from  industry  and

graduate  employment surveys.  These surveys serve as checks  on

the  demand  for  skilled manpower by different sectors  of  the

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is a highly technical subject, my Ministry will

brief  the  Member if she is interested in the  details  of  the

model.
