<br><br>"Dear Mr Speaker,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your letter of August 26 forwarding

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL DEFENCE CORPS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

(a)  what  is the present strength of  the  Civil

Defence     Corps     under     the     following

classifications: - (i) Reserves;  (ii)  Volunteers

in  training;  (iii) National  Service  Men;  (b)

whether  he  is aware that there is  considerable

dissatisfaction prevailing among the men



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Corps and potential recruits  as  regards

administration,  promotion and training;  and  (c)

whether  he will take all necessary steps  to  re-establish  the  pre-war esprit  de  corps  in  the

present Civil Defence Corps.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Answer to part (a), Sir. The

present strength of the Civil Defence Corps  under

the classifications mentioned is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserves - 736. These are volunteers who have

completed two years' service on the active list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volunteers in training - 135 on the active list

carrying  out  training service, and  736  on  the

Reserve list carrying out reserve training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Service Men - 1,145.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of dissatisfaction prevailing

among  the  men  or  the women of  the  Corps,  or

potential  recruits, but if the hon.  Member  will

give  me specific instances of the dissatisfaction

said  to  be prevalent, I will see that these  are

investigated forthwith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort is being made to establish a high

esprit  de  corps  in  the present  Civil  Defence

Services.  I  do not subscribe to the  implication

that  the present Corps is inferior to the pre-war

Corps in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Chief  Secretary please tell this Assembly why  is

the  strength of the Volunteers in active training

so small?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I should like notice of that question,

Sir.  The  strength  of  the Volunteers  naturally

depends from time to time on the number who  join,

and  I  think it may be that the large  intake  of

National  Service men may have had some effect  on

the numbers of Volunteers joining.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

a  report  I  have just received, it says  that  a

Volunteer is required to carry out a maximum of 60

hours'  training  per annum for a  period  of  two

years.  This  means that a Volunteer  has  only  a

training -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please, Mr Lee Choon Eng.

Please  ask  a supplementary question and  do  not

make a statement.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am asking

a question.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Carry on, Mr Lee Choon Eng.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> This means that a Volunteer

has  got only five hours' training a month. Is  it

the  opinion  of  the  Chief Secretary  that  five

hours' training a month is sufficient to qualify a

Volunteer?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not within the terms of the

original question, Mr Lee Choon Eng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT TRUST (LABOUR FORCE)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Mak Pak Shee</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing whether he is  aware

that  the  Chairman  of the Singapore  Improvement

Trust  has  issued instructions that  no  English-speaking person in the future will be employed  in

the  Labour  Force  of  the Singapore  Improvement

Trust; whether he will state the reasons for  this

apparent   discrimination;  and  what   steps   he

proposes to take in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  my information is that the Chairman  of  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust has  issued  no  such

instructions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TERM "SQUATTER" OBJECTIONABLE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mak Pak Shee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Mak Pak Shee</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,   Lands   and  Housing   whether   his

attention has been drawn to the fact that the term

"squatter" is objectionable to those who  can  not

accurately  be so described; and whether  he  will

arrange  that the term "Squatters" should  not  be

associated with the Working Committee which he has

recently appointed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the answer to the first part of the question

is "Yes"; and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



answer  to the second part of the question is  also

"Yes".



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

Minister  inform  this House what is  this  Working

Committee and when was it appointed?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, this Committee was appointed about a fortnight

ago  on  my  instructions, and the  object  of  the

formation  of  this Committee is to  go  thoroughly

into the question of those people who live in semi-permanent houses in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CITY COUNCIL HANDLING OF CONTRACTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. R. Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr A. R. Lazarous</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing what action  he  has

taken  in connection with the representations  made

in  writing to him concerning the manner  in  which

the City Council is handling its contracts and with

particular  reference to a matter  the  details  of

which had already been communicated to him.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the making of contracts is within the  powers

of  the  City  Council, and I have no authority  at

present  within  the provisions  of  the  Municipal

Ordinance   to  interfere  with  the  awarding   of

contracts by the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lazarous -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lazarous:</b> Could the Minister assure this

House that he would try and amend this Ordinance or

make  recommendations to effect necessary amendment

to meet such cases?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if the hon. Member who has just spoken  would

like   to  make  any  amendment  to  the  Municipal

Ordinance, he can do so; but at the present moment,

as you are aware, the question of local government,

which  includes the City Council, the  Rural  Board

and   the  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  is  being

deliberated   upon  by  the  Committee   on   Local

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Is the Minister aware that the Member

who  questioned  this  is  a  Member  of  the  City

Council,  and  has he directed the Member  to  find

redress in the City Council?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am aware that the questioner is a Member  of

the City Council, and with regard to my directions,

I think, as Members will be

aware, the question of redress was discussed by the

City Council at its full meeting about a week ago.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT GOODWILL MISSION TO INDONESIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like, with your  indulgence,

to  make  a  statement on the goodwill  mission  to

Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> By all means, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Hon. Members of the House are

aware that from the outset of our existence, it has

been  our  desire  to  send a goodwill  mission  to

Indonesia  to clear away what one newspaper  called

"the cobwebs of suspicion and antagonism" that have

existed  and  accumulated in  the  past  few  years

between us. We naturally had our trade relations in

mind,  for in seeking our basic aim to improve  the

standard of living of the people of this territory,

we  must  be  ever watchful to improve the  general

prosperity of the island. The inspiration  for  the

goodwill  mission, however, Sir, went  well  beyond

the question

of trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the principal objective of the people of this

territory - independence - is to have any real meaning,

we must now seek to lay the foundations of friendly

relations   which  will  transform  our   immediate

neighbours   into  our  allies  of   tomorrow.   We

recognise  the fundamental truth that  it  will  be

possible  for  us  to survive  and  prosper  as  an

independent  political entity only if we  have  the

active  and  full  and  friendly  support  of   our

neighbours and the British Commonwealth of Nations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Rendel Constitution does not permit

this  Government an active part in foreign affairs,

we,  the  elected  Government  of  the  people   of

Singapore, consider  it  our  duty  to   lay   the

foundation   today  for  the  foreign   policy   of

tomorrow,  with the full knowledge of Her Majesty's

Government,  from  whom  we  have  received   every

assistance in pursuing our policy of seeking closer

friendly relations with our neighbours



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the context of this desire on the part

of  the  people of Singapore to initiate close  and

friendly relations with its neighbours, that it was

natural   that   our  first  thoughts   turned   to

Indonesia,  our  closest neighbour  and  the  first

territory  in  this part of the  world  to  achieve

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Indonesian

Consul-General    in    Singapore,    Dr.    Hermen

Kartowisastro, and to the receptive attitude of the

Indonesian Government, we received an invitation to

send  a  goodwill mission to Indonesia between  the

9th and 14th September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should add that we kept the Federation

Government fully informed and, although because  of

the  manifold matters it had to deal with on taking

office  it  could  not  accept  the  suggestion  of

sending  a  full  mission  jointly  with  us,   the

Federation  Government sent  an  observer  and  its

blessings and good wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Djakarta, in Bandoeng and in Palembang the

Singapore  goodwill mission was received with  full

honours and every courtesy. The honour shown us was

an  expression of the feelings of friendship of the

great Indonesian nation towards its young neighbour

on  the  threshold  of joining the  brotherhood  of

Asian nations. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs,

His Excellency Ide Anak Agoeng Gde Agoeng, put it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indonesia is glad to welcome the first Chief

Minister of Singapore, a son of Singapore,  leading

the first elected Government of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are such close neighbours that we can almost

see  each other from our windows, and I assure  you

that  we have watched the course of development  in

the   next  house  with  great  interest  and  much

sympathy. We, who have already travelled  the  road

to freedom, now see Singapore taking the first long

step



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



in  the same direction, and it is our sincere  hope

that the journey will be continued and successfully

concluded.  We  hope that in the  not  too  distant

future  Singapore will join the ranks of those  who

are in control of their destinies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to consider from now how to lay the

foundations  for  a  close political  and  cultural

relationship.  One of the unexpected advantages  of

independence is that those who are independent  can

choose  their  own friends. We, in  Indonesia,  are

doubly  fortunate that in our closest neighbour  we

have also a good friend."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members are perhaps aware of the measure  of

agreement  achieved by the goodwill  mission.  This

was  incorporated in a joint communique issued  on

the 12th of September, and it contained nine points

which I shall read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"1. A full Economic Mission (jointly with the

Federation  of Malaya, if they so desire)  will  be

welcomed  by the Indonesian Government in  December

1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A working party will be sent by the Government

of   Singapore  (jointly  with  the  Federation  of

Malaya, if  they so desire) in the first  half  of

October this year for the purpose of: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) arranging the venue and date for a full Economic Mission; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) drafting the agenda of all subjects to be discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The Indonesian Government announced: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in clarification of their new Import Regulations, that there will be no

discrimination    against    imports     from      Singapore, including textiles;",



<br><br>and,  incidentally, Sir, the same was  declared  in

respect of our neighbouring island, Hongkong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(b) a temporary relaxation, at the urgent

request of the Singapore goodwill mission, of

the   ban  on  export  of  slab  rubber  from

Sumatra,  to  take  effect  as  soon  as  the

details are worked out by the working  party.

This  relaxation is without  prejudice  to  a

completely  new  approach  by  the   Economic

Mission; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that the matter of importation of dried fish

from   Singapore   is  being  sympathetically

considered  in  the  context  of  Indonesia's

obligations   vis-a-vis  other   neighbouring

countries. Details will be discussed  by  the

working party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Singapore Goodwill Mission announced that

it  will  sympathetically consider the question  of

reimbursement  in  Malayan dollars  for  Indonesian

fish  and  timber imported into Singapore,  and  of

transport  facilities for fish caught in Indonesian

waters,  and  will authorise the working  party  to

work out details.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Singapore Goodwill Mission reiterated its

assurance of full co-operation in establishing  and

maintaining normal, healthy trade relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Singapore Goodwill Mission, recognising

the  basic  importance of the payments  problem  to

Indonesia  and the part that a favourable  solution

can   play   in   stimulating  trade  between   the

respective countries, will examine at an early date

the   means   to  achieve  a  mutually   acceptable

solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Indonesian Government would welcome the

appointment of a Trade Commissioner to Indonesia at

an  early  date  to maintain the goodwill  achieved

during the recent talks and to serve as a permanent

liaison between the respective governments."



<br><br>I  would  add,  Sir,  that  he  was  not  referring

entirely to trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8. The Singapore Goodwill Mission stressed the

importance of closer relationships in the  cultural

and educational spheres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Singapore Goodwill Mission expressed its

deep  appreciation of the very friendly spirit  and

the  generous hospitality with which  it  has  been

received by the Indonesian Government."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to Indonesia without expecting anything

more  than to establish a friendly climate  for  an

Economic  Mission  and it is entirely  due  to  the

goodwill of the Indonesian Government that we  have

come back with an agreement so full of promise  for

our   future  relations.  One  concession  of   the

Indonesian  Government symbolises the goodwill  and

the friendship of Indonesia towards Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The export of slab rubber from Sumatra is

prohibited  because of two reasons. Sumatra  has  a

number  of modern factories which are quite capable

of  coping  with  the slab rubber  production.  The

Indonesian  Government  wishes  to  discourage  the

production of slab rubber in order to encourage the

production of the far more profitable sheet rubber.

Nevertheless, when we pointed out that the  ban  on

export  of  slab  rubber meant the unemployment  of

thousands    of   our   workers,   the   Indonesian

Government,  basing  itself  on  a  policy  of  the

desirability  of  helping a neighbour  in  time  of

need,  assured  us  that  it  would  relax,  though

temporarily, the ban in order to assist us. I  know

no more dramatic gesture to express the goodwill of

Indonesia to the people of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, in this House, as one privileged

to  be  the  chief  elected representative  of  the

people, to express to the Indonesian Government the

deep  appreciation of the people of  Singapore  for

the  reception accorded to the goodwill mission and

the  friendship  that Indonesia has  shown  towards

Singapore.  We who went to Indonesia as a  goodwill

mission  from Singapore have come back as a mission

full  of  goodwill for Indonesia. I should like  to

repeat   here  what  is  important  to  them,   the

assurance  I  gave,  that the  cornerstone  of  our

policy will be a sincere desire for close, friendly

and  cultural  relations  and  co-operation  in  the

maintenance of healthy legitimate trade  relations.

Singapore  seeks  to  serve its  neighbours  as  an

honest broker, an open market place, and a catalyst

of commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing more I would like to add, Sir.

The  House  will perhaps be pleased to  learn  that

there  is every possibility that the Federation  of

Malaya  will accept our suggestion that the working

party and the Economic Mission should be on a  full

Pan-Malayan basis.

<div align="center"><b>PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC SECURITY BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Emergency Regulations and their use during the past

few  years  have disturbed the conscience  of  many

decent  law-abiding citizens. We, as  the  people's

first  elected Government, in the policy speech  by

His Excellency the Governor on the first day of the

sitting   of  this  House,  undertook  to   examine

exhaustively  "the  Emergency  Regulations  with  a

view,  in  so far as is practicable, to  dispensing

with such powers as are no longer necessary and  to

the   exercise   of   powers  essential   for   the

maintenance  of law and order within the  framework

of normal legal procedure." We added, Sir, that "in

considering this matter, regard will be had to  all

the   factors  involved,  including  the  Emergency

situation in the Federation of Malaya".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, although we outlined our policy with

some caution, leaving ourselves room to retain such

powers  as confidential information which might  be

made   available  to  us  might  indicate   to   be

necessary,  we  were at that time - I  will  frankly

confess - of  the view that we could sweep  away  the

entire   structure  of  the  Emergency  Regulations

without endangering the fabric of security  of  the

people.  That  was  the 22nd  of  April,  1955 - five

months ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after His Excellency's speech, Sir, we

watched  efforts  to  fan  and  twist  a  perfectly

legitimate trade dispute at the Hock Lee Bus  Depot

into  an instrument for mob violence which exploded

in  the  horrible riots and brutal murders  of  May

12th.  That  was  our  first  introduction  to  the

technique of a group of hardened persons, loyal  to

a  foreign ideology of tyranny, who, without regard

to human suffering, seek the creation of conditions

of  chaos and the violent overthrow of a democratic

form of government, in order to bring the people of

this territory under their control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We next witnessed, not long after, another

legitimate  strike,  this  time  at  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board,  being twisted and tortured  in  an

effort to repeat the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



success  of  the Hock Lee riots. Strenuous  efforts

were made to paralyse our economic life. It did not

matter   how  much  the  pitiable,  misled   worker

suffered,  if  only these malevolent organisers  of

chaos  could  succeed in their aim of overthrow  of

the Government by mob violence and the creation  of

conditions which would bring about the supremacy of

their  brand  of ideological tyranny. But  for  the

existence  of some sincere trade unionists  in  the

Trades  Union Congress, in the Naval Base,  and  in

the  docks,  there could have been an even  greater

holocaust than the Hock Lee riots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a letter signed by the Member for Bukit

Timah  (Mr  Lim Ching Siong) throws light  on  the

conduct   of   these  pseudo-trade  unionists   who

organised  the  abortive illegal strikes - I  repeat,

illegal strikes - of last June. The letter was  typed

on  the head-note of the Singapore Factory and Shop

Workers'  Union,  149  Middle Road,  Singapore,  7,

dated 12th of June, 1955, addressed to the Manager,

Singapore  Cold  Storage Company, Limited,  Orchard

Road,  Singapore.  In referring  to  the  so-called

sympathy strike of the workers of the Cold Storage,

this is what it says:



<br><br>"Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to notify you that the action taken by

our  members  is not directed against your  Company

but  is  taken in support of the common demands  of

fraternal  unions  presented to the  Government  in

respect of detained unionists."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There we have, Sir, the naive admission by the

Hon.  Secretary - the  name is  Lim  Ching  Siong - the

admission that the workers are made to suffer,  not

in  pursuance of a trade dispute, but in  order  to

blackmail the people's Government by mob coercion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a technique, Sir, of the Communists

throughout the world to infiltrate trade unions and

to  work ostensibly for the welfare of the labourer

in  order  to gain his confidence. Then,  when  the

time  is  considered ripe, they sacrifice him.  The

Malays,  Sir, have a word for this type of  pseudo-trade unionists. They call them "topengs".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the trade unionists at that time who was

detained,  the House will remember,  was  Yong  Kok

Kim,  President  of that very union  of  which  the

Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



for  Bukit Timah was and is the Hon. Secretary. The

Communist  Party  aliases  of  Yong  Kok  Kim,   as

admitted  by him, were Sang Swee Sen, Ah  Yong  and

Yong Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Sir, is what the Member for Bukit Timah had

to  say about the detention of Yong Kok Kim. I read

from  an  article in the Straits Times  of  Monday,

July  11, 1955, headlined "JAIL ME TOO, SAYS  LIM".

It  is  cheap to shout to the bushes that  you  are

looking  for wars when it is known full  well  that

this Government does not arrest arbitrarily. Let us

see  what  the statement was that the  hon.  Member

issued.  In  a  statement  issued  from  the  Union

Headquarters in Middle Road, Mr Lim said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The abuse of power provided by the Emergency

Regulations  has  once more been displayed  by  the

arrest of Mr Yong Kok Kim."



<br><br>Abuse of power, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I", said Mr Lim, "share the same beliefs and

have  the same aims as Fong Swee Suan and Yong  Kok

Kim. I therefore challenge the Government to arrest

me too".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was July 11, 1955. On August 24, 1955,

Mr Yong Kok Kim was convicted in an open court  of

law  and sentenced to five years' imprisonment  for

terrorist activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of this statement of the Member

for  Bukit Timah - that he shares the same  aims  and

the  same beliefs as this convicted man - and in  the

light  of  the statements he has seen fit to  issue

criticising the present Bill, in lurid language,  I

think  it  is pertinent to enquire and to  ask  him

whether  he speaks as a man loyal to the democratic

process   and  to  the  people  and  territory   of

Singapore, or whether he speaks as a Communist  and

a   fellow  sympathiser  of  the  Communists.  That

question  was  once before addressed  to  the  hon.

Member  by  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary.  It  was

evaded  with the heavy-handed technique we know  so

well.  He  said,  "I  will not  answer  a  colonial

official."  Now,  I,  Sir, who have  the  privilege

today  of standing here in this House as the  chief

of the people's representatives, ask him to declare

himself,  so  that the people will  know,  when  he

speaks about this Bill, where he stands.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our examination, Sir, of the Emergency

Regulations,  we studied voluminous  memoranda.  We

received   top-level   representations   from   the

Federation of Malaya, and I spent some time in  the

Special   Branch  and  its  departments   examining

documents,  investigating  procedure,  looking   at

files, and talking to ex-terrorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the outset, it is important that the hon.

Members   of   this  House  should  know   of   the

representations  from  the  Federation  of  Malaya.

General Bourne, as Chief of Operations against  the

terrorists  in  the  Federation,  and  the  Defence

Secretary  of  the Federation emphasised  with  the

utmost  gravity that any relaxation on the part  of

Singapore   in  its  laws  against  Communism   and

Communists  would mean a stab in the  back  to  the

Federation. They said we would make of Singapore  a

rest camp and a rearming centre for terrorists  and

would create a wide open door for them to pour into

the Federation, so that in a matter of a few months

the  security position of the Federation  could  be

jeopardised. To us, Sir, on this side of the House,

and I hope to all in this House, the welfare of our

brothers  across the Straits is a  matter  of  very

real  and immediate concern. If there was no  other

reason,  that  plea was sufficient in itself,  Sir,

for  us to exercise the utmost vigilance for  their

protection. But that plea alone, the needs  of  the

Federation  alone, were not the sole  reason,  Sir,

for  this Bill. After what we believe to have  been

careful  consideration - anxious consideration,  Sir,

on  my part - in the light of the attitude with which

I  originally  approached the whole problem,  I  am

today satisfied that this law is essential for  the

protection  of the people of this country  and  for

its  nascent  democracy.  It  is  the  primary  and

supreme  duty  of a government to provide  for  the

safety and security of its citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1948 there has existed in this territory,

and  to a very far larger extent in the Federation,

a  subversive organisation inspired by an  ideology

of  tyranny and violence, which indulges in all the

techniques of murder and intimidation, and seeks to

overthrow the people's government of today,  as  it

sought to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



overthrow  the colonial government of yesterday.  It

does  not  matter to these people that if they  were

successful,  they  would bring  ghastly  misery  and

starvation  to the whole population of Singapore.  I

ask  this  House  to remember this:  Singapore  eats

because it serves the free world. If Singapore  were

to become Communist, we would cut ourselves off from

those whom we serve. We would be unable to earn  our

living,  and as we produce nothing, we would  starve

miserably and suffer even more than we have suffered

under  the  Japanese occupation. But that  does  not

matter  to  these  gentlemen of  this  international

subversive  organisation  that  seeks  to  bring  us

within  the fold of their tyranny - these people  who

pretend to seek the welfare of the common man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such an organisation existing and constituting

a  real threat to our security and to the safety  of

individuals,   the   question  remains,   Sir:   can

Government  protect  its  citizens;  can  Government

protect the country by use of the normal process  of

the law? Justice in our Courts, Sir, is based on two

fundamentals, as you are aware, and as  some  of  my

hon. Friends across the floor are aware. One is that

the honest citizen, who is in the great majority  of

the  population,  99 per cent, would  be  ready  and

willing to give the Police all information he has of

any  criminal activity. The second is that he  would

be  ready to give freely of his knowledge on oath in

open  court. Unfortunately, Sir, as Members of  this

House   are  fully  aware,  this  small  but   well-disciplined  group  of  hard  core  terrorists   has

succeeded  in  a  large measure in intimidating  our

population,  so  that  few of  them  will  volunteer

information,  and  none of them will  come  to  open

court  to  give  evidence  for  fear  of  his  life.

Furthermore, Sir, it often takes a very  long  time,

sometimes  years,  to  build up  a  picture  of  the

activities of terrorists. They have many aliases  as

Yong Kok Kim, the President of my hon. Friend across

the floor, had - several Communist Party aliases. They

have  a  technique of changing their home addresses,

and  changing their places of work, and you have  to

build  up  the  picture from statements  by  various

persons detained, who know only the aliases, and who

can give you certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



information;  but by the time the jigsaw  puzzle  is

complete,   some  of  the  persons  who   gave   the

statements on which the picture is built may already

have  been  repatriated.  Sir,  I  like  it  to   be

understood that under this law it is not a  question

of  imprisonment,  it  is a question  of  preventive

detention - detention  to prevent  conduct  which  may

gravely  prejudice the security and  safety  of  the

State and its citizens. Very often, Sir, we consider

that  the departure of the detainee to his place  of

original  birth would put him sufficiently far  away

from  us  to  render  him  innocuous,  or  at  least

harmless. In those circumstances, Sir, it  has  been

and   will  continue  to  be  the  policy  of   this

Government to repatriate as soon as possible as many

as  we  can.  These people having been  repatriated,

Sir, all we have remaining are their statements, and

these often give very valuable information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no government can abdicate its duty to protect

its  citizens, and since we cannot utilise the  full

magnificent judicial process and judicial  tradition

which  we  have for the trial of these individuals

who constitute a threat to our security, we have  to

seek extra-judicial means for our very survival, and

yet  give  the  maximum possible protection  to  the

citizens. Sir, in this search for a law to  fit  the

formula  of  the  maximum security for  the  citizen

within  the  context of the basic  security  of  the

country,  we have studied the laws of our neighbours

who have the same problems. I have supplied to every

single  Member of this House copies of the  Security

of  Pakistan  Act, the Preventive Detention  Act  of

India,  and  the  Public Order Preservation  Act  of

Burma. Each and every one of these laws of our great

neighbours   gives  powers  to  the   Executive   of

preventive  arrest and detention.  If  hon.  Members

have  studied these laws, Sir, they must admit  that

the  Bill now before this House is far and away  the

most  liberal, the most circumspect in every detail,

and  the  one that gives the greatest protection  to

the  basic rights of a human being. We, on this side

of  the  House, Sir, have striven with sincerity  to

give every possible protection to the honest citizen

from  the possible abuse of executive power,  and  I

venture  to say that we have done far more  in  that

direction,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



with  respect  to  our  neighbours,  than  all  our

neighbours  combined. They are far  greater  people

with  far  longer traditions of democracy  than  we

have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Indonesia, Sir, I naturally made

the  same enquiries. This matter has been very much

on  my  mind, and I learned that in Indonesia  they

have  a  law  known  as S.O.B. which  provides  for

preventive  arrest and detention.  Unfortunately  I

have  been unable to obtain a translation  as  yet,

but  I will certainly supply a copy to hon. Members

as soon as I can get it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government is only too anxious to give the

maximum  possible protection within the context  of

the  protection  of the people in  the  country.  I

understand that the P.A.P. and the P.A.P. - dominated

unions, startled by the evidence of which they were

in  ignorance - and, frankly, I have to confess,  of

which  I  was  in  ignorance  before - that  all  our

neighbours  have  these  laws  which  provide   for

preventive arrest and detention - have now  come  out

with  a  strange and a fantastic explanation.  They

say  it  is  quite  all  right  for  India,  Burma,

Pakistan and Indonesia to have these laws. They are

independent  countries, but we  are  a  colony.  We

should  not  have  any! A colony,  it  seems,  Sir,

cannot, must not, and should not legislate for  the

security   of   its  citizens  and  its   form   of

government. What a fantastic stand for a Party that

pretends  to hope one day to govern the  people  of

this territory!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been suggested by my Friend, the

Member for Bukit Timah, that this law will be  used

by this Government, Sir, to perpetuate colonialism!

I  am  happy  for the recent constitutional  crisis

because,  amongst  other things, Sir,  the  private

correspondence  between His Excellency  and  myself

was ordered to be published, and any person who has

read  that  correspondence knows that the Coalition

Government  and each and every one of  the  Parties

constituting  it,  and each and every  one  of  the

Members  on this side of the House, was  ready  and

willing to sacrifice himself in order to pursue the

principle   of  rapid  self-government   for   this

territory.  Anyone  knowing that  but  pretends  to

believe



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



that  this Government will use the law in order  to

perpetuate colonialism is defrauding himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been some criticisms - on the face

of them legitimate, and some of them, in fact, very

constructive - directed against this Bill. The first

one  I will deal with is that it seeks to make  law

for  three years what has so far been law for  only

three months at a time. In the past we had to renew

this  law  every  three  months.  The  question  of

renewal  of a law every three months was  based  on

the  concept of the existence of an emergency. This

Government,  Sir,  believes  in  facing  facts.   A

situation  which  has existed for eight  years  and

promises to exist for many more cannot be called an

emergency.  That, Sir, is a misnomer. It  is  today

part  of  the  fabric  of our  lives.  It  is  just

possible,  Sir,  that the amnesty  which  has  been

offered  by the Federation and ourselves may  bring

about  a  radical change in the situation. If  that

happens - I pray it happens - I will be only too  happy

to  review  the  situation and  to  remove  what  I

frankly admit is an inroad in the rule of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We of the Singapore Government offered the

amnesty  because  we hope to attract  back  to  the

normal healthy democratic way those who were  loyal

nationalists  but  who,  through  frustration   and

bitterness  and inability to improve  the  existing

conditions,  strayed into the camp of violence  and

tyranny.  We  are  not hopeful  that  international

Communism  will really relax its efforts to  obtain

by  violence, control of this strategic island.  At

the  same  time,  Sir, although we  cannot  see  at

present the end of the situation which requires the

existence  of this law, we wish to give this  House

an   opportunity,  before  it  is   dissolved,   of

reviewing the whole situation. This Government  has

never  avoided,  and so long as I survive  on  this

side  will  never  avoid its responsibilities,  and

instead  of  making it four years and "passing  the

buck" to the next government, we will have to  face

this  House,  at  least  five  months  before   its

dissolution, and review the situation. That is  the

reason  for  the  three-year  period.  It  is   not

intended as a permanent measure, but it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



is  not  conceivably a palliative for three months.

Let us face it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second criticism, Sir, which has been

levelled  at the Bill is that the power  to  order

detention has been given to the Chief Secretary,  a

colonial  official. We did consider that before  we

drafted  the Bill, and it seemed to us  a  somewhat

invidious  position for the Judges  of  the  Appeal

Tribunal  to sit in judgment on a decision  for  an

order of detention of the Council of Ministers, and

we  thought that there was sufficient protection if

the  Council of Ministers could have the  power  of

review  every six months. This criticism, Sir,  has

come  from many sides - from perfectly decent people,

from the Press, and from some loyal trade unionists

whom  we have learnt to respect at a time when many

went  berserk. They have convinced us that, despite

the illogical position, it would be more acceptable

to  give  the  power of original detention  to  the

Governor-in-Council.  Hon.  Members  have  received

from me this morning notice of an amendment which I

shall  move at the Committee stage of this Bill.  I

have accepted and acceded to the criticism, and the

Bill now provides that not the Chief Secretary  but

the  whole  Council of Ministers will consider  the

reports before an order of detention is issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticism is that this power of detention

is  extended from that against persons  who  are  a

threat  to  public security, to persons who  are  a

threat  to  the maintenance of essential  services.

This   extension  which  follows  our   neighbours'

provisions  was introduced in order to protect  the

country  against possible acts of sabotage  and  in

order  to  protect the worker against the  type  of

illegal  general strike with which he  was  saddled

and  under which he suffered last June. We consider

that  the  worker  should  be  protected  from  the

"topengs",  the pseudo-trade unionists,  when  they

seek  to  sacrifice  him  and  the  community.   We

consider  that  the community should  be  protected

against illegal strikes in essential services,  and

the  operative word is "illegal". There  cannot  be

and  there  never  will  be  any  question  of  the

utilisation of these powers against persons who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



are lawfully pursuing their constitutional right to

strike after proper notice has been given, even  in

essential services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was an eye-opener to us - the general

strike  of last June. We all knew, the whole public

knew,   who   were  the  principal  and  ostensible

organisers of that illegal strike, and yet when  we

sought to obtain evidence in order to bring them to

court;   when  we  examined  more  than  70   trade

unionists for statements - though many of them freely

and frankly gave names and indicated in what manner

there  was intimidation and a threat to bring about

this   general  strike - not  one,  Sir,  would  give

evidence   in  public.  When  it  came  to   formal

statements for the Police records, they  said,  "We

went on strike because we felt like going on strike

that day! Nobody told us! We each individually just

decided that we wanted to take a holiday that  day,

so  we went on strike! That is all there was to it!

We just decided to go on strike!" Very clever. Very

clever.  And  we are being blamed today,  Sir,  for

seeking to protect the people from these who made a

laughingstock of the law, of the security  and  the

comfort of decent citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in answer to the fears of

responsible  trade unionists, I have already  given

notice  that I will introduce amendments to  clause

3, that I will delete the word "supplies", and that

I  will  define with precision the words "essential

services",  so that there need be no  fear  of  any

ambiguity.  The new clause, as it will be  amended,

is before hon. Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like to say a few words about the

protection  which this Bill gives to  the  ordinary

citizen.  Neither  my friends of  the  P.A.P.,  nor

those who are not my friends of the P.A.P.; nor the

unions  which called that absurd meeting on  Sunday

and  issued  its abusive memorandum, illogical  and

lying, which some have received today: nor even the

Progressive Party which in the past used  to  stand

for  the  progress of vested interests,  have  seen

fit,  Sir,  to  draw attention to the  immeasurable

improvements  we  have  brought  to  the   original

Emergency Regulations for the detention of persons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



suspected  of conduct prejudicial to the safety  of

this territory. It seems, Sir, that at least in this

city  and in this territory there is no such  thing

as  fair play in politics. We have been abused  and

maligned, but not one word was said, Sir, about the

successful   efforts   for   improvement   and   to

liberalise the law that now stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should in this House like to take the

opportunity,  which is mine, to draw  attention  to

these  improvements because it seems  to  me  that,

like   this  so-called  nine-man  committee   which

represents 80,000 people, it is just possible  that

hon.  Members themselves have not read the Bill.  I

have  already  drawn  attention  to  the  amendment

making  it  necessary  for  the  whole  Council  of

Ministers  to  decide  on  the  original  order  of

detention. There is no such safeguard in any  other

law of preventive detention, past or present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to give the citizen the greatest sense

of  security possible, Sir, this law requires  that

the Appeal Tribunal should consist of three Judges,

men whose traditions of impartiality, integrity and

responsibility   through  the   decades   in   this

territory  have earned the respect of every  single

member of every community. It is three Judges, Sir,

who will form the Appeal Tribunal. There is no such

protection in any other law in any other  territory

which provides for preventive detention and arrest.

The  Appeal  Tribunal, Sir, if  it  considers  that

there  is  not  enough  evidence  to  justify   the

detention,  can order the release of the  detainee.

That  order  is  final.  It  does  not  matter  how

dangerous the Government or the Special Branch  may

think  a  man  is. If the Tribunal of three  Judges

orders his release, Government must obey. Under the

Emergency  Regulations and under the  laws  of  our

neighbours, the Appeal Tribunal can only advise the

Government. The Government retains the final say as

to whether it is to release the man or not. But we,

and I who have worked in our Courts, have so strong

a  sense of respect for the responsibility  of  our

Judges  that we are content and happy to leave  the

matter in their hands: and if the three Judges,  or

the majority of them, decide that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



man  must  be released, Government has  no  further

say.  This,  Sir,  is  a  radical  change  in   the

principle   of  laws  of  preventive   arrest   and

detention.  No other country in the  world,  not  a

single   one   of  our  neighbours,  provides   the

protection to the detainee which this law does.  It

is  a malicious falsehood to suggest that this  law

gives  the Government power to arrest anybody  whom

it  dislikes - the  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar,  for

example - and keep him in prison on a free holiday at

the expense of the Government -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> With "Class A" rations!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I shall bring you some

titbits, myself! Sir, even if the Tribunal confirms

the  order  of detention, the three Judges  of  our

Courts - not ex-Judges, but serving Judges - even if

that   Appeal  Tribunal  confirms  the   order   of

detention, it is the duty of the Government to  see

that  within  six months - and in these six  months - a

Reviewing  Officer, whose qualifications  are  such

that  he  himself  could be a  Judge,  reviews  the

history  of the detainee and reports on it  to  the

Council  of  Ministers, and it is the duty  of  the

Council  of  Ministers every  six  months  to  look

afresh   at  the  case.  The  Ministers   are   not

permitted, Sir, by this law to forget for a  moment

a man they have detained. There is no other country

in  the world, not one of our neighbours, which has

laws  of preventive arrest and detention which give

this    additional   opportunity   and   additional

protection to a detainee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it proper, Sir, that I should inform this

House,  or perhaps remind it, that this Government,

of  which  I  have  the  honour  to  be  the  Chief

Minister,  has used the Emergency Regulations  with

circumspection,  that the majority  of  the  people

detained  have been or will shortly be  brought  to

court, and that the large majority of the remainder

have freely admitted to being members of subversive

organisations  and  have been  repatriated  or  are

awaiting repatriation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may mean nothing to hon. Members across

the  floor,  but to the public which  has  seen  us

struggle to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



utmost  of our power for its welfare, to the people

of  Singapore  I  give  this  assurance,  with  all

solemnity, that this Government, and so long as I am

Chief Minister, will exercise its powers under this

law - if    it    becomes   law - with    the    utmost

circumspection  and  with  the  keenest  sense   of

responsibility to the individual as well as to  the

State. Our conscience is clear. We have acted  with

honesty and sincerity to protect the welfare of the

people  and of the individual. Though we  unhappily

find  it necessary, Sir, in the light of experience

to  perpetuate  the  law of preventive  arrest  and

detention, we have so improved it that I  would  be

content  to  live under it, even if the Member  for

Bukit Timah were Chief Minister!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Judges will be changed!



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I am interested, Sir, to hear

that  comment. I am told by the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  that the Member for Bukit Timah will  change

the  Judges!  I can only say: Shame on the  P.A.P.!

Shame on you, Sir!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not been slow to accept criticism and to

benefit  by  it, as is proved by the amendments  of

which  I have already given notice, and many  other

amendments  which I shall bring,  not  of  a  vital

character,  but  which will certainly  improve  the

Bill,  when we reach the Committee stage.  I  would

like  to say, Sir, in this instance at least, I  am

grateful  to  the  Press and to  the  Trades  Union

Congress for constructive criticism, some of  which

has  been most helpful. It is because we hope  that

hon.  Members across the floor will  also  show  a

spirit  of  constructive criticism which will  make

this  Bill  as  nearly perfect  as  possible,  that

Government  has decided not to take  the  Committee

stage today. We would like, if it is possible,  the

Opposition   to   consider   with   a   sense    of

responsibility  amendments which can  improve  this

Bill.  We, who have done our utmost, do not pretend

to be omniscient, Sir. We would be glad to consider

each  and every suggestion, and would gladly accept

any  improvements  which do not destroy  the  basic

needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As guardians, Sir, of the safety of the people

and  the democratic form of government, which alone

can  assist  us to a full and fruitful development,

we bring this Bill asking for the weapons necessary

for  the discharge of our duties. You cannot refuse

your guardians the necessary weapons. The people of

Singapore  must  be  protected  against  those  who

would, with violence, trample on their interests in

pursuance  of  a loyalty to a foreign  ideology  of

tyranny. Those who refuse the Government the  power

to  protect  the  people will stand self-condemned.

The people of Singapore may be illiterate, Sir, but

they  are  not fools and they will not  forever  be

fooled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proud to have sloughed away many of the

provisions  of  the  Emergency  Regulations.   What

remains is essential. It is with a heavy heart that

I  introduce a Bill, Sir, which does not completely

remove the existing inroads in the rule of law as I

had  hoped  in  the early days of my government.  I

believe this law is necessary for the protection of

the  people  of  Singapore and the  people  of  the

Federation of Malaya whom we should never forget. I

commend this Bill, Sir, to the honest attention  of

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Southern Islands):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support  the  motion standing in the  name  of  the

Chief Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to speak on the relative merits

and  demerits of the Emergency Regulations. As  far

as   the   Alliance  is  concerned,  our   platform

indicates that the Emergency Regulations should  be

amended at the earliest possible moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we must remember is that our island is

gradually  forging ahead towards  independence.  We

are  faced  today,  not  only  with  the  power  of

colonialism, but also with other factors which  are

just  as  bad as colonialism. If we desire to  free

ourselves  from  colonialism, we  must  also  guard

against attempts by these other factors which  will

no doubt try to bring about another



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



form  of colonialism that would be with us for  the

rest of our lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Piah Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Piah Teng (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  we all agree that every person regards human

rights   and   personal  liberty  as   sacred   and

inviolable.  Consequently  any  legislation   under

whatever  title - whether  Emergency  Regulations  or

Preservation  of  Public  Security  Ordinance - which

contains provisions interfering with or restricting

such  rights  is undesirable. We intensely  dislike

such interference or restriction. At the same time,

we  also  intensely abhor the causes which make  it

necessary    to    introduce    such    restrictive

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know why the Emergency Regulations were

introduced  and  how  they  were  operated  to  the

dislike  of the people. How certain parts of  these

restrictive  Regulations were removed not  so  very

long  ago,  and  how quickly the same objectionable

parts   had  to  be  re-introduced  by  this   same

Assembly!  In giving an account of these events,  I

am not saying that the reasons for the introduction

of the Emergency Regulations and those which led to

their  re-introduction not very long  ago  are  the

same, but they both result in the loss of life  and

property and are detrimental to the peace and order

of this Colony. I am confident that every Member of

this House, as well as the public, abhors violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are considering whether it is possible

to  pass  a  Bill or Bills for the preservation  of

public   security  which,  we  are  assured,   when

accepted,  will result in the repeal  of  the  much

disliked  Emergency Regulations, but which  contain

some  of  the objectionable features found  in  the

Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I express my opinion on this Bill or

Bills,  I feel it is my duty, first of all, to  ask

myself  whether  the causes which were  responsible

for  the introduction of the Emergency Regulations,

and  the factors which are responsible for the  re-introduction  of  certain  objectionable  parts  of

these  Regulations that have been repealed earlier,

have now com-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



pletely  disappeared. I am  not  a  member  of  any

political  Party,  hence I  am  not  bound  by  any

political  programme;  but in  the  light  of  past

events,  the  state of affairs in the  neighbouring

territories,  and the as yet unpredictable  results

of  the  amnesty, I regret to say  that  I  cannot

convince myself that this country can do away  with

some of the provisions in the law to maintain peace

and order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not, for a moment, pretend that this

legislation  will serve as a cure for  such  evils.

No,  no.  The  remedy lies elsewhere. It  can  only

serve  to prevent outbreaks of grave and unforeseen

incidents;  nor do I suggest that such  law  should

have  provisions  giving unlimited  powers  to  one

single  executive to do anything he pleases without

any safeguards whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a lawyer, so I do not pretend to know

the  extent  of  the implications of  some  of  the

provisions  in the Bill. As far as I  can  see,  it

gives  very  extensive  powers  to  the  Executive.

Fortunately we have several very eminent lawyers in

this  House. It is therefore my hope that when they

examine  this  Bill in Committee,  they  will  only

retain  such  powers  as  are  necessary  for   the

preservation of peace and order. They should see to

it  that  the  rights of the workers in  legitimate

trade  union  activities are not  interfered  with.

Subject to suitable amendments along these lines, I

support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we have heard what the Hon. the Chief Minister

has said this morning. Sir, as a trade unionist,  I

cannot but express the alarm of the trade unionists

in   this   Colony.  The  Labour  Front   Coalition

Government  has come into power because the  people

had  placed  their  faith  on  the  programme  they

promised  to carry out. One of the central features

of  their  programme was the Emergency Regulations.

These   Regulations  were  imposed  to   meet   the

political conditions that arose at the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, Sir, most of us in this

House - I  am  afraid  I have got  to  say  with  the

exception  of  the  Progressive Party - realised  the

feeling of the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



in this country on the Emergency Regulations. These

Regulations were no longer serving the  purpose  of

saving  the country from a grave political  crisis,

but  were,  in  fact,  a fetter  on  the  political

development  of  the people in this country.  Trade

unionists and freedom fighters were fully alive  to

this threat of the Malayan freedom movement and  to

ordinary   trade  union  activity.   The   colonial

Government  was struggling to convey the impression

that  they were helping the people of this  country

towards  self-government, and were encouraging  the

development  of trade unions. I say "struggling  to

convey  the  impression" because  they  desired  to

maintain themselves in this country by the  use  of

the power of the Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Labour Front Coalition Government is in

power,   but  under  a  very  different   political

situation. We have today people who are  no  longer

afraid  of  fighting  for their democratic  rights,

people  who  no longer intend to live in servility,

people who will no longer submit in silence to  the

threat and coercion brought upon them by this piece

of legislation. What is most important, Sir, is that

our   people,  who  stood  together  against  these

Emergency  Regulations, have sent to this  Assembly

House  today  their representatives  to  carry  out

their election pledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Labour Front came into power, it was

faced  with  difficulty - problems of the  riots  and

general industrial unrest. In fact, as an aftermath

of the elections and the release of energy, and the

feeling of greater hopes after the years under  the

Emergency  Regulations, the riots in May this  year

seemed  almost  inevitable. Industrial  unrest,  of

course,  has not ceased and is not likely to  cease

as   long   as   conditions   of   employment   are

unsatisfactory.  With  a greater  volume  of  trade

union  activity  and the determined  stand  of  the

workers   to  improve  the  conditions  of  living,

industrial unrest will continue to exist unless, of

course, the Government is able to carry out  social

and  economic  reforms  in  the  interests  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these Bills before us today are a great

threat to trade unionists who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



determined to fight and to secure better  terms  of

employment for the workers. Trade unionists are  no

longer  silent and submissive, and to add to  this,

we  have the threat of new legislation which is, in

fact,  no different from the Emergency Regulations.

Such legislation can easily be interpreted by trade

unionists  as  being  in  the  interests   of   the

employers.  The  views of genuine trade  unionists,

who  are truly representative of the workers,  have

been frequently expressed during the past few days,

and I am sure that the Government is aware of these

views. As a method of expressing their views,  they

have sought to raise a hue and cry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am against the imposition of new legislation.

If  our cries should pass unheeded, I would like to

remind Members of the Government that they will  be

taken  to task in the future on the election pledge

they made to the public early this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only last night the Naval Base Labour Union

deplored  this Security Bill. Outside this Assembly

House now, officials and members of the Naval  Base

Labour Union are demonstrating against this Bill by

peaceful  picketing. At this stage, the workers  of

the  armed Services are presenting their grievances

to  the management. They cannot but feel unhappy at

the  legislation  which may be used  against  them.

Sir,  I have been directed by the Naval Base Labour

Union  to  state that the members of the Union  are

pledged to oppose this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Chief Minister, during his now very famous

election  campaign under the old  apple  tree,  had

said  many uncomplimentary things about the present

Emergency  Regulations. But there is at  least  one

thing to be said about these Emergency Regulations.

It  is  that  they  had to be renewed  every  three

months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has introduced into this House a Bill

which seeks to put into permanent form most of  the

objectionable features that are to be found in  the

Emergency Regulations. His excuse is that India and

Pakistan have enacted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



similar  legislation, and there is,  therefore,  no

reason  why we should not follow suit. May I remind

the  Chief  Minister that India and  Pakistan  were

never  oppressed with having to be ruled for  seven

years  under  Emergency powers  and  never  had  to

contend  with the position which faces  our  people

today?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Poppycock!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Legislation to protect public

security  did  not follow with indecent  haste  the

long  period of rule under Emergency powers.  India

and  Pakistan and our other Asian friends  did  not

have  to  suffer  the indignation of  seeing  their

Government  putting into permanent form  oppressive

legislation  which has occasioned a lot  of  public

criticism and public condemnation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill which we are asked to approve today

gives  the  Chief Secretary the power to detain  on

his own warrant -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> - any person who is suspected of

acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety  or

order  for  a  period not exceeding  two  years.  I

remember listening to the public speeches  made  by

the  Chief  Minister. He was against this  sort  of

thing  against  which he spoke with great  passion,

yet   today  the  same  Mr  Marshall,  now   Chief

Minister, seeks to ask us to approve what he a  few

months ago publicly condemned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party and I are opposed to the use of violence

in  any form. We have striven and will continue  to

strive  to  bring about desirable  changes  in  the

government  of the Colony by constitutional  means.

We  cannot,  however, subscribe to what the  Labour

Government is trying to do today - detention  of  the

people of Singapore on mere suspicion. May I remind

the Chief Minister that if he ever attempts to rail-road this Bill through this House today, he may one

day  have to answer for it? It may happen  that  he

will have to answer to the people of Singapore, and

under the very same old apple tree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



where  not  so long ago he denounced the  Emergency

Regulations and all the arbitrary powers associated

with them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am surprised  sometimes  at  the

ignorance  displayed  by certain  Members  of  this

House who come here with prepared speeches and talk

nonsense. They never read the amendments that  have

been explained by the Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> They do not even listen to speeches!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Yes, they do not even listen to

speeches! Thank you, Mr Chief Minister! They  come

to  criticise legislation that the Government seeks

to  pass  for the protection of the public  against

violence and victimisation by forces which seek  to

turn illiterate masses into mobs of violence. I  do

not  see any reason why any reasonable man, any man

who  values justice that has been practised in this

country,  could object to such legislation,  which,

as  explained by the Chief Minister, is  much  more

lax  than  legislation in other countries  such  as

India, Pakistan and Burma.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin

Ibrahim)  said that this law is a threat  to  trade

unionism.  I  do  not  see  how  legitimate   trade

unionism can be threatened by such lax legislation.

There is an assurance by the Chief Minister that no

legitimate trade disputes will be taken as  reasons

for  the Government to detain any person. There  is

also  the  criticism that this is but  a  political

fetter,  and I challenge Members of this  House  to

cite one instance where Government has detained any

person   who  seeks  to  fight  for  his  political

freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge hon. Members to study the Bill with care

and circumspection, and that all reasonable Members

will support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  rose by any other name smells just as sweet. The

restrictions  on  democratic  liberties  under  the

Emergency  Regulations are just as repugnant  under

any  other name. The claws of the beast remain  the

claws of the beast, whether in velvet



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



gloves or in silk gloves. For seven years now  the

forces  of colonialism in this country have sought

to  frustrate  the aspirations of the  people  for

democracy and political freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency Regulations were enforced by the

colonial  power  on  the  excuse  that  they  were

necessary for the suppression of Communism in this

country.  We  were  told  that  once  the   wicked

Communists   were  destroyed, good,   god-fearing,

democratic-minded and freedom-loving  people  like

our  Hon. the Chief Secretary and other executives

of  colonialism in this country would be  able  to

solve  all  our  political,  social  and  economic

problems   for  us.  But  after  seven  years   of

Emergency   Regulations;  years  of  arrests   and

detentions without trial; or banishment orders and

broken  families  and homes;  of  untold  miseries

suffered  by thousands of men and women; years  of

suppression  of the basic democratic  freedoms  of

speech, assembly, association and publication;  of

the  suppression of the intellectual liberties  of

the   people, - the  general  social  and  political

unrest  in  this country continues.  This  general

unrest  will  continue and even  grow,  until  its

basic cause has been removed. This basic cause  is

colonialism. If the general unrest, the political,

social and economic dissatisfactions are to cease,

colonialism must cease first. That is an essential

pre-condition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have the Emergency Regulations failed in

achieving anything at all, besides increased human

misery  and  suffering? They have  failed  because

they   do   not  provide  any  solution  for   the

political,  social and economic problems  of  this

country. These problems require political,  social

and  economic solutions - not punitive  or  military

solutions. The anti-democratic provisions  of  the

Emergency  Regulations and now of the  new  Public

Security   Bill  are  essentially   punitive   and

completely ineffective colonial remedies  for  the

deep-rooted   political,   social   and   economic

diseases  of colonialism. Colonialism and colonial

officials  cannot cure this disease, because  they

are  part  of  the  disease themselves.  The  only

solution for the disease of colonialism is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



ending  of  colonialism  and  its  replacement  by

complete political independence and full democracy

for the peoples of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colonial officials will, of course, claim that

they  are busy getting the people of this  country

ready  for freedom and democracy. I am not a  very

clever  person,  Sir,  like  the  Hon. the  Chief

Secretary, who can prove that black is white,  and

that Fascist laws and democratic laws are one  and

the same thing. I must confess that my Party and I

cannot  understand how the people of this  country

can  progress  towards  democracy  when  they  are

denied the most basic democratic rights. Only  the

wilfully  blind and the politically ignorant  will

claim  that the powers of detention without trial,

and   the   restriction  on  freedom  of   speech,

expression and assembly, have not had a repressive

effect   on   genuine  political  expression   and

development in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions on democratic liberties have always

got  a  political purpose behind them. Laws  which

deny democratic rights are valuable, for instance,

to   colonial   officials  for  the   purpose   of

intimidating  the  free  expression  of  political

views   which   are  contrary  to  the   aims   of

colonialism.   Such  laws  are  useful   for   the

suppression of political and social expressions of

popular  discontent  which are  dangerous  to  the

colonial system. They are also extremely useful to

those  who hate to see the emergence of  a  strong

and  genuine trade unionism in this country. There

is  nothing surprising or shocking about  colonial

officials who support these laws. Repressive  laws

are necessary for the preservation of colonialism,

and it is part of the duties of colonial officials

to pass such laws. But it is an entirely different

matter  for elected representatives of the  people

to  support  such  laws. Not only  must  they  not

support  such laws, but they must actively  oppose

Bills like the Public Security Bill. Failure to do

this will be a great betrayal of the interests  of

the people to the interests of colonialism. It  is

especially  true for hon. Members  of  the  Labour

Front.  The  Labour  Front  fought  and  won   the

elections on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



a   platform   which   condemned   the   Emergency

Regulations  and asked for their repeal.  Everyone

knows  that  the  Preservation of Public  Security

Bill is the same old enemy of democratic liberties

in  a  new and more permanent disguise. The Labour

Front now preserves the restrictions on democratic

rights which they promised to repeal. It looks  as

if  the  Labour  Front  has changed  its  backseat

drivers! During the elections they behaved  as  if

the people were the backseat drivers of the Labour

Front.  It is right and honourable for the elected

representatives  of the people to  recognise  only

the  people  who  elected them as their  back-seat

drivers,  but the people appear now  to  have  met

with  a tragic rebuff. The Labour Front has chosen

the   forces  of  colonialism  as  their  backseat

drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ridiculous to talk of public security under

colonialism.  What public security is  there  when

members of the public can be arrested and detained

without trial? What public security is there  when

members of the public are denied their basic human

rights?  Let  us not be hypocrites!  Let  us  call

things  by  their correct names. The  Bill  before

this  House  today is not a Public Security  Bill,

but a colonial security Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Ching Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong:</b> The laws of colonialism are

meant  to protect colonialism, not to protect  the

people. Only a free and democratic Malaya can pass

a   genuine   Public  Security  Bill  which   will

guarantee   the  public  freedom  from   detention

without  trial  and the enjoyment of  basic  human

rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Chief Minister who once warned this House

against  the  hand of friendship proffered  by  my

Party, by referring to the Kiss of Judas, I  issue

a  challenge.  Will he explain to  the  people  of

Singapore,  "Whose one now is the Kiss of  Judas?"

As  far as my Party and I are concerned, we  shall

never  commit  the grievous sin of exchanging  the

people  as our back-seat drivers for the  colonial

officials who sit on the Government Benches.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> What about my question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that

this  House  wishes  to deny the  People's  Action

Party  time to consider the Chief Minister's  very

calculated remarks. I never like to speak in haste

and to regret things at some later date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the House wishes me to meet the ferocious

attack  by  the  Chief Minister  on  the  People's

Action    Party   straightaway,   may   I    first

congratulate him? I have always been an admirer of

his  tactics  in  Court, for  he  is  the  supreme

advocate of the strategy of attack when you are on

the  defensive.  If there is one  person  in  this

Assembly who today feels a sense of guilt - if he is

the  sensitive and honest politician that  I  have

always  believed  him to be - he must  also  feel  a

sense of shame, because he has not had the courage

to  put  his  powerful  and  persuasive  arguments

before the people who gave him the mandate to come

to this House to repeal the Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the basic political tenets of democracy is

that  a Party is elected on its election platform.

Of   course,   if   one  wishes   to   avoid   the

inconvenience of having to go back to  the  people

after  going back on an election pledge one  could

say, in a moment of flamboyance, "I would break  a

promise  if  it  were  in  the  interests  of  the

country."  To  commit  that heresy  would  make  a

mockery of democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole attack that the Chief Minister has

skilfully  directed does not explain  why,  if  he

honestly  and sincerely believes that he is  right

in  changing  his  mind, he should  not  take  the

people  into  his confidence, and put these  facts

before  them. Let him ask for a mandate  for  this

most  important of all the Labour Front's election

platforms - a  mandate for the Emergency Regulations

to  be attired, not in a policeman's uniform,  but

in the Chief Minister's bush jacket.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the Public Security Bill is

but  an alias for the Emergency Regulations. There

are  some  modifications and some amendments.  For

example,  from  a Review Committee  to  an  Appeal

Tribunal;  from one Judge with a panel of  laymen,

to  three  Judges;  from a Judge  who  could  only

recommend,  to three Judges who could  order.  But

none  of  these things can explain away  the  fact

that  what the Labour Front is seeking to do today

is  something quite contrary to what they told the

people  they  were going to do. That is  the  most

serious political mistake that any political Party

can  make in this part of the world. There is  one

thing  which we must prize above everything  else.

If we condemn the Communists for being hypocrites,

for  being  thugs, for being rogues who intimidate

other people, then let us be honest Democrats. Let

us  face the world and face the music, if we  find

out  that  we  have made a mistake, as  the  Chief

Minister has said he has.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were a good actor like the Hon. the Chief

Minister,  I  could feign surprise  and  righteous

indignation  at  this  blatant  attempt   by   his

colleagues   and  himself  to  cloud   this   very

important  constitutional principle  by  launching

into  a  tirade against Members of my  Party,  and

reciting  a  slanted account of the  now  familiar

events  of  the  Hock Lee riots  and  the  general

strike. If I were David Marshall, Sir, which I  am

not, I would have thought that the honest thing to

do  would  have been to go back to the people  and

say,  "When  we drafted this election platform,  I

was   away  learning  Socialism  in  England.   My

colleagues  in  Singapore,  even  more   political

innocents  than myself, were trying to outbid  the

People's   Action  Party.  They  wrote  in   their

platform that they would repeal the whole  of  the

Emergency  Regulations when  the  People's  Action

Party, with care, circumspection and deliberation,

said  they  would repeal the Emergency Regulations

which  provide  for  arrest and detention  without

trial, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly  and

freedom  of  publication." If the  Chief  Minister

today  accurately  represents  the  feelings,  the

temper  and  the  views of the  people,  then,  no

doubt, he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



and  his colleagues would be returned with greater

strength and greater confidence. They would have a

mandate to go through with this legislation; and I

and  my  Party,  if we were also returned  by  our

constituents, would have less reason to doubt  the

political integrity, if not the sagacity,  of  the

hon. Members on the other side of the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago, the Chief Minister himself let one

of the biggest cats out of the political bag when,

in  a moment of anger and bitterness, he recounted

how a colonial Governor tried to inveigle him into

a  conspiracy  to cheat the people.  The  colonial

Governor  invited  him  to  repeal  the  Emergency

Regulations.  Then they, the colonial  government,

would re-impose them under the Governor's reserved

powers.  The Chief Minister, his sense of  decency

rebelling  at  this indecent suggestion,  said  he

would not cheat the world in such a way as to make

it believe that he was an honest democrat, and the

Governor  was - if I may quote the words of  another

publication  which  we  have  all  received   this

morning, a memorandum which the Chief Minister has

referred  to  in slighting terms - "the vicious  and

repugnant" instrument of oppression.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are now being asked to elevate rules and

orders  under the Emergency Regulations, from  the

lowly  status  of  Emergency  Regulations  to  the

resplendent status of being part of the normal law

of  the land. The reason advanced is that this  is

necessary   to  combat  Communist  terrorism   and

subversion.  Sir,  no  one denies  that  there  is

Communist terrorism or subversion. When any "ism",

be it Communism or Fascism, resorts to violence or

terror, it must be resisted. But we are at the same

time  being asked to believe in democracy. We  say

we  believe  in democracy because  it  is  a  more

liberal and a more civilised way of life.  We  say

we  dislike Communism because, under that form  of

government, they have arbitrary powers  of  arrest

and  detention without trial. They  have,  what  we

fortunately  so  far have not got here,  arbitrary

powers  of physical liquidation without trial.  So

we are told that the democratic way of life is far

superior. Yet, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



over eight years now the British and their friends

have  gradually worked themselves into a frame  of

mind  when,  in  the name of democracy,  they  can

introduce  every rule and every order which  is  a

complete denial of the basic tenets and beliefs of

democracy.   That   I  think   is   the   greatest

psychological  defeat suffered by the  British  in

this battle between the two fanaticisms



- Communism and anti-Communism. We, in this part of

the  world, I think, could profitably avoid  being

implicated  in this clash of fanaticisms,  for  as

long as it is possible. There are other people  in

Asia, far more knowledgeable in these matters than

colonial  officials like the Chief Secretary,  who

believe in dynamic neutralism -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The countries in Asia have

not got this law.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, when the Indian Government

in  1950 passed their Act, they had a mandate from

the people - and that is a great difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Ha!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> A colony cannot legislate

against  rape and murder! Only the free  countries can!



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Chief Minister has a

colourful inclination towards colourful metaphors.

We are not saying one should not legislate against

rape and murder. In fact, the Chief Minister would

have  the support of the People's Action Party  if

he decided to bring further penalties against rape

and  murder, if it were found to be too  prevalent

in this part of the world. But -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Not for public security!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - But, Mr Speaker, Sir, what the

Chief  Minister  does  not  realise  is  that   an

independent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



government, which has the  freedom  to decide its own destiny, has the right, through its elected  representatives, to  choose  any  way  of

life - any rule of law under which they should live.

But  in  a  Colony  where  the  circumstances  are

different, where the people have never been  given

the  power  and their elected representatives  the

right  to  decide their own destiny, I say  it  is

morally  wrong to do what the Chief  Minister  now

seeks to do. What he is seeking to do in the  name

of  democracy is to curtail a fundamental  liberty

and  the most fundamental of them all - freedom from

arrest  and  punishment without having violated  a

specific  provision of the law and being convicted

for  it.  Of  course,  the  Chief  Minister  could

quibble and say, "After all, it is not punishment;

it  is not imprisonment; it is detention under the

most  benign  and  kind conditions."  But  no  man

should be deprived of his liberty. It may be  that

such  a  liberal way of life does not  and  cannot

exist  in  conditions in South-East Asia.  But  if

that  is so, then let the Chief Minister at  least

have the courage to go back to the people and tell

them so, and seek a mandate to do what he wants to

do. I am sure he will understand that it is better

done that way now than deferred for three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important observation which the Chief

Minister  has  allowed to drop from  his  lips  is

that,  after eight years of the Emergency, we  are

faced with a problem as grave and as acute as when

it began. It is the most conclusive proof that the

Emergency Regulations are not the answer either to

Communist  terrorism or Communist subversion.  The

Emergency    Regulations   have   not    destroyed

Communism,  but it may well destroy democracy.  It

has  not completely frightened the Communists, but

it  may  act  as  a  dampening  restraint  on  the

nationalists. Of course the Chief Minister has not

given  his assurance to me personally that I would

not  suffer  under  these Regulations - but  we  all

believe, at least we all should believe,  that  as

long as his Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



is  in control, conscientiously, scrupulously, and

honestly  working these rules and regulations,  no

one  will be penalised or made to suffer who  does

not deserve to be penalised or made to suffer. But

he  has  not said what would happen if,  in  fact,

these  special powers were not used with the  same

scrupulous  care  and regard for human  values  as

they are -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Three Judges!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Three Judges! Great play has

been  made  of  three Judges! But  I  should  have

thought  that purely counting by numbers  it  does

not get us very far! One good judge is as good  as

three.  If you have one good judge and you  put  in

two bad ones, I should have thought you would have

lowered  the  mean average! But what does  it  all

prove? It only proves that three Judges can  order

a   man's  release  against  the  wishes  of   the

Governor. It is an advance, I am not denying that.

It  is  better than what it was before,  when  one

Judge  could not order but could only recommend  a

man's release. There will be three Judges who  sit

and  receive evidence in the absence of the person

against whom the evidence is being given,  and  in

the  absence  of  his counsel. I think  the  Chief

Minister will be the first to admit that  it  does

not,  in  any  way, approximate to the  protection

which a trial by confrontation -



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Never pretend to!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not saying the Chief

Minister   pretended,  Sir.  The  Chief   Minister

pretended a lot of things this morning, but  I  am

not accusing him of this. I am pointing out to him

now  that  it  nowhere approximates  to  the  same

protection which he, as a criminal advocate,  must

know is of vital importance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after eight years of these Regulations, we

are  faced with the same conditions - and we are now

asked  to be more realistic and incorporate  these

Regulations  in a more permanent form for  another

three  years - we wonder whether it is  because  the

Chief  Minister  and  his  colleagues  expect  the

danger  to exist for another three years, or  that

only the Bill will exist for another three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



years.  If  the Bill is designed against Communist

subversion,  and  will be maintained  so  long  as

Communist subversion is present, then I  say  this

Bill   will  outlive  this  Legislature  and  many

Legislatures  to  come, for  Communism  is  not  a

passing fashion or a passing craze. It is  and  it

has  become the way of life of nearly half of Asia

and  a large part of Europe and we must understand

the basic causes of it -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fight it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Before you fight it, you must

understand  what you are fighting. It  is  no  use

saying that they are evil men out to wreck, out to

create  chaos, out to stir up disorder, or out  to

make  the  poor  worker suffer, when  you  do  not

understand, or attempt to understand,  why  it  is

that  they, and they alone, can work this  passion:

first,   for  freedom;  second,  for   their   own

political beliefs.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> They do not win such allies!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They do not what?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is a significant point, and

the  Chief Minister should think more of it:  that

nowhere  in  SouthEast Asia  is  Communism  more

successful   than  in  colonial   Indo-China   and

colonial  Malaya.  I  am not  saying  that  India,

Burma,  Pakistan and Indonesia have not got  their

own Communist problems. Communism, as I understand

it, and not only from textbooks, is a product  of

social  and  economic frustration and  discontent.

When  you have this social and economic discontent

and it is exacerbated by the irritants of colonial

control,  then you have a situation  growing  into

cancerous proportions. I am not suggesting that if

we are free tomorrow of the eminent members of the

civil  and legal services who sit with us here  as

of right under the constitution, we should be free

from all our troubles. But I do say that we have a

much  better  chance  of  resolving  the  internal

social  and economic discontent than we  ever  can

have now. To me, Sir, it is an act of faith. If it

does not work, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



what  can  work?  Violent military suppression  of

Communism? It has little chance of succeeding.  It

might  succeed in South America because it  is  so

far  away and it is such a different world,  where

dictators come and go. But Asia in revolt, Asia on

the march, is a very different proposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister, with his flair for colourful

metaphor, will appreciate this when I say that the

problem of Communist subversion and terrorism  has

become  a  cancer  in  our  body  politic.   These

Emergency   Regulations  at  best  can   only   be

barbiturates.  They numb the pain. They  lull  one

into  a  sense of security, into an illusion  that

perhaps, after all, the thing that causes the pain

is  not  there. But I myself would prefer  a  bold

cure. I would take one bold step to freedom.  Then

I say we have a fighting chance to resolve our own

social and economic problems when they are reduced

to  the proportions which they naturally assume in

any  part  of the world, for anywhere  social  and

economic discontent inevitably leads to industrial

and social unrest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that such a free government, speaking

for  the  people, deciding its destiny  absolutely

and  unreservedly, could drastically repeal  those

parts  of the Emergency Regulations which militate

against  the  fundamental rights of  human  beings

anywhere  in  the world. This would  not  lead  to

Communism  if such a step were accompanied  by  an

equally  bold  and  drastic  economic  and  social

reform. To shrug and doubt is to admit defeat. You

may  stifle political discontent, but it will come

out  at  some  subsequent  date  in  a  much  more

virulent  form. If we take our chance now,  I  say

Malaya  can  succeed  as an independent  and  free

democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emergency as a violent struggle is very

probably going through a decline, and a new  phase

of  bitter political struggle is opening up. If we

do  not  relax these Emergency Regulations with  a

relaxing  of this violence, then we are  admitting

to  ourselves  that we are irrevocably  wedded  to

what I am sure the Chief Minister will agree is  a

totalitarian method of government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> "Nonsense", Sir, covers up a

lot  of ignorance of many, many things. If  it  is

not  totalitarian to arrest a man and  detain  him

when  you  cannot  charge  him  with  any  offence

against  any  written law - if that is not  what  we

have   always   cried  out  against   in   Fascist

States - then what is it? I am sure the Minister for

Communications will be the first to say that  that

is  what is wrong with Communist States. Then what

is done in the name of democracy is right. When it

is done in some other name, it is wrong. But these

are  fundamental beliefs. They may or may not work

in  Asia,  that  no one can say. But  one  can  say

this:one must have the courage to make it work, to

try   it;   for  if  it  cannot  work,  then   the

alternative is one of constant suppression the end

of which no one knows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that for seven years now we have

developed  an  Emergency  mentality.  Many  people

believe that the only way to keep down any form of

agitation,  which anybody may have  exploited  for

their  own personal or political ends, is  by  the

use  of repressive laws, more policemen, and  more

arrests.  But  this  has been proved  false  after

seven  years.  I hate to think that after  another

three  or four years, or whenever it may  be  when

the  Chief  Minister decides to  go  back  to  the

people, that it is again to be proved false. It  is

such  a  futile answer to the Communist challenge.

If  we are to survive as a free democracy, then we

must be prepared, in principle, to concede to  our

enemies - even  those who do not  subscribe  to  our

views - as much constitutional right as you  concede

yourself.  My  plea - to  quote  from  sonic-one  in

another  context - is  that the  time  has  come  in

Malaya  for  an agonising reappraisal of  strategy

and  strength. To go on blindly in the  hope  that

somehow  or  the  other  suppression  can  prevent

latent  social, economic and political discontents

from  manifesting  themselves and  disrupting  the

structure of society is a piece of folly to  which

my Party does not subscribe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Chief Minister, before he launches into

another furious tirade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



against me and my Party, to think of the political

implications  it  has, first, on himself  and  his

Party,  and, second, on Singapore and  Malaya.  My

Party   believes,  passionately,  that  the   only

solution  is  a  hard one, where a great  deal  of

social  adjustments may have  to  be  suffered  in

order  that a more stable and a just society could

emerge  in  the non-Communist world in  South-East

Asia.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir,

there  is  to  me  a  most distressing  similarity

between the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan

Yew) and the Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching

Siong). I do not mean to imply, Sir, that they  are

both  Communists, but what distresses me, Sir,  is

that  they  are  both, and in at  least  one  case

wilfully, deluded about this self-created bogey of

colonialism.  The Member for Bukit Timah  has  his

mind  so  firmly  fixed  on  the  evil  doings  of

colonial officials - of those few of us who  survive

in this exalted Chamber -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Very comfortably survive!



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> - that he seems to be quite unable to

put  his mind at all on to the problems which face

the  Government of Singapore today and which  face

this  Assembly  today.  He, apparently,  is  quite

happy  to  face a situation in which, as he  says,

there will be continued general unrest because  of

the    basic   cause   of   colonialism.   Because

colonialism,  in his view, denies  the  people  of

Singapore  today their basic human rights,  he  is

prepared,  apparently, to continue,  from  day  to

day, allowing Singapore to continue in a state  of

unrest - a state of unrest which, if I know anything

about  it, so far from his trying to stop  it,  he

will  try  to inflame. So much for the Member  for

Bukit Timah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now how terribly similar is the attitude of the

Member for Tanjong Pagar! He treated us to a  long

dissertation on what he thought the Chief Minister

ought  to  do.  Fortunately, he is not  yet  Chief

Minister, and I, for one, and I am sure all  on  my

side  of  the House are quite confident  that  the

Chief  Minister  will  judge  what  he  should  do

without receiving free advice from the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Member for Tanjong Pagar, who enjoys, of course,

all the delights of play-acting in this House,  of

appealing  to  the  Gallery and  never  having  to

honour a cheque.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to revert, if I may, to the point that I was

going  to make which I feel is distressing and  is

dangerous. It is that while the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  understands  and sees  the  danger  of  the

Communist ideology, and is fully conscious of  it,

he  is,  in fact, I think, half fascinated by  its

dynamism and by its selflessness. But what does he

do?  All  he does is to tell us that the Emergency

Regulations and colonial methods will not stop the

Malayan  Communist Party in Singapore. Of  course,

they  will not. No one ever suggested they  would,

and  I  certainly  do  not suggest  that,  through

measures  such  as the Emergency  Regulations  and

these  new  Bills, we can root out Communism  from

the  body  politic  in Singapore.  Of  course,  we

cannot.  All we can do with these measures  is  to

try and stop it getting out of hand and to try and

take  away  its  most dangerous leaders.  But  the

basic  issue is the issue which must be fought  by

the   citizens  of  Singapore -  not  by   colonial

officials - but by the citizens of Singapore and  by

their  leaders, and by such people as  the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar sets himself out to be.  It  is

for  you  to fight this battle. It is for  you  to

capture  the minds and the hearts of the  citizens

of Singapore and to stop them being led away along

that  false  and  sterile  trail  which  leads  to

Communist  dictatorship which I know  you  do  not

want to see in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do warn you and all Members of this House, with

the  utmost sincerity, against being deluded  into

this idea that you can avoid being involved in the

struggle  between  Communism and  democracy.   You

cannot avoid it. It is here today. It is with  you

night   and  day.  Do  not,  I  beg  you,   delude

yourselves with some such extraordinary phrase  as

"dynamic neutralism".  There is not such thing  as

"dynamic  neutralism" in the Communist  philosophy

of  life which is challenging you today, here  and

now.  I say to you that if you wait,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



which is what the Member for Tanjong Pagar wants  to

do - he  says he cannot fight Communism until  he  has

got  rid  of colonialism; he cannot fight  Communism

until  Singapore has got independence - I say to  you,

you  cannot afford to wait. The struggle is here for

you  to  fight  it now, and the more vigorously  you

fight  it,  the quicker you will get independence - an

independence  which  is worth  while.  Do  not  give

yourself  the excuse of not being independent  today

to  refuse to do what is now your duty and what,  if

you  do not do it now, it may be too late to  do  in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

of  all the Bills that have been passed as law since

after  the  liberation, the Bill that  was  disliked

most  by  all  people was the one on  the  Emergency

Regulations.  We have today, of course,  the  Public

Security  Bill  which, if we boil  it  down  to  its

essence,  would  be  just  about  the  same  as  the

Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it has always been our view that

extraordinary  times need extraordinary  Bills,  and

extraordinary measures must be used to keep law  and

order.  Our  view,  however, is that  the  Emergency

Regulations,  or  the  present  security   measures,

should not be kept one day longer if necessary.  The

Emergency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



Regulations  were  a temporary  measure  renewable

every  three  months.  This,  of  course,  has   its

advantage.  Any  cases  in  which  Government  might

detain people might be brought up and aired, and any

grievances  that people genuinely  have  may  get  a

hearing.  The  Government also have to  make  out  a

case, when the life of the Emergency Regulations  is

ending  and it is time to have it renewed,  to  show

that the Emergency Regulations are still necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Public Security Bill is to be put on the

Statute  book  for a period of three  years.  I  say

again   that   measures  such   as   the   Emergency

Regulations   or  the  Public  Security   Bill   are

distasteful to the people. They are distasteful  for

various  reasons which I will try to explain  later,

but all are agreed that they are not a very pleasant

thing  to  keep. We governed Singapore  before  1948

with  no such rules, and I hope that there will come

the  day when we can remove all such Regulations and

return  to a normal life. To keep security  measures

on  the Statute book is something that nobody likes.

It  is  something that we would like to put  in  the

backyard, but putting it on the Statute book, making

it  law,  it  is  just like moving that  distasteful

substance into the house itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All people in Singapore and anywhere else value

freedom,  and  anything that is going to  take  away

personal  freedom from them will be distasteful  and

undemocratic. But I say, for a large majority of the

people,  we  need to have such measures  to  protect

them,  but people do not like it. I would  say  that

the people who say they are for it just tolerate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people who dislike such measures, I think, can

be classified under three categories. Obviously, the

first   category   of  people  are  the   subversive

elements.  They hate it, and they hate it  with  all

their might, and you know why they hate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of people would be, I should

say,  the ordinary citizens, probably connected with

trade  unions and respectable people. Some of  these

people, I should say, may have been called in by the

Special  Branch for interrogation. There  may  be  a

case  against them, but more often, as  I  know  it,

they are usually let off and, of course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



this Bill has given them the jitters that probably

they  will be the victims of interrogation by  the

police. There are grounds for their fears,  and  I

think  that the power that such measures as  these

Regulations give to the Government should be  used

most  sparingly,  especially with trade  unionists

who are trying to better the standard of living of

the  workers. They have legitimate reasons. If  we

can  prove to trade unionists that these  measures

are not against people doing the right things,  we

will  probably  win over a very large  section  of

moderately-minded persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the last category of people who dislike

these  measures would be the ordinary  men-in-the-street. They dislike them for this reason. We know

that  if  a  member of the subversive elements  is

hauled  in  and interrogated, and later  on  other

people  are called in to give evidence, they  will

do  so  on the quiet; but if you ask them to  come

forward to give their evidence on oath, they  will

cringe and they will suppress any information that

they  have.  The reason obviously is fear - fear  of

reprisal.   In  the  same  way,  the  peace-loving

citizens of Singapore are afraid of this, not from

the  subversive elements, but from the police.  We

know that the power might be given to the Governor

in  Council that the case might be handled by  the

Superintendent  or  Assistant  Superintendent   of

Police, but, invariably, the investigation part of

it  must  be  done by the rank and file.  I  have,

during  my  short term here, received a number  of

complaints  about  detectives  putting  fear  into

peace-loving citizens by telling them,  "You  play

ball  with us, otherwise we might book you in  for

this."  This is very serious, and I bring  forward

this  point of view because in the Public Security

Bill   there  is  power  given  to  the   ordinary

Inspector   to  search  a  house  and  arrest   on

suspicion.  I  believe that must be  rectified  to

make   it  safer  for  peace-loving  citizens   to

consider  that  their home is  their  castle,  and

unless there is very strong suspicion, this  power

should never be used at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just recently heard of an offer of

amnesty  offered by the Government  to  subversive

elements. What does this amnesty tell us?  Is  the

situation  getting worse, or is still  normal,  or

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



it  gone  better? It must have pointed to  one  of

these  three.  I should say that such  an  amnesty

offer  does indicate that the situation is getting

more  normal, because I should like to think  that

such  a  measure is indicative as being  the  last

round for subversive elements to come out so  that

we can again lead our normal way of life. If it is

going  to give us peace, as we hope it would  give

us  peace,  then I think to put this Bill  in  the

form  of the Public Security Bill for three  years

would  not be justifiable. We do not know  whether

this  Emergency situation will end in three months

or  in six months, or whatever time it may be, but

my  contention  is that the moment  the  Emergency

situation  eases, then we must let  the  Emergency

Regulations lapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comparing the two Bills - the established Bill,

which is the Emergency Regulations, and the second

one, this Public Security Bill - I would prefer that

the  Emergency Regulations remain as they  are  so

that we can have a review every three months.  You

will  gather, from what I have said, that  we  are

not  in favour of the present Public Security Bill

on  the point of the length of time and the  power

it  might give to the Police - especially the junior

police officers. This power, as I have said, given

to  them  must  be very carefully  considered.  An

experienced  man need not have much guidance,  but

raw  hands may sometimes provoke serious incidents

which  might undermine the faith of the people  in

the police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking in this trend because I feel that we

should  have  the  people  co-operating  with   the

police, and every step that we take should  strive

towards this end. I hope that the Government  will

consider  what I put forward to them in the  light

that it is for the good of all concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  proposed new legislation, as we  see  it,  is

merely  a  subterfuge to a large  extent  for  the

existing    Emergency   Regulations.   The    only

difference   which  I  welcome  as  a  substantial

improvement  is  that  an  Appeal  Tribunal,  with

apparent real power, will sit in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



place    of    the    Advisory   Committee    whose

responsibility  is to make recommendations  to  the

Governor  who may either accept or reject  them  at

his pleasure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that Government still

recognises  the need for Emergency powers,  and  by

introducing  the  proposed legislation  (which,  if

approved,  will be incorporated into  the  ordinary

laws  of the Colony) it seeks to retain these  oft-criticised  Emergency powers on  a  more  permanent

instead of a temporary basis, subject to review and

extension once in every three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in view of the several amendments

just  proposed by the Hon. the Chief  Minister,  in

view   of  the  Chief  Minister's  desire  not   to

legislate  the  Bill  today  but  to  put   it   in

Committee,  and  in  view of the  Chief  Minister's

assurance that further constructive suggestions and

criticisms   will   be   considered   and   further

amendments,  if any, and if desirable, be  adopted,

my Party will reserve our position until then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although I

am  a schoolmaster by profession, it is no part  of

my  normal duties to ensure that the Members of the

Opposition do their homework. They have  come  into

this Assembly today and, in their speeches, some of

them  have  given considerable evidence  that  they

have  not done their homework. They have apparently

not   read  the  Bill.  They  have  not  read   the

amendments.  They  have not even  listened  to  the

speeches  in  the Assembly, but still I  will  pass

this by because those things are in the public  eye

and will remain so, no doubt. But when they further

give evidence of having neglected their homework by

attacking  us  on  what they call our  pre-election

pledges   without  apparently  having  read   these

pledges or knowing what these pledges are,  I  feel

that  I  should help them to understand  what  they

have apparently misunderstood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Member of the People's Action Party said in a

speech  in  this  Assembly just  now  that  we  had

promised  that we would repeal the whole  Emergency

Regulations.  He is not in the room but  those  are

the words as I wrote them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>



down  from his very mouth. That is what he  said - we

had   promised   to  repeal  the  whole   Emergency

Regulations - and he then proceeded to  question  our

integrity because we had not done so. I think  that

he  went extremely far in questioning our integrity

and  later  the integrity of the Judges; as  indeed

the   People's  Action  Party  makes  a  habit   of

questioning the integrity of almost anybody who  is

not a Party member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, our pre-election pledges are contained in

this  little  booklet.  It  had  a  circulation,  I

believe,  during  the election  campaign  of  about

10,000  copies, but I still have a few copies  left

and if any hon. Member would like a copy I will get

it out of my bag and give it to him, and he can see

for himself precisely what we said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that some people did not have one

before.  [Interruption.] I am always glad to  do  a

little   bit   of  propaganda!  Now,  this   little

booklet - I had my share in drawing it up and  I  can

speak  with  some  authority on it - falls  into  two

parts. The first is our Principles and Aims;  those

were first published about this time last year  and

they  state  broadly our objectives as a  Party - our

principles and our aims. I will now read to you the

13th  point of the Principles and Aims.  It  is  on

page 2:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Page 2. The Labour Front stands for

investigation  of the working of the Emergency  and

Banishment  laws with a view to repeal or  revision

in  conformity  with basic concepts  of  democratic

justice and the actual needs of the country."



<br><br>I  repeat  once  again, "the actual  needs  of  the country".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Read the whole thing!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> In deference to my own side, I will read it once again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Labour Front stands for investigation of the

working of the Emergency and Banishment laws with a

view to repeal or revision in conformity with basic

concepts of democratic justice and the actual needs

of the country."



<br><br>That  is the first pre-election pledge dealing with

the Emergency Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will pass to the Four-Year Programme which was

published last Christmas. You can find it on page 6



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



under  10  (a).  The  heading is  "The  Repressive Laws":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The situation in Singapore does not warrant the

continuation of the Emergency Regulations and  the

Labour  Front  will  seek  the  removal  of   this

unnecessary  and undemocratic restriction  on  the

liberty of the people."



<br><br>"The  situation does not warrant this  unnecessary

restriction" - I hope you will pay attention to  the

wording  because that is not a categorical promise

to  repeal  the  Regulations.  It  is  a  definite

statement  that,  in a certain situation,  certain

action will be taken and if the situation changes,

the action will necessarily change too. We did not

say that we would repeal the Emergency Regulations

at  any cost. What we said was, "The situation, as

we  see  it  now,  looks good and  promising.  The

Emergency  Regulations  are therefore  unnecessary

and unwarranted."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition can, if they like - they have not

done  so - accuse us of being "political innocents"

and  of being unduly optimistic. They can say that

we  were blind to the real dangers around us. They

can   say  that  we  were  unrealistic  about  the

strength  of  the  Communist menace,  and  I  will

freely  admit  that  when we were  drafting  these

Principles  and Aims and this Four-Year Programme,

I,  for  one, did not foresee that riots would  be

fomented  in the streets of Singapore. I  did  not

foresee  innocent people would be beaten to  death

in  the  streets.  I  did  not  foresee  that  the

Singapore  Factory and Shop Workers'  Union  would

have  a  Communist as its President, nor  that  he

would  be  put into open court, prosecuted,  tried

and convicted. I could not foresee those things. I

did not foresee that a harmless schoolboy would be

shot down in the open street by a Communist killer

squad.  I  had not imagined that kind of activity,

but  it  happened.  We did not  foresee  the  full

gravity  of the attack that would be made as  soon

as  democracy  began to grow in strength  in  this

country. The People's Action Party may have  known

better. If so, I am afraid, in that case, I cannot

congratulate  them on their close acquaintanceship

with the forces of destruction. We did not realise

the  full  danger. We have had to learn by  bitter

experience. We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



can  be  accused of past optimism; but  I  do  not

think  we can be accused of lack of courage or  of

shirking the realities of the present situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this Government came into power, the

situation has changed in many ways. It has changed

very  much  for  the  better with  regard  to  our

prospects of early self-government. It has changed

very  much  for  the  better with  regard  to  our

prospects  for trade, particularly with Indonesia.

There  are  many points on which we  can  say  the

situation  is  much better. But we must  also  say

that  the situation is worse in this respect: that

the Communist machine has gone into action, as  it

always  does  go  into action when  it  sees  that

democracy  is  starting to grow up  and  establish

itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual need has arisen, and we must legislate

now  to  meet the actual need and not to meet  the

situation  of nine months ago. I do not think  the

Opposition will profess to say that the  situation

has  not,  in  some  respects,  deteriorated.  The

terrorist situation has not deteriorated. I  think

they will have to admit that. What they may try to

say  is  that,  in enunciating the principle  that

laws  are  not  eternal  and  that  laws  must  be

adjusted to the needs of the moment, they may  say

that,  in saying that, I am putting forward a  new

and unheard-of principle. They rather tend to talk

in  terms  of absolutes and to say that  democracy

resides  in  one particular law and that  kind  of

thing. Now, this is not a new principle at all. It

is  a principle which was accepted just now by the

Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong). He said

that  extraordinary situations need  extraordinary

laws.  It was a principle put forward by the great

Greek law-giver Solon more than two thousand years

ago,  and also by the Chinese teacher Mo Tzu about

the  same  time; but I expect that  those  classic

examples  may  not appeal to all  Members  of  the

Opposition. Perhaps they prefer to have the  words

of  the Soviet jurist, Krylenko. He has since been

liquidated,   but,  in  his  time,   he   was   an

established   authority.  He  said,  "At   certain

moments in history, we quite consciously sacrifice

all these guarantees" (that is, the guarantees  of

justice through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



normal  court  procedure) "to the  necessity  of  a

swift revolutionary struggle." The fact is that  we

do  not  admire the Communist model. We are against

it. We can take Mr Krylenko as a practical man. He

knew  the relative instability and unpopularity  of

his  government, and he knew that it was  necessary

to  defend  it. But the fact is that this principle

that  laws are not eternal - the principle that  laws

must  meet  the needs of the moment - is a world-wide

principle  which stands and will always stand.  The

question  is:What are the laws that are  needed  in

Singapore  to  deal with terrorism  and  subversion

today in 1955? That is the question we have to deal

with,  and the Opposition, in considering  it,  has

dismissed  it  with  a wave of  its  hand,  Saying,

"India,  Pakistan and Burma - Oh no, we  cannot  take

those countries as our models because they are free

democracies,  and  here we are still  tainted  with

colonialism!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They would not be here

otherwise!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Well, shall I give them another

example  from Russia? Would that be more acceptable

to  them?  At  least  no one will  claim  that  the

Soviets provide a model of free democracy. This  is

a  decree  of  December,  1934,  for  dealing  with

terrorism:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum period of investigation - 10 days;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused receives a copy of the charge only 24

hours before he is brought to trial;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is denied any right to defence;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is denied any right to appeal;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused is excluded specifically from any

possible amnesty; and finally,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sentence of shooting is to be carried out im

mediately after the trial is concluded.



<br><br>That  is  how  Big  Brother in  Russia  deals  with

anybody  who tries to rise up against him!  It  was

used in December, 1953, for the trial and execution

of  the  late  Mr Beria, the former  head  of  the

Soviet  Secret  Police. That is how the  Communists

rule  their own country. I do not hold it up as  an

example for this House to follow. I hold it up as a

warning  of  what  will be imposed  on  us  by  the

Communists  if they can get control. That  is  what

you  will have if you allow these subversive forces

to  catch  hold of the Government and  to  dominate

you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We here are not, thank God, concerned with

defending the totalitarian system in which unity is

imposed  by repression. Perhaps I ought to  digress

here  for  a moment because the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan Yew), coming  down  from  his

cloud  of  rhetoric, became rather  heated  on  the

question of what totalitarianism is. He appeared to

think that totalitarianism resided in some specific

item or law - which is a complete misapprehension. In

case  he  does not accept my word for  it,  I  have

brought in here a standard political dictionary  by

Theimer  and Campbell - an encyclopaedia, in fact - and

if  he likes me to refer to it, I will refer to  it

for him. Briefly, I will sum it up by saying that a

totalitarian state is a concept which was coined by

Mussolini in the early 1920's, and it means a State

in  which every single activity, every association,

every  individual, and everything in the State,  is

welded  by  force  into a single monolith  directed

from  the  top. That is totalitarianism, and  every

activity, even the thoughts of the children and the

thoughts  of  the  adult, are subordinated  to  the

State.  For  a man who is respected and admired  by

many   people  in  this  city,  to  use  the   word

"totalitarianism"  and thereby to  seek  to  accuse

India,  Pakistan  and Burma, and  many  other  free

countries  of  being  totalitarian,  is   to   talk

nonsense. I would not put it more highly than that,

but   I  would  suggest  to  hon.  Members  of  the

Opposition  that when they use words,  they  should

use  them with respect for their meanings, and they

should   not  try  to  arouse  feelings  by   using

emotional words when they know very well that those

words would not, in fact, hold water -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

Would  the  Minister for Communications  and  Works

describe  the  laws  that I  have  referred  to  as

democratic?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is a point to which I am coming,

Mr  Speaker, if the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  can

contain his impatience for a moment. I shall arrive

at  that  in  due course. I said that we  were  not

concerned   here  with  protecting  a  totalitarian

system,  but  we are concerned with protecting  the

strong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



growth of a young democracy in a country which  is

moving  very rapidly towards self-government;  and

it   is  precisely  because  democracy  and  self-government are growing and strengthening every day

here that the Communist attack is now unleashed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget the precise words of the Member for

Tanjong Pagar, but he said something to the effect

that  Communism has been more successful in  Indo-China  and Malaya than it has been anywhere  else,

and   he  argued  that  that  was  because   other

countries  were free and we are still  a  colonial

country.  I endorse a good deal of what  he  said,

but  I  suggest that he remember this:  that  when

Burma  cast  off  the colonial  system  and  freed

itself  from  imperialism,  it  was  then  that  a

Communist  walked  into the Cabinet  Chamber  and,

with  his  tommygun, wiped out  practically  the

entire  democratic government of  Burma.  That  is

what  the  Communists will always seek  to  do  to

democracy.  They know that they have  no  hope  of

winning  power by democratic methods, and as  soon

as  democracy looks strong, they set out  to  kill

it.  That  is  what will happen here as  democracy

grows stronger here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another People's Action Party statement on the

26th  of  April cried out, with an  air  of  great

conviction,   that  no  law  should  hinder   free

association, free speech and free publication, and

that  no  consideration of security  should  weigh

against the principle of freedom. That was said by

the Member for Tanjong Pagar. He is a lawyer - and I

am  told he is a very able one - but he showed  less

than the legal precision of thought when he sought

to proclaim the principle of absolute unrestricted

freedom - for anybody to say anything he likes;  to

publish anything he likes; for any group of people

to  associate  together for any  purpose  to  take

joint action of any sort -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information,

Sir. Is the Minister for Communications and Works

aware that there are ordinary laws regulating what

can   be  said  within  the  law,  when  one   can

foregather and assemble for -?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> That is not a point of

information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is he aware of it?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. The Member for

Tanjong Pagar means elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I am aware of it. [Interruption.] The

point at issue is the matter of a speech which was

made  on the 26th of April. I do not think we need

dally any longer over it. As I read it, it appears

to me to be using words in a very cloudy and vague

way,  as  the  People's Action Party  often  does,

because  they  feel that if they  become  precise,

they  have to say things they do not like. As long

as  they can keep broadly to absolute freedom,  it

is  all right, but when coming down to details, it

gets  more difficult. The fact, of course, is that

the hon. Member knows perfectly well, as everybody

knows  that  freedom depends on  law  and  not  on

absence of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this very Assembly, Mr Speaker, Sir, we meet

freely  for  democratic  purposes.  We  have  free

speech  and  what we say is freely published,  but

the  whole  freedom of working  in  this  Assembly

depends,  Mr Speaker, on our Standing Orders  and

on  the  very  considerable powers which  you,  as

Speaker, exercise under the Standing Orders.  Hon.

Members  who  do  not know their  Standing  Orders

should  look  at pages 16 and 17 where  they  will

find  that Mr Speaker has powers without  appeal;

not  merely  to  say, "Sit down", but  to  control

people, to suspend them and even, if necessary, to

remove  them  by  force from the Chamber  if  they

behave in a grossly disorderly way. If this honourable,  learned  and  respected  House  cannot  run

freely  without  having controls -  very  arbitrary

controls - in  the hands of Mr Speaker to  suppress

any  individual or individuals who  behave  badly.

then I think it is fair to say that the government

of  a country must also have reasonable powers  in

order  that  it should also be able to  deal  with

people  who  are setting out to subvert  democracy

and to destroy freedom.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make is that to abandon

the  rule of law in the name of theoretical freedom

will, in fact, often make freedom impossible, and I

am  sure that when the Member for Tanjong Pagar and

the  Member  for Bukit Timah come down  from  their

rosy cloud of rhetoric to the cool thought which  I

hope  they sometimes take, they will realise  that

law  is  the basis of freedom and not the enemy  of

freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party habitually prophesy

that  dire  calamity will follow  if  anybody  does

anything  that  the People's Action  Party  do  not

like.  The  Progressives  have  sometimes  shown  a

tendency  to  blow other people's trumpets  and  to

borrow  other people's clothes, and they  sometimes

try  to  follow the People's Action Party  line.  I

must,   however,   congratulate  the   Member   for

Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) who made undoubtedly

the  best  speech we have heard from the Opposition

today  by  a  very long way. Although the  People's

Action  Party  prophecies  have  almost  invariably

proved wrong in the past, they still fret and fume

and  cry havoc. They still bellow out, "Freedom  is

in  danger! Trade unionism is in danger! Everything

is in danger! Vote for the P.A.P.!" It is true that

there is danger, but the danger does not lie in the

direction  which the P.A.P. seeks to indicate.  The

danger  does  not stand in the open light  of  this

Assembly   and   in  the  open  workings   of   the

Government. The danger lurks in the backstreets and

in  the  lorongs;  in  the network  of  underground

subversion;  in intimidation by word and  deed,  by

threat  and  by  murder. The  danger  lies  in  the

deliberate  dissemination of hatred,  distrust  and

falsehood,  as  conscious and purposeful  means  of

political action. It is to defeat that danger  that

this Bill is necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I take another People's Action Party

argument  to the effect that we have had for  seven

years  the Emergency Regulations and yet  we  still

have  Communist crimes. This proves that  the  best

thing to do is to give up the Emergency Regulations

because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



are  ineffective. But in the streets of  Singapore,

we  fairly often have traffic accidents. Is that  a

reason  for giving up the traffic laws? When murder

is  sometimes  committed,  is  that  a  reason  for

abolishing the Police Force? If we find  we  cannot

win  immediately, is that a reason for surrendering

at  once? A more ridiculous argument I have  seldom

heard!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perfectly true that the final answer to

Communist  activity lies in the  political,  social

and economic sphere, and if hon. Members would like

further  copies of our Four-Year Programme and  our

Principles and Aims, they will see that we  do  not

propose the Emergency Regulations as a single thing

but  that they are one small facet in a very  large

system -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> A very large facet in that

booklet!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> But large in the eyes of - [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. Please continue, Mr Thomas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, perhaps I might remind the

People's Action Party of a promise which they  gave

on   the   16th  of  May.  You  will   recall   the

significance of that date. There was a long  speech

dealing  with  colonialism and the  rights  of  the

people  that  desire freedom and so forth,  and  it

ended with this: "Give us our rights" (that is, our

rights  to self-government without British control)

"and  we  will  fight  Communism  and  defend   our

freedom."  Well, our Chief Minister  has  moved  us

very  rapidly towards self-government  and  towards

the  ending of colonial control. Will the  People's

Action Party carry out their promise? Will they  go

out  now  to the pickets in the streets  there  and

say, "We are opposing the Public Security Bill just

for  the  time being. As soon as we get free  self-government, we will support its imposition  if  the

situation  warrants it." Will you go  out  and  say

that -?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Did I say that just now?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> On May the 16th, you said that you

would  fight Communism to defend your freedom  when

you had your rights -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not believe outright

oppression will fight them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Nobody suggested that oppression is

the sole weapon. I have mentioned that before. I do

not  think  you  need be afraid  of  these  pickets

outside. I went out myself at twenty-five past  two

to  have a look, and I got very well booed  for  my

pains.  Though I stood there for some time,  nobody

noticed  me.  I  felt rather small and  unimportant

until,  finally,  the cheer-leader started  booing,

and off they went booing. People were booing loudly

and vigorously all around me, but they did not know

whom  they were booing. They did not see  me  until

gradually  their  eyes learned  to  focus  on  me - I

walked  forward a bit so that they could make  sure

they  knew who I was, and then, at last, the booing

began  to come into focus. For the first minute  or

so,  the  booing  was just booing for  the  fun  of

booing.  I do not think you need get frightened  of

them.  They  impressed me as a  very  friendly  and

jolly  lot,  and I am sure that if you go  out  and

speak  to  them honestly and truly, what  has  been

demonstrated in this Assembly; that their right  to

strike  has been guaranteed by the Chief  Minister;

and  if you say that this Bill will not be used  to

threaten them; and if you truthfully tell them what

the  safeguards  are,  I am  sure  that  they  will

understand -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why did you not try just now?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, please. I take it that the

Minister   is,  in  fact,  addressing   the   Chair

indirectly?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> My apologies, Mr Speaker, Sir. I am

being so much addressed directly myself that I  was

perhaps  forgetting myself and allowing my  remarks

to  flow  in  the wrong direction. I have,  in  any

case, arrived at the end of what I have to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will just conclude by repeating again that in

this  situation  in  Singapore today,  there  is  a

genuine threat, a threat which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



is clear and obvious, and it should not be twisted,

distorted, and misrepresented in the interests of a

temporary  political  popularity.  There  are  more

grave  issues at stake than that. There are  forces

in this country which could destroy it. We have our

responsibility to the people of the country, and we

should carry out that responsibility with the  full

sense  that  we  are trying to give leadership  and

guidance where it is very much needed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Theng Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Theng Chiang (Rochore):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  see  that the Opposition is almost unanimous  in

their  attack on the Public Security Bill.  It  was

only  to  be  expected and it is also natural  that

they  should  point out to us that, by  introducing

this  Bill,  we  are  going  against  our  election

pledges.  However,  none  of  them  has  taken  the

trouble  to  analyse  the causes  of  the  wave  of

strikes  we have had in Singapore since the  Labour

Front  took office some six months ago. No one  can

deny  that  some strikes at least are  inspired  by

forces  which do not have the welfare of the people

of  Singapore  at heart. Nor can anyone  deny  that

there are Communist sympathisers in Singapore.  Yet

when  the  Government took the opportunity  of  the

grant  of amnesty in the Federation to offer  local

Communists the chance to surrender themselves,  the

response has been practically nil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also escaped the notice of our opponents

that  Singapore  is still a Crown Colony  and  that

subversive  elements under the cloak of nationalism

are   fomenting  discontent  among   the   innocent

citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When sovereign Republics such as India, Pakistan

and Burma have such laws, there is no reason why we

in  Singapore,  while  we are  striving  for  self-government  and ultimate independence,  should  not

take  measures to maintain law and order,  so  that

the  colonial powers may not use any disorder  that

may  prevail  in  the  country  as  an  excuse  for

delaying  the grant of self-government. Anyone  who

cares  for the welfare and well-being of the people

of   Singapore  will  not  fail  to   realise   the

inconvenience and discomfort that they will have to

undergo  if  there is any disruption  of  essential

services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pledged to foster the growth of healthy

trade  unionism  in this country,  but  can  anyone

honestly   claim  that  all  trade   unionists   in

Singapore are working solely for the benefit of the

workers?  It  is  indeed  a  tragedy  that  certain

professional unionists have infiltrated  into  some

unions  with no other motive than to promote  their

own  interests  and  for their  own  glorification.

Until the workers realise that they are being duped

and  learn to manage their own affairs, it will  be

in  the  interests of the people if the  Government

take steps to ensure that they are not subjected to

unnecessary suffering.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House provides for safeguards

against  arbitrary  arrest and  detention,  and  if

anyone  is  subjected  to such  treatment,  he  can

appeal  to a Tribunal consisting of two High  Court

Judges  and  a  District Judge.  The  Judiciary  is

independent of the Administration and there need be

no  fear  that  such appeals will be treated  as  a

formality.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

our  Party, the Progressive Party, has always  been

realistic  in  our  policy  with  regard   to   the

Emergency   Regulations,  and  the   Minister   for

Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas)  paid

us  a compliment when he said, by implication, that

we  were  not such political innocents as  to  have

made  the mistake which he did when he drafted  the

Labour  Front platform, in thinking that  Singapore

was  ripe for the Emergency to be lifted. Not being

so optimistic and being too straightforward, we did

not  take advantage of the favourable winds created

by   the   shouts  of,  "Down  with  the  Emergency

Regulations!",  as a result of which  many  of  our

ships did not reach harbour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we do not have to borrow other people's

discarded  clothing. We are not  going  to  deviate

from  the  course  we have set ourselves  and  have

taken  so  far. We have supported and will continue

to  support the continuance of these Regulations or

other  similar laws so long as there  is  violence,

terror and fear in Malaya. But we must also re-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



member  that, as we have infringed upon the  rights

of individuals, we must see to it that no injustice

is perpetrated as a result of these Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much as I admire the Chief Minister's efforts to

safeguard  further the rights of the  detainees  in

that  they are now allowed to appeal to a Court  of

three Judges, whose decision is final and cannot be

interfered  with by the Executive, I am  unable  to

agree  to  the  surrender of our right  which  this

Legislature has retained for the last seven  years,

to  receive  the  report of Government  and  decide

whether  the  circumstances justify the continuance

of  the  powers of detention without trial. I  feel

that, as an elected Member of this Assembly, it  is

our  duty  to  decide  periodically  whether  these

Regulations have or have not been misused, and that

we  cannot  delegate this power to the  Council  of

Ministers.  I maintain that we should  not  deprive

ourselves  of  this power granted to us  since  the

inception of these Regulations by agreeing  to  the

provisions  of  this Bill to last for  three  years

instead of three months at a time.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, all the Parties

in  this  Assembly have given their  views  on  the

Preservation  of  Public  Security  Bill.   As   an

Independent,  I  know I can speak without  fear  or

favour,  without  affection or ill-will,  from  any

Members on both Benches -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I hear there is no favour

coming.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, I am very sorry indeed to say that

most  of us will miss the quarterly review  of  the

Emergency situation by the Chief Secretary and  his

brilliant  speeches  from  now  on.  I  take   this

opportunity of congratulating him on his efficiency

so  far in bringing to the notice of this House the

various  activities  of the terrorists  which  have

been prevalent in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I am bound by the mandate from my

electorate  who  have asked me to  convey  to  this

House  their demand to release all detained persons

up  to the time this Bill comes into law, and  thus

enable  them  to  repose  confidence  in  the   new

Government's  intention to  implement  the  various

provisions of the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



law. They have asked me to convey this message: the

people   who  are  detained  under  the   Emergency

Regulations are therefore eligible for pardon. From

now  on,  detentions and arrests will be under  the

provisions of the new Bill, and they will  have  to

wait  and see how far the implementation is carried

out  in  a  very fair way. I hope either the  Chief

Minister  or the Chief Secretary will  be  able  to

give them an answer in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been told, Sir, to record at this

sitting  the  views  of my constituents  that  they

believe in freedom and justice, and therefore  they

feel  that no person should be detained or arrested

without letting him know what the charges are. They

also  realise the present situation and  they  feel

that  some  sort of extraordinary power  should  be

given  to  the  Executive. They have  asked  me  to

convey  to  this  House  the  fact  that  they   do

appreciate the Government's move and that they have

no objection to my giving my approval to this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir. Could

I  ask the Member for Seletar, who brought us  this

very  interesting  message from  his  constituents,

whether he subscribes to their views or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I cannot understand which one. I think

I  have conveyed several messages. If it is for the

demand of the release of detained persons, Sir,  it

is   their   view  that  they  should  be  released

straightaway -



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Is it your view?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Whatever their views are, they are my

views as well.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, outside along the picket

line, the Labour Front has been described as trying

to  break an election pledge if we carry this  Bill

through today, and the hon. Members from the P.A.P.

have  tried  to  decry that we, who have  given  an

election  pledge,  are  now trying  to  break  that

pledge.  The Minister for Communications and  Works

(Mr  Francis  Thomas) read from this blueprint  of

the Labour Front, but unfortunately the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



Tanjong  Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) was not  here.  I

would therefore ask the indulgence of this House if

I  quote again from this blueprint of ours for  his

information and perhaps for his guidance -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You will be surprised! I have

studied it better than you -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Lim. I do not think I can

allow  a repetition of this nature. If hon. Members

choose  to be absent from this Assembly, I  do  not

think  they  should be apprised of  what  has  been

said.  If  the hon. Member now speaking  wishes  to

draw  the attention of the Member for Tanjong Pagar

to  this  particular point, I suggest that  he  lay

that booklet on the Table.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> He can read!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I wish to repeat this

point  in  order to emphasise once again  that  the

Labour  Front  does not break its election  pledge,

and I have that right -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have ruled that the Minister can

lay that blue book on the Table.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I was one of the members

who  sat  on this Labour Front Four-Year  Programme

and  it was I who was most insistent in wanting the

Emergency Regulations repealed because it was felt,

at the time when we were considering this, that the

situation  in Singapore did not warrant  a  continuance of these unnecessary and repressive laws. When

we  were returned to power, I was still of the mind

that  we  should  have  the  Emergency  Regulations

repealed, but in May, just one month after we  were

returned to power, Sir, our friends over there, not

all  may be, but our friends over there, with their

friends  in  the Bus Workers' Union  and  in  other

unions, were responsible for the riots of May  12th

and  responsible for the deaths of so many innocent

people. It is because of that, Sir, that I now feel

that  such Regulations cannot, and should  not,  be

repealed  in  the interests of public security.  If

there  is  any blame to be attached for introducing

this Preservation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



of  Public  Security Bill, it  is  because  of  the

activities  of people such as those represented  by

the other side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many trade unionists now say that this Bill

will react to the detriment of trade unionism,  and

yet,  Sir, since we came into power in April  until

now, there have been 213 strikes, 162 of which  can

be  attributed  to friends of the P.A.P.  Can  they

honestly   say   that  the  Emergency   Regulations

restrict  their activities? Can they  honestly  say

that?   In  1953  and 1954 - two  years - the  total

amounted  to  only thirteen strikes as against  213

within  five months this year! They say  that  this

law will restrict the freedom of assembly, and yet,

since  the  Labour Coalition Government  came  into

being,  we have, I do not know how many times,  had

pickets   outside  this  Assembly.  Is  there   any

restriction on the freedom of assembly? They should

ask  themselves  that, instead of coming  here  and

talking in high-faulting language about restriction

on  the freedom of trade unionists, restriction  on

the  freedom of association, movement and assembly.

I have received this morning a memorandum issued on

behalf of 94 trade unions at a meeting held in  the

premises   of   the  City  Council  Labour   Unions

Federation.  Can  that  Federation  say,   in   all

honesty,  that the Emergency Regulations  prevented

them  from  striking last year and this year?  They

cannot  say  that! Can they honesty  say  that  the

Emergency  Regulations were ever used against  them

in  their  strikes? They have never been used!  The

fact  is  that  their strike was  a  constitutional

strike,  and there was no reason why the Emergency

Regulations should be applied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another illustration, Sir. As the Chief Minister

has  said,  Mr Yong Kok Kim, who was the President

of  the  Singapore Factory and Shop Workers' Union,

was  charged  in open court and was sentenced.  Did

the  Government take any action against the  Union?

No,  he was charged not because of his trade  union

activities, but he was charged and sent  to  prison

because  of his subversive activities. So can  they

say   that  the  Emergency  Regulations   or   this

Preservation of Public Security Bill  is  aimed  at

trade unions? Definitely not!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This memorandum I referred to just now, Sir, is

signed  by  Mr Jamit Singh, Secretary  to  the  94

unions and Secretary of the Singapore Harbour Board

Staff  Association. They called a strike this year.

Were the Emergency Regulations ever applied in that

strike? No, they were free to strike and, in  fact,

they were even assisted in their claims by a number

of other unions. But did we take action against the

other  unions?  No, because those  activities  were

genuine trade union activities. Therefore,  I  want

to say again and I would ask our friends over there

to  search  their own hearts whether this  law  was

ever used against trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)

said that it would be better if we had stuck to our

Emergency Regulations and come back to the Assembly

every  three  months for renewal.  Sir,  the  Chief

Minister  has said that the security of the  public

is  not  an  emergency. Therefore it  is  wrong  to

describe that as an emergency, and this law that we

seek  to  introduce for three years does  not  mean

that  it  will live for three years. If a situation

arises where there is no further need for it, there

will  be no need to use the powers given under this

law  at  all. The Chief Minister says, "It  is  the

primary  and  supreme  duty of  any  government  to

provide  for  the  safety  and  security   of   its

citizens", and this Bill, Sir, seeks to provide for

that safety and security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chief Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> In reply, Sir. If it please

you, Sir, of all the speeches we heard this morning

from  the  Opposition, it seems to me the one  that

really  represents the feelings of the  decent  and

loyal citizens of Singapore was the one made  by  a

Nominated  Member, the hon. Mr Ong  Piah  Teng - his

repugnance, his keen anxiety, his gratitude for the

improvements    effected,   and    his    reluctant

acceptance.  I can assure him that, for  our  part,

there   is  no  question  of  being  pleased  about

bringing  before this Assembly and placing  on  the

Statute book the perpetuation of a law that  is  an

inroad into the democratic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



process.  There is no question about that.  We  are

not  proud  of having to do it, but in  facing  our

responsibilities, we do have to do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, much has been made, and that, to my

surprise, by the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew), including every member of his Party,  of

a  suggestion  that  I have broken  faith  with  my

electorate  and questioning my political integrity.

Sir,  it has been suggested that every time we want

a measure of this character, we should dissolve the

House  and  go  before the public  and  have  fresh

elections.  It may be that the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar is even a greater political innocent than  he

pretends  I  am,  but I must confess  that  I  have

never,  at  any  time, read  or  heard  of  such  a

fantastic procedure. I would say to him one  thing,

Sir - it  may be necessary for him and his  Party  to

indulge in that sort of conduct, but for myself,  I

do  not  have to wait till the end of the  term  of

this  Assembly  in order to face my  electorate.  I

face  my  electorate every day. Cairnhill  sits  in

judgment  on Marshall every single day. During  the

election,  and since then - last week was  the  last

time  I  reiterated it - I have made a solemn promise

to the electorate, which no Member opposite has had

the  courage to do, that if the time ever came when

half the voters in my Division decided that they no

longer had faith in me, they could ask me to leave.

Singapore  can  speak through Cairnhill  today  and

tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. I do not have

to go running to my electorate every time I think a

measure  is necessary for their welfare.  I  am  on

trial there every day. There can be no question  of

breach  of faith with my electorate. I do not  seek

this  position against the wishes of the people  of

the country, Sir, and I should imagine that if hon.

Members  opposite, one of whom my young friend  the

Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) has so

ostentatiously refused to answer the question as to

where  his loyalty lies - whether it is to Singapore

or  to  Communism - I should imagine that it  is  not

beyond  their  capacity to organise  a  petition - if

they really had any faith



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>



in  the suggestion that the people of Singapore  or

the  people  of Cairnhill would want to  reject  me

because of this law which I now think necessary  to

introduce  for their welfare. Sir, these gentlemen,

who  have  seen  fit to question my integrity,  and

particularly  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar,  have

indulged  in  a  bit  of  sophistry  that   it   is

impossible to square -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order, Mr Chief Minister. I think

the word "sophistry" is probably not parliamentary.

Will you please withdraw it?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Indeed, Sir, I do apologise

if   you   think  the  word  "sophistry"   is   not

parliamentary. I certainly withdraw it, but, Sir, I

would like to refer to the action of the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar  who, recognising the  existence  in

every   Asian  territory  of  laws  of   preventive

detention  and arrest, comes along here  and,  Sir,

may  I  use the word?, quibbles about the right  of

the Colony to pass laws for its protection. If that

is  the extent of the intellectual integrity of the

P.A.P., I do not admire it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I may take the speeches of the

Opposition in their order, the Member for Sembawang

(Inche  Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) - apart from this question

of  breaking my election pledge and the  threat  of

what   will  happen  when  I  face  my  electorate,

forgetting  that I face it every day - has  suggested

that  the  Bill is a threat to trade unionists  and

could  easily  be  interpreted  as  being  in   the

interest  of  capital.  Sir, the  Communists  could

interpret anything into anything as it suits  them.

Red is black and filth is something you can eat and

shove  down the throats of the poor workers.  These

are  men  whose hearts are pickled in  vinegar  and

whose  ears are deaf to decency. I will not try  to

convince them, and I do not care how they interpret

my  actions;  and  as  for the suggestion  that  we

threaten  trade  unions, it  ill  becomes  a  trade

unionist,  who must be conscious of the  way  trade

unionism has flourished in the past five and a half

months,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



to  make such a charge against this Government - five

and a half months, Sir. I agree, not previously -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Cannot give credit to them, can you?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Would you? The Member for

Ponggol-Tampenis (Mr Goh Chew Chua) had nothing to

say  but give a parrot repetition of the threat  of

what  will happen to us when we meet the people  of

Singapore.  Then  we come to the Member  for  Bukit

Timah  (Mr Lim Ching Siong) whose speech and whose

future speeches must now be viewed in the light  of

his  unhappy refusal to inform this House  and  the

people  of Singapore of where his loyalty lies.  He

has told us, Sir, that this is a colonial law, that

it is a betrayal of the interests of the people for

the  interests of colonialism, and that  it  is  an

enemy  of democratic liberties. Well, Sir, I should

like for a moment to envisage what would happen - and

I  hope  that  those who are from India  here  will

forgive me - if this were repeated in India which has

an  identical law. I take it then, by analogy, that

India  is  introducing and perpetuating a  colonial

law  for  the betrayal of the people of the country

in the interest of colonialism and that India is an

enemy   of   democratic  liberties.  It   will   be

remembered  that the Bill before the House  is  far

more  liberal than the law that has been and is  in

force in India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said, Sir, "What public security can

there  be  when a man can - be arrested and detained

without trial?" Has he stopped to think what public

security can there be when police officers  can  be

shot   to   death   and   witnesses   killed    and

intimidated - which  is  happening  and   which   has

happened - what public security can there be?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we come, Sir, to the pink barbiturates of

the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is good, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I do not care for drugs! He

asks how we expect to solve and cure Communism with

repressive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



measures when the past eight years have proved that

those measures cannot achieve that end. The answer,

Sir, is this: The Emergency Regulations of the past

and the Public Security Bill of today will not cure

this  country  of Communism. All it can  do  is  to

contain  it,  to lessen its possible  effect  until

such time as the tender growth of democracy in this

territory  is  sufficiently strong and  flourishing

that the forces of evil and their vitriolic hatred,

which  pours out of them like sap out of  a  rubber

tree,  cease to have the vicious effects they  have

in blinding the people of the country to their true

welfare. That is all this Bill is expected to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong) has

made  somewhat serious charges against  members  of

the  Police  Force and asks us to  view  them  with

suspicion. Sir, it is this Force which protects his

life,  his safety, his property and his honour.  It

is  this Force which makes it possible for him  and

for the rest of us in this country to walk about in

peace,  without fear of molestation, and I feel  it

comes  ill  to  make  accusations  of  so  vague  a

character  about the Force which has proved  itself

worthy  of our gratitude in times of stress and  in

times  of  peace.  If  he has complaints  with  any

basis, it is surely a matter of elementary courtesy

and  decency  that  the details  should  have  been

communicated  to the Chief Secretary or  to  myself

and investigated? I trust, Sir, that he will, at  a

not  too distant future, take an opportunity either

to   withdraw  those  unhappy  allegations  or   to

substantiate them. It is easy to attack  those  who

cannot hit you back, and I feel that that is not  a

gesture  which the Member for Serangoon would  care

to make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one novel suggestion comes from the Member

for  Seletar. He asks us now that we have got  this

new  Bill  to release the old criminals. I  do  not

know where the logic is, but I would like to assure

him  that his suggestion has certainly given me  an

idea  and  perhaps we can work it out in Committee.

Perhaps  we can work out, Sir, a provision  whereby

those who have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



detained  in  the  past  can  be  given  the   full

protection   of  the  provisions  of  the   present

Ordinance,  including the right of  appeal  to  the

Appeal Tribunal in spite of having failed in  their

past  appeals.  I am not promising anything  except

that  I  would like to consider that idea which  he

has given us today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final thing, Sir, and it comes as a surprise

to  me: it is that not a single Member opposite, in

considering the provisions of this Bill,  has  seen

fit  to  refer  to our duty to the Federation -  not

one.  The Federation, it seems, does not exist when

it  comes to indulging in political manoeuvring but

we,  On  this side of the House, have  a  sense  of

responsibility and we will not forget our  duty  to

those across the Straits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor has any single Member of the Opposition

suggested  how  we  can meet  this  threat  to  the

security  of  the  people  and  of  the  individual

without  extra-judicial powers. It is  so  easy  to

criticise  and it is distressing to see how  little

of what is constructive has come forward today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee stage, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Sir, the 12th of October.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, might I

enquire if it is possible to adjourn now instead of

cutting  up  my  hon. colleague's  speech  in  two

parts - there is only five minutes -?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Standing Orders do not provide for

that, Mr Chief Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> If it please you, Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is divided into six parts and

deals with a number of different



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



matters which, at first sight, bear little relation

one  to  another, but they do have this in  common.

They   are   all  measures  which  the   Government

considers    are   necessary,   in   the    present

circumstances in Singapore, to strengthen  the  law

against  those who seek to overthrow  the  lawfully

elected  Government by violence,  or  who  seek  to

subvert  the  minds of the people by  intimidation,

away  from  genuine  democracy  and  constitutional

advance to self-government, to the rule of fear and

to ultimate Communist domination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have this in common: that all are

measures  which we hope and believe  will  only  be

required  for  a  limited period, a  period  during

which  we hope that the citizens of Singapore  will

learn  by experience to distinguish between liberty

and  licence, between good leaders and bad leaders,

and  will  learn to see the dangers into which  the

Malayan  Communist Party and those  who  compromise

with them are likely to lead this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures, we think, are necessary during a

period   of   immaturity   in   understanding   and

practising  democracy  to  safeguard  us  from  the

dangers  that beset us on the path to maturity.  We

hope, therefore, that they will no longer be needed

after  that  period  and,  accordingly,  all  these

various  matters have been put together  into  this

one Bill which, by sub-clause 2 of clause 1, is  to

remain  in force for a period of only three  years.

As  the  title  of  the Bill indicates,  these  are

temporary additions to our criminal laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I of the Bill deals with definitions

applicable throughout the Bill and needs no further

explanation from me at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II is directed at the Malayan Communist

Party  and  its killer squads, who seek  to  impose

their  rule  by murder, arson and intimidation.  It

provides  increased penalties for those who  attack

life or property by the use of explosives, and  for

those  who  consort with them. It also  deals  with

those who furnish supplies to these people who seek

to undermine public security, and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



provides   penalties  for  the   making   and   the

possession  of subversive documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that this House will accept the necessity for these

admittedly stern measures in order to deal with the

ruthless  and  secret  activities  of  the  Malayan

Communist  Party.  If and when  that  Party  should

renounce violence and murder, then it may  be  that

these  additional  powers  and  penalties  can   be

discarded. I should like to make it clear that  all

the  offences  laid  down in  this  Part,  and  the

offences provided throughout this Bill, are subject

to trial in the ordinary courts of law. The accused

have  full opportunity of making their defence  and

sentences  are only imposed on conviction  after  a

fair and full trial -

Debate to be resumed - what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. J. Braga:</b> Programmes of expansion of existing facilities in the Hospitals involve: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The General Hospital, which is being expanded to a total of about 1,300 beds and where provision of resident accommodation for House Doctors and for additional Student Nurses is being made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which is being expanded to about 1,100 beds, with expanded Out-patient facilities. The provision of accommodation for training of student assistant nurses is being planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Kandang.Kerbau Hospital, which is being expanded to about 450 beds and where provision of additional accommodation for resident doctors and for pupil midwives also is planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Woodbridge Hospital, which is to have an additional 240 beds and where a special department for Mental Defectives is planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The Trafalgar Leprosy Home where additional accommodation for about 250 patients is proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The St. Andrew's Orthopaedic Hospital for Children where an additional 80 beds is proposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) The Middle Road Hospital where a general Out-patient Department has been planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of the last three hospitals the programme of expansion has already started and is well under way. Subject to the availability of funds it is hoped that it will be possible to commence work on the last named two hospitals in 1957 and on the Trafalgar Home expansion in 1956.
