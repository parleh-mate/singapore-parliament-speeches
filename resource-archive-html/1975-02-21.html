<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>8.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President (accompanied by two A.D.C.s) entered

the  Chamber,  accompanied by  Mr  Speaker,  who  was

preceded  by the Serjeant at Arms (without the  Mace),

the  First  Assistant  Clerk, the Principal  Assistant

Clerk and the Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Clerk announcing "The President", the

President delivered his Opening Speech.



<div align="center"><b>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</b></div>



<br><br>8.01 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The President (Dr Benjamin Henry Sheares):</b> Honourable

Members, there will be much to keep Honourable Members

busy  in 1975. We started 1975 with the United  States

and  Western  Europe easing credit to  avoid  more  un

employment   and  deepening  recession.   Japan   will

probably  do likewise later in the year. Singapore  is

likely  to  reverse the downtrend in her economy.  Our

economy will probably do better in the second half  of

this year than in the first half.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not fared too badly last year, with real

growth  around 7%. Two rough indicators are  usage  of

our  harbour  and  airport. General  and  bulk  cargo,

excluding  bunker  fuel,  handled  by  the   Port   of

Singapore  Authority  increased  in  volume   by   4%.

Aircraft  arrivals  and departures increased  by  less

than 1% in 1974. But passengers increased by 9%.  Thus

the world and Singapore adjusted to higher fuel prices

and higher fares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans cannot expect to enjoy real growth

rates of 10-12% which lasted for over five years up to

1973. The Japanese, who achieved 12-15% growth for the

decade  before the energy crisis, now plan for  a  4~%

growth  rate. If our growth rates are between  5%  and

7%,  it is because we have a lower base from which  to

climb up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided there is no war and another oil embargo or

other  major catastrophe, Singaporeans will adjust  to

slower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



growth  rates.  This  is one of the  advantages  of  a

relatively young population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our birth rates continued to fall in 1974. Experts

had predicted more births

because  of  more young people entering the  fertility

age group. But, in fact, total births declined in 1974

to 44,000 from 48,000 in 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the problems of the old will grow

more  difficult as young families leave out their aged

parents  when they move into flats. Already, over  one

million people, or more than 45%, live in Housing  and

Development  Board  estates. Last year,  26,000  homes

were  completed. My Government will take  measures  to

make  it  more  attractive for young couples  to  have

their  parents  live with them. If nothing  else,  the

grandparents  help in bringing up the children  whilst

father and mother are at work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more pressing problem is travelling at peak hours.

Once  we  live in high-rise and work in high-rise,  we

have increased the density of traffic between the home

and  office.  And when so many. want to get  into  the

Central  Business  District at  the  same  time,  then

traffic jams at peak hours are. inevitable. Fringe car

parking  will  have to be made to work,  to  free  the

roads  in  the  Central  Business  District  for  more

efficient use by public passenger vehicles. Peak  hour

travelling  times and the charges for  entry  will  be

adjusted  to  give  maximum room for public  passenger

vehicles.   The   bus  service  is   improving.   More

improvement  can  be  made in another  three  to  five

years.  In  the late 1980's the beginnings of  a  Mass

Rapid Transit may lessen this congestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One beneficial side effect of the energy crisis is a

slowdown   in  the  number  of  new  cars  registered.

However,  within  a few years, car manufacturers  will

design   lighter  cars  with  more  economic  engines,

cheaper  to buy and cheaper to run. So it is necessary

to  be vigilant and to adjust road and petrol taxes to

prevent our roads from over-congestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem Honourable Members will have to

tackle is the growing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



crime  rates.  High crime rates used to correspond  to

high  unemployment rates. This is no  longer  true.  A

generation is growing up that does not know what it is

to  be  unemployed. They get jobs easily, despite  the

slowdown  in  world trade and in Singapore's  economy.

They want the good things in life, but without working

to  pay for them. On the other hand, the police  force

is undermanned. My Government will introduce full-time

National  Service for the police force. In  this  way,

the  manpower shortage will be lessened. We shall also

have  people in the reserve police service living  all

over  Singapore. They will enlarge our  law  enforcing

capacity.  We  must catch criminals and  punish  them.

More severe punishment must be meted out, most of  all

to drug traffickers on whom any mercy is misplaced. We

must  make Singapore a safe and orderly place to  live

in.  And this we can achieve because we have a  people

responsive to their collective needs, a public service

and  police  force  not tainted by corruption,  and  a

Government  prepared to take action before things  get

out of hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary duty of government is to establish a

society in which everyone has an equal chance to live,

learn, train,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



work  and earn to the best of his or her ability.  We

shall  complete 16 years of representative  government

this  June. Our population growth went down from  4.0%

in  1959  to  1.5%  in 1974. On the  other  hand,  our

external  reserves have grown 20 times,  from  a  mere

$336  million in June 1959 to over $6+ billion on  1st

January,  1975.  This could never have  been  achieved

without   self-discipline,  hard  work,   thrift   and

enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members, I am confident that in your

deliberations,  you will not be swayed  by  short-term

political considerations, and that, instead, you  will

be  guided  by  the  long-term interests  of  all  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the President's speech, Mr

Speaker, preceded by the Serjeant at Arms, the  Clerk,

the  Principal Assistant Clerk and the First Assistant

Clerk,  escorted  the  President (accompanied  by  two

A.D.C.s)  out of the Chamber, and the House  adjourned

without question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at Fourteen Minutes</div>

<div align="right">past Eight o'clock p.m.</div>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ADDENDUM TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>SECOND SESSION OF THE THIRD PARLIAMENT</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ON FRIDAY, 21ST FEBRUARY 1975</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary aim of economic and financial policy is

to  counter the effects of the current world recession

and   to  prepare  ourselves  for  economic  recovery.

Provided  that we use our resources intelligently,  we

shall  continue to achieve relatively  high  rates  of

growth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will offer an attractive package of fiscal

incentives for new types of industries such as machine

tools,   precision  instruments  and   petrochemicals.

Pioneer  industry tax exemption will be extended  from

five  to  ten years for the most deserving industries.

Not  only  do they require heavy investments in  plant

and  machinery; they also need highly skilled workers.

Our  workforce  must  be better  educated  and  better

trained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will help existing industries to improve and

expand.  At the same time, we will not overlook  other

sectors  of  the economy such as construction,  trade,

tourism, transportation and other service industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spare construction capacity and labour now available

will  be  used  to expand our physical  assets.  Large

amounts of capital will be required to expand wharves,

industrial   sites,  telecommunications  and   airport

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such investments have to be financed by public

funds.  A sizeable contribution averaging $500 million

annually  is  being made from the Main Budget  to  the

Development  Budget. But with a less buoyant  economy,

existing  tax revenues may not be sufficient  to  meet

capital needs. We may therefore have to draw upon  the

foreign  exchange  reserves we have  built  up.  These

fortunately are considerable and should be  more  than

adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore will continue to

deal with the problems

of a disordered international monetary system. It will

supervise  and  regulate banks and  finance  companies

more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



sensitively.  For  more efficient  management  of  our

reserves, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and  the

Board of Commissioners of Currency will be merged into

a central bank with powers of currency issue. The 100%

backing  in  gold  and  foreign  currencies   of   the

Singapore Dollar will be maintained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence build-up is levelling off. Further

improvement  in our defence capacity will be  achieved

not  by  greater  numbers but by higher  quality.  The

Singapore  Armed Forces will therefore concentrate  on

improving   its   training  programmes,   methods   of

instruction, logistics administration and  methods  of

utilising manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever possible in non-combat vocations, national

servicemen will be posted to work which they intend to

do  after  leaving the Army. Special units  have  been

established  in Mindef to plan the career  development

of  regular  officers and NCOs. It is gratifying  that

growing  numbers of young Singaporeans  have  come  to

regard  service  as  regular officers  or  NCOs  as  a

rewarding and respected career.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign policy must take into consideration the

new situation arising from the gradual scaling down of

American and Western military presence in the  region.

The  overwhelming Western influence in the region  has

been correspondingly reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will lead other powers to seek greater

influence  for  themselves in the  area.  It  will  be

important   to   cooperate  with  our  neighbours   to

safeguard  our  common interests. ASEAN  can  play  an

important  role  in lessening the leverage  the  great

powers  can  otherwise have in exploiting  differences

and conflicts within the region. It can also quicken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



the   pace   of  regional  co-operation  and  economic

development.  This  in turn will strengthen  stability

and  peace  in the area. ASEAN can help member  states

adjust  to  the  rapid geo-political  changes  in  the

region as the consequences of American withdrawal from

direct involvement with the problems of Indochina work

themselves   through,  and  a  regional   balance   is

established  without any great power  hegemony.  ASEAN

will  soon  have  a permanent Secretariat  which  will

coordinate  the  many  regional economic,  social  and

cultural projects being implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the growing wealth from their oil resources,

the  countries of the Gulf have clearly  increased  in

importance for trade and investments. A Trade  Mission

was sent to West Asia and an official Economic Mission

is  proposed  for Iran. Arrangements  are  also  being

discussed   for   a  Singapore-Iran   Joint   Economic

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area where trade can be developed to the

benefit  of both parties is Eastern Europe.  Relations

between Governments there and Singapore have been very

friendly and it is proposed there be more exchanges of

trade and economic missions with these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea communications are vital to Singapore. Our

interests lie in the maintenance of existing rights of

passage  through all major waterways,  especially  the

Straits  of  Malacca  and Singapore.  We  support  all

changes  which will facilitate speedier and  increased

communication  to improve world trade. Fishermen  from

Singapore should continue to enjoy the right  to  fish

in  Southeast  Asian  waters in the  same  way  as  do

fishermen  of  other  countries.  Singapore  therefore

favours  the  setting  of  internationally  acceptable

standards which will take fair account of the needs of

countries like Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br><i>The Police Force</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force will use new techniques to deal

with  the rising crime rate and new patterns of crime.

A



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



centralised  Criminal Intelligence  Unit  has  been

established   to   improve   criminal   investigation.

Officers   will   be   trained   in   "scene-of-crime"

procedures and the use of sophisticated equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team policing which enables patrolmen to maintain

radio  contact with their patrol cars and move swiftly

was  successfully tested in two Police  Divisions.  It

will be extended to the other six Divisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the manpower shortage in the Force more

civilians and women police officers will be used. Full-time National Servicemen will be taken into the Force.

Work methods will be reviewed to save manpower.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police will implement the Points Demerit

System  and  Ticketing System soon. Under  the  Points

Demerit  System,  drivers who commit  serious  traffic

offences  will be awarded points. Those who accumulate

12  points  or more within 12 months will  have  their

licences  suspended for up to 6 months. The  Ticketing

System  will  enable  the  Traffic  Police  to   issue

summonses on the spot for certain offences. Both these

systems have been computerised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will require the support of the public to

be   fully   effective.  Thus  nationwide  educational

campaigns  such as last year's "Keep Singapore  Crime-Free"  and  "Keep  Singapore Accident-Free"  campaigns

will continue to be organised from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cater for shifts of population to new towns and

housing  estates and to replace dilapidated Divisional

Police  Stations, four new Stations will be  built  in

Toa  Payoh, Paya Lebar, Orchard Road and Jurong  Town.

Construction  is  expected  to  start  in   the   next

financial year.



<br><br><i>Vigilante Corps</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps has grown not only in numbers

but  also  in  its usefulness to the community.  Apart

from  its  civil defence role, it has also established

the  Community  Security Force  to  help  the  regular

Police in crime prevention.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



The  CSF will be expanded to a strength of 10,000 men.

Planning for a new Camp at Nee Soon has begun.



<br><br><i>Prisons Department</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the recommendations of the Prisons

Reorganisation   Committee  have  been   accepted   by

Government.  A  Prisons  Action  Committee  has   been

appointed  to oversee the reorganisation.  To  relieve

the  problem of accommodation, temporary prisons  have

been  developed.  A large prison for  4,000  prisoners

will be built at Ulu Bedok.



<br><br><i>Central Narcotics Bureau</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Committees on Drug Abuse were set up last year.

The  first Committee was appointed to study the causes

of  drug  abuse  amongst youths in  Singapore  and  to

recommend effective measures for its eradication.  The

second  Committee  was  appointed  to  look  into  the

welfare,  rehabilitation and  job  placement  of  drug

abusers who are undergoing or have undergone treatment

at  the  Drug  Rehabilitation  Centre  on  St.  John's

Island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau will counter drug trafficking and sustain

its  educational and publicity efforts  to  alert  the

young on the dangers of drugs.



<br><br><i>Immigration Department</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Checkpoint will be built at Woodlands to match

the  widening of the Singapore/Johore Causeway. It  is

expected to be completed in 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department's Illegal Immigration Task Force will

seek out and deal severely with traffickers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education system will be restructured by stages

with  the  objective of reducing educational  wastage,

improving  teaching and learning, and  increasing  the

supply  of trained manpower. The new education  system

will have the following features:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Primary education will be extended to seven

years, with provision for pupils who make good

progress to complete it in six years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Primary School Leaving Examination will be a

grading   exercise   instead  of   a   pass-or-fail

examination.  Every  pupil  who  completes  primary

education  will  proceed to post-primary  education

and  training of a type best suited to his aptitude

and ability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The secondary curriculum will be diversified to

include  a  variety  of  vocational  training   and

apprenticeship schemes.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide the necessary supporting facilities for

the  restructured  education  system,  the  following

measures will be implemented:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A new Education Act will be enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The building of new schools and junior

colleges will be speeded up.

Additional workshops and science and language

laboratories will be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The Industrial Training Board's capability

will  be  strengthened. It will conduct  vocational

courses  and  implement apprenticeship schemes  for

secondary students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Teacher training will take into account the

revised  staffing needs under the new  system.  In-service  courses will be conducted  to  familiarise

principals and teachers with the philosophy of  the

new system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Textbooks and other teaching materials will be

produced  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  new

system.

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to take into our stride the adverse

effects  of  the  ills afflicting  the  world  economy

depends  on  the continued tripartite co-operation  of

the  Government, labour and management. The  two  most

important  factors  are  the  discipline,  hard  work,

efficiency   and  skill  of  our  workers,   and   the

enterprise and innovation of our entrepreneurs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center">I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MODERNISATION</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to pursue our twin objectives of

upgrading  skills  and  increasing  productivity.  The

National Productivity Board will assist those who  are

prepared  to set up productivity committees.  It  will

shortly  convene  the  National  Industrial  Relations

Committee  to  consider the issue of productivity  and

wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Productivity Board will continue to

assist  small  and medium industries  to  improve  the

expertise  of  their lower and middle  management.  It

will  also  continue to help to improve the skills  of

their  supervisory staff. To help local industries  to

upgrade their technology, the Board has established  a

Low   Cost  Automation  Unit.  It  has  also   planned

additional   services   in  the   fields   of   design

engineering, metal trade engineering, quality control,

preventive maintenance, management information  system

and electronic data processing.



<br><br><div align="center">II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of inflation and recession. the pursuit

of  modemisation  of our economy and  the  strive  for

higher productivity can disrupt our present industrial

peace  and  stability. To ensure that  this  will  not

happen,   our   tripartite  structure  of   industrial

relations  has to be strengthened and the  quality  of

industrial  relations improved.  This  will  call  for

positive  personnel management and sound  trade  union

policies.  It  will  also  require  capable  personnel

managers and trade unionists. The Ministry has decided

to  set up an Industrial Relations Division with  high

level staff. It will provide conciliation services  as

well  as  preventive mediation to eliminate  areas  of

industrial friction.



<br><br><div align="center">III&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELFARE OF WORKERS</div>



<br><br><i>Safety and Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is determined to raise standards of

industrial  safety and health especially  in  building

construction,  shipbuilding and ship-repairing.  These

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



the  highest rates of industrial accidents. A special

unit  each  has  already been set  up  for  these  two

industries.  A  Study Group on accident prevention  in

the   shipbuilding  and  ship-repairing  industry   is

expected  to  submit  its report  shortly.  Industrial

dermatitis and noise-induced deaf ness will  be  added

to   the   list   of  diseases  for  which   workmen's

compensation  is payable. The Factories  Act  will  be

amended  to provide for more stringent safety measures

to  be observed for work in hazardous enclosed places.

Enhanced    penalties   will    be    imposed    where

contraventions  are likely to cause  death  or  bodily

injury.



<br><br><i>Workmen's Compensation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will present to Parliament a new

Workmen's  Compensation Bill which will  increase  the

quantum of compensation. Procedures will be simplified

to    ensure   expeditious   payment.   The    maximum

compensation will be increased from $21,600 to $35,000

for  a  fatal case and from $28,800 to $45,000 in  the

case of permanent incapacity.



<br><br><i>Placement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has set up a special retrenchment unit

in  August 1974 to assist retrenched workers  to  seek

alternative employment.



<br><br><i>Employment of Young Persons</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Committee on Crime and Delinquency found

that   the  requirement  that  young  persons  seeking

employment  in  industry must obtain  Certificates  of

Registration  from  the Commissioner  for  Labour  has

contributed   to  the  delinquency  of  young   school

dropouts.  The Ministry will amend the Employment  Act

to  allow young persons between 14 and 16 years of age

to work in industrial establishments without the prior

approval  of  the  Commissioner for  Labour.  Children

between the ages of 12 and 14 will be allowed to  work

in     industrial    undertakings    under    approved

apprenticeship   schemes.   However,   the    existing

provisions  on  safety, health and  welfare  governing

their   employment  will  be  re-enacted  in  separate

regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br><i>Health Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Services will develop in the range and

sophistication of its services and maintain  standards

of excellence.



<br><br><i>The Tasks Ahead</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tasks ahead are: -



<pre>

   (1) To further expand the services and improve

       standards  in  the  face  of  rising costs.



   (2) To meet the  challenge of  new patterns of

       diseases.

</pre>



<br><br><i>Population</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compounding all these is our large and growing

population.  Population density is 3,664  persons  per

square kilometre, about the highest in the world.  The

number  of  women in the fertile age group  15  to  44

years  is 529,200, double that in 1957. If each couple

limits  its  children to two only,  population  growth

will  continue  for another 50 years before  it  stops

growing.  By  then  the population  will  be  about  4

million.  We have to achieve our goal of two  children

per  family.  Otherwise the standards  of  our  social

services  and  environment  must  go  down  by   sheer

pressure of population and overcrowding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the birth rate continued to decrease

last  year  to 19.8 per thousand. The rate of  natural

increase was 1.43% the lowest recorded rate since  the

War.  The  National  Family  Planning  and  Population

Programme   will   be  intensified,  complemented   by

sterilizations and abortions.



<br><br><i>Costs</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Costs of the medical services escalated from an

annual  increase of 5% in 1972 to 25%  in  1974.  This

will  continue to escalate even higher  as  prices  of

medicine,   equipment   and  staff   salaries   follow

inflationary  trends and as new hospitals,  outpatient

and other medical facilities are added.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of these increases will be paid from taxes.

Those  who  utilise  the services will  have  to  bear

higher nominal charges.



<br><br><i>Organisation of Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of escalating costs, changes are necessary

to prevent wastage. For example, ambulant patients who

can be treated at the Outpatient Dispensaries will not

occupy costly hospital beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector will be encouraged to develop

private hospitals to meet the demand of those who  can

afford it.



<br><br><i>Hospital Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vast and extensive hospital development

programme  will continue. Construction  on  the  first

phase  of  the $150 million Singapore General Hospital

at  Outram  Road began on 2nd January this  year.  The

first  ward  blocks with 450 beds are expected  to  be

completed  in  1976. When completed in 1978,  it  will

have 1,450 beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning for a University Teaching Hospital, and

another general hospital at Bedok has already begun.



<br><br><i>Outpatient Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outpatient services will be further expanded and

improved.  Certain  laboratory, X-ray  facilities  and

treatment  services now undertaken  in  the  hospitals

will  be decentralised in selected Outpatient Centres.

More new Outpatient Dispensaries will be built.



<br><br><i>The Dental Health Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dental Health Services will be expanded. The

expansion of the Dental Health Services which has been

hampered by a shortage of dentists will be overcome by

the  training of a new grade of dental personnel,  the

Dental  Therapists.  They will be  trained  at  a  new

Dental  Institute  to be established  with  the  first

recruits taken in this year.



<br><br><i>Disease Patterns</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ascendency of heart diseases and cancers

requires new approaches in control and treatment.  The

re-appearance  of  malaria,  persistence  of   typhoid

fever,  and  recurrence  of  cholera  demands  greater

vigilance against infectious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



diseases. Our vulnerable position as a major  air  and

sea   junction   makes  it  impractical   to   isolate

ourselves.  We have to depend upon early  warnings  of

epidemic outbreaks, an efficient surveillance  system,

high   standards   of  environmental  sanitation   and

personal hygiene.



<br><br><i>Legislation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health legislation will be revised to meet the

changing patterns of diseases and methods of combating

them.  These include amendments to the Quarantine  and

Prevention  of Diseases Act, the Leprosy Act  and  the

introduction of a new omnibus Medicines Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment is responsible for

maintaining  a  high  standard of public  health,  for

improving   the   environment  and   for   controlling

pollution.



<br><br><i>Water Resources and Pollution Control</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Water Pollution Control and Drainage Bill will be

introduced this year for more effective protection  of

water resources and prevention of water pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kranji/Pandan catchment areas, pig farms

and some pollutive industries will have to move to non-catchment  areas.  In the catchment  areas  only  non-polluting industries and activities will be allowed.



<br><br><i>Sewerage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimated sum of $400 million will be spent on

sewerage  projects in the next five years for  housing

and  industrial  estates. These  projects  will  serve

Telok  Blangah, Bukit Timah, Clementi, the City,  East

Coast, .Bedok, Woodlands and Ang Mo Kio.



<br><br><i>Drainage</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A live-year drainage plan integrated with the

development  of  new  public  housing  and  industrial

estates has been drawn up. This drainage plan  is  for

Ang  Mo Kio, Bedok, Telok Blangah, Ayer Rajah, Geylang

Serai, Woodlands,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



Clementi, Chua Chu Kang, MacPherson,Stamford and  the

East Coast.



<br><br><i>Solid Waste Disposal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of a 1,200-tonne incinerator will

commence this year to cope with the growing volume  of

refuse.



<br><br><i>Hawkers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bona fide hawkers have now been licensed. No new

licences   will   be   issued   except   in    special

circumstances. Licensed street hawkers will  be  moved

into  markets  and  hawker centres. Firm  action  will

continue to be taken against unlicensed hawkers.



<br><br><i>Crematoria and Funeral Parlours</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four new crematoria at Mount Vernon will be ready

for  use this year. A columbarium (facilities for  the

keeping  of  ashes  of the dead) will  be  built.  Two

modern  funeral parlours will be constructed at  Mount

Vernon  to serve, in particular, the people living  in

high   rise  flats.  Other  suitable  sites  will   be

allocated  for funeral parlours to be constructed  and

run by private organisations.



<br><br><i>Air Pollution</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air, pollution will be kept within acceptable levels

by  selective siting of industries and control of  the

number  of  vehicles. Only clean  industries  will  be

sited within housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industries, which make marginal contribution to the

economy  and  which  are  highly  pollutive  such   as

sawmills,  will be phased out. The more efficient  and

viable  sawmills  will be required to modernise  their

operation  and will be relocated in the  Sungei  Kadut

Industrial Estate.



<br><br><div align="center">PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PUB continues to execute more projects to

meet  the  growing demand for electricity,  water  and

gas.   Two  major  water  projects  will  shortly   be

completed.  Construction of the new power  station  at

Senoko is making steady progress. Preliminary work  on

two  new  gasmaking  plants will commence  within  the

year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase in cost of labour and materials,

especially   fueoil,  the  production  cost   of   all

utilities  has risen considerably. For the first  time

in  its  history  the  Board has  forecast  a  revenue

deficit  for  1975. This upward trend will  ultimately

affect  the  price we will have to pay  for  utilities

consumed.



<br><br><i>Electricity</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth in electricity consumption in 1974 of

3.7% is considerably lower than in previous years  and

is  due  mainly to public awareness of the oil  crisis

coupled  with  the  increase in  cost  of  electricity

because of the fuel oil levy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stage II of Jurong Power Station (cost: $133

million) has been completed and the three 120 MW units

successfully commissioned by the middle of  1974.  The

first 120 MW unit of the Senoko Power Station Stage .1

now   under  construction  (cost:  $200  million)   is

expected to be commissioned towards the latter part of

this  year.  The  first  phase  of  the  new  230   KV

underground transmission network (cost: $100  million)

is  scheduled for commissioning in October 1975.  This

phase  is  designed to transmit large blocks of  power

from  Senoko  Power  Station to load  centres  on  the

island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board's rural electrification programme

comprising some 500 projects (cost: $15 million) in 18

stages  of  implementation was completed by the  third

quarter of 1974. Electricity is now available  in  all

parts  of  the  island, except in remote  rural  sites

earmarked for redevelopment.



<br><br><i>Water</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an increase of only 1.81% in water

consumption in 1974. This remarkably low growth is the

result of the awareness o. the public. Economising  in

the  use  of  water  must become a  way  of  life  for

Singaporeans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Upper Peirce(cost: $56.8 million) and Kranji

Pandan (cost: $75.1 million) schemes will be completed

shortly  and  will increase the total maximum  storage

capacity  of  the Republic's impounding reservoirs  by

more than 49 million cubicmetres.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



The  third-phase  extension (cost:$1.14  million)  of

Jalan Eunos Service Reservoir was completed last year,

bringing  the total capacity to 100,000 cubic  metres.

Together  with  the booster station and  water  tower,

this service reservoir will cater for the future water

requirements  in  the eastern part of  Singapore.  The

construction of a 32,000-cubic metre service reservoir

at  Hill 65, Jurong (cost: $3 million) is in progress.

Scheduled  for  completion  in  September  1975,  this

service reservoir will serve the Jurong New Town area.



<br><br><i>Gas</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas consumption in 1974 increased by 16.8%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the commissioning of the eighth gasmaking plant

(cost:  $1.5  million) in August 1973, the  production

capacity of Kallang Gas Works was increased by 100,000

cubic metres per day. Work on two new gasmaking plants

(cost: $4.5 million) with a combined capacity of  more

than  200,000 cubic metres per day will commence  this

year.  The  addition of these plants will  enable  the

Board to meet the anticipated demand for gas until the

1980's.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From current economic upheavals lessons can be

learnt  from  the  more resilient  economies  of  West

Germany  and Japan. We must increase our technological

capability  if  we  are  to  compete  effectively   in

international markets. This Ministry has the following

projects  in  manpower development and the  collection

and dissemination of technological information:-



<pre>

   (a) A  Nuclear Energy Unit was  established  in 1973

       to  collect technical information on the  use of

       nuclear energy.



   (b) The  Radiation Protection Act was enforced  from

       1st September, 1974  to regulate  the  use  of

       radio-active materials and irradiating apparatus.

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<pre>

   (c) Plans for an Ocean Engineering Centre have been

       formulated.  This proposed Centre  will provide

       research,  design,  engineering  and  technical

       information  services  to upgrade  the nation's

       shipbuilding   and   repairing    capabilities.



   (d) The  Ministry  is overseeing the building  of a

       new  University  at  Kent  Ridge  and   a   new

       Polytechnic   at   Dover   Road.   Both     are

       scheduled  for   completion   at   about   1978.



   (e) The  Science  Centre  will  open  in  1976. Its

       exhibits  will  complement science  teaching in

       schools  by  showing  the role  of  science and

       technology in social and  economic development.



   (f) After  re-organisation the Chemistry Department

       diversified its activities to include  research

       and  development for industries, consultancy on

       industrial  waste, radioactive  waste  disposal

       and microbiological examination of food.



   (g) Metric conversion  in  1975 will focus  on  the

       retail   trade   sector.



</pre>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<br><br><i>The Construction Sector</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oil crisis, inflation and economic recession

adversely affected the construction industries. A two-pronged  effort  to  counter this recessive  trend  is

underway.  Public  works  are  being  stepped  up  and

measures  are  being implemented to stimulate  private

sector construction.



<br><br><i>Public Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB completed a record of 26.000 units in 1974.

One  million Singaporeans (45% of the population)  are

now  living  in  HDB  estates. There  is,  however,  a

waiting list of 80,000 intending purchasers and 20,000

applicants to rent HDB flats. The HDB's building



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



programme   will   be  further  accelerated   towards

completing  30,000 units, and eventually 40,000  units

per  year.  This year, new designs for  3  and  4-room

flats (which are 10% larger) will be introduced.



<br><br><i>Middle income Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our middle income citizens, ineligible for

public housing and unable to afford the high prices of

private  dwellings, the Ministry, through its  Housing

and  Urban Development Company, will build condominium

housing  for  sale at prices within their reach.  Some

4,200 housing units in nine residential areas will  be

constructed within the next two years. This  programme

will continue so long as demand continues.



<br><br><i>Urban Renewal</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Urban Redevelopment Authority was established on

1st April, 1974  to  improve,  through  comprehensive

planning and systematic redevelopment, the living  and

working environment in the central area. The 4th  Sale

of  Sites was launched in April 1974 and a 5th Sale of

Sites  will  take  place this year  to  generate  more

private sector development.



<br><br><i>Building Managetment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has set up a Building Management Unit

under  the  Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance

and  Management) Act to ensure that all  common  areas

and  services  of  buildings such  as  corridors,  car

parks,  fencing, lifts, etc. are properly  maintained.

In  cases  of  default, the Unit will  carry  out  all

necessary maintenance work and charge the costs to the

owner(s) who may be private individuals, corporations,

Statutory Boards or institutions.



<br><br><i>Reclamation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclamation work along the east coast and west coast

continues.   The  latest  Marina  Centre   reclamation

project  which will create a large lagoon and sizeable

areas  for open space and recreation will also  enable

the  construction of a highway linking Changi  in  the

east  to  Jurong  in  the west,  thus  casing  traffic

congestion in the city centre.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Parks and Recreation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major park and beach recreation area - The East

Coast Park - being developed on 500 acres of reclaimed

land  from  Bedok  to  Tanjong Rhu,  will  have  cycle

tracks,   footpaths,   a   swimming   lagoon,   sports

facilities,  camping sites, holiday chalets  and  food

centres.  On  completion, in mid-'76, it will  be  the

largest centre of recreation in Singapore.



<br><br><i>Public Works</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building programme for schools, hospitals,

airports, roads and other public work projects will be

accelerated.  Amongst major road  works  are  the  new

coastal  expressway  along  the  Marina  Centre,   the

remaining  stretches  of  the Pan  Island  Expressway.

There  is  a  five-year road development programme  to

ease  traffic  congestion in  the  central  area.  The

Orchard  Road pedestrian mall will be extended towards

the Botanic Gardens in the north and Stamford Canal in

the  south. Fifteen fringe car parks will be completed

for  the Park and Ride Scheme to be implemented by the

middle  of this year. A central cornputerised  traffic

control  system to promote a smoother flow of  traffic

and  ease congestion will be implemented. Tenders will

be called in April.



<br><br><i>Primary Production</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore continues to be self-sufficient in fresh

pork,  eggs  and poultry meats in spite of  occasional

shortages  and high prices of imported raw  materials.

Local  production acted as a stabilising influence  on

prices  of  foodstuffs.  In  conjunction  with   water

resources  development, pig farms  will  he  relocated

into  non-catchment areas. Work is in hand to resettle

pig farms from Kranji to Ponggol.



<br><br><i>Manpower</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In co-operation with the University of Singapore, a

part-time training course for architects will commence

in  April.  Other  training programmes  to  train  and

upgrade  skills for the building industries, are  also

being planned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications will continue to

expand  and  improve the communications infrastructure

for  Singapore to discharge its role as a major centre

for international communications.



<br><br><i>Road Transportation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will introduce traffic management

measures  such as the Park and Ride and  City  Shuttle

Bus and Area Licensing schemes. Voluntary schemes like

staggered  work hours and formation of Car Pools  will

be  stepped  up.  The prime objective  is  to  relieve

traffic congestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 100 Government and Singapore Armed Forces

personnel were seconded to Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.

(SBS)  since August last year. A determined effort  is

now  in  progress to improve the management and  raise

the  standard  and quality of the public bus  service.

SBS  is  to be converted into a public limited company

with  Government  having  a shareholding  when  it  is

firmly established.



<br><br><i>Mass Rapid Transit</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Phase Study of mass transit systems was

completed  in 1974. The Second Phase Study,  involving

more  detailed  feasibility evaluations including  the

engineering  and financial aspects, is underway.  This

Study is expected to be completed this year.



<br><br><i>Maritime and Port Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships on the Singapore Registry totalled more than

three  million  tons  in May 1974.  Within  the  first

quarter  of this year, they should exceed four million

tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1974, the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA)

handled nearly 14.3 million tonnes of cargo (excluding

bunker  fuel),  an  increase of 4% over  the  previous

year.  Unless trends are reversed, the growth rate  is

expected to level off in 1975. Retraining schemes will

be  introduced for the excess manpower resulting  from

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PSA is undertaking various development projects.

These  include warehouses at Pasir Panjang,  Alexandra

and  other  areas in the Western Corridor.  Additional

berths and related facilities for container ships,  as

well as slop reception facilities at Pulau Sebarok are

also being constructed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As PSA needs to dredge navigation channels and

anchorages,  the  dredged material  will  be  used  to

reclaim  a number of offshore islands. These reclaimed

islands  are  to  be  used  for  industry  and  public

recreation.



<br><br><i>Civil Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aircraft and passenger movements, freight and mail

handled  at Paya Lebar and Seletar Airports  continued

to increase in 1974. Commercial aircraft movements for

Paya   Lebar  Airport  increased  by  0.8%,  passenger

traffic by 9%, freight by 38%, mail handled by

15.4%,   in   1974  as  compared  to   1973.   Further

development  of  Paya  Lebar and Seletar  Airports  to

cater to the demand is planned at an estimated cost of

$460 million.



<br><br><i>Meteorological Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meteorological observations of the upper atmosphere,

including  the monsoons affecting Singapore,  will  be

carried   out   for  a  regional  research   programme

sponsored  by  the World Meteorological  Organisation.

The  Meteorological Department will install electronic

aids  to observe weather for aviation purposes and  to

speed up interchange of meteorological data.



<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New telephone exchanges are being constructed, and

installation  of telephone switching and  transmission

equipment is being speeded up. To improve the  service

to  the  public,  the Telecommunication  Authority  of

Singapore (TAS) will be running more training  courses

for its staff, with the assistance of various overseas

experts, at its new telecommunication training centre.

new  post  offices  from 1973  to  1978,  twelve  post

offices  have  been completed. Four more  are  nearing

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF CULTURE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social and cultural development is an integral part

of the overall development of the nation. The Ministry

of   Culture   will  encourage  this  development   by

promoting all forms of artistic endeavour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Music for Everyone" concerts and "Art for

Everyone" exhibitions have had good response. Together

with other activities such as "Concerts for the Young"

and  "Open  Air Art Exhibitions for the  Young",  they

will  continue to foster public appreciation of  music

and the fine arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will encourage artistic pursuits which will bring

graciousness  into the lives of our  people.  This  is

particularly important because more and more  live  in

high-rise new towns. Active support will be  given  to

original  literary  and  artistic  productions.   More

competitions,  exhibitions and  performances  will  be

organised. We shall especially encourage the young  to

participate in these activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our radio and television services will continue to

inform,  educate and entertain. A new  radio  building

will  be  completed this year. It will  have  a  large

auditorium to allow for greater audience participation

in radio and TV productions. A pilot colour TV Service

was  introduced  in  August last year.  The  hours  of

colour  TV  programmes will be progressively extended.

More local programmes will be produced to balance  the

overseas  colour programmes. These will  include  film

documentaries on a wide range of subjects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Library is encouraging the reading

habit  and developing an enquiring mind in our  young.

Two more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



branch  libraries have been opened in  Toa  Payoh  and

Chai  Chee. Branches will also be established in other

satellite   towns.  Opening  hours  will  be   further

extended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association will provide a wider range

of  recreational,  social, cultural,  educational  and

sports activities through its network of 174 community

centres.  Youth  movements in community  centres  have

helped  to  identify the needs of  our  young  people.

Youth  councils  will be set up to formulate  policies

and  programmes.  More community centres  and  holiday

camps  will  be  built or re-developed  with  improved

amenities in keeping with changing social needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre Trust has, in the last two

years, promoted more local cultural activities besides

continuing with its presentation of overseas artistes.

The  Theatre was renovated last year. The  Trust  will

continue to assist cultural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Museum will also serve as an exhibition

and educational centre devoted to the art, history and

anthropology  of  the peoples of  this  region.  After

renovation,  the Museum will have an  Art  Gallery  of

local  paintings. The art collection of the University

of Singapore will also be displayed in the Museum.

<br><br><i>The Aged</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation to control the operation and management

of  private  welfare  homes  is  under  consideration.

Minimum  standards for care of inmates and cleanliness

of  homes  will  be  imposed, and  ancillary  services

provided.



<br><br><i>Vocational Rehabilitation of the Disabled</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A United Nations expert on Vocational Rehabilitation

of  the Disabled has submitted recommendations on  the

vocational   assessment,   training,   guidance    and

placement  of handicapped persons. His recommendations

are under consideration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



and  will  form  the  basis of  proposals  to  assist

handicapped persons to become self-supporting.



<br><br><i>Community Probation Service</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will recruit and train more volunteers

for  the Community Probation Service to supplement the

work of Probation Officers. Five batches of volunteers

have  been  trained,  and  a sixth  batch  will  start

training  in March 1975. To make them more  effective,

the  Ministry is considering vesting these  volunteers

with statutory powers of supervision.



<br><br><div align="center">CONTROL OVER INSTITUTIONS AND SERVICES</div>



<br><br><i>Curbs on Moneylending Malpractices</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moneylenders Act and Regulations are being

reviewed  for more stringent control over moneylending

activities.  Heavier  penalties will  be  imposed  for

offences  such as charging exorbitant interest  rates,

harassment, kickbacks and other malpractices.



Control of Pawnshops



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Pawnbrokers Act is also being revised

to  allow  stricter control over the  pawnbroking  and

financing activities of pawnshops.



<br><br><i>Strengthening the Co-operative Movement</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two International Labour Organisation experts have

studied  the  cooperative movement in Singapore.  They

recommended the re-organisation of the Registry of Co-operative  Societies  into a Co-operative  Development

Department,  the  creation of a Co-operative  Training

Centre,  the training of Registry staff, the  revision

of  the Co-operative Societies Act and Regulations and

the  establishment of an apex organisation to  provide

leadership for the co-operative movement. The Ministry

is  considering  these  recommendations.  Revision  of

existing  legislation providing  procedures  `for  the

management  and  operation of  co-operative  societies

will be implemented soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Brigade has been reorganised

into four area commands. The operational force of

the   Brigade  will  be  strengthened  with   the

establishment of an Auxiliary Fire Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is considering legislation to

define  the  duties and responsibilities  of  the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



service   and   provide   guidelines   for   its

improvement and development.



<br><br><i>Search and Rescue Operations in High-Rise Buildings</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Fire Brigade will introduce

search    and    rescue   operations   in    high-rise

buildings,  utilising helicopters.  A  nucleus  of  25

officers  and  men  is  now  undergoing  training  for

this new service.
