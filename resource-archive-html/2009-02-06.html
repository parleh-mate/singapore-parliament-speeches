The Middle Eastern economies have demonstrated sustained economic boom and immense opportunity in non oil, non traditional sectors, such as construction, retail, transportation, logistics, water treatment, infrastructure and city planning.&nbsp; But, today, as the world grapples with the fallout from years of mismanagement of financial policies, Middle East states, like Dubai, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and others who had benefited from the oil wealth are also beginning to feel the "heat", hotter than the desert heat.&nbsp; No doubt, they will see their wealth shrink because of their investment in various decaying financial assets, but their oil wealth has provided some comfortable cushion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has a good working relationship with the Middle East.&nbsp; Several high level Ministerial visits were made, including a tour by our President to Egypt and Jordan.&nbsp; However, as an article in the Arab English Language daily, <I>Arab News</I>, stated it was a good start but more must be done.&nbsp; I hope the Minister can update the House on the progress of our efforts to strengthen relations and open new platforms between the Middle East countries and Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe some of the opened doors have resulted in mutual beneficial economic gains but I think not enough is done to promote cultural exchanges and the people-to-people contact, including tourism.&nbsp;

This May, the first ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting with the Gulf Cooperation Council Foreign Ministers will be hosted by Bahrain.&nbsp; To coordinate the vastly increased workload, the ASEAN Secretariat, under the <p align=left>Column: 2093<p>energetic leadership of Dr Surin Pitsuwan, is being strengthened and the ASEAN Charter is being implemented.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Thai chairmanship of ASEAN has been affected by domestic political discord.&nbsp; The ASEAN Summit has had to be postponed from December last year to the end of February this year. &nbsp;That could not be helped.&nbsp; Because of the conflicting travel schedules of leaders, the Chair has not yet been able to fix the dates for the ASEAN+3 Summit and the EAS.&nbsp; This is not good because urgent decisions, like the increased currency swap lines under the ASEAN+3 Chiangmai Initiative, have got to be made.&nbsp; But we must persist in supporting the Thai government and making sure that ASEAN continues to push forward in the face of the global economic crisis.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's chairmanship of ASEAN from July 2007 to July last year turned out to be more eventful than we had planned for.&nbsp; We were able to progress the ASEAN agenda well enough, especially the drafting of the Charter.&nbsp; What intruded unexpectedly was the violent crackdown on peaceful demonstrators, including Buddhist monks, in Myanmar in September 2007.&nbsp; ASEAN Foreign Ministers were in the UN for the General Assembly at that time.&nbsp; We had to convene an emergency meeting to express our collective revulsion.&nbsp; We also supported the use of the Good Offices of the UN through the Gambari mission.&nbsp; However, the Myanmar government objected to Prof. Gambari meeting ASEAN leaders during the Summit in Singapore at the end of 2007, making it clear that Nay Pyi Daw wanted to deal with the UN and the international community directly.&nbsp; Thereafter, ASEAN stood aside until the tragedy of the cyclone Nargis hit in early May 2008.&nbsp; For two weeks, there was a standoff between a paranoid Myanmar government on one side, and foreign governments and international aid <p align=left>Column: 2094<p>agencies on the other.&nbsp; Singapore, in the Chair, convened an emergency ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting and persuaded Myanmar to agree to the formation of an ASEAN Humanitarian Task Force and the Tripartite Core Group to oversee the flow of international assistance.&nbsp; That process worked very well, much better than anyone had hoped for.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Although political progress in Myanmar remains slow and difficult, ASEAN did make a significant contribution to the people of Myanmar, especially in preventing a second wave of deaths from famine and hunger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.30 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The credibility of ASEAN is a challenge to us in these trying times, and so it was too, during the Asian Financial Crisis when some commentators&nbsp;thought that ASEAN would become diminished.&nbsp; But in actual fact, under the pressure of crisis, leaders met, acted, and we became stronger as a regional organisation.&nbsp; This present economic downturn presents a fresh challenge to us and there are domestic political difficulties, there are bilateral political problems like Preah Vihear.&nbsp; But I believe because of the changes in the world, because of the rise of China and India, the countries in Southeast Asia have no choice but to stay united and proceed with even greater determination on the integration of our economies, closer political coordination, and a gradual outreach to young people, to make the ASEAN Community not only a legal reality, but a reality in our hearts and in our minds.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi Daipi asked about our relations with Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 2095<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Malaysia, our relations have improved considerably under PM Abdullah Badawi. &nbsp;In November last year, Foreign Minister Rais Yatim hosted the Singapore delegation for the Wisma Putra-MFA Games in Johor with great warmth.&nbsp; With the judgment of the ICJ (International Court of Justice), our bilateral dispute over sovereignty of Pedra Branca has been resolved, but to be sure, to neither side's complete satisfaction.&nbsp; Maritime boundaries around Pedra Branca are, however, yet to be delineated.&nbsp; We hope to do this expeditiously through the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Technical Committee, in a constructive spirit.&nbsp; Both sides have also been discussing the implementation of the Points of Agreement.&nbsp; On Iskandar Malaysia, the Joint Ministerial Committee has met a number of times with good results. &nbsp;With the economic crisis, it is all the more important for the two countries to cooperate for mutual benefit.&nbsp; And the recent decision to free up the KL-Singapore air sector to competition has brought down fares.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong met Malaysia Deputy Prime Minister Najib in Lima last November, he expressed the hope that bilateral relations could be raised to an even higher level.&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister Najib responded positively and PM Lee suggested the development of an iconic project in Iskandar Malaysia to express this common aspiration.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our relations with Indonesia are also very good.&nbsp; Apart from the ET/DCA (Extradition Treaty/Defence Cooperation Agreement) issue which both sides agreed to set aside for the time being, Indonesia and Singapore cooperate closely on a wide range of issues.&nbsp; Just last month, President Yudhoyono inaugurated the Batam/Bintan/Karimun Free Trade Zone drawing the two countries closer together.&nbsp; To facilitate to-ing and fro-ing, Singapore will establish a Consulate in <p align=left>Column: 2096<p>Batam this year.&nbsp; Relations between the TNI and the SAF are excellent with regular joint exercises conducted by all three services.&nbsp; We are completely on the same side in our fight against terrorism.&nbsp; We work together on fighting bird flu in Tangerang in West Java and fighting forest fires in Jambi. &nbsp;On ASEAN and the regional architecture, Indonesia and Singapore share almost identical positions.&nbsp; And recently, after six rounds of negotiations, both sides agreed on the delineation of our sea border in the western part of the Singapore Strait.&nbsp; Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda and I will be signing the agreement within a few weeks.&nbsp; This agreement would have to be ratified by the Indonesian DPR (House of Representatives).</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue broadening and deepening our relations with Indonesia in the coming years.&nbsp; In contrast to the Soeharto era, Indonesia's power structure has become much more complex. &nbsp;In Jakarta, we need better links to the legislative branch of the government.&nbsp; Our MPs should get to know their DPR counterparts better and develop personal relationships.&nbsp; Indonesia has a lively media which we must be ready to engage.&nbsp; Indonesia has also devolved much power to the provinces and <I>kabupatens</I> (regencies) and it behooves us to build stronger links to the provinces and <I>kabupatens</I> that are closer to Singapore.&nbsp; We should also pay attention to people-to-people links including exchanges among scholars, students and artists.&nbsp; Whatever the outcome of the elections in Indonesia in the coming months, the relations between Indonesia and Singapore will remain strong because both sides need it.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for our relations with Thailand, they are back to normal.&nbsp; We have to deal with whoever is in authority.&nbsp; We do not know how long the political uncertainty will continue. &nbsp;But whatever the domestic political situation in Thailand, we have to rise above it and keep formal bilateral <p align=left>Column: 2097<p>relations on an even keel because that is in the best interest of both countries.&nbsp; All of us know that there is considerable mutual affection between Thais and Singaporeans.&nbsp; Many of us know Prime Minister Abhisit personally.&nbsp; Singaporeans visit Thailand by the hundreds of thousands every year.&nbsp; We were very touched last year when Princess Ubolratana chose Singapore to screen the international premiere of her movie "Where the Miracle Happens".&nbsp; Princess Sirindhorn visits Singapore regularly in connection with her work on technology for the handicapped and on philanthropy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah and Ms Irene Ng asked about our hosting of APEC in November this year and how Singaporeans can benefit from it.&nbsp; This will be a major event because the leaders of 21 economies in the Asia-Pacific will be attending, including new leaders like President Barack Obama of the US and President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia. &nbsp;The world's media spotlight will be on Singapore that week.&nbsp; It is important that we host the meeting well.&nbsp; At the last APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Lima, Peru, it was heartwarming the way ordinary people joyously greeted visiting delegations, waving from motorcars and sidewalks.&nbsp; And as Ms Irene Ng said, we should try to do the same in Singapore so that the meeting in Singapore becomes a memorable experience for all those who come.&nbsp; In addition to the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, we expect some leaders like China's President Hu Jintao to make bilateral visits to Singapore just before or after.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of APEC in Singapore.&nbsp; I remember vividly the first meeting in Canberra 20 years ago.&nbsp; That same week, the Berlin Wall fell.&nbsp; Many of us had a sense that one chapter in history was being closed and a new chapter was being opened.&nbsp; By happy chance, at the <p align=left>Column: 2098<p>same time as we hold APEC this year, a 16-foot stretch of the Berlin Wall will be unveiled at Bedok Reservoir near Temasek Polytechnic on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the wall in Berlin on 9th November, and we will have a big party.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Chair of APEC, Singapore has the responsibility to push forward the APEC agenda, particularly promoting economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and resisting protectionism.&nbsp; With the sharp economic downturn, protectionist sentiments will rise in many countries.&nbsp; As we all know, the chance of the Doha negotiations being concluded in the near future is small.&nbsp; In trade matters, like riding a bicycle, there is always a danger of falling off when you are not moving forward.&nbsp; An important item for APEC is the proposal to establish as a long-term goal&nbsp;&ndash; a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.&nbsp; In fact, this is the only way to operationalise the Bogor Vision of the Asia-Pacific becoming a region for the free flow of trade and investment by 2020.&nbsp; The Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, which is a proposed FTA of a number of APEC economies, will help us get there.&nbsp; The US, Australia and Peru will be negotiating membership with the present members, which are Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore.&nbsp; Vietnam has expressed interest too.&nbsp; When the 21 leaders meet in Singapore this November, we can be sure that their preoccupation will be the global economic crisis because all economies are seriously affected by it and by the end of the year, that crisis will bite hard in every economy.&nbsp; If we host the meeting well, both in substance and in form, Singapore's international reputation will be enhanced, and this will be good for our economy&nbsp;&ndash; precisely the point Ms Irene Ng made.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Michael Palmer asked whether a new Administration in the US will mean a <p align=left>Column: 2099<p>change in our relations and ASEAN's relations with the US.&nbsp; Singapore's relations with the US are excellent and should remain so under the Obama Administration.&nbsp; Whatever others might say of the previous Administration, from our perspective, US policy on East and Southeast Asia under President George W Bush was constructive and good for the region.&nbsp; We expect stability of the core positions under President Obama. &nbsp;We do know and we have been in contact with a number of the key officials in charge of East and Southeast Asian policy in the new Administration.&nbsp; Singapore's FTA with the US continues to be a model for other countries and has helped us attract investments into Singapore and create jobs.&nbsp; Our Strategic Framework Agreement with the US also enhances the security of the region.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for US relations with ASEAN, we might well see an improvement under President Obama.&nbsp; Because, as Mr Palmer said, he lived for four years in Indonesia as a young boy, President Obama has a feel for the region which goes beyond what is contained in briefing documents. &nbsp;You know, when Ambassador Chan Heng Chee greeted President Obama at a social function in Washington DC last week, he replied in Bahasa Indonesia to Ambassador Chan's surprise and she had to quickly search her mind for Malay words in response.&nbsp; When Prime Minister Lee met then-Senator Obama in May 2007, he fondly recalled following his mother to Singapore for occasional shopping trips from Indonesia.&nbsp; We look forward to welcoming Secretary Hillary Clinton to our ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok in the middle of the year and President Obama for the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November.&nbsp; At her confirmation hearing in the Senate, Secretary Clinton laid out a position on ASEAN which we are very comfortable with.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 2100<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we position ourselves for an increasingly multi-polar reality in the world, the fact is the US will remain the pre-eminent pole for a long time.&nbsp; Without the US in the lead, multi-polarity can be unstable and even dangerous.&nbsp; Without the US driving the G-20 process, the reform of global institutions cannot be accomplished.&nbsp; Without the US staying deeply embedded in East and Southeast Asia, the region can be destabilised, affecting prospects for peace and development. &nbsp;And as for the dangers of the US turning protectionist, this will be an ongoing struggle within the US body politic itself. &nbsp;We read recently how, in passing the stimulus bill in the House of Representatives, a clause was added to buy American steel first.&nbsp; But because countries protested and the White House stated its position, when the same bill went to the Senate, the Senate said that it would be subjected to all international agreements being observed. &nbsp;That is a good sign, but we expect this to be a continuing fight in US domestic politics because of rising unemployment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Mr Ang Mong Seng asked for an update of our relations with China.&nbsp; China will become increasingly important to our well-being in Singapore as its economy and influence grow.&nbsp; In December last year, we commemorated the 30th Anniversary of Deng Xiaoping's visit to Singapore around the time he launched China on its new path of reform and opening up, a decision which was historically decisive for China and the world.&nbsp; Over the years, we have built up our links with China and our China account is now considerable.&nbsp; A few months ago, we concluded our FTA with China, which complements ASEAN's FTA with China.&nbsp; And later this year, both sides will be celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Suzhou Industrial Park, which has become one of the most successful parks in China.&nbsp; That project deepened mutual understanding, created <p align=left>Column: 2101<p>trust and facilitated cooperation across a wide range between the two sides.&nbsp; The new Tianjin Eco-City Project will take our bilateral relationship to a new plane.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this economic downturn, China's economy will continue to grow. Last week in Davos, Premier Wen Jiabao reported that China would strive to achieve 8% GDP growth this year.&nbsp; MFA will work with MTI and the various economic agencies to open up more business opportunities for Singapore businesses in China in the coming months and years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng asked about the state of cross-strait relations and Singapore's relationship with both sides of the Taiwan Strait.&nbsp; Under President Ma Ying-jeou, cross-strait relations have improved considerably. "<I>San Tong</I>" (&#19977;&#36890;) benefits not only Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese but everyone else in the region.</p></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was in Xiamen last month and could feel the sense of optimism about the future.

Like for China, we will work hard to open up new opportunities for our businesses in India both at the centre and in the states, capitalising on our position as one of India's major investors.&nbsp; We also want a strong reflection of India in Singapore.&nbsp; Over 3,600 Indian companies now operate out of Singapore.&nbsp; Last year, the first overseas meeting in the region of Non-Resident Indians, Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, was successfully held here strengthening our links to the worldwide ethnic Indian network.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2103<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin wanted an update about the state of our relations with countries in the Middle East.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Members would have noticed in media reports, the flurry of high-level bilateral visits between Singapore and the Middle East continues unabated, and President Nathan will soon be visiting the Middle East again.&nbsp; It is an important new frontier for us.&nbsp; Despite&nbsp;a drop in the price of oil and the collapse of real estate bubbles, the region will stay wealthy because the cost of producing oil and gas is very low.&nbsp; I remember one Kuwaiti Minister telling me that it only costs US$1-US$2 to extract a barrel of oil in Kuwait; no need to pump because the oil is already under pressure and will gush out on its own.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particularly in these difficult times, we must explore new openings in the Middle East.&nbsp; Many countries there want closer cooperation with us, seeing lessons they can draw from Singapore's developmental experience.&nbsp; They also appreciate our integrity and our forthrightness.&nbsp; The appointment of Prof. Shih Choon Fong, former President of NUS, as the President of the new King Abdullah University of Science and Technology is a compliment not just to him but to the Singapore education system.&nbsp; When the new Libyan Ambassador called on me recently, he expressed a strong hope that our bilateral relations will flourish.&nbsp; The signing of the Free Trade Agreement between Singapore and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in December last year, which is the first to be signed by the GCC with any country or region, benefits both sides.&nbsp; We have to continue building up our knowledge and expertise on the Middle East.&nbsp; Mr Zainudin talked about the Middle East Institute which is gradually building up layers of expertise. &nbsp;It will take time as this is a long-term undertaking, but it is making <p align=left>Column: 2104<p>good progress.&nbsp; Together with MTI, we will build up our stock of Arabic speakers and send more officers to the countries which offer us the most opportunities.&nbsp; With the developed countries in recession, we will give particular emphasis to new opportunities in the Middle East, in addition to China and India.&nbsp; These will be our areas of concentration.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shared Dr Maliki's abhorrence at the unending cycle of violence in Palestine, in particular recently in Gaza.&nbsp; When Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan stormed out from the panel in Davos last week, he expressed the anger which many people feel about the lives lost in Gaza when the Israeli Army moved in to stop the firing of rockets by Hamas into Israeli towns and villages.&nbsp; Singapore has good relations with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah.&nbsp; While we understand the legitimate right of Israel to self-defence and understand the fear they face when rockets could suddenly explode in their midst in the middle of the night, we were however dismayed by the disproportionate response.&nbsp; We hope the present ceasefire will hold.&nbsp; We support a two-state solution with the Palestinians having their own sovereign state on the West Bank and in Gaza.&nbsp; This can only happen if Hamas is prepared to work with Fatah and accepts the PLO's (Palestine Liberation Organisation's) commitment to renounce violence and recognise Israel.&nbsp; And Singapore has stated this position repeatedly at the UN and in various media releases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the world in disarray, Mr Chairman, MFA expects this to be a busy year.&nbsp; The international configuration is changing dramatically. We have to be alert to changes that could affect our well-being, avoiding dangers and seizing opportunities.&nbsp; We must continue to nurture good relations with all our neighbours and with all the major powers, and I thank Members of this House for&nbsp;their full and consistent support.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Public Housing</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, I beg to move,<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated&nbsp;for Head T of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans' ownership of their homes has not been spared the effects of the current economic recession.&nbsp; I have three areas of concern, which I believe will result directly from this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, smaller HDB flats.&nbsp; Home owners or potential home owners will be looking to downgrade&nbsp;or to purchase smaller flats.&nbsp; When times were good, the demand for these smaller units did not justify the building of new 1- to 3-room units.&nbsp; It is, however, reasonable to anticipate the demand for these units will rise if the economic situation continues its decline.&nbsp; Does MND foresee a need for new smaller size HDB flats to be constructed in view of Singaporeans' changing needs, and will we see more new 1- to 3-room flats being built?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the availability of HDB rental flats.&nbsp; My experience in the recent Meet-the-People Sessions is that more Singaporeans are having their flats compulsorily repossessed because of their personal financial difficulties.&nbsp; I am also seeing more residents who are having to voluntarily sell their flats to enable them to settle their debts.&nbsp; These ex-home <p align=left>Column: 2107<p>owners will need to obtain alternative housing and often look to rent flats from the HDB after they have moved out of their old flats.&nbsp; However, there is currently a 30-month debarment period from the time of sale within which they will be ineligible to obtain a rental flat from the HDB.&nbsp; Does MND anticipate that the current supply of HDB rental flats will have to be increased to cope for greater demand?&nbsp; And would MND consider amending the HDB rental flat eligibility criteria and the debarment period&nbsp;for those who have to sell their flats because of financial difficulty?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, downgrading.&nbsp; If someone is facing financial difficulties, it makes good economic sense that he should try and downgrade to a smaller property and use the unlocked equity from the sale of the larger unit to tide him over this difficult period.&nbsp; This is something, I think, should be encouraged where it is a realistic possibility.&nbsp; The difficulty with this is that the second concessionary interest rate of HDB loan is currently only available to those who are looking to upgrade to larger units and not to those who intend to downgrade.&nbsp; The latter category of home owners will generally have to take commercial bank rate loans to finance the new smaller flats.&nbsp; To further complicate matters, a number of these downgraders will not be able to obtain bank loans because of their financial situations and also, possibly, because banks' lending criteria have become more stringent.&nbsp;

Many finally relented to the resale HDB market, paying exorbitant cash-over-valuations as well as high HDB resale prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various reasons can be attributed for the rise in HDB prices.&nbsp; The most important is the switch by HDB from a cost-based pricing approach to a market-based pricing approach. The market-based pricing approach has resulted in escalation of both new and resale flat prices as both are benchmarked to one another in an upward spiral manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan):</B> With close to 90% of our population living in public housing and owning their flats, public housing affordability is both a critical and uniquely Singaporean issue which affects not only the housing options of citizens and PRs but also has implications on the cost of living.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public housing affordability is a perennial issue, whether in good times or bad.&nbsp; Due to a strong economy in 2007 and the first half of 2008, prices of HDB new and resale flats continued to escalate, outlasting even the prices of private residential properties which had already started retreating.&nbsp; This has led many Singaporeans, especially newly-weds and potential first-time home owners to feel that they are being priced even out of public housing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As resale flat prices have recorded hefty price increases, many young couples are unable to afford resale flats even with a housing grant and say that their only option is to buy a new HDB flat.&nbsp; But here lies another problem.&nbsp; Due to strong demand for new flats in the last few years, many have been unsuccessful in getting a flat even after numerous tries.&nbsp; Increasingly, I am seeing young couples coming to my MPS to appeal for faster allocation of a new HDB flat.&nbsp; In the last two years, it is hard even to get new flats in outlying areas like Jurong West and Woodlands, once shunned as "<I>ulu</I>"  due to strong demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The move to increase the maximum Additional Housing Grant (AHG)&nbsp;from $30,000 to $40,000 and raise the household income ceiling from $4,000 per <p align=left>Column: 2111<p>month to $5,000 per month are thus welcomed as they would help improve the affordability of public housing to first-time buyers, specifically low-income households.&nbsp; Since the AHG was implemented in 2006, it has been revised twice, once in 2007 and then this year under Budget 2009.&nbsp; However, rapidly rising resale flat prices could cause public housing affordability for first-time buyers to lag prices unless housing grants are revised regularly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, in a downmarket the prices of both new and resale flats tend to be more sticky as the Government could be cautious of the impact of reducing the sale prices of unsold new flats on existing home owners, whilst sellers in the resale market may hold out for better prices.&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to propose that the HDB commit to regular reviews of both the CPF and the additional housing grants at, say, yearly intervals to ensure that public housing remains affordable, at least to first-time buyers and low-income households.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the HDB should also look at pegging the prices of all new flats to the market prices of comparable resale flats at, say, the beginning of the year.&nbsp; This is similar to JTC's pricing of its industrial premises.&nbsp; Such yearly revisions will give more transparency and certainty to the pricing of new HDB flats and help mitigate the problems of affordability of new flats regardless of the state of the market. &nbsp;I would also add to what my Parliamentary colleague Dr Lim Wee Kiak said, not help to cause spiralling in prices of both resale and new flats because they feed on each other.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Currently, studio apartments and 2-room and 3-room flats are in great demand and more of these should be built at a faster pace.&nbsp; To increase affordability of housing, we should avoid building flats which look like condominium with value-added features.&nbsp;

At 95% home ownership, mostly in public housing, Singapore&rsquo;s housing achievement has been widely admired by many countries.&nbsp; This is a commendable feat.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the severity of this downturn will impact Singaporeans&rsquo; financial ability to purchase homes and service their mortgages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In most countries, even in the best of economic times, such high home ownership would not be possible to achieve. &nbsp;There will&nbsp;be&nbsp;segments of the lower income group, perhaps the lower 20%, who will either be unable to afford the initial downpayment and/or not be able to obtain loans or the inability to service the loans.&nbsp; In fact, this could have been the case for Singapore as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2113<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, according to the Department of Statistics, our lower income 10% of the households earned an average monthly income of $1,310 in 2008. &nbsp;Given&nbsp;our cost of living in Singapore, this group of Singaporeans survives on very thin margin for error in their day-to-day endeavour to make ends meet.&nbsp; This is already the case even without&nbsp;housing commitments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, therefore, remarkable that we are able to maintain such a high home ownership rate, even for our citizens in&nbsp;the lower 20% of our income group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three crucial features in our public housing policy make this high home ownership possible. &nbsp;They are, firstly,&nbsp;HDB flats are sold at subsidised price,&nbsp;secondly, generous housing grants, and thirdly, the HDB concessionary loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that the Government has, in response to the severe economic crisis that we are facing, further enhanced the CPF Housing Grants.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing further details from the Minister on the enhancements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I applaud the Government enhancements to the AHG, I also hope that MND can look into the unintended situations created in our efforts to make home ownership more affordable to the first-time flat buyer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often in my Meet-the-People sessions, I have residents who come to see me with regard to the difficulty they face in servicing their mortgage loans. &nbsp;They are usually from the lower income group with earnings of less than $2,000 per month. &nbsp;Besides working on a shoestring budget, their income streams are often uncertain as they are the most vulnerable in a downturn. Occasionally, when they are faced with any unforeseen circumstances or mishap at home, they will run into arrears for their mortgage repayments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2114<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I probe deeper into their situations, many of them are actually second or third-time home owners. &nbsp;In fact, what most often happens is that with the housing grants, the subsidised prices and the concessionary loans, they are able to get by with the purchasing and servicing of their first flat. &nbsp;They can manage the mortgage repayments because of the small loan quantum required. &nbsp;However, more often than not, the home owners would be tempted to sell their flats and cash out the gains as soon as the minimum occupation is served out. &nbsp;Given that they had bought the first flat at a subsidised price coupled with the generous housing grant, there is usually quite a tidy sum of cash proceeds. &nbsp;The problem begins when they buy another flat, now without the housing grant and the subsidised price.&nbsp; Their loan quantum will have to be increased and the corresponding monthly repayments increase sharply as well.&nbsp; So if the income level of these home owners has not increased sufficiently, they will soon run into problems servicing their mortgage repayments.&nbsp; The arrears will pile up and often leading to the dreadful consequences of compulsory acquisition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry will study ways to minimise this undesirable situation from recurring. &nbsp;Among possible measures&nbsp;&ndash; can HDB have dedicated financial counselling for these Singaporeans who are contemplating such a move so that they can be better advised on their new financial commitments?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, can the Ministry also look at ways of incentivising first-time home owners who have enjoyed the generous grant to stay in their flats longer before selling?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this downturn, other than enhancing the AHG, I hope that HDB can also enhance the existing financial assistance schemes, helping those who have problem servicing the mortgage <p align=left>Column: 2115<p>repayments due to the economic crisis.&nbsp; While downgrading to smaller flat is one option, there may be instances where high relocation and social costs make the downgrade not worthwhile. &nbsp;It is often the children&nbsp;who suffer when a family needs to downgrade and move to a new home, especially when it involves the change of schools.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

With this promise in mind, I would like to speak for a group of people who might feel that they have been left out&nbsp;&ndash; single mothers.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public housing policy for single mums has not changed, and those under 35 cannot buy HDB flats unless they go through a difficult process that is assessed on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; Mother and child are not considered a family unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, why does the Ministry keep a housing policy that undermines many other Government policy objectives?&nbsp; The authorities say they endeavour to prevent dysfunctional families.&nbsp; Is this better served by allowing mothers to find a roof over their head if they can afford to, or by preventing them from doing so?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Finance Minister said Singapore must be the best home to nurture our young.&nbsp; How is this served by preventing some of our children from benefiting from the security of their own home?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MND says it works to make home ownership a pillar for Singaporeans, to provide an asset that will grow in value.&nbsp; Does excluding single mums and their children strengthen or weaken this pillar?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2116<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of all, when it comes to single mums, how can the Prime Minister's promise be best fulfilled?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the very least, let us start somewhere.&nbsp; Why not allow single mums above 30 to be allowed to buy a flat?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can imagine the Ministry might say that the priority is for family units consisting of a father, mother and child.&nbsp; Sir, there are ideal families, but a mother and child are a family too.&nbsp; We allow divorced mothers to own a flat, why not single unwed mums.&nbsp; What is the difference?&nbsp; Ultimately, the fabric of our community is made up of all families, big and little.&nbsp; The question the Ministry must answer is whether their policy actually strengthens our families, or undermines our community and whether the Ministry is undermining or advancing our national interests on balance, as I have just listed, and in reality.&nbsp; I repeat, on balance and in reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of divorced mums, I would next like to touch on how a good number of them find it hard to afford their own homes, especially those who have little in their CPF accounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently came to know of one, whose husband walked out on her and their two children.&nbsp; She was a stay-at-home mum for a few years, with very little CPF and is not confident of buying a flat.&nbsp; But she probably would not qualify for public rental flats, either.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what can be done for these mums?&nbsp; Is it possible for those who had bought only one subsidised flat to purchase a second smaller flat direct from the HDB?&nbsp; Or can the HDB at least offer them concessionary loans, even if they buy resale flats?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, divorced mothers have to wait for their matrimonial homes to be <p align=left>Column: 2117<p>sold before they can find new&nbsp;housing, which can be delayed by uncooperative dads.&nbsp;

These are people who have fallen into financial difficulties and have to downgrade their flats. &nbsp;It is a practical and prudent action of these people who are trying to live within their means.&nbsp; The assumption that they could tap on their sale proceeds does not always hold true.&nbsp; Sometimes, there are no sale proceeds. &nbsp;Even if there are, the money is usually used to settle debts, arrears and other financial commitments.&nbsp;

I would like to suggest that the additional family CPF housing grant be also applicable to parents who have had a subsidy before but choose to move to&nbsp;new towns where their children are staying, places like Sengkang and Punggol.&nbsp; This would create a demand there and balance the age profile of residents in mature and new housing estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also urge our town planners to have a good mix of studio apartments, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-room flats in each estate for this reason.&nbsp;

On the other hand, how can we be sure that there&nbsp;is enough&nbsp;planning and designing that go into such housing, such that the dementiated will <p align=left>Column: 2122<p>not become an inconvenience to their neighbours?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my estate, which has a high proportion of elderly, I get complaints about the inconveniences suffered because of the behaviour of their&nbsp;lonely elderly neighbours, who could be throwing stuff down their high-rise flat or making noises in their flat in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Sir, I urge the HDB to continue&nbsp;sending teams to countries, like Japan, that have more experience in handling housing needs of the elderly.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;as Mr Liang Eng Hwa alluded to just now, our high home ownership rate has been a major Singapore success story.&nbsp; Statistics show that&nbsp;over 80% of Singaporeans live in public housing and over 95% of them actually own their own homes.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a remarkable home ownership rate.&nbsp; In fact, I believe it is one of the highest, if not the highest home ownership rate in the&nbsp;world, and more remarkably we have achieved this without going into&nbsp;heavy taxation or suffering a sub-prime crisis as in the US.&nbsp; Rather, through generous Government subsidies, whether it is in the form of&nbsp; a housing grant or whether it is through subsidised loans and an emphasis on prudence in home purchases, the vast majority of Singaporeans need not worry about not having a roof over their heads, even in this economic downturn.&nbsp; For those who face difficulties, the Government will help them cope with the economic crisis, including their housing problems.&nbsp; I will elaborate on this later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch a little bit on the philosophy behind our home ownership programme. I have explained this before but I think it is worth reiterating.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp;adopt a life-cycle approach in our home ownership programme, so that the <p align=left>Column: 2123<p>housing needs of Singaporeans are fully catered for over their lifetime. Let me elaborate.&nbsp; We start off with providing generous subsidies for young couples starting their own&nbsp;family, to buy their first home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When their family grows and they are financially ready, we facilitate their upgrading to a larger flat with another subsidised loan and this is the reason why we have kept the second subsidised loans for upgraders.&nbsp; I will talk about second subsidised loans for downgraders later on.&nbsp; Then to&nbsp;sustain the value of the flat over time, their flats as well as their&nbsp;estates are regularly rejuvenated and upgraded through various upgrading programmes.&nbsp; Finally, in their later years, we help them to unlock the value that is stored in their flats to provide for their old age.&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp;we start off helping them to buy a flat, preserving&nbsp;their value, finally unlocking that value.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, and Dr Amy Khor, among others, have&nbsp;asked whether HDB flats are affordable at current levels. Are HDB flats over-priced?&nbsp; Have they gone up in price faster than income?&nbsp; I think as far as affordability of HDB flats is concerned, my&nbsp;answer is an unequivocal "yes". We sell our HDB flats&nbsp;at a generous discount, either by pricing new flats below market value or giving a grant to buyers of resale flats.&nbsp; There is a CPF Housing Grant of $30,000, or a higher grant of $40,000 if they stay near their parents.&nbsp; We have also introduced&nbsp;an Additional Housing Grant, or AHG, to help the lower-income families. This year, we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;enhance the AHG further.&nbsp; I will elaborate on this&nbsp;later.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people talk about&nbsp;affordability, what do they mean?&nbsp; What is affordability?&nbsp; There are generally-accepted criteria to measure affordability&nbsp;which we have adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp;So&nbsp;we&nbsp;monitor affordability by how much a flat buyer has to pay out of his monthly household income, in order&nbsp;to <p align=left>Column: 2124<p>service his mortgage loan.&nbsp; This is a commonly used indicator in the financial industry, they call it&nbsp;the debt-service ratio (DSR).&nbsp; A DSR of 30% or below, is accepted as an indication that housing is affordable. In other words, it is reasonable that you spend not more than 30% of your total household income on housing.&nbsp; In some countries, this measure is also used to measure how much rental they spend out of their total household income.&nbsp; So whether it is rental or whether it is mortgage payments, 30% or below is the benchmark to measure affordability.&nbsp; So what is the situation in Singapore for HDB flats? &nbsp;In 2008, the DSR for purchases of new HDB flats was 21% overall, well within the affordability benchmark of 30%.&nbsp; In other words, households use 21% of their total household income to pay for housing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you a little bit more detail about this.&nbsp; I show you a chart which shows the&nbsp;average DSRs for different flat types, based on the median income of actual applicants last year.&nbsp; For example, a 2-room flat, the average price was $88,000, but the median income of buyers for 2-room flats was $1,280.&nbsp; And the DSR for a 2-room flat was 18%.&nbsp; So they use 18% of the median income of $1,280.&nbsp; So for a 3-room flat, DSR 24%; 4-room, 21%; 5-room, 23%; and average 21%.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;see that&nbsp;the DSR for almost all flat types was lower than 23%.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; Why 23%?&nbsp; Because 23% is the monthly CPF contribution that can be used to pay for housing mortgages.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;that&nbsp;loan repayment which is below 23% of total household income can&nbsp;be serviced entirely by their monthly CPF contributions.&nbsp; They do not need to come out with any cash.&nbsp; So if you take a typical 4-roomer, household income $4,000 plus,&nbsp;debt-service ratio of 21%, he does not have to pay any cash to buy that new 4-room flat which cost about $250,000.&nbsp; This is the best way of measuring affordability, to show that, if you compare <p align=left>Column: 2125<p>incomes with house flat prices, flat buyers&nbsp;in each category of flat&nbsp;are able to afford their flats.&nbsp; This does not mean to say that a person with a median income of $1,200 buying a 5-room flat will not have&nbsp;a problem of affordability.&nbsp; This is why HDB builds a whole range of flats, which will cater to&nbsp;different income groups.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from affordability,&nbsp;we also need to worry about the supply of flats.&nbsp; And many Members have asked about supply of flats.&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong, Dr Lim Wee Kiak,&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah, among others,&nbsp;asked whether HDB will offer more lower-priced flats, especially during this economic downturn.&nbsp;The answer is "yes". For the first half of 2009, HDB plans to launch about 3,000 flats for sale, out&nbsp;of which&nbsp;half or 1,400 will either be studio apartments, two-room and three-room flats.&nbsp; The basic no-frills flats, as&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah would call them.&nbsp; Over the next&nbsp;two years, there will be about 2,000 such smaller flats launched each year.&nbsp; We will increase the supply of smaller and lower-priced flats further, if necessary, if the demand for such flats goes up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another common question raised by Members in this House&nbsp;&ndash; Mr Charles Chong, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Dr Amy Khor&nbsp;&ndash; is&nbsp;about&nbsp;residents who have complained about not being able to get HDB flats.&nbsp; They have balloted unsuccessfully, many times, especially in mature estates, or&nbsp;as Dr Amy Khor mentioned,&nbsp;"even in the <I>ulu</I> estates".&nbsp; Let me elaborate a little on this.&nbsp; HDB sells flats in two ways.&nbsp; One is through&nbsp;the balloting exercise, and one is through the BTO exercise.&nbsp; In the balloting exercise, the flats that are offered are those that are surplus flats after SERS-affected residents have selected their flats.&nbsp; So they are limited in number.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;in mature estates.&nbsp; They are very popular for these reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;it is not unexpected that when HDB ballots these flats, the number of applicants&nbsp;is in the <p align=left>Column: 2126<p>thousands, when the flats&nbsp;available are in the hundreds.&nbsp; So as a result, the chances of&nbsp;applicants&nbsp;getting a flat successfully in these ballots&nbsp;are very low.&nbsp; And these are the ones who always come back to us&nbsp;and&nbsp;say, " I have&nbsp;balloted many times&nbsp;and I&nbsp;cannot get a flat".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, that is not the only way HDB sells flats.&nbsp; In fact, HDB&nbsp;sells&nbsp;the bulk of its flats under the BTO scheme, which is a demand-responsive scheme.&nbsp; In other words, applicants apply for a flat and&nbsp;they indicate that&nbsp;they want to buy&nbsp;the flat,&nbsp;then HDB builds.&nbsp; So from the time&nbsp;you buy&nbsp;until the time&nbsp;you get&nbsp;your flat, typically, it is about three years, which is about the time&nbsp;you usually&nbsp;wait for a new private property in any case.&nbsp; All&nbsp;the BTO exercises that HDB has conducted in recent months have been undersubscribed.&nbsp; In other words, there are more than enough new flats supply from the BTO exercises to cater to the demand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to give you an example, there were two BTO selection exercises that were recently completed,&nbsp;one was called&nbsp;Fernvale Residence and the other one was called&nbsp;Punggol Breeze.&nbsp; Both of these are in Punggol.&nbsp; After all the applicants&nbsp;were asked to select their flats, there were&nbsp;still about 200 flats left for sale.&nbsp; Some of those who were asked to select the flats actually did not select the flats, even though there were many flats available.&nbsp; We do not know why they did not select&nbsp;a flat.&nbsp; There are many good reasons, but if any of those residents were to come back&nbsp;and say that they could not get a flat,&nbsp;the first question&nbsp;to ask them is whether they have actually been&nbsp;offered but&nbsp;have not selected.&nbsp; I have received quite a few complaints or cases from Members of this House, complaining about the issue&nbsp;of their residents not getting a flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question I&nbsp;asked them is to get me the details, let me know who is the person and&nbsp;I will check.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the cases that I have checked, have been cases where the applicants&nbsp;have <p align=left>Column: 2127<p>been offered&nbsp;but they have not selected a flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have often gone back to&nbsp;Members with full details so that they can then approach their residents to further clarify why is it that they did not select a flat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the point I am trying to make is, there are new flats available. Not all flats will be available in mature estates because we do not have the land for this.&nbsp; Not all flats will be available&nbsp;immediately for occupation, but, certainly, there will be flats available, although it may not be in an estate,&nbsp;or on a floor of their choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And certainly, we will make such flats available in more estates, and in a speedier manner&nbsp;with a wider selection over time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move on to the issue about Additional Housing Grant&nbsp;(AHG).&nbsp; I think all Members accept and realise that we need to incentivise young couples and low-income families to buy their&nbsp;first homes, and the Government will give them more help to do so, especially in these difficult times.&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduced the AHG&nbsp;in 2006 for this particular purpose&nbsp;&ndash; to give the low-income an extra leg-up in owning their flats.&nbsp; In 2007, we enhanced this scheme and this year, we are going to do even more.&nbsp; How will we enhance the&nbsp;scheme?&nbsp;The maximum AHG amount for those earning less than $1,500 monthly will be increased by $10,000 to $40,000.&nbsp; In addition, to help not only the low-income, but also middle-income families, we will raise the income ceiling for the AHG from $4,000 to $5,000.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AHG also has&nbsp;a "two-year continuous work" condition.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;to make sure that&nbsp;flat buyers have the ability to sustain their mortgage payments.&nbsp; HDB will reduce this work condition to&nbsp;one year.&nbsp; In other words, it will be easier for applicants to now qualify for the AHG.&nbsp;With these enhancements, we have doubled the amount that the lowest-<p align=left>Column: 2128<p>income families receive, from $20,000 in 2006, when we implemented the AHG, to $40,000 today.&nbsp;&nbsp; So in two years,&nbsp;we have&nbsp;doubled it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also doubled the&nbsp;number of families benefiting from the AHG from about 4,000 in 2006 to now, about 8,000&nbsp;per year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give some specific examples of how the AHG works.&nbsp; If you take a young couple earning $1,500 a month, buying a new two-room flat with the average price of about&nbsp;$90,000.&nbsp; With the AHG of $40,000, they will need a loan of about&nbsp;$50,000.&nbsp; To repay that loan of $50,000 will cost them $200 a month or 13% of income.&nbsp; In other words, all of these repayments can be made through their CPF.&nbsp; No cash involved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take another case of a&nbsp;family buying a four-room flat, say, middle-income family with $4,000 household income.&nbsp; They buy a resale 4-room flat at $315,000 near their parents, so they get a CPF Housing&nbsp;Grant of $40,000, and with the added&nbsp;AHG of $15,000, the loan will be about $260,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;The monthly instalment&nbsp;will be&nbsp;$1,041. &nbsp;This is 26% of their household income.&nbsp; 23% of that will come from their CPF.&nbsp; They need to come up&nbsp;with&nbsp;$121 in cash&nbsp;&ndash; 4% of their monthly take-home pay.&nbsp; So, this is how we will incentivise and we will&nbsp;help low-income and even middle-income families to own their own homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the above policy adjustments, families will get significant extra help to buy their first homes.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;want to take this opportunity to remind flat buyers to exercise financial discipline and prudence.&nbsp; My advice to young families is this&nbsp;&ndash; start with the right flat, one that is within your means, and upgrade only if you can afford it and when needed.&nbsp;I agree with Mr Liang Eng Hwa that home owners should hold on to their flats and not cash out too often, too soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do see, many times,&nbsp;families selling their flats for a&nbsp;good profit, use up their cash proceeds,&nbsp;run into <p align=left>Column: 2129<p>difficulties servicing the mortgage payments for the&nbsp;larger flat that they have purchased.&nbsp; These are some of the examples,&nbsp;I think, all of us as Members of Parliament see in our MPS.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to stress that HDB flats are for the long term.&nbsp; They are not for speculation.&nbsp; They are not for quick profit.&nbsp; Those who have bought subsidised HDB flats are required to live in their flats for at least&nbsp;five years before they can sell in the open market.&nbsp; This helps to guard against speculation.&nbsp; The CPF Housing Grant and the AHG that I spoke about earlier, must be refunded into buyers' CPF accounts when the flats are sold, to ensure that flat owners do not cash out their subsidies too soon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has also put in place measures to ensure that buyers do not over-stretch themselves when purchasing flats.&nbsp; They do credit assessment.&nbsp; They require&nbsp;a HDB Loan Eligibility (HLE) letter so that&nbsp;people know exactly how much loan they can get, before they commit to a flat purchase.&nbsp; This may seem quite self-evident that you find out how much you can borrow before you buy a flat, but you will be surprised how many flat buyers buy a flat without knowing how much loan they can get.&nbsp; And this is why we had to implement the HLE.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, ultimately, flat buyers and flat owners need to exercise financial prudence and live according to their means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me turn to the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS).&nbsp; Many Members have asked about it.&nbsp; The LBS follows upon what I said earlier.&nbsp; If&nbsp;owners hold on to&nbsp;their flat for the long term,&nbsp;they will&nbsp;be in a position to unlock the value of their flats when they grow old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members &ndash;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong, Mr Masagos, Dr Faishal and Mdm Ho Geok Choo, among others &ndash;&nbsp;have&nbsp;asked for more details of the&nbsp;LBS.&nbsp; I am happy to announce and inform them that we have finalised the details with all the relevant parties and we <p align=left>Column: 2130<p>are ready to&nbsp;kick off the LBS&nbsp;with effect from&nbsp;1st March this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be having a&nbsp;major launch for this purpose and we will involve all the advisers, especially those who have larger numbers of senior citizens in their constituency in this exercise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LBS is one of our key initiatives to facilitate flat monetisation by the elderly.&nbsp;&nbsp;It targets those who own smaller flats,&nbsp;2-room and 3-room flats, who have enjoyed not more than one housing subsidy.&nbsp; It is another subsidised scheme because the&nbsp;Government will be&nbsp;providing a $10,000 grant to anyone who signs on&nbsp;this scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the LBS, HDB will buy back the remaining flat lease, less the first 30 years.&nbsp; In other words, if&nbsp;there is a 70-year lease&nbsp;remaining, we will buy back 40 years and leave the first 30 years.&nbsp; In return, the lessee gets a $5,000 upfront sign-on bonus and a lifetime income stream from a CPF annuity plan.&nbsp; $5,000 upfront plus income for life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if I take&nbsp;an example of a 62-year-old male lessee of a 3-room flat with a typical resale price of $236,000.&nbsp; Under the LBS, he gets to stay on&nbsp;in the same flat albeit with a reduced lease of 30 years. After he receives his first LBS <I>ang pow</I> of $5,000, he will continue to get monthly payouts of about $530 for life.&nbsp;&nbsp;$5,000 cash upfront and $530 for life, and he remains&nbsp;where he is.&nbsp; He can do whatever he likes.&nbsp; He can rent out an extra room.&nbsp;&nbsp;He can move.&nbsp; He can rent out&nbsp;one or two rooms and keep the cash.&nbsp; And on top of that, he has the CPF LIFE.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Masagos and Dr Faishal asked what will happen should an LBS applicant pass away before the end of the 30-year lease.&nbsp; If such an unfortunate event happens, his wife or child will be given the option of either staying in the flat for the rest of the 30 years, or getting a refund of the remaining flat lease.&nbsp; Further, they will be given the full refund of the undrawn premium from the annuity <p align=left>Column: 2131<p>plan.&nbsp; Let me elaborate.&nbsp; For example, if $100,000 was used&nbsp;from the sale&nbsp;of the flat to purchase the annuity plan, and the lessee passes away after receiving $10,000, his estate will be given the&nbsp;remaining $90,000, so he will not lose any of the annuity that is unused.</p></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

For those who live beyond the 30 years of the flat lease, we will guarantee them a roof over their head thereafter.&nbsp; We will look at individual cases.&nbsp; If there is a need and a&nbsp;possibility to extend the lease, we will do so.&nbsp; If not, we will find them an alternative accommodation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the LBS will increase the housing and monetisation options available to our elderly lessees.&nbsp; I strongly urge eligible flat lessees to sign on to this scheme.&nbsp; It is a good and generous scheme.&nbsp; And I would like to urge advisers, Members of this House, to explain this scheme to their residents, and I would ask HDB to work with the advisers to provide more details of the scheme especially to their senior citizens, so that more of them will be able to take advantage of the LBS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few Members have asked whether we can extend this scheme to other lessees, eg, 4-room flat lessees or larger flats.&nbsp; My response to them would be this: let us wait until we roll out this scheme for the 3-roomers and below and, say, after six months or a year, gauge the response, get the feedback from the public, and then we will decide.&nbsp; But I am open to the idea of extending this scheme to others if there is a good demand for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now talk about studio apartments.&nbsp; I think Dr Faishal mentioned <p align=left>Column: 2132<p>studio apartments as a good and popular option.&nbsp; It is a popular option because all the studio apartments that we have built have been taken up.&nbsp; So we will build more.&nbsp; Over the next two years, we are going to build 1,000 more studio apartments, and we will build them in various parts of Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Baey mentioned, we are going to build them in non-matured towns, eg,&nbsp;Chua Chu Kang and&nbsp;Woodlands.&nbsp; We are going to make sure that there is a good social mix of studio apartments with other types of flats, so that there is a good ambience and community being built around them.&nbsp; So he might want to encourage some of his constituents to sign on to the studio apartments in places like Woodlands, Chua Chu Kang, Tampines or other places, and not just in Queenstown or Bukit Merah.&nbsp; All of these options will help our senior citizens and our people to monetise their flats.&nbsp; In these difficult times, we will commit to making sure that housing remains a key pillar of our Home Ownership Programme.&nbsp; And we are going to support home ownership through enhanced AHG.&nbsp; We are going to build more lower-price flats, and we will also introduce the LBS to offer more monetisation options for the elderly.&nbsp; But I emphasise these are not short-term measures that are reacting to the current situation.&nbsp; These are actually long-term solutions designed to help Singaporeans in need while we strengthen the social security framework, so that people not only do not have to worry about a roof over their heads but they will also have security in their old age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I just want to reiterate my note of caution&nbsp;&ndash; because I feel this is something that is not emphasised enough&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that when flat buyers buy their flats, they must be prudent in their financial planning.&nbsp; As&nbsp;Mr Liang pointed out, the generous subsidies that are given by Government may encourage some people to cash out too early.&nbsp; These subsidies are meant to help our citizens build their nest <p align=left>Column: 2133<p>egg for their golden years. They should not be treated as a windfall to be used or consumed prematurely or spent.&nbsp; But despite our best efforts, I grant that some Singaporeans will still fall into financial difficulties especially in these tough times, and I will elaborate on how we can help this group later on.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Flat Owners in Financial Difficulties</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim:</B> Sir, with the economic downturn, many home owners may face retrenchments and job losses.&nbsp; They may struggle to pay their HDB loans.&nbsp; I would like to know how the HDB will help these home owners cope with their loan payments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to urge&nbsp;the HDB to demonstrate compassion and generosity in helping these residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home owners who had gone through such experiences in the past could actually share their personal experiences with those experiencing their plight now to help the latter manage their problems better.&nbsp; I would like to ask&nbsp;the HDB if they have a platform akin to that of a support group to help these financially stricken home owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the HDB consider helping the setting up of support groups for such purpose?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to urge the HDB to facilitate the process of timely downgrading for those who genuinely need to do so.&nbsp; This will help them avert from going deeper into their financial woes.&nbsp; For those whose flats have been foreclosed, we should do all we can to assist them secure alternative or temporary housing.&nbsp; Wherever possible, we should avoid situations where the family members are&nbsp;displaced due to the unavailability of housing options.&nbsp; We do not want a situation where the children and&nbsp;their parents&nbsp;have to stay at different locations due to the foreclosure of their <p align=left>Column: 2134<p>flats.&nbsp; This will result in the disintegration of the family unit, lower morale and affect the development of our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I often observe that those who are unable to manage their HDB loans often have arrears with SP Services, property tax as well as Town Council.&nbsp; I feel that not only do these residents need help to pay their arrears, they would also need support to manage their stress levels and the financial knowledge and skills to get them out of the vicious cycle of outstanding loans and arrears.&nbsp; I would like to propose that the Government take an inter-Ministry and agency integrated approach to assist these residents in managing their current financial burden, as well as to get them stay out of the arrears cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our quest to encourage home ownership among our people, it is also important that we continue to educate them about property ownership and their responsibilities when owning properties.&nbsp; I would like to know what other plans the HDB has in enhancing the understanding of&nbsp;home ownership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as we move&nbsp;deeper into the economic crisis, I am concerned that the number of housing loan arrears may increase.&nbsp; As such, there may be a risk of a sub-prime crisis in Singapore.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry how the HDB intends to prevent such a sub-prime crisis from taking place here.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> As at October 2008, it was reported that there are 33,000 flat owners owing HDB arrears of three months or more.&nbsp; This is about 8% of the 420,000 households with outstanding mortgages. While this percentage is not very high, it cannot be said to be low either.&nbsp; In absolute terms, 33,000 homes in arrears for three months or more is cause for concern.&nbsp; Sure, some of these might be just slow in settlement for all sorts of reasons&nbsp;&ndash;

Undoubtedly, as the economic thunderstorm ravages on, this number will certainly increase.&nbsp; All MPs, myself included, have our fair share of residents coming to our MPS to appeal for help to sort out their housing arrears or rental woes.&nbsp; In fact, the number of such appeals has risen significantly especially in the last two years.&nbsp; Proportion wise, such appeals are among the highest in our MPS case load.&nbsp; Whilst MND has time and again assured this House that HDB will assist households with mortgage arrears on a case-by-case basis, we continue to see mounting unresolved repeat cases as well as new arrears cases.&nbsp; Admittedly, HDB has been flexible and made exceptions for some of these cases to waive the debarment period, allow them to downgrade with a subsidised HDB loan, while some have been allocated a rental flat.&nbsp; But the number of resolved cases remains a small fraction of the number of appeal cases we receive.&nbsp; Is this a sign of recalcitrants or is there something deeper?&nbsp; While it is not reasonable to expect all appeal cases to be resolved since not all may be deserving cases, providing some certainty and transparency through reviewing some relevant HDB policies will go a long way in mitigating the problem.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me make four suggestions for MND to consider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, HDB should change its two-bite-of-the-cherry policy and allow downgraders to obtain a second subsidised HDB housing loan.&nbsp; This would allow even those who are not already in arrears but nonetheless have financial difficulties to downgrade.&nbsp; After all, the policy that only upgraders who are purchasing directly from HDB for the second time can enjoy a second subsidised HDB loan was <p align=left>Column: 2136<p>implemented many years ago when upgrading was a norm.&nbsp; Times have changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second suggestion: HDB should make available flats to be sold directly to those in mortgage arrears with genuine financial difficulty to allow them to downgrade as quickly as possible, so that they do not accumulate even more arrears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, HDB should also give some priority to those with severe financial difficulty and wanting to sell their existing flat, and then rent a flat from HDB.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, as a concession to badly hit households during this recession, HDB should also relax its policy on loan deferments or allow home owners to dip into their CPF Special Account to pay for their housing loans.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports and Minister for Transport (Mr Teo Ser Luck)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, sometimes, when crises hit like the situation right now, we are seeing more and more cases of families that are looking&nbsp;to downgrade.&nbsp; And I have seen about 20% increase in the cases in my constituency.&nbsp; They have defaulted on their loans, piled up on their arrears, they tried to get private bank loans or, if they are on private bank loans, they try to get refinancing&nbsp;but they could not.&nbsp; So they are left in the lurch; they do not know what to do.&nbsp; And many a time when we make the appeal for HDB loans, the applications&nbsp;get rejected.&nbsp; They do not have a clear idea of what happened, neither do we.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many of my colleagues, we feel that it is difficult to explain to residents.&nbsp; Maybe it is time to review the policies and what we can do for them because I see more and more of these families coming&nbsp;to the MPS for these cases.&nbsp; So I hope that the HDB or <p align=left>Column: 2137<p>the Ministry can review this and help these families.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir,&nbsp;Members have asked how my Ministry intends to help those home owners who are facing financial difficulties during this time.&nbsp; Let me explain what we have done and will be doing.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, as a short-term assistance measure, if households show that their income has been affected because of retrenchment or a wage reduction, HDB will temporarily reduce or even defer their loan repayments for up to six months.&nbsp; This gives them time to make adjustments to their lifestyles and consider longer-term options.&nbsp; However, reducing the loan repayment cannot be a solution in itself, especially in cases where the poor financial situation is likely to persist.&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer we stretch the reduced repayments, the more the interest accumulates.&nbsp; More seriously, households may be lulled into a false sense of financial security, and reduce their resolve to settle their financial problems decisively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not talking about hypothetical situations here.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;last economic slowdown in 2003/2004, if you look at all the&nbsp;arrear cases,&nbsp; HDB allowed very long periods of reduced repayments.&nbsp; Today, what we have in the files are&nbsp;some 6,500 households in arrears who were granted periods of reduced or deferred repayments that accumulated to more than&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; Some of them are owing three to four years in arrears.&nbsp; We have hoped that by giving them more time, they would be better able to resolve their financial problems.&nbsp; Instead, they remain unable to service their loans and they are not nearer to a sustainable solution.&nbsp; In fact, their circumstances have worsened significantly, and their arrears have gone up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a salutary lesson for us.&nbsp; If a patient needs surgery to get well, we cannot just keep on giving him painkillers.&nbsp; We will do him more harm in the long run <p align=left>Column: 2138<p>by storing up more problems for the future.&nbsp; That is why HDB has shifted the focus from giving short-term relief to helping our arrear cases find longer-term sustainable solutions.&nbsp; To do this, we also need individual households to be realistic and prepared to make tough but necessary adjustments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some, such&nbsp;adjustment entails subletting a room or even the whole flat, where circumstances permit.&nbsp; In many other cases, the most viable solution is for the household to right-size their flat and reduce their loan by downgrading.&nbsp;&nbsp;So HDB will help households in financial difficulty to downgrade.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They will facilitate this process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will provide them with an additional loan. Mr Charles Chong, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Mr Baey Yam Keng and many others have called for HDB to give downgrading loans.&nbsp; HDB generally will not provide another loan to downgraders because usually they have enough proceeds from the sale of their larger flat.&nbsp; But for those who need help in this difficult time, HDB will be flexible and will help them with another loan to buy a smaller flat. So there is no overall change in policy, but recognising the situation, HDB will be more flexible for such things.&nbsp;<I>De facto</I>, those who are in difficulty and want to downgrade will be able to get another HDB loan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, HDB will make available low-cost flats where necessary to help those in need to downgrade. This is what Dr Army Khor requested for just now.&nbsp; This is a small vulnerable group and HDB will help them source for affordable resale flats.&nbsp; If need be, HDB will also directly purchase flats from the open market to sell it to them.&nbsp; In this way, these households do not need to pay any Cash-over-value (CoV) valuation or the HDB resale levy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2139<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB will also make available some of HDB's unsold stock of&nbsp;lower cost flats to these cases in financial difficulty.&nbsp; HDB has some stock of low-cost flats that were built in the early years that are still available and these&nbsp;can be sold to some of these households who are in severe financial difficulty.&nbsp; I want to stress that these are special measures for exceptional cases of financial difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we recognise that some households in difficulty may need temporary accommodation as they downgrade from their current flat.&nbsp; Some may be waiting for their new two-room flat to be completed. To tide them over this period, HDB will refer deserving cases to its managing agent for a temporary rental of a room at&nbsp;below market rate.&nbsp;Sir, by helping families to right-size their flats, we allow them to remain as homeowners.&nbsp; But for those in financial difficulty, who cannot afford a smaller flat in spite of our help, HDB will consider allocating a rental flat to them if they have no other housing options.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make sure that families in financial difficulty are given proper advice, HDB has deployed special housing counsellors at every HDB branch office. The job of these housing counsellors is to look at each and every case holistically and comprehensively. So, when we talk about a sustainable solution, we are talking about painstakingly going through each and every case, making sure that they know what are options available, working out the sums.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having available those options at their disposal,&nbsp;HDB will be able to guide them and direct them to the right solution.&nbsp; This is a very complex and painstaking task as I have said.&nbsp; But I have asked HDB to press on because we want homeowners to find a viable long-term solution.&nbsp; We want them to sleep easily and soundly at night, with a roof <p align=left>Column: 2140<p>over their heads without having to worry about financial problems. No effort will be spared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, HDB officers made more than 60,000 house visits on arrears-related matters and conducted over 35,000 interviews and financial counselling sessions.&nbsp; I have asked for these figures because I have been pressing HDB to do more and they tell me that all their officers have been harnessed for this effort.&nbsp; I have had to encourage them and explain to them why it is important for us to do so, even though it is a lot more work.&nbsp; A lot of these interviews and&nbsp;counselling sessions have to be conducted even outside office hours because sometimes, flat owners are not at home during the day.&nbsp; But they must press on because if they do not, the problems facing these households will accumulate and become worse over time.&nbsp; But despite our best efforts, some households are still not prepared to face up to&nbsp;the reality of their circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, there&nbsp;are more than 15,000 HDB loan cases that are in arrears for over a year. Some deliberately ignore HDB's frequent calls and house visits.&nbsp; Whilst HDB has exercised patience, at some point, a line must be drawn.&nbsp; If the lessee remains unmoved, HDB has no choice but to issue a notice to acquire the flat.&nbsp; Otherwise, his debts may spiral to the point of negative equity.&nbsp; This would be even worse for the flat owner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even when HDB issues a notice of compulsory acquisition, it is still with the intent and hope that the lessee comes to realise the seriousness of his situation.&nbsp; And if he is serious about selling his flat without any more delay, HDB may withdraw the compulsory acquisition notice. Otherwise, they may have to proceed.&nbsp; But HDB will ensure that the lessee has a viable housing option, including a rental flat, if necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2141<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So for those who fall into financial difficulty, HDB will spare no effort to help them work towards a financially sustainable housing solution, particularly, help them downgrade to a more affordable flat with another loan. Downgrading is a tough decision.&nbsp; It requires adjustment to lifestyle, even with some discomfort.&nbsp; But, ultimately, it is in the best interest of the family as it allows them to get a fresh start to rebuild and recover from their financial setback.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to end by highlighting a family which made such a decision.&nbsp; Mdm Tan Suay Yan was in this predicament&nbsp;and took the advice after quite a long consultation process. She wrote a letter to <I>Zaobao</I> to explain her experience and gave some good advice.&nbsp; Her husband lost his job and the family started to accumulate arrears. They downgraded to a flat that HDB found for them. They cleared their arrears&nbsp;and their financial situation today&nbsp;is much improved.&nbsp;In&nbsp;her letter to <I>Zaobao</I>, she used the term "<I>ku kou po xin</I>", in other words, the HDB officers patiently and painstakingly gave them advice.&nbsp; She also urged those who are in financial woes to "<I>jiao ta shi di</I>, <I>liang ru wei chu</I> ", in other words, be realistic, spend within your means. So this is indeed what I urge loan mortgagors to do if they find themselves in financial difficulty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the right thing and we will help them and support them every step of the way.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>HDB Rental Flats</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:</B> Sir, quite a number of residents come to see me to appeal for a rental flat during the Meet-the-People session.&nbsp; The situation will be exacerbated with the worsening financial situation that has impacted Singapore.

It was reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 25th April 2008 that the waiting time for a rental flat was&nbsp;two to three&nbsp;months in 2006. &nbsp;In 2008, it was about nine&nbsp;to 18&nbsp;months. This underscores the increasing number of people who are caught in financial difficulty because of this recession.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, the goal of the Government is still home ownership and that I do support, but for the interim when times are bad, a roof over one's head, even if rented, is better than no roof at all!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given time, when these tenants' circumstances improve, they can choose to buy over their flats.&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I believe if this group of needy Singaporeans cannot find affordable housing, we will soon have more social problems, like stressed out families, domestic strife, juvenile delinquency, maybe even increased crime.&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the HDB what alternatives are there if&nbsp;people on the rental queue are not able to get a&nbsp;rental flat fast enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, having said that, I note that the MND is building 2,260 rental units this year.

These are the people that we have designed the public rental scheme for because it serves as a final safety net for them to provide for their housing needs.&nbsp; We will further enhance this rental housing safety net to help low-income Singaporeans to weather the economic downturn. We will do this in several ways.&nbsp; Let me elaborate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will continue to keep the rents low for our public rental tenants. Second, we will increase the supply of rental flats significantly. And finally, we will take steps to manage demand and safeguard rental flats for the deserving, so that they are not crowded out by the less needy.&nbsp; Let me talk about how we will keep rents low.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Finance announced in the Budget speech that we will give our rental tenants another month of rent rebates for 2009.&nbsp; One-room tenants will enjoy four rent-free months for the whole year;&nbsp;2-room tenants will enjoy three rent-free months for the whole year. These rent rebates are on top of the heavy rent discounts that we are already providing.&nbsp; Most of rental tenants, in fact, 85% of our rental tenants, pay the basic tier rent. This basic tier rent is less than 10% of the open market rate. Taking the increased rent rebates into consideration, the total rent that they need to pay for 2009, ie, for the whole year, for a 1-room tenant, is $240 and,&nbsp;for a two-room tenant, it is $540.&nbsp; If we take the current rentals that they are paying, if you discount it and remove the rebate for those months that they do not have to pay, that is what they are paying&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an average of $20 a month for one-roomers and $45 a month for two-roomers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the other 6,000 tenants with relative higher income, their rents are not fixed but pegged to 30%-50% of the <p align=left>Column: 2145<p>market rate. To help this group of tenants, we have deferred the market adjustment of the rental rates.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, 30% market rate for 1-room flat is $160 per month, but HDB charges the tenant only $110 a month.&nbsp; We will freeze the market rate adjustment for 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, HDB has frozen its rental rate alignment exercise.&nbsp; This is a little bit complicated.&nbsp; So let me explain a little bit.&nbsp; You remember that in November 2006, HDB announced that tenants earning above $800 per month would see their rental rates increase over two rounds of tenancy renewals, or four years.&nbsp; So every round is&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; This is the rental alignment exercise.&nbsp; The first round started&nbsp;in November 2006,&nbsp;the second and final round was supposed to start&nbsp;in November 2008.&nbsp; It would have affected 6,000 rental tenants.&nbsp; But in view of the economic downturn, HDB will freeze this second round of rent alignment for a year.&nbsp; So it would not be implemented by November 2008, as originally planned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, let me address the supply and demand of public rental flats.&nbsp; Mr Masagos asked how my Ministry intends to cope with the increasing number of rental applicants.&nbsp; Yes, every month, there are more new applicants than there are people giving up their rental flats.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three&nbsp;hundred&nbsp;new applicants join the rental queue every month.&nbsp; The number of people returning flats is 150.&nbsp; Over and above that, there are over 500 appeals from Members of this House each month, from those who do not qualify for rental housing, who are not&nbsp;on the queue at the moment.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;all Members would know that this is probably the largest item on the agenda, as far as MPS is concerned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the queue today, there are now 4,550 applicants.&nbsp; Some are really in need of help but they are on the queue.&nbsp; They <p align=left>Column: 2146<p>have no&nbsp;housing options and the rental flat is really the final safety net for them and their families.&nbsp; For this group, we have started to build more rental flats since 2007.&nbsp; Going forward, HDB will accelerate its rental flat building programme.&nbsp; So, by 2012, we will increase the stock of HDB rental flats to 50,000 units, from the current 42,000 units, that means&nbsp;an increase of 20%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just increasing the supply alone will not solve the supply-demand mismatch. &nbsp;There is an overwhelming demand for rental flats from those who have alternative housing options.&nbsp; Who are these people?&nbsp; They either have the financial means to buy or rent a flat in the open market, or they have family members who could easily accommodate them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB&rsquo;s rental flats are very heavily subsidised so it is not surprising that these people also&nbsp;join in the queue.&nbsp; As I said,&nbsp;the rent for a 1-room flat for the&nbsp;whole year can be as low as $240, which is probably half&nbsp;of one-month rental for a 1-room in the market. &nbsp;So our rental flats have now become a cheap and attractive option for those who want to cash out of their ownership flats, or for children who want their elderly parents to live elsewhere or for elderly parents who want to live away from their children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give&nbsp;Members two real-life examples.&nbsp; One rental applicant had&nbsp;a 5-room flat, sold it after paying off his loan, received net proceeds of $325,000&nbsp;&ndash; more than enough to buy a studio apartment, a 2-room flat,&nbsp;a 3-room flat or even a 4-room, for that matter.&nbsp; But he is now in our&nbsp;rental queue.&nbsp; He meets our current eligibility criteria: he has zero income,&nbsp;he&nbsp;waited 30 months after selling his flat.&nbsp; So he is eligible under the current rules.&nbsp; Another applicant&nbsp;&ndash; an elderly couple&nbsp;&ndash; happily staying with&nbsp;their child in a private condominium.&nbsp; They can continue <p align=left>Column: 2147<p>to do so.&nbsp; Instead, they chose to apply for a rental flat. Again, they qualify&nbsp;&ndash; they are retirees, they have zero income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are, by no means, isolated cases.&nbsp; Two-thirds of applicants in the rental queue currently comprise households who used to own an HDB flat.&nbsp; In other words, they are second-timers.&nbsp; They bought a subsidised HDB flat&nbsp;and enjoyed a housing subsidy previously.&nbsp; Now they have cashed out and they are coming back for a heavily-subsidised flat.&nbsp; The majority of them, of these two-thirds, do not seem to have&nbsp;financial difficulty when they sold their flats&nbsp;&ndash; no financial arrears, not divorce cases, etc.&nbsp;Forty per cent&nbsp;of these ex-lessees received more than $90,000 as sales proceeds.&nbsp; As I said earlier, they could easily afford a studio apartment or a small resale flat.&nbsp; These applicants on the queue should not be competing with needy families for rental flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They do qualify for rental flats under our current eligibility criteria.&nbsp; We need to take decisive steps to correct this.&nbsp; We must reinstate the Public Rental Scheme to its rightful role as the final safety net and the housing option of last resort for the needy.&nbsp; If everybody jumps onto this safety net, whether they deserve it or&nbsp;not, the safety net&nbsp;is going to&nbsp;break.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, with immediate effect, HDB will implement revised eligibility criteria for HDB rental flats. We will adopt three main principles:&nbsp;&nbsp;first, rental flats should only be allocated to those who cannot afford their own housing.&nbsp; The current household income ceiling of $1,500 per month does not stop retirees who have zero income but are asset-rich from accumulated savings or from buying and selling subsidised HDB flats, from joining the rental flat queue.&nbsp; Therefore, HDB will take into account both the income and the assets of rental flat applicants who have <p align=left>Column: 2148<p>enjoyed at least one housing subsidy.&nbsp; Those with substantial savings, as well as those who realised significant proceeds from their last flat sale, will not qualify for a rental flat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the family, not the Government, should be the first line of support for those in need. Therefore, an elderly applicant will not qualify for rental housing if his children own flats or houses, and are able to accommodate him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rental flats are heavily subsidised, HDB will continue to permanently debar those who have enjoyed&nbsp;two housing subsidies.&nbsp; This is a current criterion, and we will maintain that.&nbsp; We will also retain the 30-month debarment for those who have just sold their flats.&nbsp; I assure Members that appeals that are based on financial hardships that do not meet these new eligible criteria will continue to be evaluated based on the merits of each case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will release the details of these new eligibility criteria later today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, let&nbsp;me reiterate our commitment to ensuring that all Singaporeans will have a roof over their heads.&nbsp; We will build more rental flats.&nbsp; We will also ensure that they are allocated to deserving cases only, so that those public rental flats that we do build will&nbsp;be truly an effective final safety net and housing of last resort for the truly needy.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Home Improvement Programme and Spalling Concrete</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Spalling concrete is not a new issue in Parliament.&nbsp;&nbsp;Spalling concrete in existing HDB flats affects ceilings.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, HDB has treated the spalling in non-wet and wet areas differently.&nbsp; HDB has assisted financially in the repairs for wet areas as these are serious.&nbsp; Last year, the Minister&nbsp;wrote in&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2149<p>his&nbsp;reply that HDB had assisted 2,300 lessees affected by spalling concrete over the past 12 months.&nbsp; The figure of 2,300 lessees affected may seem small in relation to the nearly 900,000 HDB units islandwide.&nbsp; But I believe this is only the tip of the ice-berg.&nbsp; Many of the residents have&nbsp;carried out the repair themselves. &nbsp;As they have to pay for the costs of repair,&nbsp;they go for a cheaper contractor.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As a landlord, can HDB&nbsp;organise such repairs on a national level?&nbsp;&nbsp;By calling a bulk tender to carry out such works,&nbsp;there will be the economies of scale and residents can have the repairs carried out at competitive pricing.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the cost to lessess is an average of $40 for each repair.&nbsp; This is not so.&nbsp; Residents tell me the cost of repair to the lessee is about $200, when I see them in MPS as well as during house-to-house visits.&nbsp; I have asked the lessees about the $40 payment&nbsp;but their reply is that the contractor said that the area repaired is bigger.

What is the cost of repair for one square foot of spalling concrete?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the guarantee period for each repair?&nbsp; Many a time, residents come back and say that the repair was done at one area and the same area was spalling again&nbsp;a few months, or after a year.

With this love Budget, we hope that LUP, which is part of the infrastructure programme to enhance our living environment, will be uplifted.&nbsp; Can the Minister update the status of the programme and how fast&nbsp;his Ministry&nbsp;has been rolling out the LUP?&nbsp; And&nbsp;will there be any cutback in the programme, in view of the higher cost of materials in 2007 and 2008?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that HDB has reduced the number of blocks for LUP because of cost factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry reveal how many blocks do not qualify for the HDB LUP, because of the $30,000 per benefiting unit cap?&nbsp; And what plans does the Ministry have in mind to improve the mobility and accessibility for residents of these blocks?&nbsp; In view of the recent downward trend of the material cost, will HDB ramp up its programmes?&nbsp; And is the $30,000 cap still a realistic figure after the hike in 2007 and 2008 material cost&nbsp;and,&nbsp;hopefully, with some downward adjustment in 2009?&nbsp; Has HDB reviewed its cap of $30,000?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it increase the cap to allow more blocks to be eligible for the LUP?&nbsp; It is&nbsp;an infrastructure programme that will enhance the living condition of the residents and it is essential.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, will the Ministry reveal the amount payable by the Town Council as co-payment for HDB LUP, since it is an infrastructure programme and Town Council will need to pay more to maintain the new flats, because of more new landings and many more additional new flats?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point I would like to raise relates to the sinking fund, which has come under&nbsp;the limelight recently.&nbsp; The sinking fund is a sum total of monies saved up over the years for the purpose of paying for big-ticket items which need repairs, refurbishment or replacement.&nbsp; Without this, residents will find their estates deteriorating into a slum.&nbsp;&nbsp;Has&nbsp;our <p align=left>Column: 2154<p>Town Councils been taking steps to grow this fund?&nbsp;&nbsp;There are concerns that the sinking fund may not be adequate in time to come.&nbsp; Firstly, as estates get older, there&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;need for more regular maintenance.&nbsp; Secondly, the cost of upkeep has risen.&nbsp; And thirdly, the conservancy fee has been unchanged.&nbsp; As a result, the funds that are at the disposal of the Town Councils have not kept pace with the market, such as inflation, cost of labour, material, and&nbsp;energy.&nbsp; The Town Councils have also used parts of the sinking fund to co-pay for the HDB LUP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, like to ask whether the Ministry would consider helping Town Councils keep up with their seasonal cyclical maintenance by reinstating the Cyclical&nbsp;Works Grant which was granted to Town Councils in the earlier years, since Town Councils have to pay for part of this infrastructure cost, especially when there are more lifts in each block and these are new infrastructures.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Charles Chong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

At present, it would seem that getting this right and making it safe for the disabled and less mobile is a challenge.&nbsp; Just last week, I took a walk in two recently upgraded neighbourhoods&nbsp;&ndash; in Bishan and at Towner Road. &nbsp;I noticed how a lot more work is needed in this aspect of our infrastructure development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Bishan, the lifts at one of the blocks were recently upgraded.&nbsp; Very well done, except that there was a small step down from the new lift lobby to the walkway leading to the main road.&nbsp; Sir, I may say small step, but that is only the case for able-bodied persons.&nbsp; For a wheelchair user, it is an obstacle.&nbsp; It is a difference between ease of access and having to go around the block to find a way out.&nbsp; There was also a path leading to the main walkway.&nbsp; The path was slightly elevated.&nbsp; Instead of a proper ramp, a narrow and makeshift-looking slope of concrete was slapped on at an angle where path and walkway met.&nbsp; I asked a mother pushing a pram down what she thought of the ramp (I use that word loosely), and she said, "It's not very good."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the other estate, there was an upgraded covered walkway leading to&nbsp;a bus stop.&nbsp; Instead of a ramp to link the <p align=left>Column: 2156<p>two, there were three high steps.&nbsp; Sir, this is for a bus stop that is part of a wheelchair-accessible route.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;a bus stop for all Singaporeans and a sheltered walkway only for the able-bodied.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in these two estates, as my wheelchair-bound friend put it, you need to know where the accessibility points are, otherwise you have to go round in circles to find them.&nbsp; Surely, the Government is not investing so much to upgrade our estates and to make them more disabled and elderly friendly only to achieve the results I just described.&nbsp; It is a pity that the attitude towards accessibility seems to be one of getting the job done with little thought put into purpose, functionality and safety.&nbsp; Simply building a ramp&nbsp;&ndash; never mind how steep some might be&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and assuming that is enough for the disabled will not do.&nbsp; The question of where and how, by putting the disabled on equal consideration with the able-bodied, needs to be applied.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry if there are any compliance standards set for accessibility in our existing and upcoming estate rejuvenation programmes, and what may these be.&nbsp; Second, who monitors estate renewal, from the planning to the implementation, and who would be responsible for ensuring accessibility is met?&nbsp; Third, are Singapore's accessibility standards aligned to any international code?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have what it takes to integrate accessibility into our infrastructure.&nbsp;

The HIP is a new upgrading programme for flats built in 1986 or before that have not undergone flat <p align=left>Column: 2157<p>upgrading.&nbsp; In FY 2007, we selected four new HIP precincts.&nbsp; In FY 2008, we have accelerated this to seven new HIP precincts.&nbsp; So far, over 13,000 flats have been selected for HIP.&nbsp; There are another 320,000 flats that are eligible for HIP.&nbsp; In other words, we have many more flats&nbsp;that are eligible for HIP, but our focus now is LUP,&nbsp;which I will talk about shortly.&nbsp; The repair of spalling concrete is only one of the improvements under HIP.&nbsp; The incidence of spalling concrete is not high.&nbsp; It is at about&nbsp;five cases per thousand flats, or 0.5%.&nbsp; Until a precinct is selected for HIP, spalling concrete repairs can be handled using a targeted approach, under the Goodwill Repair Assistance measure (GRA).&nbsp; Under this assistance scheme, HDB helps to repair spalling concrete that occurs with ceiling leaks and co-pays 50% of the cost.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining 50% is to be shared by residents in the two units on top and below each other.&nbsp; And the $40 that Mdm Cynthia Phua has brought up in her question relates to $40 for the share.&nbsp; In other words, 20% share of the cost, which ties in with what she has said earlier on about an average of $200 repair bill.&nbsp; But as the name implies, GRA is carried out by HDB out of goodwill.&nbsp; HDB has no plans to extend&nbsp;its assistance measure to cover other aspects of maintenance and minor repairs.&nbsp; Home owners are responsible for the upkeep of their own homes.&nbsp; That is a fundamental policy rationale of our home ownership&nbsp;policy.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members have spoken about the LUP&nbsp;&ndash; Mr Charles Chong, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Mr Low Thia Khiang.&nbsp; It has been a challenge to carry out LUP amidst the sharp construction cost increases over the last two years.&nbsp; Construction costs have begun to moderate recently.&nbsp; HDB will press on with this programme.&nbsp; To date, we have selected 80% of eligible blocks for lift upgrading, including those <p align=left>Column: 2158<p>selected in FY 2008, which will be announced soon.&nbsp; The programme is on track. &nbsp;HDB will select the remaining 1,000 eligible blocks over the next few years, so that they can be completed by 2014.&nbsp; HDB has reduced costs through block procurement, reconfiguration of lift excess and&nbsp;introduction of machine roomless lifts, home lifts and shaftless lifts.&nbsp; HDB will continue to explore different lift solutions so that even more units can be eligible for LUP.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak's query touches on a new lift solution that HDB has implemented.&nbsp; This involves steel lift shafts clad with aluminium for aesthetic purposes.&nbsp; The steel lift shafts are designed and constructed in accordance with the relevant code of practice and are as safe as conventional concrete lift shafts.&nbsp; The use of new technology, such as steel lift shafts, not only hopes to make more units eligible for LUP, it also reduces the costs for residents as well as the costs to Town Council which has to co-pay the LUP programme.&nbsp; Generally, for steel lift shafts, we find them in low-rise blocks where conventional concrete method&nbsp;makes it very expensive because of the small number of benefiting units involved.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong asked if there will be a slowdown in the LUP, given the current economic downturn.&nbsp; The answer is "no".&nbsp; On the contrary, we intend to step it up.&nbsp; For FY 2008, we have selected 60 precincts for LUP, 10 more than the original intended 50.&nbsp; We also plan to select more for FY 2009 and to bring forward this selection by about six months.&nbsp; Nonetheless, we need to monitor the construction costs and the capacity of the construction industry carefully.&nbsp; We are mindful of the impact on Town Councils and residents who co-pay the LUP costs.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Co-payment by Town Councils for LUP has been an integral part of the <p align=left>Column: 2159<p>programme since its inception.&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong, Mdm Cynthia Phua and&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang have asked about it.&nbsp; In fact, Town Council sinking funds are meant to fund the cyclical overhaul of lifts, even in the absence of lift upgrading.&nbsp; Furthermore, lift upgrading is a key estate improvement item and the co-payment by all three parties, namely, the residents, Town Council and the Government, reflects the joint ownership of the LUP.&nbsp; The co-payment scheme has been implemented since LUP was introduced in 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a scheme that we intend to continue.&nbsp; When LUP was conceived then, several Town Councils indicated that they would like to help make lift upgrading more affordable for their residents by sharing in the co-payment.&nbsp; Town Council and residents co-pay only a small fraction of the LUP costs at 5% to 12.5%, depending on flat type.&nbsp; The Government bears the bulk of the costs as&nbsp;a subsidy for the programme.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua has expressed concern about the cost of LUP for her Town Council.&nbsp; Towards the end of last year, we provided each Town Council with a projection of their share of the total LUP costs going forward&nbsp;&ndash; thus, the question that Mr Low has asked on why&nbsp;he was given a number of expected co-payment.&nbsp; Some Town Councils have raised questions on the basis of estimates and asked for further details.&nbsp; As construction costs are changing, we will soon be updating the Town Councils with further estimates and information in order to help them prepare for co-payment matters.&nbsp; This projection is to facilitate the Town Council's budget planning for future remaining LUP projects.&nbsp; Town Councils are given ample notice of the co-payments as they are billed in parts over several years after a precinct is selected for LUP.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The $2 billion in sinking funds&nbsp;held collectively&nbsp;by the 16 Town Councils might appear large at first glance.&nbsp; However, it needs to be reviewed in the context of the expensive long-term maintenance works needed for almost 9,000 HDB blocks as well as the LUP co-payment needs.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua has given a very long explanation&nbsp;about the pressure that Town Councils are facing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our preliminary study of the adequacy of residential sinking funds of the Town Councils has shown that they are not excessive.&nbsp; It is, therefore, unwise to lower the minimum contribution into the sinking funds or to allow Town Councils to use the net investment incomes generated from sinking funds to be transferred into operating funds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Chong is aware, sinking funds are earmarked for specific expenditure and works in the future and they are vulnerable to inflation.&nbsp; If a Town Council does not have sufficient sinking funds to carry out the necessary works when needed, the living environment of the housing estates may deteriorate, and the health and safety of the residents compromised.&nbsp; It is important that the level of S&amp;CC takes into account the long-term financial needs of the town.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong also suggested a programme to install lifts in all multi-storey car parks (MSCPs).&nbsp; HDB recognises the need to make our MSCPs more accessible.&nbsp; And since December 2006, HDB has designed all MSCPs in new public housing developments with lift access.&nbsp; We are also installing lifts in some MSCPs in conjunction with LUP and car park improvement works.&nbsp; However, as I have mentioned earlier on, our priority now is really to complete our LUP project for residential blocks and, therefore, the need is more urgent there, and we will focus our resources on that project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2161<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On accessibility, Ms Eunice Olsen has asked about the Barrier-Free Accessibility Programme.&nbsp; HDB is working closely with the Town Councils to complete this for public housing estates by 2011.&nbsp; The programme is on track with over 40% of blocks completed as of 2008.&nbsp; Residents welcome the programme on the whole.&nbsp; Some have given feedback about specific sites, maybe not different from some of those as mentioned by Ms Olsen, and they would bring this feedback to their Town Councils who will act on their suggestions.&nbsp; What we have done is to have Town Councils act as managing agent for this project, and Town Councils, being under the leadership of a local MP, would have a much better feel of the ground the needs of the residents, and they should look for solutions that best suit the needs of their residents.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I applaud the NParks for developing nature walks in the Southern Ridges, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Sungei Buloh and also marine areas like Chek Jawa, and setting up of a coral nursery.&nbsp; However, more can be done if we want to be truly a sustainable island state.&nbsp; A survey done recently by the Singapore Tourism Board shows that of <p align=left>Column: 2165<p>the selected fauna groups, 252 species of animals exist in Singapore.&nbsp; However, 55 are locally threatened&nbsp;and will disappear if we do not do something to protect them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the marine ecosystem, we have lost 60% of our coral reefs because of coastal reclamation, but we are fortunate that the biodiversity has not been affected much.&nbsp; We are still in a position, if we act now, to reverse the trend of our dying corals.&nbsp; In our coral reefs, we have more than 250 species of hard corals, more than 120 reef fish from 30 families,&nbsp;12 out of the 23 seagrass species found in the&nbsp;Indo-Pacific region.&nbsp; To ensure that we conserve and preserve what we have both terrestrial and marine, I have a number of recommendations.&nbsp; But because of time constraints, I can only mention two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, preserve and restore the edges around the seven fragmented patches in our nature reserves.&nbsp; Our once integrated forest nature reserves are now fragmented into roughly seven patches, each standing isolated with gaps in the forest cover.&nbsp; Fragmentations bring about population isolation among the various species causing the&nbsp;edge effect which has no immunity or resistance, therefore finally killing the native wildlife.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, conserve 10% of our natural unmodified remaining coastline.&nbsp; Although we have high biodiversity, the small reef size or areas mean that we need a critical area for the reef to survive and thrive.&nbsp; Fragmentation of our reefs like the terrestrial case does not work.&nbsp; I would be happy to provide the Minister with reports on all the other recommendations.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mr Chairman, Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked what could be done to address the weak property market.&nbsp; The property market is inextricably linked to the economy as a whole.&nbsp; It saw phenomenal growth in 2007 in tandem with the strong economic growth then.&nbsp; Now, with the current economic <p align=left>Column: 2166<p>downturn, the market has similarly corrected.&nbsp; The Government cannot artificially prop up prices, in as much as&nbsp;we cannot suppress prices in a bull market.&nbsp; But we can seek to achieve&nbsp;several objectives, two, in particular.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we want to ensure that the property market is efficient and functions well.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp;property prices move more or less in&nbsp;tandem with&nbsp;economic fundamentals.&nbsp; We want to prevent excessive swings in the property market as this would have serious ramifications on home ownership, asset prices, retirement savings and other sectors of the economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we want to help businesses in the real estate sector ride through this difficult period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has already acted very swiftly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we have suspended the Confirmed List of the Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme for&nbsp;1st half 2009,&nbsp;this was last year when we made that decision.&nbsp; And we have also&nbsp;made sites available via the Reserve List only.&nbsp; This allows the market to decide how much supply is released to meet real demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, URA has released more real estate data to enhance market transparency, so that all market players&nbsp;&ndash; buyers, sellers, developers, finance industry&nbsp;and Government agencies&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;are aware of what is the real situation and will act accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we have introduced new measures in this Budget&nbsp;to ease the cash-flow of developers and give them more flexibility to stage the sale and construction of their developments in accordance with market conditions.&nbsp; These measures&nbsp;give developers more time to complete their projects, allowing them to reassign their sites, giving them <p align=left>Column: 2167<p>more time to sell the completed units, allowing them to rent out the unsold units, giving them property tax deferrals and, last but not least, granting the 40% property tax rebate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang&nbsp;also asked how badly the market&nbsp;is hit by the tightened credit.&nbsp; I think it is not unreasonable to expect that banks&nbsp;will be more prudent in lending under the current tough economic&nbsp;situation.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I understand that genuine buyers are still able to obtain loans, especially for owner-occupied property, and developers who have good collaterals and track records can still obtain financing for their projects.&nbsp; In fact, several of the&nbsp;REITS have recently announced that they are able to obtain financing to&nbsp;roll over their debts.&nbsp; These new measures announced in the Budget&nbsp;are aimed at helping developers ease their cashflow and give them more flexibility, so that they can stretch out the development as well as the sale of their developments in accordance with market conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;just want to assure Members that MND and other relevant agencies will continue to monitor the property market closely, and we will implement more measures, if necessary, to lend stability to the market.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The Government will therefore press on with the long-term development plans to build Singapore as a vibrant global city, and an endearing home for Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2168<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of this year, Singaporeans will see Marina Bay take shape as a new premier business location.&nbsp; A new vehicular and pedestrian bridge with a unique double-helix design will link the Bayfront area to Marina Centre.&nbsp; A new Art Park and waterfront promenade, which will loop around Marina Bay, will also be substantially completed.&nbsp; This will create opportunities for not just people living or working in the vicinity&nbsp;but for Singaporeans from all over to come and enjoy Marina Bay.&nbsp; In the next few years, we can look forward to the completion of Gardens by the Bay, along with the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.&nbsp; By then, Singapore will have a new downtown, a waterfront hub for business and financial services that can offer an exciting &ldquo;live-work-play&rdquo; destination for all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also pressing on with the infrastructure development for new regional commercial hubs at Jurong East, Paya Lebar and Kallang that were earmarked for development in the Master Plan 2008.&nbsp; A total of $2.9 billion will be invested to implement essential infrastructure works for the progressive development of these three new growth areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Jurong Lake District, LTA will upgrade the Jurong East MRT station and redevelop the bus interchange to integrate better with the MRT.&nbsp; JTC will expand the International Business Park southwards to cater to increased demand.&nbsp; PUB will transform Jurong Lake to allow more water-based activities. MOH will build the Jurong General Hospital.&nbsp; The Science Centre Board will develop&nbsp;a new science centre&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;all these in the next few years.&nbsp; So it is not surprising that some property analyst are now saying that prices of HDB flats in Jurong area are increasing faster than in other parts of Singapore.&nbsp; And, of course, this is what prompted Mr Liang Eng Hwa just now to also ask what we <p align=left>Column: 2169<p>are doing for Bukit Panjang,&nbsp;which I will come to later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at Kallang Riverside, we will also create new infrastructure&nbsp;to open up the area for future waterfront developments.&nbsp; At Paya Lebar Central, the Circle Line, a new Paya Lebar MRT interchange, will be operational in 2010, and the new Geylang Serai Market will be completed this year.&nbsp; I would like to assure Dr Fatimah Lateef that when we finally implement the plans,&nbsp;the heritage and ethnic character of the Paya Lebar and Geylang areas will be preserved in the process of the redevelopment, and we will make sure that she is consulted when we do up these plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, a new pedestrian mall along Geylang Road will be redeveloped to accommodate more stalls during the annual Hari Raya bazaar.&nbsp; I know this is a very popular Hari Raya gathering place for Singaporeans, not just for people around Geylang but from all over.&nbsp; So we want to make sure that this special aspect of the Geylang Serai&nbsp;area is preserved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we will rejuvenate our HDB heartlands.&nbsp; We see here on the slide&nbsp;the upgraded Clementi Town Centre.&nbsp; We have spent $2.4 billion over the last&nbsp;five years on the various upgrading programmes; and will almost double it, with another $4.6 billion, over the next&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; That is&nbsp;a picture of the Ghim Moh MUP (Main Upgrading Programme) and I believe that that garden is now well used.&nbsp; Under the Remaking Our Heartlands (ROH) initiative, we will revitalise the old and middle age towns in a more comprehensive manner.&nbsp; Rejuvenation works for the pilot town, Yishun, have just started.&nbsp; This is a picture of the Yishun Town Centre.&nbsp; The next picture shows the Yishun pond which is an area which is abutting the Town Centre, which will be redeveloped into a place for&nbsp;water-based recreation and activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2170<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also rejuvenate our older estates through the injection of new flats and residents.&nbsp; Such projects include the DBSS project in Bishan; the waterfront SERS project in Kallang Whampoa; and the&nbsp;new BTO projects in Choa Chu Kang as well as in Woodlands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I come to&nbsp;Mr Liang's question about development plans for middle age towns like Bukit Panjang.&nbsp; Bukit Panjang residents can look forward to the new upgrading programmes, such as the Home Improvement Project (HIP) and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP). They will soon enjoy new recreational facilities at the Bukit Panjang Sports Complex and Community Hall and also&nbsp;the Dairy Farm Nature Park.&nbsp; Under the NRP, Advisors can engage residents to shape their neigbourhood and the "character" of their town.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I refer to Mr Charles Chong&rsquo;s question about Punggol 21 Plus.&nbsp; I want to assure him that the Government remains totally committed to the Punggol 21 Plus&nbsp;programme.&nbsp; It is not just a rehash of the Punggol 21 plan.&nbsp; There are some very&nbsp;new aspects&nbsp;of the Punggol 21 Plus plan, which were never envisaged,&nbsp;in the original Punggol 21, eg, the contract for the construction of the first 2.4 km of the Punggol Waterway.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new park of the Punggol plan.&nbsp; This 2.4 km of the&nbsp;Punggol Waterway will&nbsp;cost $145 million. &nbsp;The contract has just been awarded and&nbsp;announced last week, and is scheduled to complete by end 2010.&nbsp; This will allow the first sale site for a mixed commercial-residential development at the Town Centre&nbsp;to be launched by 2011. Apart from the waterway, we are also ramping up housing in the area so that there is a critical mass of at least 20,000 units ready by then.&nbsp; So in 2011, we will be ready to launch the sites for the first commercial development.&nbsp; When the new Town Centre and the Waterway are completed, residents of Punggol 21 will enjoy a first-class waterfront environment quite unique in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2171<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the transformation of our city goes beyond infrastructure. Dr Faishal asked about the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Sustainable Development (IMCSD).&nbsp;&nbsp;It was set up last year to chart strategies for Singapore&rsquo;s sustainable development.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform&nbsp;him that we have met up with industry leaders and&nbsp;members of the public.&nbsp; We sought ideas and we have deliberated and are ready to release our recommendations in March this year.&nbsp; So I will not go into the details yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I want to say, in general, that the IMCSD&rsquo;s recommendations will centre on&nbsp;four key areas.&nbsp; First, measures to improve Singapore&rsquo;s resource efficiency.&nbsp; In particular, we will put in special&nbsp;efforts to promote energy efficient buildings,&nbsp;both new buildings as well as existing buildings.&nbsp; We will encourage energy efficiency among industries and households and greater fuel efficiency in the transport sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will implement measures to enhance the livability of our city.&nbsp;&nbsp;More efforts will be made to promote clean transport and enhance connectivity for cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; I just want to assure Mr Edwin Khew that we&nbsp;intend to further extend the greenery and protect the rich bio-diversity of our city.&nbsp; We will work with the relevant NGOs, such as the Nature Society&nbsp;and individuals such as Mr Khew, to come up with these plans, and we will announce more details in due course.&nbsp; As regards these plans, I refer both to terrestrial as well as marine nature areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we will invest new resources to build up Singapore as a hub for sustainable development technologies and solutions.&nbsp; And last but not least, all these would not be possible if we do not build up&nbsp; new partnerships with the people and the&nbsp;private sectors so as to promote <p align=left>Column: 2172<p>lifestyle changes&nbsp;to support a higher level of sustainability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will take the lead in sustainable development by setting aside $1 billion over the next&nbsp;five years to implement&nbsp;IMCSD&rsquo;s recommendations.&nbsp; We believe that early investment in sustainable development will strengthen Singapore&rsquo;s competitive position as a lively yet livable city in the medium to long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in short, notwithstanding the current economic recession, we are taking the opportunity to remake our city.&nbsp; In five to&nbsp;10 years&rsquo; time, we will see a new Singapore.&nbsp; We will have a new city, as plans to transform and rejuvenate our downtown and our heartlands take shape.&nbsp; Singaporeans will enjoy a better quality of life, as our public housing plans, our&nbsp;upgrading plans, our plans for new parks and plans&nbsp;for&nbsp;greater connectivity all start to&nbsp;take shape.&nbsp; We will create new opportunities&nbsp;for both&nbsp;locals as well as global businesses and talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Wednesday, during the debate on the Budget, Ms Eunice Olsen asked who are&nbsp;we building or creating this global city for.&nbsp; I think this is a very relevant question.&nbsp; We are striving to be a global city of distinction &ndash; a top destination for global businesses to base their operations here.&nbsp; We also want to be a choice location for global talents to come here and to work but, above all, we want to build a city that all Singaporeans can be proud to call home. Sir, let us look beyond the immediate troubles and press on with our efforts to remake Singapore. We have the resources and the resolve.&nbsp; Let us tell the world that we are a resilient people, that we have a resilient economy and Singapore will continue to be a land of opportunity for all.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, we cannot keep building heavy vehicle parks in or near residential estates as these would cause&nbsp;disamenities to the majority of the residents in the estates.&nbsp; There is more than enough heavy vehicle parking spaces island-wide.&nbsp; Residents who are not able to secure heavy vehicle parking lots near their residences would have already secured parking lots at their workplaces, like factories, and at designated parking places outside HDB estates.&nbsp; They can continue to park at these locations.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Sustaining the Construction Industry</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M:</B> Sir, prices of private residential offices, shops and industrial properties have decreased in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as year-on-year 2008.&nbsp;

As of fourth quarter of 2008, there were about 65,000 private residential units in the pipeline comprising supply from projects that were already under construction and those that have been granted planning approval but were not under construction yet.&nbsp; For the office sector, there was a pipeline supply of about 1.39 million square metres of gross floor area of office space from various Government and private land sources.&nbsp; With the falling prices, faltering demand and a glut of supply coming on line, what <p align=left>Column: 2175<p>is the likely impact on the construction sector going forward?&nbsp; In addition, what are some measures the Government will put in place to sustain and assist the construction industry during this period in continuing to spur the construction sector in moving forward?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a professional engineer working in the construction industry.&nbsp; During this difficult economic situation, perhaps the Government could look into providing downpayments to consultants and contractors.&nbsp; This would give them a headstart to moblilise manpower and purchase required resources without having to struggle with bank loans.&nbsp; Another way that Government can help is to pay on time.&nbsp; Inefficient administrative processes often slow down the settlement of payments to the building contractors, in particular, when it comes to the&nbsp;settlement of the variation orders.&nbsp; This has imposed additional financial burden on the contractors.&nbsp; Besides that, new Government requirements that are not critical should be deferred.&nbsp; An example of this is the requirement of geo-technical professional&nbsp;engineers for the designing of foundations for high-rise buildings.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to urge the Government to push out more lift upgrading programmes and covered link-ways to improve the quality of HDB living.&nbsp; In Nee Soon South, for example, there are 35 blocks of flats which have not been selected for lift upgrading.&nbsp; I know there is <p align=left>Column: 2176<p>a schedule drawn up for LUP, but the Ministry should review this periodically&nbsp;as time waits for no man, and how long must elderly residents endure before relief comes to them.&nbsp; MND should also re-examine the building of covered link-ways.&nbsp; Is our policy so rigid that some of our residents are deprived of having covered link-ways?&nbsp; Let me give&nbsp;Members an example.&nbsp; In Nee Soon South, there are seven blocks of flats&nbsp;&ndash; Blocks 858 to 865&nbsp;&ndash; not linked to the adjacent&nbsp;cluster of HDB blocks because they are separated by a school and a temple.&nbsp; We know that these days the weather is often in the extremes.&nbsp; When it rains, it pours; when it shines, it burns.&nbsp; Residents do not have access to sheltered paths that would take them to Khatib MRT Station.&nbsp; I brought&nbsp; LTA top officers to the site to show them that we can build a covered link-way along the roadside in order to link it to the nearest HDB block.&nbsp; LTA told me that they do not have the budget and referred me to CIPC funding.&nbsp; So, when I talked to the Town Council, they told me that the cost for the linkway exceeds the CIPC funding cap.&nbsp; I hope I would not have to window shop from LTA to MND.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Government also look at tweaking the Workfare Bonus to give more to those workers who take up employment in the construction industry?&nbsp; This way, it may be able to attract more Singaporeans to work in the industry.&nbsp; With the expected slow market recovery, property developers are laden with high operating cost and cashflow burden.&nbsp; Additional tax incentives, like waiver of property tax for land under development, property tax rebates &nbsp;for service apartments and&nbsp;stamp duty reduction deferred will be welcomed.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We need to sustain and grow the industry, which can provide good jobs for Singaporeans.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the construction sector had a very good year in 2008, with demand reaching a record of $34.6 billion. &nbsp;Although it will not be left unscathed by the current economic downturn, the sector is still expected to perform relatively well for the next few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the strong construction demand of 2007 and 2008 will keep the sector <p align=left>Column: 2180<p>relatively well occupied as works for ongoing projects, especially the larger ones, continue.&nbsp; Second, public sector demand from 2009 to 2011 will remain strong.&nbsp; For 2009 alone, the value of Government projects to be awarded will reach between $18 billion and $20 billion.&nbsp; This will make up for the slack in private sector demand.&nbsp; Although the total annual demand will moderate to between $20 billion and $29 billion from 2009 to 2011, this is still substantially higher than the average annual demand that we have seen&nbsp;from 1998 to 2006, and that is about $13 billion in the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware that the current economic downturn has presented some specific challenges for the sector.&nbsp; We are monitoring the situation and have worked with other Government agencies, to provide proactive and targeted support for the industry and I will&nbsp;elaborate on them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order books of the larger construction firms would remain relatively full for 2009 and, perhaps,&nbsp;until&nbsp;2010.&nbsp; But some of the small and medium-sized builders are beginning to feel the pinch due to the rapid drop in private sector demand.&nbsp; We are, therefore, taking a targeted approach aimed at helping the small and medium-sized contractors during this difficult period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As announced by the Minister for Finance, the Government will award, in 2009, an additional $1.3 billion worth of small and medium-sized public sector contracts, each valued at $50 million or less.&nbsp; Together with the amount of small and medium sized projects in the original plan, this will bring the total public sector demand for such projects to $4.8 billion.&nbsp; This is a sizeable increase of 67% over the average annual value of small and medium-sized Government projects awarded in the past&nbsp;five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The range of projects to be brought forward will include smaller scale projects <p align=left>Column: 2181<p>of value up to $15 million, such as the upgrading of community clubs, roads, parks and park connectors. &nbsp;Projects of value up to $50 million will include the building of new rental flats, indoor sports halls in schools,&nbsp;upgrading of hospitals, as well as projects under the lift-upgrading programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As banks and financial institutions have become more prudent in extending credit, viable construction firms may face the challenge of having adequate cash flow to sustain their businesses.&nbsp; To ease the credit squeeze, the Government has made several enhancements to the business financing schemes offered by SPRING Singapore to help companies access credit financing. &nbsp;For example, the relaxation of qualifying criteria and loan quanta means that even large construction firms can now access some of these schemes, like the Loan Insurance Scheme-Plus and the newly created Bridging Loan Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Government will ease the cash flow of construction firms undertaking public sector projects, which&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah called for.&nbsp; Public agencies will provide more frequent and prompt payments to construction firms for work done. &nbsp;The Government is also taking an exceptional measure to undertake higher risk by lowering the security deposits for construction projects from the normal 5%. &nbsp;In general, the quantum will be capped at 1.25% for projects of value up to $15 million, and 2.5% for projects of higher value.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor the situation closely. If necessary, we are prepared to take further measures to assist the industry.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah will agree with me that the industry generally thinks that the Government is a very good paymaster and is a preferred customer in these times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Masagos asked about training and employment opportunities in the construction sector.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2182<p>Workload in the industry will stay at a healthy level over the next few years.&nbsp; There will be continued demand for manpower, including at the PMET levels. &nbsp;With a relatively stable outlook and abundant training incentives, the industry presents new entrants into the job market and those seeking a career switch with excellent prospects for a rewarding career.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the job opportunities and how do we attract talents?&nbsp; Many construction firms are, in fact, looking to hire more workers. &nbsp;In a BCA's recent survey of about 1,500 firms in the sector,&nbsp;half of them indicated that they are short of manpower and they have posted more than 800 jobs on BCA's Building Careers Job Portal since December last year.&nbsp; Mdm Ho would like to know that the job portal actually features very attractive young people, whom we are working very hard to attract,&nbsp;to improve&nbsp;the image of the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firms are seeking additional tradesmen and foremen in areas such as crane and construction plant operation, electrical works and plumbing.&nbsp; For the PMETs, there will be job opportunities in new growth areas, such as energy-efficient or green buildings.&nbsp; As the green building movement gathers momentum, the demand for a "green collar" workforce will grow rapidly.&nbsp; Mid-career PMETs could also retrain and take on jobs in areas, such as safety coordination and property management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare new entrants and upgrade the existing workforce to fill these key demand areas, BCA, together with WDA and NTUC, have stepped up the pace of its Job Recreation Programme (JRP).&nbsp; This initiative aims to train locals in key demand areas and match them with job vacancies.&nbsp; Let me elaborate further on the types of training opportunities available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have up to 1,000 training places&nbsp;available over the next two years to train <p align=left>Column: 2183<p>locals in key trades.&nbsp; The BCA Academy also offers diploma programmes to upgrade tradesmen to take on supervisory positions.&nbsp; All these courses are subsidised under training assistance schemes such as the Skills Development Fund as well as the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience&nbsp;(SPUR).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support the growth of the green building sector, there will be some 8,000 training opportunities over the next&nbsp;five years to develop a highly skilled "green collar" workforce.&nbsp; In addition, the BCA Academy offers diploma courses in areas such as building cost management and interior design that are also suited for mid-career entry.&nbsp; We will place more courses under WDA's Professional Conversion Programmes, to re-skill mid-career professionals to join this industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example of a professional who has&nbsp;made a very successful mid-career switch into the green building sector is Mr James Chua.&nbsp; After 25 years in the manufacturing and electronics industry, he embarked on his Green Mark Manager Course at the BCA Academy.&nbsp; Upon completion of the course, James joined G-Energy last year and is now an Energy&nbsp;and Sustainable Design Consultant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we tackle the immediate concerns of the economic downturn, the Government will also remain focused on the long-term goal to upgrade the construction sector.&nbsp; We will introduce measures to enhance productivity, build capabilities and expertise in new growth areas, and nurture a core of skilled local workers and progressive builders to lead the industry. &nbsp;I am confident that with the various stakeholders working closely together with the Government, the industry will ride the current economic turmoil well and will emerge stronger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2184<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah also asked about one-stop service centres for private estates.&nbsp; Arising from the recommendations of the Committee on Private Estates chaired by Senior Minister of State, Mrs&nbsp;Lim Hwee Hua, a two-year pilot project was launched by Aljunied GRC in July 2008 in which public education and a telephone hotline are provided to help private estate residents coordinate estate maintenance issues with relevant Government agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim's Committee will review the scheme at the end of the pilot and assess if it should be extended to other constituencies.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Ensuring&nbsp; food safety is key priority of AVA.&nbsp; Diseases such as the avian flu and abuses such as the melamine contamination of milk in China show clearly the need to remain vigilant, especially since most of our food is imported.&nbsp; In this regard, AVA will be establishing a dedicated Unit to monitor early signs of food safety threats.&nbsp; The Unit will undertake horizon scanning to gather information from various targeted sources, such as Internet, open literature, news feeds and networking with strategic partners including key industry players.&nbsp; It will then carry out trend and impact analysis to determine a potential threat, and coordinate responses to such alerts.&nbsp; This will allow us to take pre-emptive calibrated responses in line with our overall risk management philosophy.&nbsp; This Unit will work closely with its overseas counterparts, and partner regional and world organisations, such as&nbsp;WHO, OIE and the European Commission, which <p align=left>Column: 2186<p>allow rapid information-sharing to respond to potential health threats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now speak on the resilience of our food supply.&nbsp; The sharp price inflation last year also showed the volatility of the global food demand and supply situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country, diversifying food imports remains an important strategy.&nbsp; We will strengthen our diversification efforts and consider other complementary strategies such as encouraging and supporting our companies in investing in agriculture businesses overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim also raised the idea of developing our agriculture industry to provide food and employment for Singaporeans in this economic downturn.&nbsp; Given our land scarcity, we need to consider this very carefully.&nbsp; We have to ask ourselves whether it is better, cheaper and easier to grow our own or&nbsp;buy from overseas.&nbsp; In some cases, it is; in others, it is not so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, local egg production has proven to be valuable, as our shell&nbsp;egg supply is not well diversified.&nbsp; The aquaculture industry is another example to reduce&nbsp;our reliance on wild catch.&nbsp; AVA has invested in high-value upstream technology to produce robust fish frys, which is the weakest link in the food fish production.&nbsp; Growing-out of frys can then be carried out in nearby waters.&nbsp; I am pleased to say that we have achieved some success with our R&amp;D, such as the "super seabass" which feed our market last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong asked about our safeguard against the incursion of Avian flu.&nbsp; Avian flu is endemic in this region, and its recent resurgence in China, Vietnam and Indonesia is a stark reminder of this.&nbsp; Although the WHO has assessed that there is no risk of a full-blown epidemic across Asia like we have seen previously, AVA will remain vigilant and continue to enforce and review our multi-<p align=left>Column: 2187<p>layered defences.&nbsp; Our safeguards include importing poultry only from HPAI-free countries or zones, and enhancing biosecurity measures and disease surveillance at our local establishments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the task of balancing food safety and supply has become more challenging.&nbsp; We will continue to work with the industry to achieve a resilient supply of safe food at affordable prices for our people.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Charles Chong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Parliamentary Secretary said that there are more than ample heavy vehicle parking lots throughout Singapore and yet he said also that there&nbsp;is a&nbsp;long waiting list for heavy vehicle parking lots such as in Sengkang and other areas.&nbsp; Would it not be a reasonable conclusion to say that we have over-catered for heavy vehicle parking lots in areas where there is no demand and under-catered for areas where there is demand?&nbsp; And if the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with that, could he tell us what remedial actions the Ministry would take?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

What I have highlighted earlier in my reply was that there are enough heavy vehicle parks available all over Singapore, the bulk of them are in the industrial estates where the heavy vehicles rightfully should be.&nbsp; We do recognise&nbsp;that many drivers prefer&nbsp;to have their vehicles parked near their residential areas.&nbsp; But we have to strike a balance between the disamenities that these vehicles will cause the residents of those residential estates.&nbsp; So <p align=left>Column: 2188<p>it is not so much that there is a&nbsp;long waiting list.&nbsp; Of course there will be a longer waiting list in areas that are highly preferred but that does not mean that the supply is not readily available.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Chong mentioned earlier, the vehicles will have to have a parking lot first before they can be registered.&nbsp; We have about 21,500 registered heavy vehicles with 42,000 parking lots available.&nbsp; So the issue is really one of preference but, at the same time, I hope Members will appreciate the need for us to ensure we reduce the potential disamenities that can create in our public housing estates.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Is the Minister hoping to achieve more than 90%?&nbsp; Can we do less than 90% in view of a more complex family structure that we have now and a more diversified population?&nbsp; And this leads me back to the Lease Buyback Scheme.&nbsp; Is it too late because there&nbsp;are already a lot of old folks in the market?&nbsp; Can we not have a wider range of rental flats that have less subsidies?&nbsp; And can we be more creative and consider maybe allocating land&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;if HDB does not want to build&nbsp;&ndash; to&nbsp;the private sector to build rental flats and rent them out?&nbsp; This is an area where we should have more love&nbsp;but&nbsp;instead we tightened the criteria for the application of our older folks.&nbsp; Has the Minister talked to the elderly on the sum of&nbsp; $5,000 upfront before confirming it?&nbsp; And has the Ministry, again, looked at its proposal on the overall guideline and talk to our senior residents on whether they are agreeable or happy with this Lease Buyback Scheme?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> First of all, on the 90% home ownership.&nbsp; There is no magic number that says we should have 90% home ownership.&nbsp; But the fact is that based on the schemes and the heavy subsidies that we have&nbsp;put in place like the CPF Housing Grant, the additional <p align=left>Column: 2189<p>housing grant&nbsp;and&nbsp;the incomes that our people are able to earn, there is no reason why more than 90% of our citizens cannot enjoy a home-ownership flat.&nbsp; In fact, the pricing of our home-ownership flats is such&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;as I have demonstrated&nbsp;just now when I showed the numbers &ndash; that the 2-room flat, which is priced around $90,000 with the CPF grant and&nbsp;the AHG, is easily affordable to somebody who earns something like $1,200, and that makes it easily readily available to 90% of our population.&nbsp; So there is no magic number that says 90%.&nbsp; But home ownership <I>per se</I> is something that we want to promote.&nbsp; And the reasons for home ownership as opposed to renting a home&nbsp;are very clear cut.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give&nbsp;Members the situation in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Hong Kong has about 50% home ownership.&nbsp; The rest of the people in Hong Kong rent their flats.&nbsp; And if you go to Hong Kong and&nbsp;you look at the condition of the rental estates, I think you will agree with me.&nbsp; In fact, the Member has been to Hong Kong&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;she was in a delegation that was led by my Senior Minister of State that went specially to Hong Kong to look at it&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and she has seen for herself the condition of a rental flat versus a home-ownership flat.&nbsp; We do not want that to happen in Singapore.&nbsp; We do not want to have rental flats deteriorate.&nbsp; Why should they take care of their rental flats when they do not belong to them?&nbsp; That is number one.&nbsp; Number two, as I have explained in my reply earlier, a home-ownership flat is a store of value.&nbsp; When&nbsp;you have a flat, first of all, you receive a grant that allows you to own a flat,&nbsp;then you enjoy upgrading subsidies through the course of the life of the flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, at the end, in your later years, that flat that you own is a substantial store of value.&nbsp; The Department of Statistics&nbsp;did a study recently that suggested&nbsp;the value that is residual in our flats is something like over $100,000.&nbsp; I think it was $120,000.&nbsp; In other words, every Singaporean who owns a flat, on <p align=left>Column: 2190<p>average, has about $120,000 of value stored in his flat.&nbsp; And if we can find a way to unlock that value, that would create a substantial sum of money for him to retire with.&nbsp; And this is where the Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS) comes in.&nbsp; The Lease Buyback Scheme is one way for us to try to unlock some of that value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member then asked whether we have&nbsp;spoken to the residents about&nbsp;the sum of&nbsp;$5,000.&nbsp; First of all, when we fashioned this Scheme, we wanted to make it attractive to the elderly low-income.&nbsp; How do we make it attractive?&nbsp; The Government decided that there should be an additional grant, a bonus, for them to sign on to this Scheme.&nbsp; And&nbsp;this sign-on bonus was fixed at $10,000, which is not a small sum of money.&nbsp; So $10,000 is&nbsp;given to somebody who signs on to the Scheme.&nbsp; Then the next thing we ask ourselves is, how much should we give upfront?&nbsp; If we give all of them $10,000 upfront, we are sacrificing downstream income&nbsp;&ndash; the monthly income that will be paid to him or her for the rest of his or her life.&nbsp; If we give nothing upfront, the Scheme will not be that attractive.&nbsp; So we decided to go for somewhere in between, ie,&nbsp;$5,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should it be $4,000 or&nbsp;should it be $6,000?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do a survey, I think you will find as many answers as there are people surveyed.&nbsp; We decided to&nbsp;go for $5,000.&nbsp; You get $5,000 upfront if you sign, and the rest of the $5,000 will be put into the annuity together with the rest of the money that we will give you for the remaining lease of your flat.&nbsp; And that annuity will then generate a stream of income for you for the rest of your life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the example that I have cited, somebody could get $5,000 upfront, another $520-$530 for the rest of his life, plus&nbsp;stay where&nbsp;he is and find other ways in addition to that to unlock even more value from&nbsp;his flat.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;he can still rent out a room in the 3-room flat and keep the additional rental.&nbsp; So this is what <p align=left>Column: 2191<p>I mean when I talk about a life-cycle approach to our housing programme&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;give generous discounts, give generous subsidies upfront to enable young families to own their flats; provide subsidies, provide upgrading to preserve and maintain the value and even increase the value of the flat.&nbsp; As the economy grows, the flat will grow in value in tandem.&nbsp; All these benefits will be&nbsp;preserved in&nbsp;the flat, unlocked at the end of the day.&nbsp; So it is not just a matter of providing a roof over people's heads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hong Kong, the approach is very simple.&nbsp; You need a flat, I will give you a roof over your head, I will rent it to you, and the rental is pretty cheap.&nbsp; But what happens after that?</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

I mean, we have been to those flats. &nbsp;We&nbsp;saw BMWs or Mercedes parked in the car parks of rental flats in Hong Kong.&nbsp; Nobody cares because you can carry on and live there for as long as you like.&nbsp; In our case, we have decided that we will have tenancy renewal, we will encourage people to buy, to provide AHG, and so on.&nbsp; In that spirit, we decide that our rental flats will and should be kept as the final safety net for those who are really in need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I have 4,500 people in the queue.&nbsp; I look at the list of names. Two-thirds of them actually have reasons not to be in the queue. We love them in many other ways&nbsp;but this is not the way.&nbsp; So we will love them in this way for the rental flat tenants.

Can the Minister elaborate on the plan and design for elderly housing, taking into consideration the needs of the elderly and the younger community? The third question is&nbsp;township.&nbsp; I would like to know whether there will be some spillover effects of the Jurong Lake district development into Boon Lay, an old and remote estate.&nbsp; In the Jurong district, as well,&nbsp;which has not&nbsp;seen much modern development. Can Boon Lay share some of Punggol 21's windfall?&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually on this subject of "love", it would appear that Punggol 21, being a relatively younger estate than old Boon Lay, is getting more attention.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, my Ministry tries to love everybody equally but some need more love than others.&nbsp; I sympathise with the Member for Boon Lay. I think Boon Lay has&nbsp;more than its share of residents who are in financial difficulties (the&nbsp;lower income).&nbsp;We need to do more to help these people in Boon Lay.&nbsp; I promise her that we will look into it. I cannot promise the Punggol Waterway will stretch all the way from Punggol to Boon Lay, although it is not inconceivable.&nbsp; We might need to build a waterway in Boon Lay from Jurong Lake all the way out to the Straits of Johor.&nbsp; But the fact is that we are progressively, through our estate rejuvenation programme, looking at all the <p align=left>Column: 2193<p>estates in Singapore. We have divided all the estates in Singapore into the old estates, the middle-aged estates and the new estates. The old estates refer to those estates where flats were developed in the 1980s and earlier;&nbsp;the middle-aged estates would be those developed in the mid-1980s; and the new estates would be those in 1990s and later.&nbsp;For each category of&nbsp;estate, we have policies and programmes in place that will benefit the residents.&nbsp; In the case of the older estates, we are going to rejuvenate them through SERS and a whole Estate Rejuvenation Programme.&nbsp;The old places like Queenstown, Redhill, and so on.&nbsp; The middle-aged estate, Yishun, is a classic example.&nbsp; Yishun's flats were mainly built in the 1980s. Those are the flats that we are going to rejuvenate through the HIP and NRP and&nbsp;the Estates Renewal&nbsp;Programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Punggol 21 is in the category of new estates. The reason we have concentrated on Punggol 21 this time is, as Members know, as Mr Charles Chong said in&nbsp;the House yesterday, in the last recession, the plans for Punggol 21 were stalled. The residents did not move in and demand for flats went down. Therefore, the rebuilding programme for Punggol 21 was stalled. We have decided to restart that programme in a big way.&nbsp; We have deliberately targeted most new flat developments in Punggol so that there will&nbsp; be a critical mass. That has allowed us to restart&nbsp;the programme as well as to put a whole new&nbsp;dimension to it.&nbsp; So the "plus"&nbsp;in the Punggol 21 Plus programme is actually quite substantial.&nbsp;&nbsp;For each of these genre of estates, the old, the middle-aged as well as the new, there will be something.&nbsp; But as Members all know, there is a limit, in terms of budget and resources, and&nbsp;we simply cannot do everything all at once.&nbsp; But rest assured that we have your estates in mind and we will try to implement those programmes as fast as possible.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as rental demand is concerned, yes, I think the Member is right. We <p align=left>Column: 2194<p>cannot just keep on building and chasing after demand.&nbsp; Demand for rental flats can be limitless.&nbsp; Who does not want to live in a new rental flat for $25-$30 a month?&nbsp; I think if we did not put new rental eligibility criteria, the demand for rental flats would&nbsp;hit the roof.&nbsp; And&nbsp;all of us, at the meet-the-people sessions, will suddenly find long queues of people wanting to come and apply. So this is the reason why we had to look critically at the situation and find out who are the people that we are building these flats for.&nbsp; And&nbsp;make sure they get them and not have everybody else coming in and joining the queue. That is the reason why we have to change the criteria and not to allow the demand to dictate how much rental flats to be built.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the housing for elderly, I have explained that we are stepping up the building of studio apartments.&nbsp; The number of studio apartments that we are going to build, the 1,000 over that we are going to build, will be distributed all over the place.&nbsp; In terms of the types of flats that we are building, definitely, this is going to cater&nbsp;to the elderly because they will have elder-friendly features. They will have, as far as possible, VWOs to look after their needs in the vicinity, either in the block itself or nearby. And to create a more balanced environment, we will be&nbsp;relocating them together with the other flats&nbsp;&ndash; the 3-room, 4-room and even 5-room flats.&nbsp; I am not sure I have answered the Member&nbsp;correctly on this.&nbsp; If she has any other questions, I will be&nbsp;happy to clarify later on.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen:</B> Sir, can I seek clarifications from the Minister to address my cut on single parents and housing?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> My apologies to Ms Eunice Olsen.&nbsp; I missed out on her cut on single mothers. She asked whether our current policy on singles mothers undermines other policies such as home <p align=left>Column: 2195<p>ownership and also being pro-children.&nbsp; I just want to say on this point that the principle underlying our housing policy for single mothers is&nbsp;to be&nbsp;pro-family.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the major policy imperative. That means HDB flats will only be sold&nbsp;at subsidised rates to those who can form a family nucleus, whether it is a couple or whether it is a couple with children or whether it is&nbsp;parents and grown-up children. Single mothers would be considered under this policy as singles.&nbsp; Under the singles policy, they can form a family nucleus with their parents and they can buy a new flat. If they are over 35, they can buy a resale flat under the Singles Singapore Citizen Scheme and of course, they will be eligible for the singles grant.&nbsp; For young umarried parents below 35 years, what do they do?&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage them to stay with their parents for mutual care and support.&nbsp; But we all know that in some cases, this is not always possible and we have instances where we have granted exemptions for single parents to actually buy a HDB flat. So exemptions have been made for poor families in difficulties.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for divorced women, although divorced couples do not constitute a family unit, HDB does allow the divorced party, with custody of children to keep their flat.&nbsp; So they are able to retain the matrimonial flat, of course, subject to the usual eligibility conditions.&nbsp; This will help the divorcees who do not have the means to&nbsp;buy another flat to live in the flat. Essentially, our policies on divorced women are quite sympathetic and we have quite a lot cases where divorced women who have custody of children continue to stay in the flat.&nbsp; However, we also have certain situations where they cannot afford to buy over the flat and we have looked at it sympathetically and provided them with a rental flat.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim:</B> Sir, two points of clarification.&nbsp; One is with regard <p align=left>Column: 2196<p>to the housing counsellors mentioned by the Minister earlier in his speech.&nbsp; I would like to know whether&nbsp;these are&nbsp;full-time professionally-trained counsellors or HDB estate officers doubling as counsellors.&nbsp; Secondly, with regard to the optimal level of lease structure in Singapore, in view of the changes in the socio-economic structure, such as with the ageing population and globalisation, are there plans to review the land lease structure in Singapore for the development of private residential housing in Singapore?&nbsp; Has the Ministry received any request or indications of demand for such developments of maybe, 30, 50 or 60-year lease land for private residential development in Singapore?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Yes, for housing counsellors, I informed Members that HDB has appointed housing counsellors in all our branch officers. These are existing HDB officers and they have been trained to deal with financial counselling, ie, to deal with&nbsp;cases in financial difficulty. Although they may not be professional financial&nbsp;counsellors, they do have the information and ability to counsel these difficult cases.&nbsp; They have been successful in what they do.&nbsp;In fact, the number of arrears cases has seen a drop in the last year. They have been able, through very patient and painstaking efforts, to work with the individual cases to resolve their financial problems in&nbsp;a more sustainable way. So when I described the various ways that they can help these residents&nbsp;&ndash; giving them a loan to downgrade, providing them with temporary interim accommodation where necessary and now providing them even with a new flat but at market rates&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;all these measures are made known to the counsellors and the counellors in turn would advise the residents accordingly. So they have all the information at their fingertips and they will be able to give the necessary and proper advice to the residents.&nbsp; I have faith that they will be able to do a good job. Many a&nbsp;time, it is not the <p align=left>Column: 2197<p>professional expertise that is required.&nbsp; It is in trying to convince the residents to have a change in their lifestyle. Many&nbsp;a time, when they approach the HDB officer, they are not psychologically and mentally prepared to make that change.&nbsp; And it is difficult change. So the counselling involves not just showing them what they can save from downgrading, but also giving them some time to psychologically prepare themselves.</P></span></div>    <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

He mentioned about the debt servicing ratio as the gauge to whether flats are affordable.&nbsp; Currently, I would like to ask the Minister how many years of loans are we talking about when we talk about debt servicing ratio of 21%.&nbsp; Because with longer life expectancy and delayed retirement age, debt servicing ratio of 21%, if I need to take a loan of 50 years, is a lot of money as well.&nbsp; The second point&nbsp;is in terms of rate of returns&nbsp;in an investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I bought a HDB flat in 1970s, compared to if I bought a HDB flat in 1980s and 1990s, what are my relative rate of returns&nbsp;over the years?&nbsp; I believe it is decreasing over the years.&nbsp; Last of all, on&nbsp;rental subsidy.&nbsp; I know that each rental unit is heavily subsidised.&nbsp; How much is the Government subsidising per unit?&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that there are a lot of people on arrears currently and&nbsp;waiting to rent out their rooms to settle their debts.&nbsp; Why does the Government not take this subsidy and rent those rooms in the open market so that&nbsp;they can pass it to those in the long queue?&nbsp; In this case, it will cut short&nbsp;the whole system of building rental flats immediately and&nbsp;there is a ready supply now.&nbsp;</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> On affordability,&nbsp;the debt servicing ratio is calculated based on an average mortgage tenure of about 30 years, because mortgages cannot go beyond the age of 65 years for the mortgagee.&nbsp; HDB will not give you a loan that stretches beyond 65 years because <p align=left>Column: 2200<p>we want to make sure that when you retire, you are not saddled with this housing debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is based on a subsidised concessionary loan rate currently&nbsp;set at 2.6%, and on the average price of the flat and your median income.&nbsp; So based on these&nbsp;numbers that I showed, the debt servicing ratio is comfortably below what most financial institutions would regard as affordable for the family.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On rate of return&nbsp;&ndash; I think the point is not the rate of return <I>per se</I>.&nbsp; The point is really from the time you buy your flat to the time you can unlock the value of the flat, whether there is this store of value that has been created.&nbsp; The track record&nbsp;shows that there is this store of value.&nbsp; It is just like making any other property investment.&nbsp; The longer you hold and if the economy grows, the better will be your return.&nbsp; Of course, if you buy and sell, as some people did in the heydays of the 1990s, you can make a lot of money, but you can also lose a lot of money.&nbsp; So, here we are talking about the&nbsp;HDB flat as a long-term investment.&nbsp; It is not for speculation.&nbsp; It is not for short-term profit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to emphasise that many times.&nbsp; I did that again in my speech just now.&nbsp; If you start talking about what is your rate of return, I think you have already started off on a wrong footing.&nbsp; Basically,&nbsp;you own your flat, you have a roof over your head, it is a comfortable roof, it will appreciate in value over time and it will be your nest egg in your old age.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on rental subsidy.&nbsp;Currently, our rental flats are priced below 10% of the market value.&nbsp; So&nbsp;one room, on average, in the market is about $400-$500&nbsp;depending on location.&nbsp; The rental for a&nbsp;subsidised 1-room flat&nbsp;is&nbsp;$30.&nbsp; So it is probably closer to 5% rather than 10% of the market rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just do&nbsp;the mathematics.&nbsp; That is the kind of subsidy we are talking about, and it is a substantial subsidy, $20,000, $30,000 over the lifetime.&nbsp; And that is&nbsp;the reason why we say if you have&nbsp;already enjoyed <p align=left>Column: 2201<p>two&nbsp;housing subsidies, you cannot come back for a rental flat&nbsp;because you have enjoyed more than your fair share of the housing subsidies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his other suggestion,&nbsp;one of the things we could do is to price all our flats at market rate&nbsp;and provide subsidies.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use that subsidy for your rental flat or you can use it for something else.&nbsp; But is that something that the Member would advocate?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Just to reply to the Minister.&nbsp;

Perhaps, you have to try to look at the other solution of trying to get them back from the heavy vehicle parking lot to their homes, whether it is in the middle of the night or early in the morning.&nbsp;

That is not many years from now.&nbsp; So&nbsp;it gives you an indication of what is going to come.&nbsp; This&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2204<p>applies to Hougang area as well as all the other constituencies.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On why HDB is not reimbursing the blocks that were torn down.&nbsp; I think the Members&nbsp;was specifically&nbsp;referring to blocks that were affected by redevelopment.&nbsp; HDB/URA will review our land use requirement on a regular basis.&nbsp; We make our decision whether to redevelop or conserve areas according to&nbsp;market requirement.&nbsp; Will we be able to tell&nbsp;them seven years in advance that there is a market redevelopment plan?&nbsp; I do not think we can do so.&nbsp; As it is, I think it is hard to project seven months in advance, let alone seven years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the type of lifts, I would just like to, perhaps, explain&nbsp;the process that we will take.&nbsp; In the LUP project preparation,&nbsp;HDB will involve the Town Council as well as representatives from the residents, typically from the RC, and we will form a working group.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this working group, we will discuss various options including type of lift, location of new lifts, the number of lifts to install, and so on.&nbsp; And, of course, one important consideration would be the expected cost as a result of this solution.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier on, we have to look at alternative methods of installing the lifts.&nbsp; Primarily, from a cost perspective, we do have a cost cap in order for us not to spend too much on any single block.&nbsp; That, first of all, could be expensive and it is not a wise way to use Government funds.&nbsp; Secondly, Town Councils&nbsp;and residents will have at the same time pay equivalent amount of co-payment which is on the high side as well.&nbsp; Taking that into consideration, the discussion at the working committee will take into consideration the views of the Town Councils, residents&nbsp;as well as HDB.&nbsp; If we find that the only way&nbsp;to carry on with the LUP is to use a certain method, we will definitely put forward that as an option to the working committee.&nbsp; The working committee can decide to proceed with the proposed method or they can <p align=left>Column: 2205<p>decide not to proceed.&nbsp; I think that is&nbsp;the prerogative&nbsp;the working committee can take.&nbsp; So let me assure&nbsp;Members that Town Council's view will be solicited and will be taken into consideration in that process.&nbsp; On&nbsp;whether we have studied that implication, I think we have studied it.&nbsp; In fact, before we implement the solution, we have actually tested it out with the prototype in the&nbsp;engineering section in HDB.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The mobile and broadband connection today&nbsp;should be considered a necessity item given our connected society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry and IDA, the regulator for connectivity services, have put in place various measures, such as the implementation of number portability and recently, an attempt to reduce the contract period of mobile phone contracts, to reduce the costs of communications by promoting greater competition.&nbsp;

Locally produced Chinese television serials have come a long way.&nbsp; To be fair to MediaCorp, I think it has been producing Chinese serials of a high standard even before the success of the "Little Nonya".&nbsp; Although Hong Kong has a longer history of producing popular television serials before us, we can and are beginning to give the competitors in the industry a run for their money.&nbsp; I urge MICA not to waver in the support of the production of local television serials, especially the Chinese language ones.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, although Singapore is generally known as a English-speaking society, I wonder why when it comes to local English TV serials, there is a comparative lack of success.&nbsp; Is this because of a lack of funding support?&nbsp; It is sad to see even as Singaporeans' appreciation of the&nbsp;arts grow, the locally produced English television programmes still concentrate on mindless comedies.&nbsp; I look forward to the Ministry's attention to this area of development although we may not be aspiring to be Hollywood.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Since the launch of the Creative Industries Development Strategy in 2003, this cluster has grown by about 6% annually in value-added and contributed to the vibrancy of our economy and society.&nbsp; However, like other economic sectors, the Creative Industries have also been hit by the economic recession.&nbsp; Preliminary estimates indicated that for 2008, the Creative Industries only managed a 1% to 2% growth in value-added, compared&nbsp;to 9% in 2007.&nbsp; The infocomm sector grew by 6% to 7% in 2008, compared to 11% in 2007.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2009 will be a very challenging year for the Creative Industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;MICA will harness our resources to help creative enterprises ride the storm and prepare for the recovery. We will upgrade capabilities to prepare for economic recovery and new opportunities.&nbsp; We will also continue to invest in physical infrastructure for the creative industries and spend on vital R&amp;D to be at the forefront of innovation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start with the media sector.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low asked about our plans to develop Singapore into a media hub.&nbsp; This is indeed the objective of Media Development Authority&rsquo;s Singapore Media Fusion (SMF) masterplan.&nbsp; SMF is an initiative to build a vibrant media ecosystem for our media companies to create and produce attractive content such as films, TV serials and documentaries for Singapore and the international market.&nbsp; Government will commit $230 million over the next five years for the SMF initiative.&nbsp; This is on top of existing government support of $500 million over five years for the Interactive Digital Media (IDM)&nbsp;sector.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2215<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMF will give a boost&nbsp;to the&nbsp;local media industry.&nbsp; It&nbsp;will stimulate demand for local contents, applications and services, and help create jobs in this sector.&nbsp; Under SMF, MDA will increase funding for collaborative media projects with the private sector.&nbsp; One such initiative is the Singapore Film Commission (SFC) New Feature Film Fund, which co-invests up to $250,000 per film.&nbsp; This gives emerging Singaporean talents the opportunity to direct&nbsp;feature films in collaboration with production companies. Last year, nine Singapore directors benefited from SFC&rsquo;s funding support of over $2 million.&nbsp; It has&nbsp;resulted in the first Singapore-Japan co-production film called "Thunder Boys".&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look forward to more such co-productions and film projects in the years ahead.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Teo Ser Luck that MDA gives full support to local film makers, including those producing films with local audience appeal.&nbsp; The SFC&rsquo;s New Feature Film Fund, which I mentioned earlier on, benefits works that are targeted at both local audience and the international market.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My response to Dr Ong Seh Hong's call for supporting local TV serials is that, yes, MDA will continue to support the production of good quality TV content.&nbsp; In fact, this year, MDA will fund 4,000&nbsp;hours of free-to-air TV content up from 3,800 hours last year.&nbsp; Recent beneficiaries include the one that was mentioned by Dr Ong,&nbsp;"Little Nonya", and the Tamil serial "Guru Paavai".&nbsp; MDA also helps showcase Singapore media products at our Asia Media Festival held in Singapore and also international events&nbsp;such as the&nbsp;Cannes Film Mart.&nbsp; Over 110 local media companies participated in such international events last year and secured an estimated US$84 million in deals.&nbsp; MDA will continue to work with <p align=left>Column: 2216<p>distributors and promote made-by-Singapore content worldwide.&nbsp; This effort has already yielded dividends with Singapore content sold to international players such as BBC (UK), ABC (Australia), Phoenix TV (China), TVB (Hong Kong), NHK (Japan), Discovery and National Geographic channels (US).</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMF will also support media financing initiatives.&nbsp; To date, we have anchored more than $1 billion of media funds in Singapore to finance international and Singapore media projects.&nbsp; MDA will continue to help media companies seeking financing for their projects.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMF also aims to build up a strong media talent base, a concern which was mentioned&nbsp;by Miss Penny Low and Dr Fatimah Lateef.&nbsp; MDA, in collaboration with the public and private sectors, will build a pipeline of skilled media manpower.&nbsp; For example, MDA, WDA and the industry are working on media-related programmes to retrain and upgrade up to 5,000 workers under&nbsp;the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MDA will introduce an attachment programme to match 500 local media professionals with companies and projects.&nbsp; We will also offer aspiring young talents opportunities to study full-time under the Media Education Scheme.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To stimulate growth in digital media content and applications, Government will continue to invest in R&amp;D in the IDM sector.&nbsp; In the last two years, we have secured IDM industry investments of more than $200 million, creating about 800 new jobs.&nbsp; One example is KooBits, which was set up by a NUS engineering graduate, Mr Stanley Han.&nbsp; This is a platform for children to create and publish e-books. KooBits has been launched in more than 80 Singapore schools and&nbsp;large number of training centres in Indonesia.&nbsp; Another example is Garena, an online <p align=left>Column: 2217<p>gaming service provider.&nbsp; Launched barely two years ago, Garena now boasts over 10 million registered users worldwide.&nbsp; Going forward, we will allocate another $70 million to support some 150 new IDM projects and start-ups.&nbsp; To promote commercialisation of IDM R&amp;D output, MDA will also actively match-make local companies with global investors and distributors of such products.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, SMF&rsquo;s software development strategy will complement the investment in infrastructure such as the Mediapolis@one-north project.&nbsp; This multi-agency project by MDA, JTC, IDA and EDB will provide&nbsp;key infrastructure, such as world-class soundstages and post-production facility&nbsp;to serve media companies.&nbsp; MDA will launch the SMF masterplan by June and announce more details then.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low asked for an update on the iN2015 masterplan.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform this House that IDA is making good progress with iN2015.&nbsp; The iN2015 masterplan is aimed at transforming the economy by the wider adoption of infocomm, nurturing globally competitive infocomm enterprises, developing a capable and competent infocomm workforce and building a Next Generation National Broadband Network,&nbsp;otherwise known as the NGNBN.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote wider adoption of infocomm, IDA has allocated $70 million for schemes such as Calls-for-Collaboration to co-develop infocomm business solutions.&nbsp; This includes $10 million for the&nbsp;Infocomm@SME&nbsp;programme to support infocomm adoption by local SMEs.&nbsp; In addition, IDA continues to promote infocomm innovation amongst SMEs with $5 million set aside from SPRING&rsquo;s Technology Innovation Programme.&nbsp; These programmes will enable IDA to help more SMEs to adopt infocomm to enhance their business model and competitiveness.&nbsp; For example, <p align=left>Column: 2218<p>IDA was able to help Gramercy Music implement an Enterprise Resource Planning system for its music retail business which will save the company cost and raise its efficiency.&nbsp; IDA will also partner SPRING to provide a single point-of-contact for relevant SME infocomm funding schemes to increase convenience for SMEs.&nbsp; It will work with SiTF,&nbsp;the chambers of commerce and other organisations to extend the use of&nbsp;infocomm throughout our SME sector.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the years, local infocomm companies have developed capabilities and solutions especially in the&nbsp; e-government area.&nbsp; To help these companies, IDA has&nbsp;incorporated IDA International to promote their services overseas.&nbsp; Companies such as ST Electronics, EcQuaria and SQLview are already working with IDA International in the Middle East, Africa and Central and South America.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the adverse economic conditions, the infocomm sector will continue to provide employment opportunities for graduates.&nbsp; To boost the talent pool, IDA is investing about $30 million over the next five years in scholarships.&nbsp; A new Integrated Infocomm Scholarship will be offered.&nbsp; It will provide a direct route from polytechnic to university for outstanding "O" level students interested in infocomm studies.&nbsp; IDA will also extend the National Infocomm Scholarship for undergraduates for another three years. Already, it has&nbsp;awarded 155 scholarships under this scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.15 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To incentivise infocomm professionals to upgrade their capabilities, IDA will invest about $25 million to enhance its Critical Infocomm Technology Resource Programme.</p></P></span></div>     <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sponsorship for infocomm courses and certification fees will be raised from the current 50% to 80%.&nbsp; Companies sponsoring their employees for these courses will also be eligible for <p align=left>Column: 2219<p>Absentee Payroll at $50 per day.&nbsp; This programme is expected to benefit about 10,000 infocomm professionals over the next two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BothMiss Penny Low and Mr Zaqy had spoken on the cost of communications. &nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that the cost of communications via mobile, broadband and fixed line&nbsp;is likely&nbsp;to remain competitive. The mobile sector is fiercely competitive with&nbsp;three operators offering a variety of services. &nbsp;The launch of Full Mobile Number Portability in June 2008 had intensified competition as mobile operators have offered more value-for-money packages and handset subsidies.&nbsp; While the fixed line sector is dominated by the incumbent operator, we are also seeing competitive forces at work which will continue to bring prices down.&nbsp; Over the past three years, broadband rates have fallen by more than 70%.&nbsp; Operators have also upgraded their broadband speeds to respond to consumers'&nbsp;needs for higher bandwidth.&nbsp; The convergence of the telecoms, broadband and media sectors have also resulted in more competitive prices in the form of triple-play packages.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Next Generation National Broadband Network (NGNBN) will contribute to further cost reduction and greater vibrancy in the infocomm and the communications sector. &nbsp;Mr Zaqy Mohamad had asked for an update on this project.&nbsp; We are pushing ahead with this critical infocomm infrastructure.&nbsp; The project is on schedule. &nbsp;IDA has awarded the NetCo Request-For-Proposal last September to OpenNet consortium to build the passive fibre-to-the-home network.&nbsp; The evaluation of the OpCo RFP for&nbsp;the company to operate the active electronics for the network is ongoing and we expect to award this OpCo contract&nbsp;by March 2009. &nbsp;Work on the network should commence later this year.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2220<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NGNBN will provide consumers and businesses with highly competitive broadband services based on an effective open access model. &nbsp;IDA will regulate the NetCo and&nbsp;OpCo&rsquo;s wholesale prices. &nbsp;OpenNet, the consortium that won the NetCo RFP,&nbsp;had proposed monthly wholesale prices of $15 per residential connection and $50 for&nbsp;non-residential connection. &nbsp;The eventual retail prices will naturally be higher than wholesale prices.&nbsp; Nevertheless, with such wholesale prices, all Singaporeans can look forward to more affordable and attractive communications and media services compared with current prices.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further optimise the use of the NGNBN, IDA will implement a neutral Singapore Internet Exchange to improve domestic internet traffic routing and access to content. IDA will also foster the growth of innovative NGNBN services through the development of Next Gen Innovation Centres.&nbsp; One example is Cisco&rsquo;s Enabling Platform Innovation Centre, launched last December.&nbsp; IDA will also introduce the Next Gen Services Innovation Programme to help companies develop prototype and scalable services over the NGNBN.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low sought an update on the Wireless@SG programme.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform this House that Wireless@SG has been completed ahead of schedule.&nbsp; Today, we have more than 7,400 hotspots serving most public areas throughout Singapore compared to 900 in 2006.&nbsp; More than 1.2 million people have signed up with the three operators for the basic tier of free wireless broadband service.&nbsp; Usage has also gone up from the average of 2.1 hours per month in December 2006 to 4.2 hours per month currently. &nbsp;IDA will consider how to further refine and enhance this programme.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low asked how&nbsp;are we encouraging ICT adoption by our citizens.&nbsp; In general, Singaporeans are already tech-<p align=left>Column: 2221<p>savvy.&nbsp; Today we have a mobile penetration rate of 131% and a household broadband penetration rate of close to 100%. &nbsp;IDA will continue to reach out to citizens to promote the use of infocomm technology.&nbsp; We will work with organisations such as NTUC to strengthen online engagement with its 500,000 members.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will nurture a digitally-inclusive society and reach out to the marginalised sector, which was one of Miss Penny Low&rsquo;s concerns. &nbsp;IDA&rsquo;s NEU PC Plus programme offers students from low-income households and disabled people highly-subsidised computers which comes with broadband services. &nbsp;This programme has benefited about 7,000 households with school-going children since it started two years ago and is expected to benefit an additional 38,000 needy households by 2015.&nbsp; IDA will also continue its Silver Infocomm Initiative to equip our senior citizens with necessary infocomm skills.<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On design,&nbsp;Dr Ong Seh Hong had asked about our support for the design enterprises. Last November, I launched the $12 million "Design for Enterprises" programme which will&nbsp; help SMEs in various economic sectors enhance their competitiveness through design innovation.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that about 200 companies have already expressed interest in this joint programme by DesignSingapore, IE Singapore and SPRING.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DesignSingapore has further earmarked $10 million over the next two years to strengthen the Design Capability Development Programme. &nbsp;This includes funding support for cross-disciplinary mentorships, scholarships, internships and overseas promotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DesignSingapore has promoted and profiled almost 1,500 Singapore designers since 2004 and Mr Ashley Isham was <p align=left>Column: 2222<p>mentioned by Dr Ong.&nbsp; Indeed he was one of those that we have profiled.&nbsp; I remember meeting him when I visited&nbsp;London several years ago. &nbsp;It will continue to showcase Singapore designers and enterprises at prestigious international events such as the London Design Festival and Venice Biennale, the Architecture Biennale. &nbsp;Such promotions have yielded dividends for our designers. &nbsp;Just last month, home-grown furniture designer&nbsp;company Air Division secured on-the-spot business deals with two topline Italian furniture companies at the leading&nbsp;furniture fair in IMM Cologne.&nbsp; So despite the gloomy scenario, there is still demand for well-designed products and I am glad that our Singapore designers were able to meet up and take advantage of such demands and opportunities.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef asked how we could harness the talent of freelancers in the Creative Industries.&nbsp; Freelancers do play an important role in the creative industries, particularly in the design sector&nbsp;and I am pleased to inform her that MICA has started to&nbsp;work with the private sector on a Creative Industries Freelancers' Network. &nbsp;This initiative will provide a centralised resource and contact database and a wide range of services such as training and networking to help match freelancers with companies and potential users of their design expertise. &nbsp;It will be launched later this year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, in conclusion, MICA is focused on assisting our creative enterprises tide over the current economic difficulties. &nbsp;We will also invest in manpower development and infrastructure for the longer term. &nbsp;We will ensure that Singapore&rsquo;s Creative Industries and the wider economy will have both the software and hardware to grow and prosper once the economic storm blows over. &nbsp;We can look to the future with confidence in Singapore&rsquo;s ability to transform into a globally competitive creative economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It cultivates an atmosphere of goodwill that makes it easier for everyone to co-exist with one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing a culture of reciprocity is also important.&nbsp; It is harder to give up your seat in the MRT train if your experience is <p align=left>Column: 2228<p>that, every time you do, the person just sits down without a glance, with no "thank you".&nbsp;&nbsp;It is harder to open the door for the person behind you, if every time you do, a stream of people just breeze by as if you are&nbsp;the doorman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I talk to Singaporeans who migrate to other countries, one reason they often cite for their decision is Singapore is too pressurised a society and the people are not gracious.&nbsp; They want to live in a more gracious environment.&nbsp; And this is what we want for ourselves too.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it is the people that make up the heart of any city and which defines its quality of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have had many campaigns on being gracious before?&nbsp; What will make this work better and stick better than the previous ones?&nbsp; I would suggest a fundamental change in approach which focuses more on values and redefining society's idea of what it means to be "great".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would propose the campaign slogan "Great to be gracious" showing scenes of how we want life to be, to redefine our values as a great society which will bear fruit in gracious behaviour.&nbsp; That graciousness is something which starts with oneself, at home and in the community.&nbsp; I would urge the Minister to pay special effort in reaching out to our younger generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that being gracious is rooted in one's values, I have reservations with the name "Project Gracious", which is being recommended by MICA.&nbsp; A project sounds very task-oriented and superficial &ndash; that it is something that has a start and an end date, that it is something you have to do; they might be even have homework, and it is not something that you want to do because you believe in it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also ask why we need to link it to big events like the Youth Olympics or APEC.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2229<p>We are not being gracious to please somebody else or to make sure that our&nbsp;tourists are happy or that tourists will&nbsp;spend money.&nbsp; We are being gracious because we want that kind of society for ourselves, and we want to build a great society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the last time we had a campaign like this, it was at the World Bank and we tried to get everyone to smile.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it was successful for a time.&nbsp; But we notice that it is a behaviour that has sunk in as a national trait.&nbsp; If we do want to make&nbsp;graciousness a part of our culture, we have to go to the root of it,&nbsp;the principle,&nbsp;the values that guide our behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Plans for the Arts and Heritage Sectors</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, on my second cut.&nbsp; Despite the recession, it is important to continue to invest in Singapore artists and arts groups, to create distinctively Singaporean content as well as to encourage collaborations with artists of other countries.&nbsp; This will position Singapore for the future as a thriving global arts city.&nbsp; How have these investments been bearing fruit since the first phase of the Renaissance City Plan (RCP) started in 2000?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is&nbsp;important as we&nbsp;need to invest in our heritage sectors. Singapore has a rich heritage and history which deserve to be preserved and showcased better.&nbsp; I would urge MICA to identify a suitable site in Singapore to develop a cluster for private museums and art galleries, and to promote greater interest among Singaporeans of their programmes and exhibitions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be ideal if this cluster&nbsp;be near the National Archives at Fort Canning Rise, another important institution. There are old shophouses and a carpark nearby&nbsp;which can be converted to be part of such a heritage cluster.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 2230<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The archives and heritage centres show us, and future generations, how we came to be what we are as a nation, a community or an individual.&nbsp; They are a hidden national asset of documents, photographs, maps, systems and radio broadcasts that constitute the primary record of our past, the very essence of our heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should do more to develop especially our National Archives and ensure it has the resources to keep up with the expanding demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its importance was highlighted recently during the dispute over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In awarding Singapore sovereignty over the island, the International Court of Justice noted that the strength of Singapore's claim lay in a letter sent by the State Secretary of Johor in 1953 to the Singapore Government.&nbsp; This letter, and many other historic documents used to back up Singapore's case, was uncovered by the archives staff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite its importance, the archives still fail to attract interest as part of our heritage, and suffer from under-funding and neglect.&nbsp; Yet, why should the loss of a contemporary artwork, or the demolition of a single historical&nbsp;building, provoke more attention than the loss of an irreplaceable archive collection?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Archives have long remained one of our few untapped treasures.&nbsp; MICA should set up a task force to look at how we can explore&nbsp;how the nation's archives can be turned more fully to advantage, and to seek ways of ensuring continued investment in and support for this neglected legacy.&nbsp; This includes renovating its building, so that it is at least on par with the standard of our National Museum and Library.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need a strategy for national knowledge management: for saving and <p align=left>Column: 2231<p>storing our present for future generations.&nbsp; Sir, I have been doing quite a lot of research&nbsp;in the Archives in recent years and have never forgotten my excitement at dealing with some historical documents which brought to life the struggle for Singapore's independence by our modern founding fathers.&nbsp; But there is also frustration.&nbsp; Our archival collection of our modern founding fathers, for example, are quite piecemeal.&nbsp; There were times when I searched in vain for missing documents which could not be located, despite the best&nbsp;efforts on the part of the&nbsp;Archives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This present Government should also be conscious of the need to capture historic moments and decisions.&nbsp; Future generations may be equally fascinated by our present struggle to overcome the economic crises of today.&nbsp; Fifty years from now, they may want to know why the Elected President decided for the first time in history to unlock the reserves.&nbsp; They will search for a written statement or film footage of the President announcing his historic decision to turn the second key.

In a belt tightening situation, it is often what they perceive to be the less essential or even non-essential items that will be sacrificed.&nbsp; What are these less essential or non-essential items?&nbsp; At this stage of our development, most Singa-<p align=left>Column: 2232<p>poreans would include the participation and contribution to arts and cultural activities as non-essential items.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst this may be how individuals spend their money under tight budget constraint, should the Government's spending on the arts and culture reflect a similar pattern?&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I hope not.&nbsp; I believe that the Government should take a strategic view for the development of arts and culture in Singapore.&nbsp; While this economic crisis is likely to be severe and prolonged, we should not treat the development of&nbsp;arts and culture in Singapore as a non-essential item that should be sacrificed when times are bad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the current economic crisis is of immediate concern, we should not forget our long-term vision to build Singapore into a global city.&nbsp; To be a global city, we need to have both the hardware and the software which require years of continued investment.&nbsp; If our long-term goal is to build up a creative and vibrant arts and cultural setting in Singapore, we need to continue to invest in the development of the arts and culture even during the current economic downturn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must believe that Singapore has strong fundamentals and that we can weather the current financial tsunami.&nbsp; If we have what it takes to weather the storm, we should ensure that the strong winds do not tear down the arts and cultural scene that we have painstakingly built in recent years.&nbsp; Should we neglect our arts and cultural development at this stage, we run the risk of having to take a few more years to re-establish ourselves to where we are right now.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

into a Singapore National Arts Gallery.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider setting aside parts of the buildings to be used as a venue for a legal history museum or a museum of Singapore law?&nbsp; These buildings are already located in the right neighbourhood in Singapore's heritage and museum districts.&nbsp; In addition, such an initiative would have various advantages.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there is no better venue for having a legal history museum than the Supreme Court.&nbsp; The 1939 building is of particular significance as it was Singapore's Supreme Court for over 60 years, serving as a symbol of justice in our island nation.&nbsp; It was only the second purpose-built court house in Singapore.&nbsp; Many great cases had been heard within its four walls.&nbsp; Indeed, the public meetings held by our only post-independence Constitutional Commission were also held there.&nbsp; It is an instantly recognised world landmark identified&nbsp;with law and lawyers.&nbsp; Secondly, the architecture and furnishing of the building are of great historical and aesthetic value.&nbsp; Many members of the Legal Profession feel that it is important to retain the architecture and layout of three <p align=left>Column: 2236<p>parts of the building.&nbsp; These are the Court of Appeal, Court No. 1 and Chambers, formerly used by the Chief Justice, and the former circular Library under the Dome.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the local bar is maturing.&nbsp; As the legal profession grows, it is imperative to preserve its heritage and institutional memory.&nbsp; Preserving these buildings and making these three venues into Chambers for a museum of legal history will allow future generation of lawyers and Singaporeans to see how justice was administered as well as to enjoy something which is aesthetically&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Museums have an intrinsic value.&nbsp; They preserve, collect and document items important to humanity, to our culture and heritage, from the mundane and common to the rare and unique.&nbsp; They are more than a knowledge archive.&nbsp; They contribute to building a sense of community, identity and belonging by serving as a conduit for cultural transmission and continuity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has a long and illustrious legal history dating back to colonial times.&nbsp; Memorable milestones include the 1872 Second Charter of Justice, which established our legal system based on the English common law, which espouses principles of common right, reason and humanity&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the foundations of justice.&nbsp; Museums help us to remember, to see and understand the world around us.&nbsp; It is timely and appropriate to establish&nbsp;a legal history museum in this historic setting.&nbsp; Such a museum will not only allow Singapore to showcase its rich legal history or legacy that has made it into one of the world's best legal systems in many respects, but it will also give us the opportunity to honour the key <p align=left>Column: 2237<p>personalities who have made the system what it is.&nbsp; Such a museum can feature both permanent and temporary exhibitions and will also act as a repository for materials relating to Singapore's legal past.&nbsp; This is a valuable aspect of continuing education which can stimulate intellectual creativity, exploration and dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Museums are incubators&nbsp;for a&nbsp;society's self reflection about from whence it has come, where it currently is and whither it will go.&nbsp; They speak to what was, what is and makes us meditate upon what is to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some concerned parties have pointed out their fear that without a legal history museum, many important documents and artifacts will be lost to time.&nbsp; For example, we have lost the valuable coroners' records that form the basic of classic books by historian, James Warren, such as&nbsp;"A People's History of Singapore 1880-1940".&nbsp; My own attempts to track down the original representations to the 1966 Constitutional Commission have also failed.&nbsp; Records and artifacts belonging to old law firms, lawyers and judges are now either lost or lying under appreciated in some dusty cupboard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This reminds me a little of a line from my favourite poem by Thomas Gray entitled "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard":</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Full many&nbsp;a gem of purest ray serene,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full many&nbsp;a flower is born to blush unseen,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And waste its sweetness on the desert air."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as our legal history is concerned, we can act to remedy the situation to prevent the loss or under appreciation of valuable things, to bring what is hidden in the public eye for the enjoyment, enrichment and edification of the majority of people.&nbsp; We need to keep some landmarks in our fast-paced rapidly changing nation, as an anchor to the past helps us remember who we are and aspire <p align=left>Column: 2238<p>to be, to aid our navigation to the waters of our own unquiet times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are very few such museums elsewhere in the world.&nbsp; Economically speaking,&nbsp;in utilitarian or instrumental terms, a legal history museum can add to our menu of tourist attractions.&nbsp; Given Singapore's high standing in the legal world, such a museum would be a worthy addition to our cultural space.&nbsp; Culture itself embodies an intangible or spiritual value from which the soul of a nation is forged.&nbsp; Museums represent a hope that we will endure and having something to pass on to the next generation and generations&nbsp;yet unborn.&nbsp; Whether in a time of feast or famine, museums, including a Singapore legal history museum, would be a valuable investment for any healthy society to make.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The performance was held at the Esplanade Theatre.&nbsp; I was told that this was the first time that a local dialect&nbsp;musical troupe performed there.&nbsp; It must have cost them a bomb.&nbsp; I was thinking why was it necessary for them to perform there.&nbsp; In Singapore, all the dialect operas were performed as roadside <I>wayang</I> with simple staging and lighting.&nbsp; However, that night's performance&nbsp;changed my point of view.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The staging of "A Mother's Woes" was simple, yet effective.&nbsp; The lighting design was state-of-the-art; the story was&nbsp;exciting; and the singing was very good.&nbsp; It was indeed a great audio-visual enjoyment.&nbsp;

But I am very glad to say that the 40-odd performers were all Singaporeans, particularly the four or five main actors and actresses were very competent in their singing technique; their stage presence was very outstanding.&nbsp; The President of the troupe told me that the Chinese director came here only a&nbsp;couple of weeks before the performance.&nbsp; However, our local opera singers have been practising very hard throughout the year.&nbsp;

Let me update this House&nbsp;on how MICA, through the&nbsp;Renaissance City Plan&nbsp;III, will respond to this economic downturn, use arts and culture to enhance Singapore's livability and our reputation as a Global City of the Arts,&nbsp;build capabilities and strengthen Singaporeans' sense of rootedness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng asked&nbsp;if investments in our local artistes have borne fruit since the Renaissance City Plan (RCP) was first launched.&nbsp;&nbsp;A key measure of the success of the RCP is the vibrancy of our arts and cultural scene.&nbsp; In the last 10 years,&nbsp;the number of arts activities in Singapore has quadrupled to more than 27,000 events a year.&nbsp; Over the same period, ticketed attendances have doubled to 1.5 million, achieving ticket sales for&nbsp;arts performances of about $46 million in 2008.&nbsp; Visitorships to our national museums have also increased more than seven fold to almost 2.5 million.&nbsp; The diversity in our cultural landscape is enhanced by a range of private sector initiatives in various creative fields, such as the Old School at Mount Sophia for the arts and the Mint Museum of Toys for the heritage sector.&nbsp; MICA will continue to work with EDB to identify suitable sites in Singapore to support the development of more clusters for private museums and the art galleries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RCP's reach can also be measured&nbsp;by the degree of participation in arts and culture among Singaporeans.&nbsp; Today, one in three Singaporeans attend at least one arts event annually&nbsp;&ndash; treble the participation rate from a decade ago.&nbsp; Gratifyingly, the strongest growth in arts attendance has been amongst HDB 1- to 3-room flat dwellers and those who have 'O' level education and below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, through funding&nbsp;under RCP, artistes and institutions have made notable achievements in artistic excellence.&nbsp; Over 500 artistes and arts groups have been supported by NAC to <p align=left>Column: 2241<p>participate in international events and collaborations over the past five years.&nbsp; Singapore's major arts institutions, like the Esplanade and major events like the Singapore Arts Festival, now attract the participation of some of the world's most promising artistes.&nbsp; These programmes and blockbuster exhibitions in our museums have enjoyed favourable reviews and become regular features in&nbsp; international journals, such as the <I>International Herald Tribune</I> and <I>Time</I> magazine as well as in our local media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's efforts to establish itself as a global city for the arts have not gone unnoticed.&nbsp; In a recent 15th January 2009 <I>Forbes</I> article on the "World's Culture Capitals" of which 10 locations were singled out for special mention,&nbsp;Singapore was the only one&nbsp;in Asia and <I>Forbes</I> declared that "while many perceive Singapore as a sterile business centre, its cultural presence in the East is now undeniable."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low and Mr Gautam Banerjee expressed concern about MICA's funding for the arts and culture during the economic downturn.&nbsp; Miss Low highlighted the importance of MICA continuing to fund the arts in anticipation of a future upswing.&nbsp; Mr Banerjee also emphasised that to be a global city, we must continue to invest in the arts and culture in a downturn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand and fully appreciate the difficulties that local arts groups will face.&nbsp; We are committed to sustaining the arts during this period of downturn by maintaining our level of funding support.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a good time to reflect and to identify new opportunities for the next phase of growth.&nbsp; MICA will adopt four strategies that we believe will strengthen the arts and cultural sector.&nbsp; They are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; developing Singapore's distinctiveness and excellence as a centre for Asian arts and heritage;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2242<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; building capabilities and developing talent;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; enhancing our cultural institutions and infrastructure towards supporting artistic excellence; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; strengthening our engagement with the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, these four strategies are aligned with MICA's three desired outcomes for the RCP programme, namely, distinctive content, dynamic ecosystem and engaged community.&nbsp; In the course of this year, MICA will inject an additional $8 million to support arts and culture initiatives.&nbsp; This is over and above the average annual RCP&nbsp;III funding of $23.25 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now elaborate more on how MICA intends to implement these strategies&nbsp;&ndash; strengthening our distinctiveness and excellence.&nbsp; Be it&nbsp;plays, novels, music, art works or dance, a nation's collective body of&nbsp;creative works reflects its heritage and values that helps define its national identity.&nbsp; The generation of such distinctive content is at the core of the creative process.&nbsp; MICA will support the creation of original artistic content through new or enhanced commissioning&nbsp;and residency schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Arts Council (NAC) will launch a new initiative&nbsp;&ndash; the International Residency Scheme&nbsp;&ndash; this month.&nbsp; A total of $2 million will be allocated for this initiative over the course of the next five years, both to attract regional artistes to collaborate with our local artistes here in Singapore, as well as to support local artistes for their residencies abroad.&nbsp; Depending on the success of this programme, we will consider scaling it up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MICA will also invest $3.5 million over the next five years through the newly announced Arts Creation Fund to further <p align=left>Column: 2243<p>build a body of new works with a local and Asian flavor that will appeal to both domestic and international audiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Baey Yam Keng asked whether the NAC will continue to invest in the development of traditional arts in Singapore.&nbsp; The traditional arts are&nbsp;a distillate of our communities' rich heritage and a cornerstone for developing works that are distinctively Singaporean.&nbsp; About $1.5 million is already disbursed annually through direct financial assistance to traditional arts practitioners.&nbsp; Starting from 2008, the NAC revised its grants framework to give more attention to traditional arts&nbsp;and cultural groups, such as the Bhaskar Arts Academy, Chinese Calligraphy Society and Majlis Pusat.&nbsp; Traditional arts activities will also be incorporated at key community arts platforms.&nbsp; For instance, in 2009, the North West District Arts Festival will focus on ethnic arts with large-scale Malay and Indian opening events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the development of distinctive content, MICA will also take a more comprehensive approach to building capabilities for the entire arts and culture society, including content creators, arts businesses and specialised services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Heritage Industry Incentive programme, which was launched last year, the National Heritage Board (NHB) has allocated $8 million over five years to support innovative private and people-sector led projects that contribute to the heritage industry.&nbsp; NHB&nbsp; will provide seed funding for content, capability and business development.&nbsp; Local company, VeeV Interactive, is one of the early recipients of HI2P co-funding, and they are currently producing an internet TV documentary on Singapore's Pioneer Artistes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, talent development must remain a key priority during these difficult <p align=left>Column: 2244<p>times.&nbsp; And I am therefore grateful for Dr Ong Seh Hong's strong support for MICA's continued provision of arts scholarships and bursaries during this economic downturn to our arts students.&nbsp; In the last five years, the NAC's financial assistance for scholarships and bursaries has increased by 30%.&nbsp; In&nbsp;FY 2008, slightly more than $1 million worth of local and overseas scholarships and bursaries were awarded to 71 recipients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC's major and general grant framework</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

We strongly encourage arts professionals and organisations to capitalise on these scholarships and training grant opportunities.&nbsp; NAC gave out approximately $7 million in grants in 2008.&nbsp; One recipient of the NAC Major Grant, the T'ang Quartet has gained international renown and was invited to perform in the UNESCO Award Ceremony in Paris.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the longer term, MICA recognises that talent in the arts should be nurtured and developed from an early age. The School of Arts (SOTA) exemplifies MICA's commitment to this ideal.&nbsp; Ms Fatimah Lateef has asked about SOTA's future plans, financial assistance and foreign student intake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOTA has operated from its interim campus at Goodman Road since 2008 and will start its next academic year in 2010 at the new premises at Kirk Terrace.&nbsp; In terms of&nbsp;number of students SOTA takes in each year, I believe is&nbsp;in the order of 130-150, and the number of applications well exceeds that.&nbsp; Let us achieve good progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its&nbsp;programmes and educational philosophy are something that are&nbsp;welcomed and have gained the acceptance of both students and parents.&nbsp; SOTA aims to nurture not just the next <p align=left>Column: 2245<p>generation of artists but also creative leaders in all fields; hence, the intent of its balanced and broad-based curriculum.&nbsp; For the 2009 academic year, SOTA has embarked on its Artistically-Gifted Programme to offer more intensive training to the top 5% of its cohort.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Ngee Ann Kongsi's generous donation of $12 million over six years, SOTA is able to offer its students school-based bursaries and scholarships, in addition to the Ministry of Education's&nbsp; Edusave Scheme scholarships and bursaries.&nbsp; For the academic year 2009, 10 SOTA-Ngee Ann Kongsi scholarships and 40 bursaries have been given out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SOTA also appeals to students from diverse backgrounds.&nbsp; Of its current student population, more than 90% of the students are Singaporeans and all three racial groups are well represented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong made some very good suggestions about international exchange programmes and what we have in place to encourage cross-cultural sharing in our schools. This year, SOTA will introduce international student exchanges for its year 3 students and continue its collaborations with international schools like the Chicago Academy for the Arts. NAFA is currently negotiating an academic collaboration with Guangxi Arts Institute in China, while LASALLE holds student exchanges with overseas academic institutions, such as Tokyo University of the Arts.&nbsp; But I want to add that the presence of foreign students in these schools also allows such cultural exchanges to take place on a daily on-going basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on now to talk a little bit about enhancing institutions and infrastructure.&nbsp; Our next strategy is to enhance our cultural institutions and infrastructure, as well as other platforms for Singaporeans to celebrate our community heritage and identity.&nbsp; MICA <p align=left>Column: 2246<p>and the Tote Board will enhance funding for the development and recurrent costs of selected heritage institutions, such as the Malay Heritage Centre, the Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall and the proposed Indian Heritage Centre. The development funding will be raised to 95% and the recurrent funding to 99% with the remaining costs to be funded by the community. The community heritage institutions will highlight Singapore's links with the region, and commemorate the contributions of our local communities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new National Art Gallery (NAG) will be housed in the former Supreme Court and City Hall buildings, and will focus on Singaporean and Southeast Asian art. The NAG's detailed architectural design will be finalised this year&nbsp;and it is expected to open to the public in 2013.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Thio Li-ann had asked if a legal history museum&nbsp;could be set aside within the NAG, and she did so very passionately.&nbsp; I have to say that&nbsp;there are currently no plans for such a museum, as there is already a legal history gallery in the new Supreme Court, which chronicles milestones in Singapore's legal history.&nbsp; Nonetheless, let me assure her that we fully appreciate the historical importance of both of these buildings and showcasing the history of the City Hall and the former Supreme Court&nbsp;will be an integral part of the visitor experience at the National Art Gallery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other heritage institutions also play an important role in documenting and preserving our national legacy.&nbsp; I would like to thank Ms Irene Ng for mentioning the important role the National Archives plays as a keeper of Singapore's historical and nation-building records.&nbsp; Indeed, NAS played a quiet but significant role in supporting Singapore's successful claim to Pedra Branca.&nbsp; The NAS is complemented by the Heritage Conservation Centre which is the conservator of our <p align=left>Column: 2247<p>national collection of artworks and artefacts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of our growing collection, the Government funded the building of a second archives repository which opened in February 2006, to meet the storage needs over the course of the&nbsp;next 15 years.&nbsp; The electronic records system, which NAS developed, has enhanced public access to archival records.&nbsp; Incidentally, this&nbsp;is also something that has been adopted in&nbsp;a number of overseas markets, including&nbsp;the Middle East. The records, I believe, has been well used.&nbsp; Let me just cite one instance where one of our schools,&nbsp;Greendale Secondary School, made a video documentary, "Punggol Story" in 2008. Extensive archival resources, such as photographs, Government records and oral history interviews from NAS, were used in its production.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For arts infrastructure development, NAC will reconfigure some Arts Housing Scheme properties to provide more flexible-use space to support the entire art creation process. The scheme is currently being piloted at the Telok Kurau Studios and the Telok Ayer Performance Arts Centre.&nbsp;Under the RCP III, as we had announced recently, $180 million has also been committed to the redevelopment of Victoria Theatre (VT) and Victoria Concert Hall (VCH) to upgrade the existing spaces and provide more room for commercial and rehearsal needs.&nbsp; By re-energising both these venues, we will be able to attract more varied performances and audiences as well as provide more spaces for the incubation of works. The restoration and renovation will commerce in the middle of 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the fourth area of opportunity is to engage the community broadly and deeply to strengthen Singapore's multi-cultural social fabric, foster a deeper <p align=left>Column: 2248<p>sense of Singaporean identity and raise the quality of life for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; We will step up community outreach efforts to broaden access to the arts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the economic climate, MICA will continue to uphold the quality and diversity of cultural offerings which audiences here deserve and expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Singapore Arts Festival in May and the Heritagefest in July, with more than one million participants, major upcoming events include an exhibition on Emperor Kangxi at the ACM in March, the Latiff Mohidin&nbsp;and Wu Guangzhong's exhibitions at SAM in March and April respectively, and the Flemish&nbsp;Masterpieces at the National Museum in July.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC's $5 million&nbsp;Arts for All Community Engagement Plan, launched in October 2008, encourages the community to develop a greater sense of ownership for the arts.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;committed to the principle of arts for everyone and will bring&nbsp;enlivening leisure options into the heartlands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan comprises two pillars. There is ArtReach and ArtLink. Under ArtLink, NAC will partner other social organisations, such as SCORE, to connect specific sectors of the population with artists, so as to integrate arts into alternative spaces such as the prisons and hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ArtReach is a broad-based programme which aims to increase access to quality arts experiences for the community.&nbsp; It encourages the public to go beyond being passive audience to being participative artmakers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One new ArtReach initiative launched last year was the Community Participation Grant (CPG).&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef asked for further details for the use of this Grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Participation Grant&nbsp;provides funds to community art projects which involve the public working <p align=left>Column: 2249<p>alongside trained artists in the creation process. The Grant provides up to $50,000 funding per recipient within a given financial year.&nbsp; It is open to NGOs, CDCs, community-based arts groups and artists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the launch of the Grant in April 2008, a total of $86,000 in grants has been awarded. One grant recipient is&nbsp;the Necessary Stage for its three-year programme, "Theatre for Seniors",&nbsp;to nurture a spirit of community&nbsp;and the arts amongst senior citizens through theatre workshops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLB too, will be focusing on the community's needs in the years ahead. NLB will work with WDA and the CDCs to make its venues available for affordable public courses in areas of skills development, career change and job fairs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NLB will expand its services to reach out to seniors, the disadvantaged and youths.&nbsp; For seniors, NLB will focus on social engagement of seniors, providing easy access and promoting awareness of library services to engage active participation for this group. The intent is to collaborate with other senior-centric organisations to develop seniors into independent and self-reliant library users making full use of the range of library services available. For children with special needs, NLB will reach out to them with&nbsp;its mobile bus,&nbsp;MOLLY, while needy children will continue to be catered for by the kidsRead service.&nbsp; For adults who are home-bound, NLB has launched its "Project&nbsp;Deliver Me" programme. The volunteers deliver books and&nbsp;AV materials directly to their homes.&nbsp; For youths and the IT-savvy, NLB will engage them through greater online capabilities like NLB's library blogs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang asked about why some features of&nbsp;online search were unavailable, which I believe was from home, and whether the cost of recovery <p align=left>Column: 2250<p>of outstanding fines was justifiable. The NLB's e-Resources enable users to retrieve about 800,000 eBooks, 600 eMagazines and 25,000 audiobooks online for free. In addition, the National Library Board currently subscribes to four electronic newspaper aggregators who make available local and overseas e-newspapers to their subscribers.&nbsp; I understand that the four vendors are currently in negotiations with SPH to make SPH newspapers available for online access by library members from home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was announced on 8th January, from 1st April of this year, any library member with unpaid fines and fees would have their borrowing privileges suspended till outstanding fines are paid up. This change is aimed at promoting greater public responsibility in the use of library materials so that small fines do not snowball over time.&nbsp; Since this policy change was first announced, around 80,000 members have paid up their fines.&nbsp; Mailers have started going out to the 670,000 members who still have outstanding fines, from&nbsp;the early part of this month.&nbsp; These outstanding fines total about $7.3 million. We estimate that this is about 30 times the amount that is required for administrative cost. When we last had a similar&nbsp;exercise in 2007 to recover outstanding fines, the NLB recovered more than six times it spent on administrative cost.&nbsp; We believe that from a cost point of view, it is an exercise that is worth carrying out. We need to give users some advance notice and running advertisements in the newspapers and the media will not be enough.&nbsp; We ought to inform them directly.&nbsp; But more than that, it is an exercise to make sure that users of library services are also responsible users who return their books on time in order not to deny other users who may want to have access to these materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mailers that we send out&nbsp;will clearly detail fine amounts and payment options, and these include NETS, cheques, Ez-link cards and cash cards for ease of payment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2251<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another means of engaging the community is through encouraging greater ownership for arts and culture.&nbsp; A growing number volunteer their time and talent to support events like the&nbsp;Biennale and the Arts Festival, and that is really very much appreciated by NAC and all involved.&nbsp;With regard to donations, our cultural institutions have received about $40 million worth of donations per annum in private cash and in-kind contributions, and&nbsp;a significant portion of this came through major donors. We should consider how we can make it more convenient for those who wish to make small donations to come forward. To facilitate this, MICA will make it easier for the public to lend their support to&nbsp;arts and culture through making small donations.</p></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An online Cultural Philanthrophy&nbsp;Donation portal will be rolled&nbsp;out in the second half of 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me come to the topic of a gracious society.&nbsp; I want to thank Ms Irene Ng for her very thoughtful and thought-provoking message.&nbsp; She has reminded us anew that that&nbsp;our people form the lens through which the entire society is viewed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, inculcating graciousness is a lengthy and painstaking process.&nbsp; "Project Gracious" is not a one-off event with a&nbsp;&nbsp;2010 deadline.&nbsp; It represents&nbsp;a national long-term initiative to foster a culture of gracious living among Singaporeans.&nbsp; It will involve broad-based public education, complemented by people community engagement across all sectors of our&nbsp;society.&nbsp; Project Gracious builds on the sustained effort that&nbsp;began&nbsp;in 1979 with the Courtesy Campaign.&nbsp; This project will steer away from being overly prescriptive and will instead advocate that graciousness is about our way of life and the values that shape our social conduct, reminding us that it is values&nbsp;that add <p align=left>Column: 2252<p>value to who we are and what we do.&nbsp; While&nbsp;previous efforts focused on specific behaviours, the effort now is to internalise enduring and endearing values that will motivate how we respond under various circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lessons on kindness are most effective&nbsp;it is&nbsp;caught, rather than taught.&nbsp; The Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) will reinforce values taught to our children by first promoting them amongst adults so that children can learn by example. This programme will be introduced in pre-school centres bringing together parents with&nbsp;children.&nbsp; I am also pleased to mention that 114 schools have already expressed interest in training workshops&nbsp;on starting kindness initiatives for teacher-mentors and student-leaders, and this will start next month.&nbsp; Besides the educational institutions, the&nbsp;SKM is working with both public agencies and private companies to promote graciousness in the workplace, neighbourhood and in public places.&nbsp; There are also plans to leverage on events where new citizens can be encouraged to participate in this national effort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Madam, how the entire arts and cultural community responds to these testing times will determine our shared future.&nbsp; MICA is committed to providing support for arts and cultural development despite the economic downturn.&nbsp; The arts community must be committed towards professionalism and excellence, and together we will be able to build a creative and culturally vibrant Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; the best home for our people.&nbsp; The economic downturn may be challenging times but therein too lies numerous opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Initiatives such as the Arts Creation Fund will help to develop distinctive content reflecting our unique geographical and cultural context, and articulate what national identity means to us.&nbsp; But distinctive content alone is not sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive creative eco-system is needed to provide supporting services which can produce,<p align=left>Column: 2253<p> market and deliver this content to audiences.&nbsp; The new capability and industry development schemes that I have touched on under the Renaissance City Plan will respond to the needs of our arts and heritage organisations at various stages of the creative process.&nbsp; Both these efforts will prepare Singapore for a new phase of cultural growth in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, as we shift our focus towards engaging the community as active participants, arts and culture will become more interactive, providing greater opportunities for different segments of the community to mingle, to exchange ideas and to better understand each other.&nbsp; We will thus use the platform of arts and culture to strengthen our community bonds and rootedness, and in so doing, we hope to develop a more harmonious and gracious society.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;this inclusive and cohesive society which will help us tide over these difficult times.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Government has responded that it would evaluate the capacity of the Government to communicate effectively online and rethink how it engaged its citizens via the feedback loop and replying to online letters.<p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what are the Ministry&rsquo;s plans and if there are&nbsp;additional resources that will be put in place to adopt the above recommendations of the AIMS committee.&nbsp; What new capabilities and approaches can the public expect in their online engagement with the Government?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also noted that many groups have&nbsp;voiced their displeasure that the Government would not engage them beyond the current Government platforms <p align=left>Column: 2254<p>and that REACH was to be the main point of engagement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I believe that the new media presents an excellent opportunity to engage citizens and never before has any medium enabled this opportunity for the Government to be able to reach each citizen directly&nbsp;&ndash; anytime, anywhere&nbsp;&ndash; be it&nbsp;in their homes, offices or&nbsp;personal communications devices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will not&nbsp;give up the opportunity to be able to connect directly with mainstream public, just because of its cautiousness to engage its critics online, one-to-one.&nbsp; I admit that it is an onerous task, but the technology today allows it if we are prepared to spare the investments and manpower.&nbsp; We have developed online tax filing systems and&nbsp;NSmen application systems that reach all employers and income earners in a massive scale.&nbsp; For all our investments in large, sophisticated projects, such as the SOE and NGN, I am sure the Government can consider implementing relevant infrastructure to be able to strengthen the connection between the Government and its citizens in a big way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is certainly an increasing demand for greater access to the Government from the younger generation of Internet users who want their opinions heard, and have easy access to the right services and the right people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that MICA, in view of&nbsp;Senior Minister of State&nbsp;Lui Tuck Yew's&nbsp;reply in this House two days ago, does not wait until the Internet community self-regulates in the way it feels comfortable before embarking on this open engagement on the Internet.&nbsp; Generally, Singaporeans&nbsp;do not speak out to right wrongdoings in public, and should we expect them to behave&nbsp;differently online.&nbsp; What would be the indicators where self-regulation is enough for the Government to liberalise <p align=left>Column: 2255<p>and to open up online political space&nbsp;and media regulations?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, let us focus on engaging the mainstream population and make the Government more accessible to be engaged constructively in nation-building and policy-making.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will lose an entire online generation, who could have had the opportunity to grow and engage with the Government, the same way as the previous generations had grown&nbsp;and engaged with the Government using the traditional media and broadcast communications.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, over time, external inputs and improvement from foreign TV channels have also been tremendous.&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, the competition from paid or cable TV, which offers a very attractive wide range&nbsp;of Malay,&nbsp;Tamil and&nbsp;Hindi programmes, has been&nbsp;very strong as well.&nbsp; Does MICA have plans to step up the programmes and performance of our minority TV channels to cope with the profusion of these imports from cable TV?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will there be platforms and plans as well as&nbsp;funds to provide greater support to local minority content programmes for Suria and Vasantham channels?&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, currently, the latter still shares a channel with the KIDs and Arts programmes.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B> Madam, the hon. Members have raised questions on broadcasting and public engagement.&nbsp; Let me first address Dr Fatimah Lateef's question on future plans and funding for Suria and Vasantham.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suria and Vasantham are important channels that reflect our multi-cultural <p align=left>Column: 2256<p>heritage and way of life, and provide relevant local programmes for the communities.&nbsp; And therefore MDA provides funding support for the production and acquisition of quality programmes, such as news, current affairs, children, information and drama.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MDA will sustain its support for both channels during this economic downturn.&nbsp; Competition from other TV channels and cable TV have actually incentivised improvements and I think this is amply demonstrated by an increase in the average ratings for both channels, especially during the prime-time belt of&nbsp;8 pm to 11 pm.&nbsp; Particularly for Vasantham, we announced at last year's COS that it will become a full-fledged stand-alone channel to offer a wider variety of programmes with more hours of broadcasting.&nbsp; And so it became a stand-alone channel on 19th October 2008.&nbsp; Since then, average ratings over the past three months have increased by more than 50%.&nbsp; These results affirm that Singaporeans support and enjoy local programmes on local channels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked about MICA's plans on e-engagement.&nbsp; The Government agrees with AIMS' recommendation to adopt an evolutionary approach and has begun engaging on the REACH portal and the online letter Fora of local mainstream media.&nbsp; As I responded in the House two days ago, we&nbsp;are not close to the idea of engaging on other objective and credible sites in future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the nature of the Internet, the Government has to be focused and selective on what platforms to engage netizens.&nbsp; As Mr Tong Sian Hwee pointed out in his letter that was published in the <I>Straits Times</I> Forum today, and I quote, "An unreasonable expectation is to be able to respond to or challenge all contributions."&nbsp; He added that, "It is also useless to enter into discussions on sites <p align=left>Column: 2257<p>which are obviously anti-establishment."&nbsp; These are his words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a relatively new mode of communication, the Government will require time and resources to build up additional manpower, capacity and skills to facilitate better e-engagement.&nbsp; I think, obviously we&nbsp;should not underestimate the skill sets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I have a bit of time, let me just share that when I first went to do a web chat, I started typing out an entire paragraph&nbsp;&ndash; obviously it took me quite a while, not that I am such a bad typist&nbsp;&ndash; and by the time I finished I had missed major chunks of the conversation taking place.&nbsp; And then I started going down to two-liners, one-liner, a few words.&nbsp; It was quite an experience.&nbsp; It was not easy to have a very&nbsp;meaningful and deep discussion, but I think everybody enjoyed it and that certainly appears to be the way that discussions are held in a web-chat environment.&nbsp; We have to adjust to it, and&nbsp;we have to make sure that we know how to respond appropriately so that both parties benefit fully from such an engagement.&nbsp; To this end, therefore,&nbsp;MICA has been recruiting more information officers conducting new media training and we have been sharing relevant knowledge with other agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over time, e-engagement will augment the wide range of channels&nbsp;the Government uses to communicate and reach out to the public.&nbsp; Let me assure the House that MICA is fully committed to develop the rich and richness of Government-citizen communications.&nbsp; Let me also take this opportunity to address some comments, including those that were just made on my reply to Miss Penny Low about self-regulation in the Internet.&nbsp; The comments seem to have misconstrued my remarks as a desire for more regulation on the Internet.&nbsp; Let me <p align=left>Column: 2258<p>say clearly that I am not advocating such a position.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the topic of self-regulation is what some bloggers have asked for.&nbsp; Members may remember that in responding to the AIMS Committee, a group of bloggers had proposed for community moderation to replace the Government's promised lighter-touch regulatory approach.&nbsp; It is for the online community to decide if there should be self-regulation or not.&nbsp; Likewise, it is for them to deliberate on how online postings could be self-regulated or moderated.&nbsp; The Government will continue with its promised lighter-touch regulatory approach and to engage netizens in a constructive and beneficial way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, new media opens up new frontiers and exciting opportunities for some but also has the potential to cause others to stumble.&nbsp; In line with AIMS' recommendation that education remains the key in combating the risk, the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA) has worked with the public, people, and private sectors to organise and support media literacy, public education outreach activities, targeting students, parents, educators and the public.&nbsp; We are mindful of the greater risks posed to minors and therefore have recommended in the AIMS report, that a new inter-Ministry Task Force on Cyber Wellness will be established and this will be chaired by the deputy secretaries from MICA and MOE.&nbsp; And MICA and MOE will collectively contribute a total&nbsp;of&nbsp;$10 million&nbsp;over the next five years for the Task Force to coordinate national efforts and develop strategies and programmes for protecting the young as well as work with other private sector partners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, let me assure the&nbsp;House that MICA remains fully committed to improving public engagement and communications, and will continue&nbsp;its efforts to foster a more open and inclusive society.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And given the prevalence and multi-fold surge in mobile take-up rates&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I think, Minister has said is 130% for mobile and less than 100% for broadband&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;how is MICA encouraging the creation of mobile content and incentivising the adoption and diffusion of mobile application amongst businesses and end-users?&nbsp;

Second clarification on the marginalised sector:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned that we have almost 100% broadband penetration rate and about 38,000 marginalised households that are still not wired up.&nbsp;

But if it is the suitability issue, perhaps you can look at investing and developing assistive technology to help the marginalised sector to better utilise the ICT.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Madam Chair, with regard to mobile content, I am pleased to inform the House and the Member that IDA supports the development of mobile <p align=left>Column: 2260<p>content.&nbsp; We recognise that more and more users are shifting onto mobile platform.&nbsp; In fact, for instance, in the Wireless@SG initiative, we are seeing more of the users accessing Wireless@SG with mobile devices like the WiFi-enabled PDAs or the intelligent mobile phones that are being sold nowadays.&nbsp; So, obviously there is a greater demand and a growing need for mobile content and the IDA will support the development of this mobile application.&nbsp; MDA, on its part, in encouraging and supporting the content creation sector, will also encourage investment and efforts in mobile content.&nbsp; For instance, in the IDM sector, we have particularly interested in encouraging game developers to develop online games that are suitable for mobile application.&nbsp; And I believe that some of these applications have already been developed and are being tested out.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, going forward, I think, Singapore can see more mobile content being made available.&nbsp; There will be diversity in mobile content, in terms of serious applications.&nbsp; Mobile content for leisure, for example, gaming products&nbsp;and&nbsp;mobile content in terms of information that people need when they are on the move.&nbsp; All these will be made available through the various mobile platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to the marginalised sector, I think the Member may have misunderstood me when I said that an additional 38,000 needy households will benefit by 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is IDA's estimate of households who need such support.&nbsp; Each year there will new people coming onboard the programme.&nbsp; The family comes onboard the programme if they have school-going children and they have low income.&nbsp; We will provide them with a new or a refurbished PC (full capabilities) at a very affordable cost.&nbsp; So cost to the family is not an issue, neither is cost to IDA.&nbsp; We have the funds and we will be able to support them.&nbsp; But the estimate of 38,000 additional families are our <p align=left>Column: 2261<p>assessment of going forward, over the next&nbsp;six years, what would be the number of needy families with children in school who will need this additional assistance.&nbsp; I just want to reiterate that it is not just&nbsp;providing computers.&nbsp; We also provide a three-year subscription for the broadband access.&nbsp; So, in fact, they have both the computer and broadband access that&nbsp;would be very useful for the students.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I just want to say that only last Wednesday at my Meet-the-People session, I had one case of a low-income family living in a rental flat whose children have now gone on to secondary school and found that they need to have access to broadband at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;They had not asked&nbsp;for the service previously.&nbsp; But now that they discovered that with a kid in secondary school, they would benefit from having a broadband.&nbsp; They came to ask for assistance, and I duly wrote to the IDA to seek their assistance to provide the family under the new PC-plus programme, with both PC and also a broadband subscription.&nbsp; They deserve it and, I think, they will get it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad:</B> Just three points.&nbsp;

Madam, I think, the Government recognises that in these difficult times, there will be families, there will be Singaporeans who will face financial distress.&nbsp; The approach is to extend to them assistance in a targeted manner.&nbsp; But we cannot be out there to assist in every individual service on nitty-gritty things.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp;we have&nbsp;programmes like doubling of the GST rebate;&nbsp;assistance through rental, service and conservancy rebates;&nbsp;and reduction in personal income tax with&nbsp;a cap of $2,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;All these mean that Government is putting cash back in the hands of people.&nbsp; Even for the lowest income group, they will benefit from this series of rebates and grants given by the Government.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2263<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, I think, this is the way of helping them.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they need to meet their communication expenses like pay for their telephone bills or for their mobile phone expenses,&nbsp;they can draw upon this series of rebates and&nbsp;grants that Government has given out to meet their obligations.&nbsp; For those who are in arrears with their telecommunication bills, I think, they can approach the service provider and make an appeal for a deferred or an instalment payment, which is what they do.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as an MP, I regularly see people at my MPS asking for such assistance.&nbsp; Where possible, we will write to the operator to ask them to consider the appeal for a deferred payment&nbsp;or an instalment payment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that addresses the concern of the Member.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Yong Siew Toh Conservatory&nbsp;is really, really world-class in terms of the facilities, drawing in a lot of top students into the institution. &nbsp;So I think there is actually a route for them, after the six years, coming out with the International Baccalaureate&nbsp;programme for those who want to continue to develop their artistic talents and to become professional artistes.&nbsp; That is at least one route.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On internet search&nbsp;&ndash; Mr Low's question.&nbsp; We actually have four vendors to aggregate the information from the <p align=left>Column: 2264<p>newspapers, both local and overseas.&nbsp; That is what NLB has contracted with them to do.&nbsp; These vendors are now in negotiation with SPH to put the local newspapers there.&nbsp; Users, when at home and in the Library, I believe, can access these newspapers directly&nbsp;&ndash; <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> website or&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I> website, as far as I understand the situation to be.&nbsp; But it is that they cannot not go through these aggregators in order to access the SPH newspapers because this is a commercial issue that is under discussion and negotiation now; so I will not be able to comment a little bit further on how exactly the negotiations are coming along.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng on the mainstream media:&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, they draw quite a lot of their revenues from advertisements and certainly during these time, we all notice that the newspapers have become a little bit thinner, and advertisement revenues have been affected.&nbsp; I think the Government's responses in terms of the Jobs Credit Scheme and whatever else Mr Tharman, our Finance Minister, has proposed for the Budget will also help them during this difficult period.&nbsp; I think, in terms of overall assessment for how the mainstream media is,&nbsp;my view is that it is credible, it is accurate, it is timely.&nbsp; And it is widely read, not only in Singapore but, I believe, also overseas, sometimes the hard copy version, sometimes the online version of the newspapers.&nbsp; I think they provide thoughtful pieces in terms of opinion pieces and commentaries.&nbsp; Not always, pro-Government, but they provide a variety of views and opinions and I think they are a reflection of some of the values that we uphold in our society.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2267<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I would like to discuss two points on our economy as we move forward&nbsp;&ndash; what to expect of it and how we should restructure it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on the Economic Outlook and Planning.&nbsp; Madam, I do not&nbsp;expect MTI to have a crystal ball to be able to predict accurately Singapore's economic numbers and as we have seen, MTI has had to revise&nbsp;economic growth&nbsp;forecasts many times recently, but it would be useful to know the outlook that the Government has of the&nbsp;economy and which&nbsp;scenarios it is using to plan ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the&nbsp;economist Paul Krugman says, and I&nbsp;mentioned this during the Budget debate, that&nbsp;in&nbsp;depression economics, the usual rules of economic policy no longer apply.&nbsp; And while we are in the middle of this storm, how does the&nbsp;Government decide on economic policies.&nbsp; Whether&nbsp;it is&nbsp;UK or USA or Japan, all the fiscal and monetary measures implemented do not seem to have an&nbsp;impact on turning around their economies.&nbsp; As normal rules of planning would not&nbsp;work in today's world, how then do we forecast moving foward?&nbsp; In the coming years, I do realise that we are going to see a destruction of many accepted economic models and new models will soon have to&nbsp;arise.&nbsp; So what will MTI do to adapt to this new reality?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, our 2001 Economic Restructuring Committee was convened to look at tapping opportunities of a fast developing world and our status as a developed nation and therefore we chose industries and sectors that reflected this.&nbsp; Such an approach made high costs an acceptable thing for the sectors with higher&nbsp;value added activities that we have selected.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister during this downturn what areas of growth can we depend on to bring Singapore out of the severe downturn?&nbsp; Will our economy <p align=left>Column: 2268<p>be able to handle this fast rate of change?&nbsp; How will this impact our GDP?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I believe that we need to once again restructure our economy.&nbsp; In my view,&nbsp;cost structure is at the top of the list of things&nbsp;that we need to change as it erodes our competitiveness.&nbsp; Also, our high cost structure now reflects our inability to support certain industries and we risk losing many of them.&nbsp; The semi-conductor industry and the disk drive industry are now starting to look unattractive here in Singapore.&nbsp; An important contributor to the GDP, the manufacturing sector is also very quickly looking uncompetitive as our costs have escalated during the good years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also do not think a high-cost Singapore is inevitable, as I mentioned before.&nbsp; We could perhaps devise a two-Singapore structure where we can institute differential pricing mechanisms, and particularly for land and property.&nbsp; We could price our industrial land not based on competition with other users of the land in Singapore, for example, but in competition with use of land in other countries that we are competing with&nbsp;&ndash; Taiwan or Korea, for example.&nbsp; So for example, we could price&nbsp;industrial land according to what it cost&nbsp;for our companies to want to locate in a similar, in a location in Taiwan doing the same type of activity and doing the same type of facility there. &nbsp;This is the type of competition that we need to worry about.&nbsp; We had followed this differential pricing approach before.&nbsp; It got taken away.&nbsp; So I would&nbsp;like to ask the Minister whether he will consider looking at this once again.&nbsp; Because if we do not do this, sooner or later&nbsp;we will make obsolete too many&nbsp;of our&nbsp;industries too early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, during the Budge&nbsp;debate I had asked the Minister to start to think&nbsp;about Economic Restructuring&nbsp;Committee to help plan the next phase of development for us.&nbsp; I hope that MTI will champion the <p align=left>Column: 2269<p>cause&nbsp;of this ERC even if it is an MTI&nbsp;committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And back to my point on forecasting.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that MTI think about setting up an institute of economic studies, something like the Institute of Policy Studies simply because I think on its own, with the complex environment that we are seeing, it is becoming increasingly difficult to predict the type of models and forecasts and what is it that is going to help us be successful in the future global economy.&nbsp; And perhaps MTI can consider championing this.&nbsp; And I think something like this would be a valuable resource not just for the Government but also for both existing and potential investors as they decide to place their operations here in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on our economic development model for&nbsp;the next generation&nbsp;&ndash; I believe focusing on MNCs will soon have limited growth potential as global companies are going to aggressively consolidate and Singapore may lose the traditional companies and operations that we could attract in the past.&nbsp; I think it is not a wrong strategy to refocus on growing more local enterprises, creating local anchors that can globalise out of Singapore.&nbsp; Does MTI see this&nbsp;happening or does it plan to stick to its original multi-national&nbsp;model that has&nbsp;been tested but may not work in the future?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On the first issue, some of the more recession resilient industries are education <p align=left>Column: 2270<p>and healthcare.&nbsp; While we have been making efforts to develop our&nbsp;schools, can we devote more resources such as funding and expertise to develop also the private education industry?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While private exhibition companies want to target what they consider growth sectors&nbsp;to run a profitable exhibition,&nbsp;the Government's objective would be to encourage development of new industries and new businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I notice the Government's Calls for Collaboration (CFC) scheme seeks to bring Government, businesses and the public sector together to develop solutions. &nbsp;Can the Government give further details on that?&nbsp; The Core Innovation Fund of $180 million over next&nbsp;two years is an interesting scheme to develop private sector solutions for Government services. &nbsp;Can the Government give more details on that and what achievements or activities have been undertaken since inception last year?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, we can also develop a scheme to encourage foreign&nbsp;internships especially among countries which we have FTAs with.&nbsp; That way, we will have a lot more Singaporeans with direct exposure to foreign industries and countries' business practices and ideas. &nbsp;On a company level, we can encourage&nbsp;establishment of FTA partner countries' companies in Singapore with the provision that they have an active staff development program for Singaporeans.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=left>Column: 2271<p><p><em>Creating Business Demand to Ensure Effectiveness of Supply-side Budget</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad:</B> Madam,&nbsp;the slew of budget measures have done well to help the bottomline of businesses with measures such as jobs credit, tax benefits as well as the SRI and bridging loan schemes.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the survivability of companies also depends on the ability of companies to maintain or protect their topline.&nbsp; In his reply to the Budget debate yesterday, the Minister for Finance spoke how measures such as GST cuts in the UK failed to stimulate demand.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the MTI perhaps update us what measures and activities it is embarking on&nbsp;to stimulate demand for goods and services in the business sector &ndash; locally and internationally?&nbsp; I agree with Mr Inderjit Singh&nbsp;that perhaps we need to rethink on our economic model to prepare for the future.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Tharman also mentioned that the Government will promote a variety of infrastructure projects across various sectors in his Budget debate reply yesterday.&nbsp; But today's <I>Business Times</I> reported that Singapore's GDP may face a sharp decline.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;OCBC economist Selena Ling was quoted as saying the contractions of manufacturing and exports were expected. What was not was the speed of decline in the services sectors. &nbsp;So, are pump-priming measures such as constructions and infrastructure building still the way to go?&nbsp; I fear that the desired impact may not be felt by sectors concerned because pump-priming infrastructure projects may not be as effective in this day given Singapore's shift in focus towards services sector over the last few years.&nbsp; So are there other areas that the Government plans to pump prime?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the indicators on the dip in the services sector, I believe that the MTI can <p align=left>Column: 2272<p>also do more to pump prime the services sector in areas such as retail, hospitality, infocommunications, logistics and perhaps even the affected financial services sectors.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact of pump-priming the services sector is towards generating local and consumer&nbsp;demand can be significant. &nbsp;The services sector is human resources intensive and sometimes, involves a significant proportion of Singaporean workers who are highly qualified and are likely from the lower- to upper-middle income segment.&nbsp; Giving them assurance of demand and jobs, may actually stimulate more corporate and consumer spending.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there is a larger chance of leakage in construction and infrastructure projects because of the intensive use of cheap foreign labour at times and purchases of goods sourced from overseas. &nbsp;In the services sector, however, even if PRs and foreigners are involved, the money is likely to circulate in Singapore because people have to be here to perform the work generally.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Budget debate, I think Member Gautam Banerjee&rsquo;s suggestion for a committee to help businesses who are not able to obtain the SRI and bridging loan schemes is a good one.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would&nbsp;like to refine his proposition to the MTI for consideration. &nbsp;Rather than set up a new committee, existing EDCs can be used to help such companies. &nbsp;Given the speed at which industries and demand is contracting, time is not a luxury that we can afford, and the EDCs can provide a ready platform that can be tapped.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this could be helpful, if staffed and funded correctly, to find good companies and innovative companies worth helping and growing. &nbsp;I agree with Minister Tharman&rsquo;s view that we should help companies that are sound, innovative <p align=left>Column: 2273<p>and with the potential for growth, but found challenges in doing so.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can also partner these EDCs&nbsp;with specialists such as venture capitalists&nbsp;(VCs) to deliver more specialised programmes such as IPO underwriting&nbsp;&nbsp;and special funding.&nbsp; This may mean also putting in place Government-developed systems, better resources and paying for better staff to reach out to the ground quicker and more effectively.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget measures and Government schemes are only as good as far as they can reach the ground. &nbsp;I think the Government needs more touch points on the ground to ensure the effectiveness of the Budget measures and obtain reliable ground feedback and data.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
