<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on

Question [8th August, 1960],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the speech

of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore, express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered on

behalf of the Government at the opening of the

present session of this Assembly.".'-(The Prime Minister).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> MrSpeaker, Sir, in

my  speech yesterday I have given evidence and have

concluded  that  this  is  a  Government  for   the

colonialists.  This is a Government for  the  Shaws

and  the big compradores. This is not a true P.A.P.

Government. I have asked, "Why is the Lee Kuan  Yew

Government so tied up with the Shaws?" I have  also

given evidence and concluded that what happened  in

the  City  Council  was  not real  integration  but

"Meadowisation". The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



followers  of  Mr Meadows are now controlling  key

positions in the City Council. The latest move  was

to abolish the post of Administrator and replace it

with  the post of Chief Administrative Officer - only

a  change  of name! Mr P. C. Lim, the most  senior

local  officer in the City Council, who had  worked

in  the  City Council for more than 30  years,  was

demoted   and  the  Director  of  Social  Welfare - a

relatively  junior officer from the  Government - was

asked  to  act as Chief Administrative Officer.  Is

this  not  an  insult  to the  City  Council  local

officers? What does the Director of Social  Welfare

know  about  City  Council  matters?  It  must   be

remembered  that  Mr Meadows  was  also  once  the

Director of Social Welfare. In the City Council, we

will still be hearing them talk of integration  for

many years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr, Speaker, Sir, this is a Government for the

Shaws,  by  Meadows,  in  the  name  of  the  Prime

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last one year, the Lee Kuan Yew Government

has  done  almost  nothing for  the  people  except

consolidation,  reorganisation and  preparation  to

further their own ends. The Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister  for National Development  talked

about  Malay  welfare. Is he really  interested  in

Malay  welfare? Or is he really interested in  free

overseas  trips? He asked his ex-Minister to  send

him  to  Indonesia to "study" fishing, but the  ex-Minister refused. Several weeks later, there popped

up  the  idea of sending him to Indonesia at  great

expense to the Government to "study" education. Out

of  the  $800,000 in the 1960 Budget earmarked  for

primary  production, $200,000 had been allotted  by

the  Member for Hong Lim for Malay welfare, and the

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

National  Development was asked to put up  schemes.

Despite repeated reminders for many months, he  had

not  even  put up one scheme. Instead he spent  his

time  planning how to get free overseas trips. When

the  Government  was first formed, the  Member  for

Hong  Lim  drew  up plans to foster Malay  welfare.

Within three months, a scheme to build 100



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



houses  in  the  Jalan Eunos Malay  Settlement  was

started.  A  scheme to benefit the  Malays  in  the

Southern  Islands was started and completed.  There

were other minor projects in the Geylang Serai area

to benefit the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for   National  Development  tried   to   play   on

communalism.  Let me remind him that  whatever  the

Lee  Kuan  Yew  Government is, it is  a  Right-wing

Government,  and  it  is  definitely  a  Government

against  communalism. We support the Prime Minister

in   his  strong  attitude  against  all  forms  of

communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development tried to distort the case of

the  proposed Sembawang Malay Settlement. When  the

Lim  Yew  Hock Government was in its last days,  it

tried  to win votes by gazetting several places  as

proposed  Malay Settlements. Some of  these  places

were satisfactory. One of these satisfactory places

is  Jalan Eunos; and when the P.A.P. Government was

formed,  the  building of the houses there  started

immediately. An unsatisfactory place was a piece of

land  in Sembawang for a proposed Malay Settlement.

The  land  had not been acquired and  a  very  high

price had been agreed to by the previous Government

with the British owners. This land was also full of

squatters.  The Government intended to find,  as  a

substitute, a piece of State land where there  were

no squatters. As a matter of policy, the Government

should  not  acquire  land  where  there  are  many

squatters who have to be evicted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before his powers were curbed in

October  1959, the Member for Hong Lim had launched

two  big projects to promote Malay welfare, namely,

the   Southern   Islands  scheme  and   the   Malay

Settlement  housing  scheme. These  were  completed

within the short space of two to three months. What

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

National  Development had done was to call  up  the

ketuas of the Southern Islands, or occasionally  to

visit   them.  What  for?  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   I

understand  that  he  is looking  to  the  Southern

Islands in the 1964 general elections. He is more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



interested  in  his  own welfare  and  in  his  own

future. Bukit Timah would not be a safe ward then.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard during the past

six  weeks how the Prime Minister consolidates  his

position  with the Assemblymen. The main object  is

to  make them part and parcel of the status quo,  a

part  of  the  existing  social  system,  and  thus

resistant  to  social  changes  demanded   by   the

overwhelming masses of the people. He  has  devious

methods:   brain-washing,  free  trips   (sometimes

compulsory  free  trips), control of  Assemblymen's

pay.  These are a few of the methods employed.  The

City  Councillor Mr Low Por Tuck  getting  $150  a

month  is a different social being from the present

Parliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Finance - he  is now getting ten times  more  income.

Five   of   the   Parliamentary  Secretaries   have

compulsory  savings. By the end  of  the  five-year

term -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All these references to

personalities and personal acts of Assembly Members

seem  to  me to be quite irrelevant to the question

before  the  House. I have tried to stop references

to  personalities. I have indicated definitely that

I  will  stop references to personalities  for  the

rest  of  this  debate. So I  ask  the  Member  for

Aljunied not to indulge in personalities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, six motor-cars seized by the

Customs  were sold to the Parliamentary Secretaries

below market prices.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Member for

Aljunied  must have due regard to the authority  of

the  Chair.  The ruling is that all  references  to

personalities must not be indulged in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not the

P.A.P. which the masses understood and voted  for.

We  are  the true P.A.P. We stand for the aims  and

ideals  of  the P.A.P. which the people understood,

believed  in  and  voted  for.  The  Lee  Kuan  Yew

Government  stands for the Shaws, the  compradores

and the colonialists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, after 14 months of long silence, the Member

for Aljunied has now opened his mouth to utter

complete lies in this Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member is

deliberately  going  to  use unparliamentary  words

which  he knows are unparliamentary, then  he  will

not   be   permitted   to  speak.   "Lie"   is   an

unparliamentary word which should never be used  in

this  Assembly. The hon. Member must withdraw  that

word.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I withdraw that

word, but may I substitute the words "twisting  the

facts"?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will not even accept the words "twisting the facts" in this context. The hon.

Member must withdraw those words.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Sir, I withdraw the words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied stated that he was not

given  a chance for the last 14 months to speak  in

this  Assembly. The other accusation was  that  all

the  speeches  made during the last  14  months  by

P.A.P. Assemblymen were prepared either by Mr  Lee

Kuan  Yew or Mr George Thomson. But after  hearing

the speech of the Member for Aljunied yesterday and

today,  it  is now quite clear who is reading  from

written speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go into the details of

the  speeches made by the Member for Hong  Lim  and

the  Member for Aljunied, I would like to say  that

they  were of a similar nature but, of course,  the

wording was different. The most important thing the

Member  for Hong Lim touched on was Malayanisation.

Let us go back to the activities in the Ministry of

National Development during the last one year. What

did  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  really  mean   by

Malayanisation?  For  example,  let  us  take   the

Architects  Department.  One  fine  morning,  there

appeared in the Straits Times and in all the  local

newspapers an article about Mr Ong Eng Guan's plan

of  4,000 units of houses to be built in Singapore.

One  does  not  need a technician to give  a  Press

statement. Anybody can call in the Press and put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



forward  his  views. But to carry out the  plan  of

building  4,000 units of houses, you  must  require

efficient and experienced architects. What did  the

ex-Minister  for  National Development  do  on  the

pretext   of  Malayanisation?  It  was  "Melbourneisation"! Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim

is  a graduate from Melbourne University. He was of

the  opinion  that  one must  be  a  graduate  from

Melbourne University, otherwise he could not  be  a

true  socialist  and an anti-colonialist.  That  is

what  happened  in that department.  Why  have  the

local  architects  left the  service  of  the  City

Council?  It  is not because they fear  the  P.A.P.

Government,  as put forward by the S.P.A.  Members.

It  is not because they are afraid of their future.

It   is  because  they  have  not  graduated   from

Melbourne  University, that they have no future  in

that department as long as that man is there as the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied talked about Lui Boon Poh

in  the City Council. If I am wrong in what I  have

to   say,  I  hope  the  Prime  Minister   or   his

Parliamentary  Secretary  will  correct   me.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, when the Prime Minister took over the

City   Council  from  the  Minister  for   National

Development, the whole sewerage system was  on  the

verge  of  collapse, because we had an  "efficient"

administrator in Lui Boon Poh. And the  ex-Minister

for  National Development himself admitted in  this

House Mr Lui's qualifications and experience as an

administrator.  When the Prime Minister  took  over

the  City Council, there was only one engineer left

in  the  service,  and  he also  had  tendered  his

resignation. That was the State of -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, on a

point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I think it is not necessary to

clarify.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member will not give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> And that was the state of affairs left by the so-called socialist and anti-colonialist who

is  now  parted  from  the P.A.P. because  of  his

"broad"  colonial attitude. That was  what  he  had

done for the people of Singapore. And in his speech

today,  the  Member  for Aljunied  boasted  of  the

achievements  that  he  and  the  ex-Minister   for

National Development had done - they had done so much

for  the  Malays,  they had done so  much  for  the

Southern  Islanders. Let me remind them: they  were

expelled  from  the P.A.P. only recently.  Whatever

the  Member  for  Hong  Lim did  was  done  in  his

capacity as Minister for National Development,  and

not as Mr Ong Eng Guan; also he did it as a P.A.P.

candidate and a P.A.P. man. So the credit does  not

go  to  Ong  Eng  Guan, but to the  P.A.P.  He  was

elected  to this Assembly as a P.A.P. candidate  in

Hong  Lim;  he  was not elected as  an  Independent

candidate.  He  ran  his  Ministry  as   a   P.A.P.

Minister,  and  whatever good he did or  encouraged

was  not personal. Maybe he had done something bad,

and that is why he is no more with the P.A.P. now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important point which the Member for Hong

Lim  as well as the Member for Aljunied brought  up

was  the  case of Mr Owen in the City Council.  It

appears  to the people of Singapore that the  three

so-called socialists went from the Government  side

to  sit in the Opposition to fight Owen's case.  It

seems that they are the mouthpiece of Mr Owen, and

the common man might think that they are obliged to

Mr Owen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I speak on the details of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, let me go through this

pamphlet,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  on  "How  to  Fight

Colonialism". It is a fine heading and  can  easily

get  the support of the masses. Everybody wants  to

fight  colonialism; not only Ong Eng  Guan  or  Mr

Lingam - I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the hon.

Member    for   Aljunied - but   the   whole   P.A.P.

organisation, the working class, the masses are all

interested in fighting colonialism. It is a 10-page

pamphlet of speeches delivered at the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



Badminton  Hall  on  12th July,  1960.  If  you  go

through all this, what way has this so-called anti-colonialist   given   to  the   masses   to   fight

colonialism?  All  these  speeches  are  merely   a

personal  attack on Lee Kuan Yew and Dr  Goh  Keng

Swee, and three expatriate officers - George Thomson,

Blades  and Meadows. In other words, if you are  an

anti-colonialist   or   if   you    are    fighting

colonialism,  you must first fight George  Thomson,

Meadows  and Blades. And if you kick them out,  you

are  really an anti-colonialist. That is the  stand

taken  by  the  hon. Member for Hong  Lim  and  the

Member  for  Aljunied.  On the  last  page  of  the

pamphlet, the following conclusions were arrived at

the meeting on "How to Fight Colonialism":



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) That the greatest enemy of the people is

still  colonialism  and that all  sections  of  the

people  must  be united to carry on the  fight  and

complete the revolution.'



<br><br>That  is the P.A.P.'s aim. Besides that, these  so-called  anti-colonialists could not concretely  put

forward  to  the  public ideas  on  "How  to  Fight

Colonialism".  That is because the  Prime  Minister

gradually  and bit by bit took over the departments

in the Ministry of National Development and finally

the   ex-Minister  for  National  Development   had

nothing in his portfolio. That is the root of  this

so-called split in the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the 1959 P.A.P. Election Manifesto.

At  that time the hon. Member for Aljunied and  the

Member   for   Hong  Lim  were  Central   Executive

Committee  members, and they were involved  in  the

drafting of the P.A.P. Manifesto. Let me read  from

this, Mr Speaker. On page 2:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To this purpose, the P.A.P. has recently week by

week  issued its policy statements on the work that

will  be carried out in government in the next five

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plans we have laid down in these policy

statements  are  not all ambitious ones.  They  are

realistic   plans,  based  on  existing  political,

social  and economic conditions. In drafting  these

plans,  we  recognise  that  an  internally   self-governing Singapore is not an independent Singapore

because control of our foreign affairs and external

defence   remains  in  the  hands  of  the  British

Colonial Office, and so in a sense we are  a  semi-colony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the severe restriction of land space,

a mere 220 square miles, and a present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



population of 1½ million, which is still going on at

the  rate  of 65,000 a year. We recognise that  our

little island has no natural resources and that our

economy  has for the past 100 years been  dependent

only  on  the  entrepot  trade,  and  has  remained

static.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the complexities of our multi-racial

society and the special problems they pose.  It  is

within this framework that we must work, and within

these  limitations  we  must construct  our  labour

basis for a future socialist society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next five years will be critical years of

testing  those people who believe, like the  P.A.P.

that socialism can be achieved step by step through

peaceful constitutional means.'



<br><br>This is the P.A.P. Manifesto which was carried  out

by  the Member for Aljunied and the Member for Hong

Lim; and they wholeheartedly supported it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Ong Eng Guan issue was first published

in  the papers, there was an outburst in Singapore,

and  the people really did not know what it was all

about.  Maybe 30,000 or 40,000 people attended  the

mass  rally, and that was the force. But that  does

not  mean that the 40,000 are supporters of the so-called  anti-colonialists  and  supporters  of  the

Members for Hong Lim and Aljunied. The people  were

quite enthusiastic and wanted to know what were the

real  differences in the Party and why these  Party

Executive members, elected on P.A.P. tickets,  were

suddenly expelled after one year of office.  Slowly

when   the   explanations  were  given,  and   when

everything  was over, the people began  to  realise

what  the  real  issue is: whether the  P.A.P. has

become pro-colonial or whether the so-called  anti-colonialists  who caused a split in the  Party  are

pro-colonialists. The people of Singapore now begin

to  realise  that the split in the  Party  was  not

because the P.A.P. deviated from its basic stand of

anti-colonialism, but because of personal  grudges.

If  I  may  put it bluntly, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  you

cannot  have  two Prime Ministers in one  State - and

that  was  the whole trouble that happened  in  the

Party.  We  can  afford  to  have  only  one  Prime

Minister,  and  luckily we have an efficient,  able

and honest Prime Minister to lead the State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is accused of being pro-colonial

because  it  retains  George Thomson,  Meadows  and

Blades.  The  P.A.P. is also accused of  being  unsocialistic because the Shaws and millionaires  are

here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask: since when did our ex-colleagues become

so  anti-colonialistic? Since when did  they  learn

that  the  P.A.P. is pro-colonial? The  P.A.P. was

formed in Singapore in the year 1954 by the working

class. Maybe some of its founders are not in  this

Assembly,  but  they  are  still  with  the  P.A.P.

outside, and it is they who began the anti-colonial

movement. It is they who supported the P.A.P. from

the  very beginning up to now and the P.A.P. still

has  the full support and confidence of the  masses

in  Singapore, especially the trade union movement.

The  P.A.P. leader, who is now the Prime  Minister,

attended  the  Constitutional Talks with  the  then

Chief Minister, and upon his return the Party  held

many meetings and explained to its members and  the

people  what was the Constitution that  was  agreed

upon. At that time the Member for Hong Lim and  the

Member  for Aljunied were with the Party, and  they

completely  agreed with the Party's stand  on  this

Constitution.  If  they  had  not  agreed  to   the

Constitution, why did they contest the elections on

P.A.P. tickets?  Because the P.A.P. categorically

stated  their stand on the Constitution.  This  was

explained in Petir and Party meetings - that  we  had

to  work this Constitution for two or three  years,

and  then  we had to go back to London  for  a  new

Constitution.  And the Party as a whole  agreed  to

it.  `If  the Member for Hong Lim thinks  that  the

present  Constitution  is  pro-colonial,  that  the

whole  administration is pro-colonialist, and  that

it  is  not a workable Constitution, then he should

have realised, at the time of the election, that he

was  going  to  contest the election  on  a  P.A.P.

ticket, that is, as a candidate of the Party  which

agreed  to  the  new Constitution,  and  which  was

confident  that it would come into power.  At  that

time, it was quite apparent that this was the  only

Party  which was going to get a complete  majority.

The  Member  for  Hong Lim agreed  with  it.  After

working one year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



within  the Constitution, he suddenly gets a vision

that it is not workable because Mr Lee Kuan Yew is

there and Dr Goh Keng Swee is there, and they  are

pro-colonialists, because they are educated in -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member must mean the Prime

Minister and the Minister for Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker. Another

attack  came from the Member for Hong Lim  and  the

Member    for    Aljunied   on   trade   unions - the

cancellation of the federations of trade unions.  I

will say quite frankly to my friends that the trade

union  leadership  is  quite efficient  in  looking

after  their own interest. I ask them to leave  the

trade  unions to their leaders The whole membership

of  the trade unions has complete confidence in its

present  leaders. So better leave the  trade  union

movement  alone  and  do  not  interfere  with  the

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Members think that by making an unwarranted

attack  on the T.U.C. and its leadership  they  can

divide  the  trade  union movement  and  get  their

support,  then I think they are wasting their  time

in  doing  this  unhealthy thing. The  trade  union

leadership  is here, and they can look after  their

interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, we have never on

any occasion attacked the T.U.C. What we did at the

Badminton Hall was to expose Mr Woodhull for  what

he was.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> That is exactly what I was explaining,

and  the Member for Hong Lim admitted it.  Whether

it  is in the Badminton Hall or in the Assembly  or

outside,  he has admitted it. Whether  or  not  the

Member  for  Hong Lim and two others  attacked  the

T.U.C. and its leadership? He admitted he attacked

it. He cannot deny it because it is written in this

speech, `T.U.C. and Mr S. Woodhull'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



That  is what I would like to  remind  hon.

Members.  If  by  attacking  the  T.U.C. and   its

leadership and making an unwarranted attack on them

he thinks that he can really become a revolutionary

and an anti-colonialist, and he can get some of the

union support, then I think politically he is going

to be a bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since this trouble started in the P.A.P., there may be some in the trade union

movement  who  think  that  they  can  also  become

revolutionaries like the Member for Hong  Lim.  Let

me  remind  them  that  the future  of  this  State

depends on industrialisation, stable government and

a  healthy atmosphere in the whole political arena.

And  if the so-called adventurers and some of their

leaders want to create unrest in this country under

the  pretext of anti-colonialism, then I think  the

whole trade union should be aware of this fact.  We

should be prepared to face the situation, and  show

that  we  are more responsible and more  able,  and

that  we can understand the situation more clearly,

even  though  we - the  trade  union  people - are  not

graduated from the University in Melbourne. We must

show  to  the  world that industrial  and  economic

expansion can be achieved in Singapore with the co-operation and help of the trade union movement  and

their confidence in the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied in his speech has said

that the Parliamentary Secretary to the ex-Minister

for  National Development was bringing up  communal

issues  in  this House in regard to  the  political

situation  in  Singapore. But  the  Member  himself

indulged  in  that by bringing up  communal  issues

when  he  said  that the only two  people  in  this

Assembly who are interested in the welfare  of  the

Malays  are the Member for Hong Lim and the  Member

for  Aljunied.  Whatever  Government  did  for  the

people  for the last one year was not done  by  the

P.A.P.  Government, but by these  two  individuals.

Where  did  they  get the money from?  It  is  this

Government  which passed the money, and the  Member

for Hong Lim acted in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



capacity   of  the  P.A.P.  Minister  for  National

Development.  How can they come here and  tell  the

public  that  whatever was done in the Ministry  of

National  Development was done by Ong Eng Guan  and

not by the P A.P. Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Member for Aljunied was

attached  to  the Ministry of National Development,

we,  the  P.A.P.  Assemblymen, even  at  that  time

considered  him, with due respect to him,  as  part

and  parcel of the civil service, because, from the

information  received from our  colleagues  in  the

trade union movement - I stand subject to correction,

Mr Speaker, Sir - he used to pay periodical or daily

visits  to the departments and find fault with  the

civil servants. Yet today in his speech, he says he

is  the  only  man  who  can fight  for  the  local

officers,  and  he  is the only man  who  can  give

something to the civil servants. But he himself has

forgotten that when he was attached to the Ministry

of   National  Development,  he  was   an   elected

representative  of  the  people  and  not  a  civil

servant. Today, when he is away from the P.A.P. he

himself brings forward the accusation that  we  are

giving   trouble,   that  we  are   forgetting   or

neglecting the local officers and civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, they want to fight colonialism,

they   want  to  malayanise,  but  they   are   not

interested in the whole set-up of the civil service

and  the  technical staff. What they are interested

in  is  this.  As  long  as  the  three  chaps  are

there - Meadows,  Blades and Thomson - then  the  whole

administration  is  colonial. And  if  these  three

people  go out, then the Members for Hong  Lim  and

Aljunied   are   the  real  anti-colonialists   and

socialists in this country. But when we say that we

are  anti-colonial, we categorically state that  we

are not interested in fighting Europeans. We do not

fight  them  because  they  are  white,  they   are

colonialists.  We  fight  them  because  of   their

political  ideology. We must know that,  especially

in dealing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



with  our colonial masters, we must be tactful  and

use  our brains. If the Member for Hong Lim  thinks

that,  by  getting  rid of these three  chaps,  our

fight  is over, that we are completely independent,

and  that we are really socialists, then we are far

apart. We will never be able to agree with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, it is stated that the Government is

going  to  build  a trade union house  and  that  a

committee will be set up to draw up plans. This was

wholeheartedly  supported by the  people  when  the

P.A.P. put  this  proposal  forward  during   the

elections.  We  hope that with the co-operation  of

the  trade  union  movement, the building  will  be

completed soon, so that all the unions can  utilise

the facilities and work for a better and prosperous

Singapore.



<br><br>3.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is the fifth day of the debate on the address

of  thanks for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.

an  address  that  does not merit  such  a  lengthy

debate.  But what has brought about the lengthiness

of  this debate is because the Honourable the Prime

Minister,  in  moving his motion, has  to  find  it

necessary to level an attack on the hon. Member for

Hong  Lim. And he has thus opened the gate so  wide

that  this Assembly has been treated to,  shall  we

say,  the  unhappy  spectacle of comrades  and  excomrades  quarrelling  among  themselves,  and   of

exposure after exposure. And that reminds me  of  a

saying,  Sir, which we all know. "When blank  falls

out,  honest men will come into their own." Sir,  I

have not used the word "rogues" because I know that

these  honourable  men are not "rogues".  But  when

something  falls  out, honest men  will  come  into

their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is typical, Sir, of the P.A.P., not only of the

Prime   Minister,  not  only  of  his   Ministerial

colleagues, but also of the back-benchers, to  rave

and  rant,  to attack unnecessarily the Opposition,

and  to  ridicule  the Opposition even  before  the

Opposition  has  opened its  mouth.  So  the  Prime

Minister in his speech



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



said; `What is this I see, the amendments that  are

proposed  by the opposition. What a comic  relief.'

Sir,  what we have been sitting here for five  days

listening to has been the comic relief provided  by

the  P.A.P. Assemblymen, Ministers and ex-comrades.

That  is  the kind of comic relief we have. Surely,

Sir, the Prime Minister must have felt in his heart

that  some  such comic relief would take  place  in

this  House, and that is why he used the  word.  Of

course,  he has to turn it around and say, `We  are

providing the comic relief!'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Members on the other side said that we

had  not  pronounced any world-shaking  events.  We

have treated the world-shaking pronouncement of the

Prime  Minister with little concern.  Sir,  I  will

touch on that in due course. But they, Sir, in  all

their speeches, have not even accepted in their own

minds, that   there  was  such  a   world-shaking

statement  made  by the Prime Minister.  They  went

into  ridicule,  jibes, and criticisms.  They  even

went  so  far as to suggest that all the ills  that

they have perpetrated during the past 14 months are

the  ills  they inherited from the past Government.

And  yet the Member for Hong Lim said that all  the

good  things,  all the buildings that they  claimed

they  had built, were built by the past Government.

I say, Sir, in this House: let the people judge the

Government not by what the previous Government  did

or  did  not do. They will judge them by what  they

themselves did or did not do during their  time  of

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, we were treated to a famous

statement of the P.A.P. - "We mean what we say and we

say  what  we mean." Let us examine their credence.

Sir,  when the previous Government felt that  Mayor

Ong  Eng Guan was not doing the right thing by  the

people  of  Singapore, and felt that  he  had  been

doing a number of acts that were detrimental to the

interests of the people of Singapore, my colleague,

the   Minister  for  Local  Government,  Lands  and

Housing  in  the previous Government, instituted  a

Commission  of  Inquiry into the  misdeeds  of  the

Mayor  and  the P.A.P. Councillors. At  that  time,

what did the Prime Minister do? He defended



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



that man and said "What he did was right.  What

he  did  captured the imagination of the people  of

Singapore. What he did had caused fear in the minds

of  the  Government. They knew they were  going  to

lose.  They  knew that we were going to  win."  All

those things were said in the courts. And now  what

do  we hear? "Ha, that Mayor Ong Eng Guan! Oh, that

silly boy! Naturally, if we had not protected  him,

he would have been dead long, long ago. Look at all

the  misdeeds  he  did! Look at  the  discredit  he

brought  to the P.A.P.!" And yet, Sir, it  was  the

deeds - I  call  them misdeeds, but  they  call  them

deeds - of  Mayor  Ong Eng Guan that  won  them  that

election last year. Had they not played up Ong  Eng

Guan  as  a  god and as a hero of the people,  they

would  not  have been sitting here.  Therefore, if

they  say.  Sir, that Ong Eng Guan was wrong,  that

the deeds of Ong Eng Guan were misdeeds, then I say

this with due respect to you and to them. Sir, that

they have been voted in under false pretences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> You forgot

Chew Swee Kee and another Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, from their own mouths they

say  that  Mayor  Ong  Eng Guan,  that  comrade  of

theirs-[The hon. Member gestured].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I had occasion to indicate to

the  Member  for Joo Chiat that I do not  like  too

many gestures. The Member must remember that he  is

addressing the Chair, and to turn his back  on  the

Chair, I think, is not polite.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, what I did was just to

focus  attention on a great hero of theirs who  has

fallen. Sir, they say that the great Mayor, Ong Eng

Guan,  was  the hero, the man who had captured  the

imagination of the people of Singapore and who  had

brought standpipes to the poor. Do you expect  them

to  drink  water when they go hungry without  rice?

Who  had brought bus shelters to the people? Do you

expect  them to be there when they do not have  the

money  to  pay for the bus fare? And they say,  `We

say what we mean and we mean what we say.' Tch,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



tch! Is that saying what they mean and meaning what

they  say, when today they say that what they  said

was  not what they meant to say? Is it not a  fact?

Is  it  a  laughing matter? They now say that  what

they  meant to say was not what they meant  to  say

what they said to mean. That, Sir, is almost right.

What did the hon. Member for Hong Lim describe  it?

Dr  Goebbels' propaganda. Again, Sir, what  do  we

have?  Last  year, Sir, on the Budget  debate,  the

Minister for Finance let the cat out of the bag.  I

think  he  said  this. It is at  col.  797  of  the

Hansard, volume 11, No. 13 of 25th November,  1959,

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To these people, we can say with perfect candourl

that members of the P.A.P. political leadership are

not lacking in talent, vigour or self-confidence. A

combination of these qualities, however,  may  well

lead  to  recklessness bred out  of  arrogance  and

ignorance  if it is not tempered with  a  sense  of

realism."



<br><br>I  picked  on those very words of the Minister  for

Finance  during  that  debate.  I  said  that   the

Minister had let the cat out of the bag. That there

were  some  Ministers in the Cabinet who  had  been

arrogant, who had been handling the destiny of  the

country  with arrogance and recklessness,  and  who

had  not  been tempered with any sense of  reality.

And  what  did  I  get, Sir? As  usual,  the  Prime

Minister  said  that the hon. Member for  Cairnhill

was  ever  fond of fishing in troubled  waters.  "I

have  the  greatest confidence in my colleague  the

Minister  for  National Development." His  greatest

confidence, Sir, has now matured in expulsion.  The

Prime Minister -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> He never said that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - now would want us to believe

that what he said he meant was not what he meant to

say.  Then, Sir, before I come to the world-shaking

pronouncement of the Prime Minister, allow  me  the

indulgence  of this House to reply to some  of  the

attacks of the speakers on the other side that have

been  levelled  at  the Opposition.  What  did  the

Minister for Labour and Law say in reply to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



speech by the Member for Mountbatten? What had the

previous    Government   done   to    industrialise

Singapore?  Then  he quoted a number  of  inquiries

that  were started then and at that particular time

when he was the Permanent Secretary to the Minister

for Commerce and Industry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I am in a position to know.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So being in a position to know,

Sir, the hon. Member must have been aware that as a

senior  civil servant there is such a thing  as  an

oath  of  secrecy. But he feels, "What is  an  oath

after all to the P.A.P.?" What is it after all? Let

us  forget  it.  They have forgotten it.  Ministers

exposing Ministerial acts. Ex-Minister exposing ex-Ministerial  acts.  I am not criticizing.  But  one

thing I took objection to was this, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It was that the previous

Minister  for  Commerce and Industry  went  to  the

United States to attend the P.A.T.A. conference and

had discussions on -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Merger.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - the manufacture of cigarettes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Correct.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And the Minister for Labour and

Law had made the allegation, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It is true.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - that the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry went there to find out  how  best  he

could himself start a cigarette factory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Correct, that is what he did.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must remind the Minister for

Labour and Law that this sort of running commentary

is  completely out of order. He must remember  that

he must keep silence.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In spite of their having a

Minister for Culture, they are not so cultured.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Labour said that the

previous Minister for Commerce and Industry went to

the  United States to try and find out how best  to

start a cigarette factory for himself. I knew,  as

his Chief Minister then, that he went there to find

out how to start a cigarette factory, bringing into

association local capital. Let us take the case  of

the  British-American Tobacco factory that has been

opened  after the PAP, came into power. They wanted

to  reopen their factory in Singapore. We  said  to

them,  although we did not claim, as they are  fond

of  claiming, to be anti-British capital,  "If  you

want  to restart your factory, we will welcome  it.

But you must allow 51 per cent local capital." They

accepted  that.  But they said the  elections  were

coming,  and so they could not accept it. But  they

were  prepared to accept in principle 51  per  cent

local capital participation. Yet, Sir, this factory

started soon after the P.A.P. Government came  into

power  with  a  100 per cent British capital.  What

about  that? No shares from the other factories?  A

hundred  per cent British capital. And this Company

has, since its starting a new factory, knocked  out

almost all the other factories manufacturing  local

cigarettes.  Why has it been so? It is all  because

they  have  popular brands. They are able  to  sell

Capstan,  a  popular  brand,  at  a  cheaper  price

because  they claim that the cigarettes are locally

manufactured. And to show how popular the brand is,

Sir,   can   be   measured  by   the   price.   The

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance

has  even  produced a packet of Capstan cigarettes.

What  is  wonderful is that this Government  claims

that  colonialism means the choking of the economic

structure  of  a  colony. Yet we  had  beaten  this

British  company down to accepting a  49  per  cent

capital  participation. And the P.A.P.  Government,

immediately after coming in, has given them 100 per

cent. That, Sir, must be due to the flexibility  in

the  struggle against colonialism as enunciated  by

the  Government. They say that the struggle has now

entered  a  flexible stage where they  must  employ

flexible tactics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Minister for Labour and Law claims, "Have

you  not  read the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech?

Did  we  not  say that there would be $101  million

capital  that  might be invested in this  country?"

And  he went on to say about the Shell Company with

a $54 million investment. The Shell Company started

its  discussions with the previous Government.  The

Shell Company wanted the piece of land that has now

been  given  to  a Japanese company.  We  were  not

prepared to give it for free. We asked for the full

price.  The British said, "No, no, do not  ask  for

the  full  price.  You  know  we  are  helping  the

country.  Give  it  to us at a cheaper  price."  We

said,  "No deal." We refused to give that piece  of

land.  And  now  that  land has  been  given  to  a

Japanese foreign company. But Shell is still  going

ahead with their proposal of a $54 million refinery

that was discussed during the previous Government's

time. So do not try to claim something that is  not

true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, did the Minister for Labour and Law mention

how  best  to get the trade unions into  line?  The

Government  is  going to build them a  trade  union

house. Do not say no to that. Sir, any trade  union

worthy  of its name and its desire to struggle  for

justice  and  just rights must not accept  any  sop

from  any Government or any political organisation,

because then it will lose its own character and its

own  integrity. But no, the plan of the  Government

is  to  build  a trade union house for  the  Trades

Union Congress, because, as the Member for Hong Lim

has  said,  they hope to capture the  Trades  Union

Congress.  And  they  have already  made  plans  to

capture the Trades Union Congress. We have heard in

this  Assembly of a trade unionist who takes  pride

in  accepting a sop from the Government. Does  that

mean  to  suggest to the outside world and  to  the

workers  throughout the world that the  workers  of

Singapore are not united enough to raise  funds  to

build  their  own trade union house? Are  they  not

confident  enough that they have  the  masses  with

them  and that with only $1 from each Member,  they

could put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



up  a  house which they can proudly call their own?

Don't they have any sense of shame? I wonder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Law said, "We believe in Malayanisation. We do not believe in Batu

Pahatisation." This debate, Sir, has brought  in  a

number  of  words that we never dreamed would  have

crept  in:  "Batu  Pahatisation.". "Meadowisation".

But  I say this, Sir: the people of Singapore  know

what  kind  of "isation" has been going on  in  the

civil  service  and  in  the authorities  that  are

controlled   by   the   Government.   It   is   not

"Malayanisation". It is not "Batu Pahatisation". It

is  not "Meadowisation". It is "P.A.P.-isation" and

they cannot deny that. Just ask any man who has got

a  new  job. "Are you a P.A.P. member?" - "Yes, Sir."

"Are  you  a good P.A.P. member?" - "Yes, Sir."  "Ah,

you  can  be promoted. You can get a job." "P.A.P.-isation" - the   killers  of  the   Singapore   civil

service! And yet they say "Batu Pahatisation"! Sir,

even  if it had been "Batu Pahatisation", they with

the   collective   leadership   must   accept   the

collective responsibility for having done something

that is not good for the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We do accept responsibility

and we have put it right.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister said, "Look

around, it is a review of the political situation."

And  he  went on, "There is no opposition force  to

us.  The  Opposition as represented  today  are  an

inert and ineffective force." Those were his words.

I  say this to him: if he really believes that that

is   so,  let  us  come  out  for  another  general

elections. [Laughter] They can just laugh  it  off,

Sir,  but  they will have to eat their  own  words.

They  are afraid of a general election because they

know - and  know full well - that the public cannot  be

bluffed  for too long, that all this P.A.P.-isation

and  all that has been going on have not been  good

for  the people of Singapore. But if they feel that

there is a danger of their being overthrown, then I

say  to them, "Do not come out and make accusations

that you are not prepared to back up. Do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



say  that we are inert and ineffective because  you

will be knocked out if you have the courage to come

out today."



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> You

said that a couple of years ago.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, an inert and ineffective

force  is now told that they will not want to fight

with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some notes jotted down about the

speech  of  the Prime Minister in relation  to  the

Member for Hong Lim. I do not think it is necessary

for  me  to waste the time of this Assembly  or  to

lower  my  dignity or the dignity of this House  to

participate in the character assassination  between

ex-comrades, it does not profit us. In fact, if the

truth be told, we are rather ashamed as Members  of

this  Assembly to hear the words used by honourable

men  of  this  Assembly.  But  there  were  certain

allegations brought out by the Member for Hong Lim,

and  these allegations have not been denied so  far

either  by  the  Ministers or by the Back-benchers.

What   did  the  Member  for  Hong  Lim  say?  "The

Government had to use six lorries to convey members

of  the  Works  Brigade,  P.A.P. community  centre

leaders and others to the City Hall to line up  the

streets  from  City Hall to this  Assembly,  hoping

that  they  would  cheer  when  these  people   who

represent the masses marched to the Assembly."  And

it  has been told that these men did not cheer. But

what  I  want  to bring out is this,  Sir.  Such  a

charge  has been made in this House and that charge

has  not been denied. I would not like to say  that

that  is  true,  but so long as it  is  not  denied

during this debate, then it must be true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another allegation made by the Member for Hong

Lim - and  this is a very serious allegation - is  that

the  Government intimidates the Press.  We  have  a

champion  of  the freedom of the Press  sitting  in

this  House as the Minister for Culture today.  The

Member  for Hong Lim made allegations that  editors

and newspaper reporters were called in and told  to

toe  the  P.A.P. line. That resulted  in  only  one

little  denial  from the Minister for  Culture  who

was, and I hope still is, a defender of the freedom

of the Press. He said. "What about this Ong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



Eng  Guan  issue? No doubt, I called  them  in  and

talked  to them. But they themselves told  me  that

they did not want to play up this issue because all

the statements of Ong Eng Guan were not true." That

may  be  correct,  Sir, and I  would  not  want  to

challenge  that  statement. But  there  were  other

instances   of  the  Press  not  doing  the   right

thing - not  maintaining the  freedom  of  their  own

Press.  When the Opposition had some statements  to

issue   which  were  not  to  the  credit  of   the

Government  or to the P.A.P., and when  Members  of

the  Opposition  had said a number of  things  that

should have been brought out into the light of day,

the Press did not print them. Sir, I would not like

to  make  a  sweeping statement that the Government

has  intimidated the Press, but I would like to say

in  this House that they have told the Press to  be

careful  of what they write and what they  publish.

When they are accused of suppressing the Press, the

Minister  for  Culture - the great  defender  of  the

freedom of the Press - stands up and smilingly  says,

"I  did not tell them anything. I only told them to

be  careful  to publish what is good  and  what  is

bad."   [Interruption]  But,  Sir,  that  kind   of

intimidation is worse than pure intimidation.  Pure

intimidation   can   be  nailed,   but   suggestive

intimidation  cannot be nailed.  [Interruption]  It

seems,  Sir,  that there must be some truth  in  my

statement that there has been intimidation  of  the

Press  because  even  the Hon, the  Prime  Minister

looks  hurt.  There is a Malay saying.  Sir - "Siapa

makan  chilli rasa pedas." It could be  true.  They

either laugh it off or they burst out in anger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in respect of the two detained journalists,

the  Member for Hong Lim said that one of them  was

detained  15  minutes after having left  his  Press

conference on his way to the office to telephone  a

report  to  the  papers in Kuala  Lumpur.  The  two

journalists  were  detained and  the  Minister  for

Culture  was the one who stood up in this House  to

justify  their detention under the Preservation  of

Public  Security Ordinance. What did  he  tell  us?

"Oh,  they are K.M.T. propagandists. They have been

trained in K.M.T. camps. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



they  are a danger to the people of Singapore."  If

that  is  the way we want to go about it, then  all

those  people  who have been trained in  the  other

camp -  the Communist camp - to do this and  that  but

have not done anything yet should also be detained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They did something.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What have they done, Sir? During

the  time  of my Government, the Communists  roused

the  school children to disobey even their  parents

and  here  we  have a Member of the Government  who

says,  "I  pray to God every day." These Communists

even  told  the children, "Thou shall  disobey  thy

parents.  Thou shall forget all those things.  Come

out  and fight." And here we have this other  group

of  men who say, "Tch, tch, do not do this. That is

wrong.  We  are  fighting  Communist  tactics   and

Communist  subversion. We are not trying  to  bring

about  the downfall of the Government but we  have,

in  fact, tried to help the Government." They  are

detained  today for acts which they did some  three

years  ago. Can the Government say that  since  the

P.A.P. came into power, these two journalists  have

indulged  in  subversive activities detrimental  to

the  welfare  of the people in order  to  overthrow

this  Government? What have these  two  journalists

done? They felt that the Ong Eng Guan issue must be

brought  to  light. They felt that  since  all  the

Singapore Press would not want to publish what  the

Member  for Hong Lim had said, they should try  and

do  something at least for the people and let  them

know  what is going on. Therefore, their activities

were  not prejudicial to the interest of the people

of   Singapore  nor  to  its  security,  but  their

activities were prejudicial to the continuation  in

power of the Government that we have today - and that

is subversive activity! I think the Prime Minister,

in  his speech, did define subversive activity.  It

is in the Straits Times -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Get the Hansard.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Hansard is not out yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Of October 1958.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister is trying to

confuse me so that I will not be able to find

those words he said. In the Straits Times of 4th

August, 1960, page 5, this is what the Prime

Minister had to say about subversive activity:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"We had defined subversion before the elections

and made it quite clear what we meant by that term:

that  whether it comes from the Right or  from  the

Left,  any  subordination of the interests  of  the

people   of  Singapore  to  outside  interests   we

consider  an  undermining  of  the  authority   and

integrity of the State,..."'.



<br><br>Now,  what had these two reporters been doing? Just

to  give the Member for Hong Lim an opportunity  to

have his words read by a section of the public? Are

these  activities  prejudicial to  the  State?  Are

these  activities  undermining  the  authority  and

integrity of the State? Is this not another way  of

intimidating the Press and saying, "Boys, if you do

not behave, and do not write what pleases us, watch

out!" They said that that placing of the facts, the

ability of their pen to put the words of the Member

for  Hong Lim across to a section of the people  is

subversion  from  the Right.  And  yet,  the  Prime

Minister has said that there is a reorganisation of

Communist forces in Singapore. He knows it. He says

it.  And  therefore he knows how  many  people,  at

least  some people who have been reorganising.  Has

he  today  told us that he has also detained  these

people under the P.P.S.O.? Oh, no, they cannot  do

that because they are a democratic government. They

must give ground play. And until they are ready  to

bite,  ah,  then the big sword will be  drawn.  Yet

these  two journalists have been detained  under  a

law  which  is  not intended to be used  for  such

purposes.  The Minister for Culture,  Sir,  as  ex-President  of  the Singapore Union of  Journalists,

will  remember the occasion when he came to see  me

about  the  detention  of  a  journalist.  We   had

satisfactory evidence to detain that  man,  who  is

now  the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.

And yet the Minister, when he came to see me, said,

"Look, it can be misinterpreted as a destruction of

the  freedom  of the Press!" I took the  course  of

releasing this detainee because the freedom of  the

Press must be maintained



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



at  all  costs.  The  Singapore  Union   of

Journalists  has clearly stated in the papers - I  do

not  know  how it came to be written, but anyway  I

read it - that the activities of these two people who

are  detained  are  not subversive  but  only  "bad

journalism".  They said so, I did not  say  it - "bad

journalism". And yet they are still detained  under

the P.P.S.O.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have brought this out in some detail in

order  to  strengthen my contention that there  has

been suggestive intimidation of the Press, although

I  cannot  at the present time say that  there  has

been  open intimidation. The Minister for  Culture

has explained the detention of the journalists, and

also explained the stand of the Singapore Press not

to give publicity to the Ong Eng Guan issue. But he

has  not explained another allegation made  by  the

Member for Hong Lim. He said that a writer in  the

Sunday  Mail, Huang Tze-chin, was sent for  by  the

Government and interrogated for four hours. He  did

not find it necessary to deny that. But now because

I   have  taken  the  opportunity  to  remind   the

Ministers   that  they  have  forgotten   to   deny

something, they suddenly wake up, "Ah, ha, this  is

a  dangerous thing. It must be denied." And I  hope

some  chits  may be passed around  to  one  of  the

Ministers  who will be quick enough to jump  up  to

his feet and deny in categorical terms that such  a

thing  has happened. That fact has not been  denied

in  this  House so far by the Minister for Culture,

under whose portfolio is propaganda, the Press  and

the radio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, talking of the anti-colonial struggle

by  the Government Benchers, the speeches from  the

other  side brought out one factor, and one  factor

alone - the  colonial struggle. Even  then  that  has

already been stated by the P.A.P. leadership,  and

what did they say about it? It takes some time  to

look it up, Sir - the colonial struggle:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"`The present phase of colonial struggle requires

more flexible and effective tactics."'

<br><br>It  is  so  flexible and effective, Sir, that  they

have  granted 100 per cent ownership of a cigarette

factory to British capital in Singapore. It  is  so

flexible  and  effective  that  they,  during   the

elections, had damned the British and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



wanted to throw them into the sea, had gone to  the

United  Kingdom to say, "Tolong-lah,  I  want  some

money",  and got $65 million. They say,  "Ha!  What

are the Americans? Troublesome people!" And yet the

Minister for Finance is not here today. He is  over

in  America, begging for money. I do not  say  that

what  the Minister for Finance is doing is  wrong.

In  fact,  what he is doing is right and should  be

given  every support of the Opposition. But  I  say

that it is wrong to go and slap people unreasonably

and  expect  them to come to your assistance  when

you need it. It is definitely wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information.

Can I -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister  with his Special Branch service  and  the

civil  service must be fully informed. He need  not

be informed `by me of the trends in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if what has been said outside and by

the  Member for Hong Lim may not be true - I  do  not

think  it  is  true - that  the  flexibility  of  the

tactics  in  the  colonial  struggle  requires  the

expulsion  of Ong Eng Guan, it has been  said,  and

said so often, "Before you want any money from  the

British,  that horrible Mayor who had  insulted  us

must be expelled." Therefore, he is out, before the

Minister for Finance -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> For $65 million.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - travelled to the United Kingdom.

That,  Sir,  is  the flexibility  in  the  colonial

struggle. I have a bit more to say about that later

on. And because this matter has been brought out by

the  Prime Minister in his speech, I want to  touch

on  it. I think he said something about that little

man, the Member for Hong Lim, who was not wanted by

Left-wing  adventurers  during  the  P.A.P.  Annual

Conference  in 1957. He said that that  little  man

was rejected by his group of Left-wing adventurers.

Why  did  he bring this out, Sir? Did we  not  know

that at the time when that little man had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



been  ousted by what the Prime Minister  wished  to

describe  as  "Left-wing adventurers"  and  what  I

would  describe in unambiguous terms as  "Communist

sympathisers  and activists"? When he  was  removed

from  the  Party treasurer-ship, was not the  Prime

Minister and his "collective leadership" then  most

unhappy?  And  was there not great  joy  when  this

foolish Lim Yew Hock Government had to take  action

against six members of the Central Executive of the

P.A.P. in 1957?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Five! You have got your

numbers mixed up.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Prime Minister, Sir, is so

well informed. He even knows the number - it is five.Strange  that he knows it, and I do not.  And  now,

accepting that he is better informed than I am, how

many were taken? Five! Five!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We know what you are doing

better than you know your own self!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Five! He knows it. So let us

limit   it   to   five.  I  thank   him   for   the

correction - five.  Five  members  of   the   Central

Executive  were  released by this foolish  Lim  Yew

Hock  Government. And then what happened?  Great

joy!  "Ong Eng Guan, come back, my brother. I  like

you!"  He  went  back  and he was  again  made  the

Treasurer of the P.A.P. Then we had what we had - the

triumvirate complete: Chairman, Dr Toh Chin  Chye,

the  Deputy Prime Minister; Secretary-General,  the

Prime  Minister;  Treasurer;  the  ex-Minister  for

National  Development. That was in 1957, and  they

worked  as  a team. Elections were coming - the  City

Council  would  have a Mayor. So they  planned  how

best to make an inroad into the hearts and minds of

the  people of Singapore. "Ah, our beloved comrade,

the  Member  for Hong Lim, is a good tactician.  He

knows how to work. He knows how to make a standpipe

worth  more than a school." Therefore, he was  sent

out,  "Go,  and fight." And they won, Sir,  because

the Labour Front at that time was foolish enough -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To take $500,000.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - outside of my presence, to agree

to  a  pact with them. They won, and then the great

Mayor  was  born. Yet, Sir, the Prime Minister  had

the  heart, shall we say, the peevish heart to  say

in  this Assembly, "That little man was rejected by

the  Left-wing adventurers." Sir, we  do  not  play

that kind of politics. We play clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, the art of denying allegations as

practised by the P.A.P. Government is to deny  what

can  be  denied, and try to forget what  cannot  be

denied in the hope that the people will forget. The

Member  for  Mountbatten said  that  the  community

centre in Joo Chiat was declared open by a defeated

P.A.P. candidate. That was not  denied.  But  what

they  tried  to  say  was, "Oh, no.  The  community

centre  in  Mountbatten was opened by  our  beloved

Deputy Prime Minister. He was there because  he  is

dressed  like we are, and the Opposition would  not

dare  to  dress  as  we dress. He  mixes  with  the

people.  He  goes  around, but  certainly  not  the

Member  for Mountbatten. And she cannot  go  around

dressed as she is in that group." Sir, we, who  are

in  the opposition, are not ashamed of the dress we

put on. We dress ourselves in these clothes because

we  respect the dignity of this House. But when  we

are  outside, we go where we like. And we need  not

have  to say that we are the beloved of the masses.

And  yet when they go about, there are at least two

bodyguards  going round with them to see  that  the

masses  do  not turn round and fight  them.  We  go

quietly.  We  go wherever we want. We even  do  not

have to come -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> To some interesting places in

Geylang too!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We do not have to come to a

meeting  in this place, a well-guarded house,  with

about 30 bodyguards outside. We do not have to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed the hon. Member

to  carry on up till now, but it seems to  me  that

all these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



details  are completely irrelevant to the topic  we

are   discussing,  that  is,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, this is in

reply to the charge made by the Minister for Labour

and Law on the question of our dress and on our not

having the courage to go out among the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is one example. When something is made

about  something else, an explanation is made about

other things, so that the whole thing could be lost

in a jungle of words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to speak on some important

matters  that  are  exercising  the  minds  of  the

Government. Sir, in this House, we are so  used  to

the   declaration  of  the  P.A.P.,   "We   are   a

democratic,  non-Communist, socialist  Government."

That  word "non-Communist" has been used so  often.

They  are  very  fond of declaring that,  at  every

opportunity, whether in this House or outside. They

say, "We are a democratic, non-Communist, socialist

Party." Sir, I would hesitate to try and teach  the

P.A.P. the  meaning of the word  "democracy".  But

surely,   Sir,  democracy  itself   is   the   very

antithesis  of Communism. You cannot be a  democrat

and  a Communist at the same time. You cannot be  a

Communist  and claim to be a democrat at  the  same

time. Therefore, there is no earthly reason for the

P.A.P. if they are real democrats, to say that they

are non-Communists too. But as I see it, Sir, there

are  two  very  important reasons which  impel  the

P.A.P. to  keep  on  repeating  this  word,  "non-Communist",  "non-Communist",  as  if  it  were   a

ritual.   The  first  reason,  Sir,  is   to   drum

consistently into the heads of that section of  the

P.A.P. membership described by the Member for  Hong

Lim  as  Communists. They want to keep on  drumming

into   the  heads  of  this  section  of  Communist

sympathisers  and activists in the Party  the  word

"non-Communist", so that these people  will  accept

it  and  keep quiet; so that this section will  not

think  that  they should try to run the  collective

leadership  and  force them to do acts  which  they

could not defend. But in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



order  to  keep this Section quiet, something  must

have  been  done. Some concessions could have  been

made to this group of people. Therefore, they were

quiet.  This  group of people in the  P.A.P.,  Sir,

together with what they claimed to be the good work

of  Mayor  Ong Eng Guan, helped them  to  win  the

elections.  They are their comrades in  arms.  They

have been with them and, as the Member for Hong Lim

has  said,  they are still with them.  They  know,

Sir,  that they must satisfy this group of  people,

and  must satisfy the other group outside. So  they

say,  let us use the word "non-Communist". It  does

not  mean  we are anti-Communist. But we  are  non-Communist. Do they not realise that any  action  by

the  Government of a Communist character, that  any

attempt  to implement what this section would  want

to  see  implemented,  would  result  in  immediate

reaction  from the Federation and would  result  in

the  withdrawal of the Federation from the Internal

Security  Council, and might result in a suspension

of the Constitution?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second reason for repeating this word

"non-Communist"  so  often, as `what  one  Minister

said,  like  a  gramophone record,  is  to  try  to

readjust  the minds of the public, who are  already

convinced  that there is a section  in  the  P.A.P.

yesterday  and today who are Communist sympathisers

and   activists.  And,  therefore,  the  collective

leadership thinks that by repeating this word "non-Communist", "non-Communist", "non-Communist",  the

public  will believe them. The public,  Sir,  I  am

sorry to say, do not believe them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why do they not believe that? Why is it not

possible for the public to believe that there is no

section of Communist sympathisers and activists  in

the  P.A.P.?  It is because of what came  from  the

very lips of their ex-comrade, their beloved Mayor,

their  beloved  Minister for National  Development,

and their beloved Treasurer. He made a statement to

the effect that there are Communists in the P.A.P.,

and  no one, not even up till today, has denied the

presence of that section in the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we come to a very important, and

perhaps world-shaking, issue in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



eyes  of  the people of Singapore - merger  with  the

Federation. Sir, merger with the Federation was one

of  the  important issues promised  by  the  P.A.P.

during  the last election: everyone was glad  there

was   this   realistic  approach  to  bring   about

political  and  economic stability  through  merger

with  the  Federation. But, Sir,  what  do  we  see

today? Not one word in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

Speech, and not one word about merger in the  Prime

Minister's speech. It is true, Sir, that during the

early  days of the P.A.P. Government, there were  a

few  bleats of merger with the Federation.  But  we

all  know  that  with every little bleat  came  the

quick statement from the Federation Prime Minister,

"No merger." And recently, Sir, the Prime Minister,

in  a  Press  statement,  tried  to  lay  down  the

foundation  for  the  time when  they,  the  P.A.P.

Government, will have to admit to  the  electorate

that  no merger is possible. And what is the excuse

they  used?  The  communal  issue.  The  Federation

Malays do not trust the Singapore Chinese. Sir, the

Federation  Government and  the  people  know  that

there are Chinese and Chinese. They themselves have

given  citizenship  rights to the  Chinese  in  the

Federation.   What   the  Federation   people   and

Government do not trust is the group of Chinese who

are  led  by or who may fall easy prey to Communist

sympathisers  and  activists.  There  has  been  no

denial  that  in the P.A.P. there is a  section  of

such evil-doers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, that in the heat of the election

campaign last year, the Prime Minister accused  the

Straits Times of trying to sour relations with  the

Federation,  and  warned that any attempt  in  this

direction would immediately result in the detention

of   the   persons  concerned,  be  they   editors,

reporters  or  any kind of worker.  They  would  be

detained under the P.P.S.O. But there have been two

instances  that  have  come  to  light  since  that

statement was uttered and that warning issued.  And

these  two matters refer to Ministerial statements.

Sir,  when Tunku Abdul Rahman said at the  U.M.N.O.

conference  that there was present in Singapore  at

that time a Russian



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



trade   delegation,   the  Minister   for   Culture

immediately   issued   a  statement   denying   the

statement of the Federation Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot understand whether it is the kind

of  culture that the P.A.P. Government has  that  a

minor  Minister, be he the Minister for Culture  at

that,  should issue a statement denying a statement

of  a  Prime Minister of the country with which  we

hope  to achieve merger? And now, Sir, what  do  we

hear  from the lips of the Prime Minister? In  his

speech  he said - and I quote again from the  Straits

Times of August 4, 1960, page 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Do they not know that even the presence of a

Russian  delegation  to  an  ECAFE  conference   in

Singapore  on small-scale industry was viewed  with

suspicion and disfavour?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they unaware from Press reports that even the

giving  of  a  residence  visa  for  more  than   a

transitory  visit  to a Russian representative  had

caused excitement and brought opposition?'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the lips of the Prime Minister, Sir. It is

clear  that  the statement of the Federation  Prime

Minister  at that time was materially correct.  And

yet  the  Minister for Culture had the temerity  to

issue  a statement to deny what was said, which  is

not  said  to be true. What is the impact of,  that

denial,  Sir? It almost amounts to saying that  the

Federation  Prime Minister was a  liar.  Who  then,

Sir,   is   trying  to  sour  relations  with   the

Federation? Is the Prime Minister going to put  the

Minister  for  Culture under  detention  under  the

P.P.S.O.?  Or  does his collective leadership  mean

that  they accept the collective responsibility  of

souring relations with the Federation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another instance which I would like

to  mention here, because it has been said in  this

Assembly.  Sir, we read in the Press recently  that

four  federations of unions had been  deregistered,

because  of the Internal Security Council. I  know,

Sir,  that  under the Constitution such matters  do

not come under the Internal Security Council. And I

dare  say  that this de-registration did not  issue

from  the Internal Security Council at all. Is this

a method used by the P.A.P. to try to hoodwink



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



their  Communist  sympathisers and extremists  that

what  they  themselves  do  in  the  discharge   of

internal security is not what they themselves  want

to  do but that they have been told to do? Sir, the

exercise  of  this  act  rests  squarely   on   the

Singapore  Government, and this  Government  claims

that  it is a strong and responsible Government.  I

would  therefore ask them if, they are  strong  and

responsible, to tell the truth. But here they do an

act  which is not pleasing to a certain section  of

the P.A.P. membership. Sir, is it fair to bring in

the Internal Security Council on a matter that does

not  affect them? And is it fair to bring  this  in

especially  when  the Federation Government  has  a

representative  in it as a member? Would  not  that

sour relations?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Finance  was  so carried  away  when  he  was

replying to the Member for Hong Lim on the question

of, merger.  He said - and I must quote,  Sir,  from

shorthand notes - that the P.A.P. are not out to seek

honours  and titles from the Federation  Government

like the ex-Chief Minister -



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Tun.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - who has been made a Tun. Sir,

it is typical of them. Here is a Government anxious

to  achieve merger with a country and yet  ridicule

the  orders  of that country. That is the  type  of

mentality  we  have of a Government that  wants  to

achieve merger in the interests of the people  they

govern  and yet ridicule that Government. "Tun  Lim

Yew  Hock!"  These  are  the  men  who  have  been

entrusted  with the duty of achieving  merger  with

the  Federation. Surely, they know, Sir, that I  am

very  proud today of being a Tun of the Federation,

because  it  means,  in simple words,  that  I,  in

Singapore,  am trusted and loved by the  people  of

the Federation.  Not like these  people  who  are

distrusted  and  could  never  be  loved   by   the

Federation. And yet they want to achieve merger. It

is  better for them to come out straight away  now

and  say, "Sorry, boys, no merger because we do not

have enough culture."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we come to the claim of the Government

in the Yang di-Pertuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



Negara's  speech,  about  the  relations  with  the

Federation.  I  quote from col. 6 of  the  Hansard,

Volume 13, No. 1 of 20th July, 1960, which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With regard to the Federation of Malaya, the

danger  then  was that the Federation might  pursue

policies  which  did  not  take  into  account  the

legitimate interests of Singapore. This danger  was

happily averted. On major matters of financial  and

economic  policy,  the two Governments  have  taken

pains  to  carry out mutual consultations. Examples

of  these are the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill,  the

new  Currency  Agreement, fiscal proposals  over  a

broad  field  and, last but not least, the  current

talks on the Common Commodity Market.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quote the two opening sentences again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With regard to the Federation of Malaya, the

danger  then  was that the Federation might  pursue

policies  which  did  not  take  into  account  the

legitimate interests of Singapore. This danger  was

happily averted.'.



<br><br>Sir,  it  has never been averted, and it cannot  be

averted  so long as this Government stick to  their

policy  of  a democratic, non-Communist,  socialist

Malaya  while  at  the same time  having  in  their

membership a section of Communist sympathisers  and

activists. But then they introduce a certain  claim

to  prove that the crisis has been averted. Let  us

examine  this  claim.  The Income  Tax  (Amendment)

Ordinance - it  was inevitable that there  should  be

joint  consultations  between the  two  Governments

because the Income Tax law is pan-Malayan.  On  the

Currency  Agreement,  this  was  reached  by   the

previous   Government  and  not   by   the   P.A.P.

Government.  But  it  is  hoped,  Sir,   that   the

Government will not do anything to jeopardise  the

continuation of this Currency Agreement. In  regard

to fiscal proposals over

a  broad field, Sir, this means nothing. It means,

because  we  have  a currency agreement,  therefore

there  must  be  agreement  on  general  and  broad

principle. Let us now see what they say  about  the

common commodity market. Yes, talks are still going

on,  and we would like to know when these talks can

be  reported to this Assembly and when these  talks

will bear fruit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so much news has been made by the Government

of the presence of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



Internal Security Council in our Constitution  that

I  feel  that,  as  leader of the  delegation  that

brought  about the new Constitution, I must present

the  Internal Security Council to the people in its

proper perspective. Sir, paragraph 24 of the Report

of  the Singapore Constitutional Conference held in

London  in  March and April 1957, Sessional  Paper,

No. Misc. 2 of 1957, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Her Majesty's Government indicated that it was

their  intention  that the new Constitution  should

confer upon Singapore Ministers full responsibility

for   maintaining  internal  law  and   order   and

preventing subversion.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, from this paragraph that

Singapore  Ministers have full  responsibility  for

maintaining   law   and   order   and    preventing

subversion.  Sir,  section  65  of  the   Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, that is  the

Government  Gazette  Supplement  No.  81  of   27th

November, 1958, clearly lays down the functions  of

the Internal Security Council. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Council shall have the following functions,

that is to say -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to consult together on all questions of

policy  relating  to the maintenance  of  public

safety and public order in Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to maintain the efficiency of all organs of

the  Government of Singapore which are concerned

with internal security;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to ensure equal access by the Governments of

the  United  Kingdom  and of  Singapore  to  the

services   of  the  said  organs  and   to   all

information at the disposal of those organs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means, Sir, that the Internal Security

Council  is a kind of referee to see that  law  and

order  is  properly maintained by  the  Singapore

Government, and that effective steps are  taken  by

the Singapore Government to prevent subversion.  So

long as the Government is strong and discharges its

duties  and responsibilities vis-a-vis the Internal

Security Council in the interests of the people  of

Singapore,  everything is rosy,  and  the  Internal

Security  Council sits back happy  and  contented.

What  gave  birth to the Internal Security  Council

were two factors that had to be resolved during the

negotiations  in  London.  What  if  the  Singapore

Government  turned out to be a weak Government  and

vacillated in its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



full responsibility for internal security? What  if

the  Singapore Government turned out to  be  a  bad

Government   refusing   to  discharge   the   full

responsibility for internal security to protect the

interest  of the people of Singapore? So,  Sir,  to

look  after  either of these two eventualities,  it

was   agreed  that  section  66  of  the  Singapore

(Constitution)  Order in Council. 1958, would  be

brought into play. I will just quote paragraph (1),

because  the  whole  section  is  so  detailed  and

paragraph (1) will give the meaning that I want  to

put across to this Assembly:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"66.-(1) It shall be competent to the Council to

make  decisions for the maintenance of the internal

security of Singapore or for the due performance of

the  functions  conferred on it  by  the  preceding

section."



<br><br>Sir, this section will only come into force when we

have  a  weak  Government or when  we  have  a  bad

Government. But the P.A.P. proudly boasts that  it

is  a strong and responsible Government. Therefore,

if  they  are  indeed strong and responsible,  then

they  must accept full responsibility for  internal

security.  They must accept, without qualification,

the  continued  detention of all those  that  were

detained  by  the  previous  Government  under  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance, and  all

future detentions under the P.P.S.O. are their full

responsibility if they claim that they are a strong

and  responsible Government. Why then, Sir, if they

are  a strong and responsible Government, bring  in

the  Internal  Security Council to explain  away  a

number  of things that are confusing the  minds  of

the people? Why then bring in the Internal Security

Council to explain away the continued detention  of

Communist  sympathisers  and  activists  under  the

P.P.S.O.? They are always claiming, as I have said,

Sir,  that they do not lack courage and they  never

lack  courage. Then I would ask them, Sir, to pluck

up  sufficient courage to declare that they  accept

full responsibility for the continued detention  of

those  people  who  are  comrades-in-arms  of  that

section  of the P.A.P. described by the Member  for

Hong  Lim  as  Communist. Perhaps,  Sir,  there  is

another reason why the Government makes use of  the

Internal Security Council. Is the collective



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



leadership  playing  a game with  that  section  of

Communist sympathisers and activists in the P.A.P.?

And  is  the collective leadership playing, at  the

same  time,  another game with the  British?  This

looks to me, Sir, like a double game: one game here

and  one  game there. We know, Sir, that  a  double

game generally ends in a double cross. Sir, how is

this double game played?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Poker!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is a very simple matter, Sir.

It  does  not  require  much  intelligence  but  it

requires  a  lot of agility. Tell that  section  of

Communist sympathisers and activists in the P.A.P.,

"Boys,  this  Constitution  does  not  give   full

powers.  The  Internal Security  Council  is  still

here.  The great colonial master is still here.  If

you  behave and be quiet and if you have belief and

trust  in the collective leadership, then  we  will

see  to it that your comrades are returned to your

loving arms." And to the British, "Oh, British,  we

the collective leadership are playing this game for

keeps.  Please, it is a dangerous game. We  believe

that  these  Communist sympathisers  and  activists

must  be detained. If they are released, there will

be  a  conflagration. But you know that  there  are

some  comrades of ours to whom at least  we  owe  a

debt  of  gratitude  for helping  us  to  win  the'

elections and we must keep them quiet." "Can I say,

Internal  Security  Council,  boleh-kah?"  And  the

answer  is, "Go ahead." And therefore the  Internal

Security  Council is brought in to explain  away  a

responsibility that should be fully discharged by a

Government   that   claims   to   be   strong   and

responsible. They say. Sir, "On one side,  we  have

the Communists -".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hey we are not!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b>" - and on the other side, we have

the  British  colonialists. When these  two  forces

clash,  we  duck." Sir, this kind of  game  is  not

going  to allow them to duck. I think they will  be

well  and strongly ducked when the time comes. They

will not duck but they will be dead ducks. The game

of the Internal Security Council is puzzling us all

here.  I  have a worried feeling for the collective

leadership, because it may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



not be improbable, Sir, that the final words of the

Minister for Culture may turn out to be true. In an

attack on the Member for Hong Lim, the Minister for

Culture   ended  by  saying,  "May  his   Left-wing

adventurers have mercy on his soul when they decide

that  they have had enough of him." Sir, if I could

have the permission of the Minister for Culture  to

substitute  some words, I would like to  say,  "May

the  Communist section in the P.A.P. have mercy  on

the  souls  of the collective leadership  when  the

Communist section decide that they have had  enough

of that collective leadership."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is an open secret that the P.A.P.

Government is pursuing a policy vis-a-vis Communist

sympathisers and activists of trying  to  win  them

over  to the cause of democracy. They say that  the

policy  of  the previous Government was wrong;  the

policy  of  taking the war into the Communist  camp

was  wrong and did not pay dividends, and that this

action  resulted in the downfall of the Government.

Therefore, what is most necessary is to try to  win

them    over   to   the   democratic - hence,    non-Communist - socialist way of life. And they say  that

because  the  previous  Government  had  taken  the

action of mass arrests under the P.P.S.O. they  had

brought  out antagonism in the hearts and minds  of

the people of Singapore. Sir, what was the previous

Government  to  do at the height of the  riots  and

civil  commotion? To surrender, or to play a  game?

This,  the  previous Government was not capable  of

doing.  So  the P.A.P. Government has,  during  the

last  14  months, to try this policy out. But  from

one.  Sir, who knows the game and its consequences,

I  say  that  their policy of trying  to  win  over

Communist sympathisers and activists to their cause

is  a  foolish policy, for the Communists are  past

masters  in  the  art  of  making  use  of  people.

particularly  people who are  fond  of  power,  for

their  own ends, while at the same time giving  the

false  notion to the people they use that they  are

being  used by such people. They have had 14 months

of trying it out, and the statement of the Hon. the

Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



in  this  Assembly  a  few  days  ago  is  an  open

admission that that line did not pay dividends.  He

has  now warned the country that Communist elements

are  reorganising and are trying to  recapture  the

trade  union  movement. Sir,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's Speech did not give an indication of  this

potential  danger, but the Prime  Minister  had  to

disclose  it. It could be, Sir, that when the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's Speech was being prepared,  it

had  been  hoped that the Ong Eng Guan issue  might

not  have  reached  such a magnitude  as  to  cause

dismay to the Government and force them to tell the

Prime  Minister  to make such a statement.  He  has

made it. It came as a bombshell to many of us,  but

it did not come as a bombshell to me because I knew

something  like  this was going to happen.  It  has

happened.  But  in that statement on the  Communist

threat,  the  Prime Minister had, in my submission,

introduced  a  statement which is not  correct.  He

said  that Communist forces had "scattered and gone

undercover before the last elections." I  disagree,

Sir. I  cannot  accept  that statement.  Communist

sympathisers  and activists had not  scattered  and

had  not  gone undercover. They were  out  in  full

force  working against the Government, and  helping

in  a  big way to bring victory to this Government;

this so-called democratic, non-Communist, socialist

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I further touch on the statement of

the  Prime  Minister on the danger ahead.  I  would

like - the  Minister is staring at me in the  face - to

say a little bit that is not connected with what  I

have  been saying. The Minister for Labour and Law,

I think it was, charged the Member for Hong Lim, in

his  capacity as Minister for National Development,

for giving a Press interview, which reads like this

in  the  Straits  Times  of 19th  September,  1959,

headlined,  `$415 million to be spent in  the  next

five  years.  Beaming Minister Ong said,  "We  have

worked  hard  on  this plan."  And  now,  Sir,  the

Minister  for  Labour and Law says,  "We  have  not

authorised that statement, and when we charged  our

colleague, he said it was a leak". But let us  look

at this paper,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



Sir, front page news and back page news - they corner

the  market as far as front and back page news  are

concerned. Back page - who is this man? Ah, ha, he is

the  Premier. "Big Housing Scheme" to  cover  1,160

acres  of Government land. Is this not a Government

statement?  What  is all this? The Prime  Minister:

"Yes,  my picture must be in also." All right,  his

picture was in. And now he says, "No, no, we  never

did  it. It was Ong Eng Guan. We never said such  a

thing." I do not know what is the truth, but  there

is the Straits Times

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- to them a colonial paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the world-shaking pronouncement

of  the Prime Minister. For the first time, we  are

told  in  this  House  of the  impending  Communist

threat - there has been a Communist build-up over the

last  14 months. As I have said, there has been  no

such  pronouncement in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

Speech. The day the speech became public, everybody

said,  "Wonderful.  Everything is  fine."  But  now

after  the bombshell has been dropped, everyone  is

looking around and saying, "My God! I have promised

to bring in money here. I had better take it out. I

am  not  going  to  stay here anymore.  Trouble  is

coming." Sir, the fact that the Prime Minister  has

informed   this  House  and  the  public   of   the

seriousness of this threat is a credit  to  him,  a

great credit to him in this regard - that he wants to

fight  them.  He  means  to fight  those  Communist

sympathisers  and activists, and in this  fight  we

are  with him. But why did he keep quiet until now?

Why  did he wait for 14 months to come out and say,

"There has been a Communist build-up"? Sir, in this

fight against Communist underground activity, every

one  who loves his country must join in, and we  in

the  Opposition pledge our full support. But  there

are  a  few  matters which we would like  to  place

before  the  Government for serious consideration.

The Government has done certain foolish things, and

these  they  have admitted. They have done  certain

foolish things -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mistakes, not foolish things.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - wittingly or unwittingly,

thereby  strengthening the other side. It is  quite

human,  Sir,  to make mistakes, and the  Government

has  declared that it will rectify those  mistakes.

And  therefore  the sincerity of the Government  in

this  rectification programme will be  put  to  the

test before the real issue comes up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say in this House that it was a grave

mistake   to   create   the  posts   of   Political

Secretaries,  and  to  give  jobs  those  detainees

released  by  the Government before taking  office.

What  did  the Government hope to achieve by  this?

Offer  them  $1,100-jobs so that  they  would  keep

quiet  and  not open their mouths? Or,  offer  them

these  jobs  and if they accept they  would  become

discredited in the eyes of their comrades by  their

acceptance of this personal advantage at the  price

of  silence?  Does the Minister for  Finance,  that

very  able  man, require a Political  Secretary  to

advise  him?  He  knows, and it is  known  to  many

people too, that there is no love lost between  the

Minister  for Finance and his Political  Secretary,

and  that the Political Secretary is seldom in  his

office.  And yet there is a Political Secretary  to

the  Minister for Finance! It is not only a foolish

mistake,  but a grave mistake. Again, the  Minister

for Labour and Law has a Political Commissar in his

office  overseeing his work. Sir, the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for  Labour  and  Law,

before  taking office, took an oath of secrecy  and

yet   sits   outside  the  office.  The   Political

Secretary,  who does not have to take  an  oath  of

secrecy,  sits in the same room with  the  Minister

for  Labour and Law. Is the Minister for Labour and

Law  put  on  good behaviour? And is the  Political

Secretary given all eyes and ears to see  that  the

Minister does behave?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have not visited the other Ministries, and

so I cannot say what is going on there. But I would

like  to  say  this:  that these detainees - I  would

clarify by saying that some of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



detainees  are  not  qualified for  appointment  as

Political Secretaries who, in our view, are nothing

but  Political Commissars. A grave mistake. If they

really  mean to fight the Communist threat that  is

mounting  up  in  strength, I say, "They  have  the

enemy  inside."  Can they fight it?  Is  there  any

sincerity when they declare they will fight it when

the  enemy  is  tolerated in their  camp?  I  would

therefore  ask the Government to make  their  fight

easier - and  they  will  fight,  I  know  they  will

fight - by  removing all those Political  Secretaries

who have shown by their actions during the past  14

months to be unworthy and disloyal to the Party and

to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would ask Government to ponder, and to

ponder  well  before  they  reintroduce  the  Trade

Unions Bill. Certain major amendments will have  to

he   made,  if  they  do  not  want  to  create   a

Frankenstein that will destroy them at the critical

hour.   Sir,  there  must  be  a  reason  for   His

Excellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  withholding

his  assent to this Bill. There is nothing  in  the

Constitution  that  gives power  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to withhold assent to a Bill of this

character. It could have been on the advice of  the

Government  in  that  they  wanted  time  for  more

thought. It is good. I would ask them to spend  not

only  more thought, but still more thought, on  the

trade  union movement. They claim and say that  the

Communist underground movement is working up in the

trade  union field. But they claim that  they  have

got  the movement under non-Communist control. Sir,

as   a   trade   unionist,  I  have  this   unhappy

feeling - the Government is losing out in  its  fight

with  the  Communists  in the  trade  union  field.

Therefore, since the Bill has not been assented to.

and  since a new Bill has to be introduced, I would

ask  the Government to reassess the position,  make

major  amendments to the Bill, and to  ensure  that

there is no danger of the Communists capturing this

massive organisation, the workers' organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, then we come to the Work Brigade. The Work

Brigade is another possible source of danger.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am wondering whether the hon.

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will then suspend this sitting. I

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>5.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have said

that  we  are glad that the Prime Minister and  the

Government have now awakened to the threat  of  the

Communists reorganising in the Singapore  political

arena.  I  say in all sincerity that the Opposition

will   join   in   this  fight  against   Communist

subversion.  But I have pointed out that  the  only

way to get the Opposition and the people behind the

Government  is  to  see  that  they  make   certain

rectifications in the Government and in the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking about the Work Brigade before the

tea  break.  The  Work  Brigade,  Sir,  is  another

possible  source of danger. If the allegation  made

by the Member for Hong Lim is true, that members of

the  Work Brigade were used by the P.A.P. to  cheer

their  Ministers and Assemblymen during the opening

of  this  second session of the Assembly, and  that

they had not responded as anticipated, then, Sir, I

say another Frankenstein has been created.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the deliberate creation of a P.A.P. force of

community  centre leaders may be another source  of

danger. The loyalty of these leaders may not be  to

the  collective leadership when put  to  the  test,

when  the  fight comes out into the open. They  may

not  be a force that the Government anticipate that

this  P.A.P. group  of leaders  in  the  community

centres could be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most important point is that the P.A.P.

must cleanse itself. I know how difficult it is for

any organisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



for  that  matter  to  rid  itself  of  undesirable

people,  especially when a debt is  owing  to  such

people.  But the interest of the country should  be

placed  above  all things, above  Party  and  above

Government.  And  if the P.A.P. leaders  have  the

will, the desire, the integrity and the honesty - and

I know they have - then purge the P.A.P. from within.

Do  not  allow this group of Communist sympathisers

and  activists remaining in the Party to  become  a

sore  and a danger to the Party, to become a  focus

of  attention of those who are not for the  P.A.P.,

because  the threat is genuine, as has been uttered

by the Prime Minister. We on this side of the House

would like to see the P.A.P. strengthen itself  and

get  rid of that group of people which is a  source

of danger to them in the fight that is to come. Get

rid  of  them. They will then have the  respect  of

everybody in Singapore, including the admiration of

the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing I would ask the P.A.P. not to

keep on doing. Do not continue to be arrogant,  and

think  that they are the ones entrusted by God,  by

the  people  of this country, to guide the  destiny

and  the interest of the people of Singapore. There

is  greatness in humility, there never is greatness

in  greatness itself. Learn how to be humble. Learn

how to appreciate, in this big fight that faces the

Government today, that the effort of each and every

one - man,  woman and child, P.A.P. and non-P.A.P. - is

necessary to wipe out this threat. I repeat  again.

I  pledge  the resources of the S.P.A. and U.M.N.O.

in this fight ahead. But I would ask the Government

to come clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had thought of pointing out a few more

statements  in the speeches made by the Members  on

the  other side. But because of the seriousness  of

this threat of Communist subversion, I feel that  I

should  end my speech on this serious tone. Let  us

all get together, genuine democrats and socialists.

Do  not  call ourselves non-Communist. If  you  are

democrats,  you are not Communists.  Democrats  and

socialists fight against this Communist subversion,

which, if not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



checked, will soon not only swallow the P.A.P. but

also this side of the House. It may mean the end of

parliamentary democracy. So if we want to preserve what  we all love, let us forget this non-Communist

declaration.  Let us come out together  and  fight,

but fight with a clean Party.



<br><br>5.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion  in

the name of the Prime Minister to thank the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered on

behalf  of  the  Government at the opening  of  the

present session of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is always a subject of controversy in

any country even where it has to deal with one race

and  one  language.  The problem  of  education  in

Singapore,    therefore,    is    rendered     more

controversial    because   of   the   multi-racial

character of our people and the acceptance  of  the

policy  of  equal treatment for the  four  language

streams of education which are at different  stages

of development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first year of the People's Action Party

Government, the difficult task of re-organising the

legacy  of  a  colonial system of  education  to  a

national  system of education had to be undertaken.

Almost  every  aspect of education,  from  Primary,

Secondary, University, Teachers' Training College,

Polytechnic and Adult Education, was ca1led upon to

face  the new situation arising out of our  changed

political   status.  For  with  responsible   self-government  in our hands, we cannot pass  the  buck

when  errors are committed. We must have the  moral

courage  to face issues boldly, not run  away  from

them  like  the  Member for Hong Lim,  who  is  not

present, and in its place shout empty slogans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a sad and sorry exhibition to' see the

Member for Hong Lim carry under his arm volumes  of

Hansard,  quoting from them, in extenso, statements

made  by the Prime Minister' when he was the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar in the last Assembly. The manner

in which the Member for Hong Lim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



read  excerpts and extracts made us feel as  if  he

was  responsible for those brave words in the fight

against  colonialism. What is sad is  that  he  was

unable  to appreciate what one says as a Member  of

the Opposition, and what one is expected to do  as

a  Member  of  the Government. In the case  of  the

Rendel  Constitution,  the  People's  Action  Party

Government decided that they would act the role  of

the   Opposition  to  expose  and  bring  about   a

breakdown of the Rendel Constitution. But when  the

new  Constitution  came into  being,  the  People's

Action  Party decided that they would have a  five-year policy programme, and that they would tight in

order  to  win  and  to work the constitution,  The

Member   for   Hong  Lim  was  given  a   wonderful

opportunity   to   see  how   he   would   perform.

Unfortunately,  he  failed  miserably,   and   just

shouting slogans will get nobody anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regrettably, in the past, he carried on a

whispering  campaign, which were verbal  statements

passed privately. It is just as well that now  that

he  is  a  Member  of the Opposition,  he  will  be

entitled  to freedom of expression in the  Assembly

to   make  statements  which  would  be  challenged

because   they   were   based   on   terminological

inexactitudes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it go on record, Sir, that every statement

made which has not the backing of evidence will  be

recorded to be untrue. It is all very well to  read

romantic histories like the Three Kingdoms or  even

the  Rake's  Progress,  but people  who  read  such

stories  or such legendary histories should realise

that  they are reading them and should not  attempt

to  emulate  the heroes who are mentioned  in  such

books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one stage of his speech, the Member for Hong

Lim  had  the temerity to suggest that  an  article

appearing  under  the  name  of  the  Minister  for

Culture  was  not  written by him but  by  somebody

else.  Surely this is a thing which members of  the

world's Press would laugh at because, although  the

Minister for Culture is a very modest man,  he  has

great attainments. Perhaps the Member for Hong  Lim

is not sufficiently well read to realise that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



one  of  the short stories written by the  Minister

for  Culture, when he was a journalist, is included

in  the volume known as the World's Best 100  Short

Stories.  I  challenge the Member for Hong  Lim  to

write  something  which is worthy of  inclusion  in

print. He wondered why the local papers would  only

print  500  words of what he had to say  at  public

meetings.  He should know the reason  that  it  was

because editors felt that the majority of his words

were only fit for the wastepaper basket. Members of

the  public  have  for quite some  time  considered

politics  a dirty game. I suggest that the  tactics

adopted by the Member for Hong Lim will make  such

suggestion seem true, but Members on this  side  of

the  House are trying their best to tell the people

of  Singapore that politics can be a clean game  if

you  have  integrity  both  in  principles  and  in

behaviour. Since the Member for Aljunied is in  the

House  and  he  has  made his  maiden  speech  last

evening,  it  is,  I  think, necessary  for  me  to

disabuse  what he has said - that he was  making  his

maiden speech as a Member of the Opposition because

he  had had no freedom of speech when he was on the

Government  Bench.  This is typical  of  the  wild

statements which the expelled members of the P.A.P.

have  been  guilty  of  for  some  time.  We  pride

ourselves on being a disciplined Party.  If  during

the  period  that  the Member for  Aljunied  was  a

member  of the People's Action Party he failed  for

some  reason or other to attend meetings  at  which

the Backbenchers were called upon to do their share

of  speaking, then we cannot be blamed nor can  the

Prime Minister or the Leader of the House be blamed

that  he  had not been given a chance. It  is  more

correct   to   say   that   he   had   evaded   his

responsibility. In fact, it perhaps shows his  true

colours,  that  he was not prepared to  accept  the

collective leadership of the Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I will miss out the Member for

Punggol  by  commenting  about  him  too.  He  made

certain  statements  at the  Badminton  Hall  rally

referring to what I had done. Here again,  if  only

he had got his facts right. I would have nothing to

say. But I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



would  like him to keep making statements  in  this

Assembly,  have  them  on  record,  and  we   shall

challenge them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the Member for Aljunied was

indeed   pathetic.   Every  time   there   was   an

interruption,  it was just like the playing  of  an

old  gramophone record - not the modern one - where you

had  to  lift up the needle and if you put it  back

too  far  in  front, then you had  the  same  thing

played back a second or third or fourth time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say that the three expelled members

of  the People's Action Party could be regarded  as

cancerous  limbs  which  have  been  amputated  and

thrown  across to the Opposition for better or  for

worse.  The  People's  Action  Party  is  healthier

without these three cancerous fingers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Tanglin, I say that every

section of the Ministry of Education is active, not

just the Complaints Section. As the principal of  a

school  he  has the responsibility of administering

corporal punishment on naughty boys with a rod, but

if  he  chooses to maintain discipline  by  quoting

chapter and verse from the Bible and the boys still

remain  naughty, then evidently he has  not  prayed

hard  enough.  Only two aspects of  education  have

been left somewhat alone during the last year, i.e.

kindergartens and private schools, which only cater

for   a   small   minority  of   the   school-going

population,   being  13,000  in   all   (6,000   in

kindergartens  and  7,000 in  private  schools)  as

compared  with the large mass of 340,000 pupils  in

Government  and  Government-aided schools.  We  do,

however,  look  into  complaints  when  lodged   in

respect  of kindergartens and private schools,  and

we  shall reorganise these too, in good time,  when

the larger issues on education have been resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan raised the

question of religious education in Malay schools. I

wish  to  say that whatever religious education  is

being conducted in Malay schools it is going on  as

before: but the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



is having this subject under serious study and I am

not in a position yet to make a statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only natural that during a period of

reorganisation,  a  certain amount  of  unhappiness

will arise, especially from those accustomed to the

colonial  way of life and privileges, and who,  sad

to  say, are still living with "blinkers" on,  like

the  Member for Tanglin. The return to the five-day

week,  the  return of the variable allowances,  the

return  to the good old days of colonialism.  Fancy

the   suggestion  that  the  six-day  week  is  not

compatible with local climatic conditions!  Is  the

Member  for  Tanglin suggesting that  in  the  hot,

torrid climate of Singapore there should be just  a

one-day  week  so that teachers and principals  can

rest  for  the  next  six  days,  and  Sundays  for

prayers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I have never said that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> No, I am saying that the Member

might suggest it would be a wonderful Utopia.  Does

he  realise that in Japan, where the literacy  rate

is  almost 95 to 99 per cent, teachers have to  put

in  44 hours a week? To such people, the burden  of

nation-building, which would involve some  personal

sacrifice  on  their  part, must  appear  not  only

irritable  but  must be resisted with:  less  work.

Some have gone to the extent of resignation, but  a

number have since withdrawn their hasty letters  of

resignation  and gone back to their desks.  On  the

whole,  we  are  glad to see that the  majority  of

teachers  have come out well during this  difficult

year  of adjustment, and the outlook for the future

should  be good. If I may make an analogy, what  we

have  been able to achieve in education during  the

past  year was like changing the course of a  river

by  diverting  the waters through land,  previously

untouched by water, so as to irrigate it for useful

purpose and to find its proper outlet to sea  at  a

spot  we want it. In this process, those accustomed

to  drawing  their water from the old river  course

would  naturally grumble over their loss of supply,

whilst  others would resist and grumble over having

to give up their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



land  and  property which will now be under  water,

being  in the path of the new course of the  river.

It  is an accomplished fact that the course of  the

river of education has been changed and the scenery

is  different  as you course down  the  river.  The

foundations of the new educational policy have been

firmly  laid  and,  in  the  words  of  the   Prime

Minister, hereafter, even in education, it will  be

one of construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with the principle of equality for

the 4 streams of education, we have endeavoured  to

achieve uniformity so that ultimately we may evolve

a  single integrated system of education which will

retain  the  best  features to be found  in  the  4

streams of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniformity in structure has been initiated. For

the  first time, registration for the admission  of

an  estimated 52,000 children in all 4  streams  of

education is going on for 1961 Primary I admission.

Primary  education is now 6 years for all  streams.

When  we  took office it was 7 years for the  Malay

and  Tamil  streams. At the end of this  year,  the

first  Primary School Leaving examination in all  4

language  streams  will be held  for  an  estimated

32,000   children.  The  Primary   School   Leaving

examination  replaces  the  Government  examination

previously   known   as  the   Secondary   Entrance

Examination in the English stream, it will be noted

that  5,000  of  those  who  failed  the  Secondary

Entrance  Examination last year have been  admitted

to  special  post-primary schools  since  they  are

unable  to go into the ordinary secondary  schools.

It is the Government's aim to ensure that those who

are  not  inclined  towards  academic  studies   in

secondary  schools would be given a two-year  post-primary education with a vocational bias. Until the

proposed  Commission of Inquiry on  vocational  and

technical  education is set up which would  produce

the  plan of vocational training to be followed for

the  time  being, the course of education in  post-primary  classes  will be one of further  education

based  on  strengthening the knowledge of languages

and  learning the more practical aspects of  normal

school subjects. I wish to assure the many anxious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



parents, therefore, that those who fail  the

Primary  School Leaving Examination at the  end  of

this  year  will  have a place in our  post-primary

classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondary education is now a uniform four-year

period.  The Chinese stream, previously  on  a  3-3

year  structure, will be running the six  and  four

year basis during the transitory period until 1962.

For  the  first time in the educational history  of

Singapore,  secondary education in the  Malay  and

Tamil   streams   came  into  being   this   year.

Furthermore, the enrolment in our secondary schools

dramatically  increased by 30 per Cent  over  1959,

which  is  twice the average normal rate obtainable

in  past  years.  The Government has  in  mind  the

expansion  of  greater opportunities for  secondary

education  and more diversification into  technical

and commercial secondary education as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Government conducts the secondary

school  leaving examination for the Chinese  stream

only,  known  as the Government Senior  Middle  III

examination  (that  is, after a six-year  secondary

course). With the establishment, of a uniform four-year  secondary  education, it  will  be  necessary

before  long,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conduct   a

secondary  school leaving examination in  all  four

streams,  and  with this in mind,  an  Examinations

Syndicate  will  be  established  to  control   and

supervise   examinations  for  both   primary   and

secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, I appointed the Educational

Advisory Council and I am pleased to say to Members

of   the   House   that   numerous   teachers   and

educationists have put in considerable work  during

the  last  eight  months to  produce  eight  common

syllabuses which have since received my approval.







<br><br>They are: -

<pre>

           1.   Malay for Malay Primary schools;

           2.   Malay for Malay secondary schools;

           3.   Malay for non-Malay schools;

           4.   Chinese for Chinese primary schools;

           5.   Chinese for Chinese middle schools;

</pre>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



<pre>

           6.  Chinese for non-Chinese primary schools;

           7.  Chinese for non-Chinese secondary schools;

           8.  Tamil for Tamil schools.

</pre>



<br><br>Work continues apace and the fruits of their labour

will  be noted with gratitude by all of us in  this

responsible work of common content for schools; and

it  will be the task of educationists hereafter  to

spend  their time writing worthwhile textbooks  for

our  schools which will receive every encouragement

from both the Ministries of Culture and Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another way to achieve a single integrated

system of education, in time, would be to integrate

the different streams of education now and have  an

interchange  of qualified teaching staff  to  raise

the  standard of language teaching in  our  schools

besides  breaking down communal barriers.  We  have

made  a  start  at  integration  in  two  secondary

schools,  Bukit Panjang and Serangoon  Garden  High

Schools,  with the English and Chinese media.  Next

year,  we  will have no less than eight  integrated

primary  schools,  four with  English  and  Chinese

media,  and  another four with  English  and  Malay

media.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of sports, we have been able to

achieve encouraging results by the creation of  two

Joint  Athletic  Sports Councils, one  for  primary

schools   and  the  other  for  secondary  schools,

whereby  schools  of  the four language  media  are

being grouped into districts and activities held at

district and inter-district levels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising the special position of Malays, we

have   since  decided  on  the  policy  of  free

education  for Malays up to University level  which

will  in  the  long run ensure that their  economic

status  will  be  raised  to  the  level  of  other

communities in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Teachers' Training College is continuing to

play its vigorous role in providing the training of

thousands of qualified teachers to qualify  in  the

national  language, that is, Malay, and  the  Adult

Education   Board   is  also   making   its   great

contribution in the provision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



similar  facilities  for the  adult  population  at

night  literacy classes. As and when more  teachers

are  qualified to teach the national language, more

periods   would  be  set  aside  in,   the   school

curriculum for its study. In the meantime, priority

will be given to those studying at secondary school

or upper primary school level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have estimated that for the next four years,

1961 to 1964, we would require something like 4,300

teachers or a little over 1,100 teachers each year.

Of  these,  about  ten per cent would  have  to  be

graduates  for  the increased number  of  secondary

schools to be created hereafter. That is why it has

been   necessary  to  rationalise   the   Teachers'

Training  College and to introduce  a  single,  in-service  system of training to provide a three-year

course   for  primary  school  teachers  in   three

language media and a one-year course for University

graduates  in  two language media. One  interesting

innovation in the training of our teachers  at  the

T.T.C. is  the  inclusion of  a  political  study

course.  I  might mention at this  stage  that  150

principals of schools have gone through this course

of  whom  30 were from the Chinese middle  schools,

another 30 from the English primary schools, and 90

from the Chinese primary schools. More courses will

be  held during the course of the year and there is

no  question  of doubt that the principals  of  our

schools are beginning to appreciate the problems of

the  Ministry and will be giving their full-hearted

support  in  its difficult task. An Advisory  Board

has been formed and the T.T.C. is expected to make

its  maximum contribution in the important task  of

teacher-training. It is worthy  of  note  that  the

School of Education of the University of Malaya  is

giving its fullest support and co-operation in  the

work of the T.T.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polytechnic, which was reorganised soon after

the  new  Government took office, is  making  great

progress  and steps are being taken to ensure  that

its  diplomas  will  be  recognised,  not  only  by

Singapore but by adjoining territories as well.  We

shall  plan our vocational and technical  education

to   produce  the  thousands  of  semi-skilled  and

skilled workers who will be required to sustain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



the industrialisation programme which we intend  to

embark upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent announcement that the Singapore

Division of the University .of Malaya would  become

the University of Singapore by 1962, we now see the

healthy  development whereby a  genuine  effort  is

being  made to absorb those who come from the  non-English   secondary  streams   of   education.   We

understand  that the 78 who are being  admitted  to

the  pre-University  course  this  year  are  being

considered  as  a  "token" intake by  the  academic

authorities  of the University, and that  long-term

plans  are being considered for much larger intakes

from  1961  onwards. Only when  the  University  of

Singapore seriously absorbs the best products  from

the  secondary  streams  of education  existing  in

Singapore can it legitimately claim to be  a  truly

national institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned the important part played

by  the  Adult  Education Board (that  is,  Lembaga

Gerakan Pelajaran Dewasa) in the popularisation  of

Malay  as  the national language amongst the  adult

population. The vigorous manner in which the  Board

is   conducting  its  activities,  especially  its

recent further education classes on the history  of

Malaya  and  allied subjects, has created  a  great

impression.   To  the  many  thousands   who   have

volunteered  in the work of this great venture,  we

express  our deepest gratitude and look forward  to

the early eradication of illiteracy from our midst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten - who unfortunately is

not  in  the House - has tried to belittle the school

building programme of the new Government.  She  did

so  because  she  failed to understand  the  answer

given  by my Parliamentary Secretary for which  she

had  to depend on the translation facilities of the

House. For 1959, the school building programme  was

largely  frozen; the freeze for the first  half  of

the  year was the work of the last Government,  and

the  second  half of the year resulted  in  a  deep

freeze by the new Government in order to study  the

financial  position of the State. As  indicated  in

the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, a careful

estimate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



has been made of our requirements for the next five

years   which   will  be  made   known   when   the

Government's Five-Year Development Plan  is  tabled

in  this  House in the near future. We  envisage  a

school building programme of 19 schools each  year,

5  secondary  and 14 primary. The  Member  for  the

Southern Islands mentioned about building a  school

in  Blakang Mati. I should like to say that for the

present most of the school children at Blakang Mati

are  either attending school at Pulau Brani  or  on

the  mainland. However, a team of officials visited

Blakang  Mati  on  the 20th  July  to  see  to  the

possibility  of  erecting  a  school  which   would

provide  education  to  nearly  300  children;  100

Malays, 187 Chinese and 18 Indians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1960, $14.2 million has been earmarked for

building  new  schools.  Because  of  the  need  to

utilise  all  available sites,  which  are  scarce,

planning  work  is in progress for a new  standard-type  4-storeyed school. It is intended  also  that

school  halls  to be erected in our  new  secondary

schools  will have a ceiling height of 35  feet  to

accommodate three badminton courts to  be  used  at

one  time,  so  that our pupils can  improve  their

standard  of badminton with the ultimate hope  that

the  Thomas  Cup will return to Malaya as  soon  as

possible. There will also be a 6-storeyed school at

Silat  Road, and a 10-storeyed one at Selegie  Road

which  will probably be the tallest school building

in  Asia. We are planning this 10-storeyed building

to be ready for 1962 Primary I admission to take in

no less than 3,000 pupils on a two-session basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. Government does things, its impact

will  be  felt by the masses whose welfare  we  are

here  to  serve.  We do not expect  to  retire  and

become owners of iron mines, like a former Minister

for Education.



<br><br>6.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I rise to support the motion standing in  the

name of the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech by the Prime Minister, which opened

this debate, was a sober and objective analysis  of

the  situation  in  Singapore, which  it  would  be

foolish



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



to  ignore. All progressive-minded people can  have

only  one  preoccupation at the present  time,  and

that is, to preserve the unity and strength of  the

broad  political and social movement of the  people

led  by the P.A.P. Anything that is done to weaken

the   P.A.P. is  also  calculated  to  weaken  the

progressive  forces in our society. As a  socialist

Government,  the P.A.P. has always  maintained  and

upheld   the  basic  rights  of  the  workers.   No

socialist  government worthy of  the  name  can  do

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim, who has lately discovered

all  kinds  of  faults with the Party which  nursed

him,  has  seen fit to cast doubt on  the  P.A.P.'s

bona fides with regard to the trade union movement.

I  would merely point out that the Member for  Hong

Lim has never been one who has been associated with

the  trade union movement. Indeed, there is not one

single  trade union issue that the Member for  Hong

Lim  has  taken  up as a member of the  Party.  His

interest in "enlightened trade unionists" has  only

been of recent origin and for obvious reasons.  The

workers of Singapore will not forget that the Prime

Minister,  whom the Member for Hong  Lim  so  much

maligns today, has a far more distinguished record

of  service with the trade unions than anyone  else

in  the  P.A.P. He was adviser to 51  trade  unions

before he took office as Prime Minister. Unlike the

relationship of the Prime Minister with  the  trade

unions,  which was on an entirely ideological  and

non-professional basis, the Member for Hong Lim. I

believe,  has  audited  the  accounts  of  several

unions for a consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The socialist movement is a mass movement.

Therefore, it can only be successful on  the  basis

of  the heroism and sacrifice of the masses, not on

the basis of individuals. Collective leadership  is

one of the most essential requisites of success for

a  socialist  movement. Individuals of  overweening

ambition and pride can only do harm to the cause of

socialism.  The Member for Hong Lim pretends  today

that, with his 16 resolutions, he can cure all  the

ills  of our society. But he is not the doctor  who

will cure our ills. He is, in fact, the disease. It

is the disease of inflamed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



egoism   and   individualism,  which   periodically

afflicts  even  the  best  organised  of  socialist

movements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, everybody in Singapore knows that the trade

union    movement   in   Singapore   is    militant

and progressive. Can the Member for  Hong  Lim  now

point  to one single trade union leader of note  in

Singapore  who  would choose to  join  him  on  any

public platform? Indeed he cannot. And he knows the

reason why.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open democratic society the trade unions

cannot  be  expected to see eye  to  eye  with  the

Government  in all its tactics and priorities.  The

trade  unions are involved with the welfare of  one

section  of the community. They are concerned  with

the  problems of wages and conditions of employment

of  the  workers, whereas the Government  has  the

responsibility  for all sections of the  community,

be  they  workers  or not. There are  bound  to  be

differences  of emphasis between the  approach  of

the  trade  union  to a problem  and  that  of  the

Government.  This is natural and to  be  expected.

Even  in  the  best  of families,  differences  do

arise,   but   the  families  are  not  permanently

separated.  This sort of differences  over  tactics

and   emphasis  must  not  be  mistaken  as   being

differences  over  fundamentals.  There can  be  no

doubt  that  at the bottom there is  a  feeling  of

affinity and sympathy between the P.A.P. Government

and the trade unions. It must be clearly understood

that  the trade union movement is not part  of  the

Government,  but  organisations  with   their   own

functions and priorities. The charge that the trade

unions are part of the Government is often made  by

Members  of the Opposition, as they fail  to  grasp

the   reasons  for  the  comradeship  that   exists

between  the  P.A.P.  Government  and  the   trade

unions.  The comradeship that was forged  over  the

years  between the P.A.P. and the broad  sections

of the working class in the common struggle against

colonialism, makes certain of this close  affinity.

The  socialist party that makes the Government  and

the  trade  unions are but two wings of  the  same

progressive  movement. The working class  can  only

achieve its aims and aspirations in cooperation and

in conjunction with a left wing government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



Any  action, therefore, which is aimed at  dividing

the  Left-wing  government  from  the  workers   is

calculated  to  weaken the strength  of  the  whole

movement. And any person who is guilty of an action

that  will  weaken the power of the  working  class

ought  to  be condemned as an enemy of the  working

class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage it may be useful to draw the

attention  of  Members of this  House  to  a  Press

statement that the Singapore Trades Union  Congress

issued  on behalf of the trade unions in Singapore,

publicly registering their vigorous protest against

the  Government's action to de-register four  trade

union   organisations.  Sir,  I  repeat  that   the

differences between a socialist government and  the

trade  unions will only be on tactics and not  over

fundamentals  or  objectives. The Member  for  Hong

Lim,   who  did  not  understand  the  ideals   and

objectives  that  bind  the trade  unions  and  the

progressive  government into one force,  sought  to

exploit  this little misunderstanding. By including

the  re-registration  of  the  de-registered  trade

union   organisations,  he  hoped  to  become   the

champion of the trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Congress, Sir, issued a statement

on  the  unwarranted  championing  of  trade  union

interests  by  the  Member for  Hong  Lim.  It  was

published  in the Sunday Times of 10th July,  1960,

under  the  heading "TUC criticises Ong Eng  Guan."

Sir,  with  your permission, I would like  to  read

extracts from this statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`"We feel that in the present situation it is

incumbent  on  us to maintain left-wing  unity  and

distinguish  between  progressive  and  opportunist

forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish to state that we consider the present

P.A.P. Government a left-wing government."'



<br><br>The consolidation and safeguarding of the unity  of

the   socialist   movement  against   individualist

aberrations was only possible if the political  and

trade  union  wings worked in harmony.  It  is  the

joint responsibility in the Singapore situation for

both  wings  of the same movement  to  combat  any

manifestation   of  disruptive  individualism   and

opportunism. The Secretariat said that the  workers

were   capable  of  distinguishing  between  issues

raised by Mr Ong and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



Ong himself. As such, they "will not be confused by

the  opportunist tactics of Mr Ong."  It  declared

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` the TUC and leadership of the unions were

competent to safeguard the interests of the working

class    "without    outside    interference     or

championship."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the general elections the

S.P.A. were never tired of telling the  people  of

the  terrible  things  that  would  happen  in  the

industrial  field  should  the  P.A.P. form   the

government. This was their view of things  and  was

no  doubt created by their own experience while  in

government.  But  the analysis was  wrong  and  was

proved wrong. While the previous Government  was  a

right-wing Government, because of its own  policies

and   the  demand  of  its  supporters,  i.e.,  the

colonialists  and the capitalists,  it  could  only

hope  to  maintain  peace by naked  suppression  of

trade  unions. The trade unions were left  with  no

other  alternative  and had  to  resort  to  brutal

force.  The P.A.P. was then in a different position

entirely. It was the spearhead of the working class

movement,  and as such it enjoyed the  wholehearted

confidence  and  support of the workers  and  their

unions. The workers, when they voted in the P.A.P.,

approved of the P.A.P. policy of industrial  peace

with  justice,  and  believed that  only  a  P.A.P.

Government could ensure that justice was done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the past year of office of the P.A.P.

Government  will  show even to the  most  sceptical

person  that the workers' faith in this  Government

has  not been misplaced. Industrial peace has  been

maintained and it has been maintained with justice.

The  emphasis has been on justice. True, there have

been strikes, and there `will be strikes as long as

our country is under a democratic government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the setting up of the present T.U.C., Sir, a

united  front  of all sections of  the  workers  of

Singapore has been achieved for the first  time  in

the   history  of  the  trade  union  movement   of

Singapore.  This  unity  of  all  sections  of  the

workers - industrial, clerical and technical, Malays,

Chinese,  and Indians - has been achieved after  very

many years of struggle, and this achievement was in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



no   small  measure  made  possible  by  a   P.A.P.

government.  This  unity is only  possible  on  the

basis  of  adherence to the principles  and  ideals

which both the trade unions and the P.A.P. share in

common.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the trade union movements in the

neighbouring countries. In those countries we  find

the  trade union movements divided on the basis  of

race,  religion  and  political affiliations.  This

must  never  be allowed to be introduced  into  our

movement. Political alignments on the basis of pro-P.A.P., non-P.A.P. and anti-P.A.P. should never  be

introduced into our movement, for that will destroy

the united front of all workers in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I wish to emphasise that if

any  section of the trade union leadership attempts

to  take measures which will only benefit the  pro-Communists  but  which will be detrimental  to  the

interests  of  the  socialist movement,  then  that

section  must  bear  full  responsibility  for  the

harmful consequences to the workers of Singapore.



<br><br>6.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  support  the  Prime Minister's  motion  of

thanks  to  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for  the

policy  speech which he delivered on July  20th  on

behalf of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara pointed out in his

speech  that the P.A.P. Government in the past  one

year  placed emphasis on the work of reorganisation

of Government departments, the consolidation of the

relationship between the people and the Government,

and the preparatory work to implement the Five-Year

Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's policy

speech was not a proclamation of revolution and did

not  provide much "flavour" for those drunk in  the

stormy revolutionary type of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech dealt, in

simple  and calm term, with the objective  reality

of the small island in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



which   we   live - its   financial   and   economic

conditions, schools, port, housing, communications,

health,  social  welfare establishments,  etc.  The

speech  contained  neither empty and  boastful  nor

cold  and  fierce language. But is  there  anything

wrong with this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people handed us the responsibility of

government  not  with  the  wish  that   we   would

continuously   create  instability  and   stimulate

revolutions, but that we might find ways of opening

factories  to enable the unemployed to  find  work,

that  we  might  build  more houses,  schools,  and

hospitals  for  the poor in order to  better  their

lot,   and  that  we  might  provide  a  means   of

livelihood  for the island's 1½ million population.

The  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech reflected  the

Government's  actual  effort  towards  a  just  and

rational  society.  Is there  anything  wrong  with

this?  What reason is there for alleging  that  the

reduction  in  the number of anti-colonial  slogans

constitutes collaboration with the colonial  forces

in doping the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on 3rd August, when the Prime Minister proposed a motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his speech, he made a very

accurate  and  profound  analysis  of  the  present

political  situation in the State of Singapore.  In

my opinion, everyone who supports the P.A.P. should

study   carefully  and  deeply  his  speech   which

explains the political stand of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said by the Prime Minister about the

Communist  Party and the Left-wing  adventurers.  I

wish  to  make  some supplementary statements  here

based  on what I personally have understood from  a

study of the Prime Minister's speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, according to what I personally understand, the various points on the Communist

Party  and Left-wing adventurers found in the Prime

Minister's  speech are nothing but a  statement  to

the   world  that  the  P.A.P. is  an  independent

political force which does not depend on others for

its existence and which does not lend itself to  be

conveniently  controlled by the political  opinions

of other people. It has its own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



analysis  and understanding of the movement  for  a

merger  between  Singapore and the Federation,  and

for  a  breakaway from colonial rule, of the  fight

for  the  ultimate victory of Socialism in  Malaya,

and  of the problem of racial unity in Malaya, etc.

In  the  past, owing to the fact that the political

force   represented  by  the  P.A.P. was  one   of

patriotism,  socialism  and anti-colonialism,  many

people  regarded it as a companion to or a  pioneer

of the Communist Party; this is entirely wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether people like it or not, as an independent

political  force, the P.A.P., on all  matters,  has

its  own initiative and views which result  from  a

cool analysis of the present political, economical,

social, racial and other conditions in Malaya.  The

P.A.P. not  only refuses to follow other  people's

slogans, but it also has complete faith in sticking

to   its   own  course,  i.e.,  a  non-Communistic,

democratic,  socialistic course, so as to  shoulder

the responsibility of leading a social revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people thought that there was discrepancy in

the P.A.P.'s stand before and after its coming into

power.  I  think  this  is a wrong  concept.  These

people  erred either in not understanding the  non-Communistic,  democratic socialism, or  in  wrongly

regarding  individual talks in the  P.A.P. as  the

initiative and stand of the P.A.P. as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, everyone who pays attention to the situation in Asia knows that, as a non-Communistic,

democratic, socialist force, the P.A.P. now  faces

in  Singapore a complicated situation which is  not

easy  to  deal with. But the facts of the past  few

years  have  shown that, compared with  many  other

countries  in Asia, Singapore is most prominent  in

its  performance.  Democratic socialist  forces  in

many Asian countries are, being crushed by cold and

hard  reality. But no matter what the situation  in

other countries is, according to my observation and

understanding,   the  effort  of   non-Communistic,

democratic   socialists  in  Singapore   has   very

important significance and effect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, besides our Malay countrymen, there are the

English-educated and Chinese-educated classes. This

arose from the long colonial policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the English-educated class, the

responsibility of the non-Communistic,  democratic,

socialistic force lies in awakening them and urging

them  not to be enamoured of the colonial  era,  in

educating  them  to understand and sympathise  with

the  suppressed  class, and not to regard  all  the

spontaneous struggles of the suppressed class as  a

desire  of the Communist Party to engulf them.  The

non-Communistic, democratic socialists must  assure

them  that the State power shall not fall into  the

hands  of members of the Communist Party.  It  must

also  educate them to adapt themselves  voluntarily

to  the  colossal  social change, which  has  swept

across  the  whole  of Asia and Africa,  so  as  to

convert   themselves  into  upright   people   with

national pride.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the Chinese-educated class, the

responsibility  of the non-Communistic,  democratic

socialistic force is that of enlightening  them  on

the  objective reality of Malaya, so that they  may

appreciate  that heated slogans from foreign  books

of  revolution are not only unable to triumph  over

the  military suppression by the colonial rule, but

also  unable  to achieve the aim of  uniting  other

communal  groups.  The non-Communistic,  democratic

socialists want to convince them of the possibility

of  democratic constitutional struggle and to point

out  that  the method which is liable to result  in

long  social economic regression is not  one  which

can be used for social reform.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, some revolutionaries view the English-educated class as undesirable and think that they

should   all  be  cleared  out  of  the  government

departments.  But  the P.A.P.'s view  is  not  like

this;  we want to patiently educate them. We refuse

to discard or punish them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the eyes of some hysterical anti- Communists, all Chinese-educated non-Right-wing

social active elements should be gaoled. But again



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P.'s  view is not like this;  we  want  to

distinguish among them those who are not Communists

and  to channel their energy for the service  of  a

society capable of fostering racial harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-communistic, democratic socialism is a course

not  welcome to the colonialists and members of the

Communist  Party.  But  we  think  that,   in   the

realistic  environment of the present stage,  there

is  no  political  course  that  is  clearer,  more

rational and ultimately more acceptable to all  the

races in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. did not come out to govern without prior observation of the difficulties under

this new Constitution. Our Government under the new

Constitution differs greatly from the Lim Yew  Hock

Government under the Rendel Constitution.  The  Lim

Yew  Hock  Government under the Rendel Constitution

collaborated  with  the  British  Imperialists   in

deceiving  the people. The P.A.P. Government  under

the new self-rule Constitution wants to take a step

further   in   awakening  the  people's   political

consciousness and interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's General Election has entrusted to us

the   fate   and  livelihood  of  the  1½   million

population  for the next 5 years. This  is  not  an

easy  job.  If it were an easy matter to solve  the

problems  of employment, housing, schools etc. the

British  would not have felt it necessary to  grant

us self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the new Constitution is not an ideal one. Everybody knows this. However, since we have

decided  that  this is the right and forward  stage

and  that,  in this stage, we democratic socialists

can  effect  positive  and  progressive  historical

reaction,  we  really  have no  reason  to  arouse,

before  the  fixed  date  for  resumption  of   the

constitutional talks, a political storm which  will

not bring us favourable results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is not ignorant of our

election promises to the electorate. It is  a  pity

that he took up political work for the sole purpose

of  becoming  a  hero.  He has  not  the  slightest

understanding of the history and significance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



of the democratic, socialistic movement. He

may  be an outstanding conspirator; but I dare  say

that he will never become a helmsman of a political

movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last one or two months the Member for Hong

Lim  has  never  let  an opportunity  slip  without

describing  himself as an anti-colonial  democratic

vanguard.  He  may really hate the colonial  force;

but  I  think  a  person as lacking  in  the  group

concept  and as disobedient to the group discipline

as   he   is,  will  never  be  able  to  overthrow

colonialism.  In  spite of the  numerous  important

basic   differences  between  we   non-Communistic,

democratic socialists and members of the  Communist

Party,  there  is  one  point  on  which  we   non-Communistic democratic socialists should follow the

members  of  the Communist Party, i.e.,  the  group

concept and determination which enables the members

of  the  Communist Party to evolve  as  a  die-hard

fighting  force. If we do not, it will be difficult

for us to overcome the obstacles on the road ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before concluding my speech, let me say a word or two on the question of Nanyang

University mentioned by the Member for Hong Lim  in

his speech made in this House last week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his disciplinary judgment by the party, in

order to win over the people's sympathy and support

for  himself,  he  has degraded  himself  by  using

indiscriminate means. His picking up  the  question

of  Nanyang University for talking is, in  fact,  a

further   instance   which   reveals   his    usual

unprincipled behaviour. If the so-called  16  Party

and   country  saving  proposals  could  not   save

himself, it is futile now for him to catch hold  of

Nanyang  University  or other  questions  as  life-saving potions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that the question of Nanyang

University  is  not  a  simple  educational  issue.

Besides the question of expenditure, administrative

re-organisation   and   staff   relationships,   it

involves  the people's cultural concept and  inter-racial feelings. With the addition of the political

separation between Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



and   the   Federation,  the  question  of  Nanyang

University  has  become  even  more  complex.   The

solution  of  this  question depends  on  the  cool

deliberations  and discussions of those  concerned.

The  government  has reiterated its  stand  on  and

attitude  to  the  question of Nanyang  University,

i.e.,  it  will first and foremost look  after  the

interests  of  the Nanyang University students;  it

will  adopt  the same attitude of equality  towards

Nanyang  University, as it has adopted towards  the

various  racial streams of education, and it  hopes

to  see in the Nanyang University a university  for

Malayans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Upper Serangoon electorate let me support the Prime Minister's

motion of thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for

his  policy speech delivered on July 20th  in  this

House.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche M. Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche M. Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I thank His Excellency the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for reading the policy speech which,

I  have counted, runs to 24 columns. What impresses

me  most about the speech is that it shows that the

first year of the P.A.P. Government has been a year

of   administration.  It  is  up  to   the   P.A.P.

Government to strengthen the economic stability  of

the  State. However, the People's Action  Party  is

well  known  for its boldness in carrying  out  the

tasks  and responsibilities that have been left  to

it  by the previous Government. Mr Speaker, we all

know  that Christmas Island has been sold. However,

during  the past 14 months since the P.A.P. assumed

office,   the   economy  of  Singapore   has   been

strengthened.  But the Opposition views  this  with

jealousy.   This  is  because  the  Government   is

"berwang",  meaning, "the Government has  money  at

its  disposal". But the word "beruang" which has  a

similar phonetic sound, means "a bear" in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the Government, I say that at the

moment  the  Government is doing its best  for  the

people.  The  amendment  to  the  original   motion

relating to the restoration of the pay cuts, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



was  defeated yesterday, was moved just to confuse

the   people.   This  is  because   the   previous

Government  was in the past frightened into  hating

the  P.A.P.  But  the answer to this  is  that  the

P.A.P. is  well able to retaliate with the  "bear"

which  I have mentioned just now to the Opposition.

The P.A.P. mixes freely with the masses and has its

roots firmly embedded in them. The Opposition,  who

have  been  living in luxury, will quite  naturally

envy us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara relates

to  the second year of Government which will  be  a

year of "reconstruction". The scope of this term is

wide.  But  we, on the Government side,  comprehend

the term "reconstruction" as meaning that we should

work harder to safeguard and protect the State  and

its  people.  This  is  the responsibility  of  the

People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main theme of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech  is  to  get  the  people  to  realise   the

awakening  that has taken place in Singapore  where

even  small  children are proud  to  sing  "Majulah

Singapura".   We   are  awaiting   the   day   when

independence will dawn on us. With trust and  faith

in  each  other,  Singapore  will  positively  gain

independence through merger with the Federation  of

Malaya.  All this could be achieved by the  efforts

of the masses who must owe undivided loyalty to the

State,  but not by the efforts of those who try  to

split  the  people, and who would like to  see  the

exhortation  "Majulah  Singapura"  (let   Singapore

Flourish)   degenerate  into one  of  "Mundor-lah

Singapore" (Let Singapore decline).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we, on the Government side, call

on  the  people,  irrespective of class,  creed  or

colour  to  strive  together  to  attain  a  common

Malayan outlook. We know this is not an easy  task,

but  with  earnestness and confidence,  it  is  yet

possible  to achieve that goal. For the  past  five

years,    we   in   the   P.A.P. have   practised

understanding  and tolerance in our movement  which

is  supported by people of various races. And it is

by  virtue of this that we have been successful and

we are now holding the reins of government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intention is good, it is sure to be well

rewarded,  but if the aim is to destroy,  then  God

will not give it His blessing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitler's might was destroyed; and so was the might

of   the  Japanese  who  once  occupied  Singapore,

because their aims incurred the wrath of God.  From

what  I  have  said,  would you  say  that  we  are

Communists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our struggle is that of the people, and the P.A.P.

will  try to achieve what it has set out to achieve

within  five  years, not in one day.  It  is  quite

confident  of  its ability to do so.  Therefore,  I

fail to understand what purpose is achieved by  the

mere shouting of slogans now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are living in a modern age

and  the masses too are modern in outlook. In other

words,  they are wide-awake. They cannot  be  hood-winked. Ideally, the Government and the Opposition,

from whatever parties we come, should work together

for  the  benefit  of the people as  a  whole.  But

instead  the  Opposition merely  sing  praises  for

their  own Parties and have nothing worth while  to

show  to  the  people. Since the day the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  delivered his  speech,  they,  who

claim  to  be  the  leaders and, according  to  our

Indonesian  term,  "fathers" of  the  people,  have

merely  indulged in confusing the people.  We  are,

everyone of us, endowed with a brain, but  some  of

us have used the brain only to confuse the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, each member of the P.A.P. has

self-confidence, but we also place full  confidence

in  our collective leadership, unlike our erstwhile

colleague  who,  I regret, is now  sitting  on  the

other  side of the House, because, as a leader,  he

is  lacking in discipline. Our Party fully realises

that  our  collective  leadership  comes  from  the

people, and it works for the people. It is well  to

bear in mind that we have a term of five years.  As

elected  representatives of the people, whether  we

are on the government side or on the Opposition, we

should  work  hard  in mutual cooperation  for  the

benefit   of   the   people   in   our   respective

constituencies in all matters, from the smallest to

the  largest.  But  it is strange  to  see  certain

Members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



Opposition use all sorts of pretext to make appeals

here  in  the Assembly, whereas the matters  raised

could  satisfactorily be dealt with by the  various

government    departments    concerned.    If    no

satisfaction is obtained, they could be brought  up

to  ministerial  level. Only if  this  step  proves

ineffective should they then be brought here before

the  Assembly. It is true this Assembly is a public

forum  for  the people, but it is not a  Government

department.  Once again I would say,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that we, as elected representatives  of  tile

people, should each show our ability to the people.

But  the  words  we utter should be reasonable.  My

former  colleague, the Member for Hong Lim,  stated

that  the P.A.P. now is not the same as the  P.A.P.

in  former days. This is obvious even to  a  child.

For  formerly the hon. Member sat on the Government

side,  but now he and two others - what I would  call

"The Three Musketeers" - sit on the Opposite side  of

the  Government.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the

Members  who  are now in the Opposition  are  there

because our Party has no place for people who  have

no  discipline.  That  is why  the  three  are  now

sitting  yonder, on the other side. There  must  be

discipline in any household. To be strong, a  union

must  have  discipline. In a disciplined  political

set-up,   it   is   collective   leadership    that

strengthens the Party, welding it into  a  body  as

strong   as  steel  and  which  cannot  be   easily

destroyed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the two Members who have spoken

have  criticised the Prime Minister,  the  Minister

for  Finance and the Minister for Labour  and  Law.

This,  I say, is futile. For whatever is hurled  at

one  is  also hurled at all collectively. We cannot

go  forward together to achieve our aims so long as

there are elements who serve to confuse the people.

We all know that our former colleagues were loud in

their  criticisms  of the Lim Yew Hock  Government,

but  now  they are loud in their praise of the  Lim

Yew  Hock Government. And what is more, the praises

are  welcomed by the Member for Cairnhill,  for  he

set  his necktie right, turned round and smiled  in

acknowledgment. This is very significant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we know the aspiration of the Member for Hong Lim. "The desire of the heart is to

embrace  the mountain, but unfortunately  the  arms

are  not  long enough." In fact, not only  was  the

Member   for  Cairnhill  praised,  but   even   you

yourself,  Mr  Speaker, were complimented  by  the

Member for Hong Lim.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I had better remind the hon.

Member  that we are on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech, and the Standing Order says distinctly that

the  debate thereon - that is, on the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's speech - shall be confined to the policy  of

the Government. I do not know whether the policy of

the  Government  is  embracing  the  mountain,  but

perhaps the hon. Member could talk about the policy

of the Government from now on.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ismail Rahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I apologise, Sir. I

was touching on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech

on  the  matter of reconstruction. We human  beings

are  not  infallible. We should have  understanding

and,  as responsible people, we should not  try  to

show  how  good we are and how bad others are.  The

Opposition Members may themselves feel competent to

talk  about external affairs, but I would  like  to

talk   about  matters  concerning  the  people   in

Singapore.  I was a postman for 22 years,  and  for

ten  years  I  delivered letters to Government  and

City  Council  offices. I came  into  contact  with

people  of  low and high status. All  these  people

praise the P.A.P. for the wise action it has  taken

to  expel the three Members of the P.A.P. who  are

now  sitting  on the opposite side. They  wish  the

P.A.P. well. The three Members opposite  tried  to

teach us how to fight colonialism, but all we heard

were the names of G. G. Thomson, Meadows, Owen  and

another mentioned over and over again. Is it not  a

fact that we are the employers and pay the salaries

of those individuals? If they do anything improper,

we  would  certainly take appropriate action.  They

are  people  who  are competent  in  their  various

spheres of duties important to the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hong

Lim  would  like to bully Meadows. The  Member  was

then  Minister for National Development, and I  was

attached to that Ministry, and therefore I know. On

one occasion, Meadows and a number of us went to an

island.  He carried wood and did manual  work  with

others  and  his clothes were torn. Were  we  doing

prison labour? No, we were doing voluntary work. So

by  such  bullying tactics, perhaps the Member  for

Hong  Lim  hoped  that  Mr  Meadows  would  resign

without  getting  any  benefits  whatever.  It  was

because of this that Mr Meadows was transferred to

the  Prime Minister's Ministry. Is this the way  to

fight  colonialism which the Member  for  Hong  Lim

bragged about when bringing up his 16 resolutions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Aljunied talked about the increase of tax on petrol. If we wish to merge

with  the  Federation, where the  price  of  petrol

costs  $2.00  a  gallon, it is not right  that  our

price here should remain at $1.50. So if we wish to

be  of  equal status, let the taxes be at the  same

level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter raised concerns cigarettes, about

which  the Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister

for  Finance  also had something to say.  I  myself

smoke "Pigeon" brand cigarettes, three packets  per

day. I pay tax to the Government when I smoke them.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was wondering whether it

would   be   correct  for  the  Speaker  to   allow

advertisements!



<br><br><!-- Inche Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ismail Rahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I apologise again,

Mr  Speaker,  for  I  am still  at  the  stage  of

learning. On the question of evading tax,  I  think

formerly I talked for 5 minutes but now I am taking

a  longer time, to evade tax is easy. I myself have

with  me now leaf-cigarettes not in order to  evade

paying  tax but in order to economise. But  if  the

hon. Member opposite wishes to avoid paying any tax

at all, I would advise him to take to chewing betel

leaf instead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, I on this side of the House share

the  views  of  the  Government. There  is  another

thing, Mr Speaker, Sir, which I would like to  say

before  I  end my speech. Although I  look  at  you

while I am speaking, actually I am reading what  is

before  me.  But I say this - this is my  own  speech

which I wrote myself. I noticed that the Member for

Aljunied  too  read  his  speech,  page  by   page,

prepared  by the Member for Hong Lim, when  dealing

with the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.



<br><br>7.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is a well-known fact that one  can

record brainwaves, and what is curious is that  the

brainwave  pattern  of a beetle is  identical  with

that   of   a  human  brain-wave.  But  there   the

similarity  ends.  A beetle on a table  cloth  sees

only  the threads, but it does not see the  pattern

or  the picture that is woven into the table cloth.

A  beetle that walks on a ceiling wonders why it is

the only creature right side up and the rest of the

world  is  upside down. And there are people  whose

minds  are  like  that  of  the  beetle - narrow  and

circumscribed. So it is, after listening to Members

sitting  on the Opposition Benches, that  I  cannot

help but feel that there are beetles in this House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Hon. the Leader of

the  House is anticipating that he would be  pulled

up,  because  to  liken Members to  beetles  is,  I

think,  perhaps unparliamentary. And as  Leader  of

the House, he ought to give some lead as to what is

parliamentary or not.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if you deem that

is  unparliamentary, well, I  do  withdraw.  May  I

substitute then that there are - may I repeat? - people

who are beetle-minded?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite rightly, Sir, the task of the Opposition is

that  of criticism, but during this debate  on  the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech, we have witnessed

the Members sitting on the opposite side going on a

rampage  of  destruction. There are two  sides  to

every person - the God in him and the devil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



in  him,  the ego and the id, the positive and  the

negative,  the  constructive and  the  destructive.

Rogue  elephants are known to invade  kampongs  and

destroy  what man has built and cultivated.  Tigers

become man-eating when they reach the age of decay.

Sir, it is very easy to destroy, but it takes years

of sacrifice, suffering and sweat to build even the

little that we have.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day that this Assembly House turns into a

place  where  representatives of the people,  using

the  privilege  of  free speech  in  the  Assembly,

uninhibitedly  give  free rein to  the  destructive

side  of  their nature, then on that very day,  the

respect  which the people themselves give  to  this

Assembly will turn to ridicule and contempt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All leaders, especially leaders in the political

field, have a responsibility not only to themselves

but  also to the community and the society in which

they live. If political leaders were to take action

only  on impulse and not calculate the consequences

of   their  actions  then  there  can  result  only

confusion and chaotic disorder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an animal which lives within the

Arctic  Circle. This species is called the lemming.

Its   zoological  name  is  Lemmus-lemmus.  It   is

described  as a small mouse-like rodent about  five

inches  long. It is a peculiar creature because  it

is  dominated always by an impulse to  get  moving.

You  find the lemmings, in their thousands,  always

move downhill towards the sea. The lemmings advance

regardless  of  all  obstacles, answering  only  to

their  own  impulse, swimming streams and meanwhile

committing  considerable devastation in their  line

of  march.  Finally, the lemmings reach the  cliffs

with the sea below. The leading lemmings jump  off

the cliffs onto the rocks or into the sea. Hundreds

of  other  lemmings follow; they plunge  themselves

into  the  sea and so a generation of  lemmings  is

drowned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irresponsible political leadership is like the

lemming. It would not matter so much if the impulse

for  self-destruction  were  confined  only  to   a

person, but usually a political leader does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



destroy  only himself. He also drags down with  him

to   destruction  others  as  well.   When   Hitler

committed suicide, he did not just destroy himself.

He  also,  in the process, destroyed the  lives  of

millions of unknown soldiers and civilians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish, Mr Speaker, to dwell upon the

negative  aspects of this debate. It  is  fruitless

and a waste of nervous energy which can be deployed

into more useful and creative purposes. But let all

those who aspire to be demigods, remember:



<pre>

 'The  evil that men do, lives after them,

 The good is oft interred with their bones.'

</pre>



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, let me pass on. It has been said that the  sublime is related to the ridiculous, and  the

ridiculous   is   related  to  the   sublime.   The

ridiculous is only one shade above the sublime, and

the sublime is one shade above the ridiculous. I am

quite sure, Mr Speaker, that in your many years of

enough in this Chamber to bear that statement  out.

And  over  the  past few days,  we  have  seen  the

ridiculous and the sublime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two main tasks of government.

Sometime  last year in the debate on the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's  speech, I had occasion  to  say,

which is reported in Hansard, Vol. 11, No. 3,  col.

120, that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are two basic general problems which we

face. First is one of nation building. Second,  the

conversion  of  our existing economy  from  a  non-productive one to productive one.'



<br><br>Those  two  tasks were the tasks of the  Government

last  year.  They are still the tasks of Government

this  year,  and they will still be  the  tasks  of

Government  for  the next ten years.  The  task  of

nation   building  goes  hand  in  hand  with   the

development    of    political    consciousness - the

development  of  consciousness or of  duty  and  of

responsibility   to   a   Malayan   society.    The

consciousness of belonging to a Malayan society  is

relatively new. It was barely evident, a few  years

ago. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, one-third  of  the  people  living  in  Singapore   are

immigrants.  Secondly, the variety  of  educational

and cultural backgrounds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



Where then do we start the task of nation building?

The  base  upon which we have to build  the  nation

must lie on the young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore for this reason that the Work

Brigade was established to absorb our young  people

to impart to them the consciousness of belonging to

our  Malayan  society, and to impart  to  them  the

consciousness of building and creating. It would be

a   mistake  if  we  were  to  neglect  the   older

generation, and therefore the community centre  was

reorganised.  The  organisation  of  the  community

centre was so directed that the older generation as

well as the young could be drawn to participate  in

the activities at a community centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill today sees only a

Frankenstein in every organisation - the T.U.C.,  the

Work  Brigade, and the community centres. He should

include the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides  in  his

place.  It  is a pity that he sees his surroundings

only in monochrome and not in technicolour. And the

one-coloured vision is not only dull, but incapable

of fine resolution of details. I have said that the

Work  Brigade and the community centres are devoted

to the task of nation building. And any group which

seeks to abuse that purpose will be severely rapped

on the knuckles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has dwelt at length on

fighting   the   Communists.  In  a   parliamentary

democratic system, we have to accept the fact  that

competition   between  different  ideologies   will

always  exist  and must be allowed to exist - between

Conservatives, Liberals, Democrats, Socialists  and

Communists.   But  there  is  one   rule   of   the

competition which must be observed. If our  society

is   based   on  the  acceptance  of  parliamentary

democracy, then the rules of the game, as  observed

in  the Constitution, must be adhered to. We cannot

have  in  the  boxing  ring one  boxer  who  adopts

Queensberry  rules - he is told that he cannot  punch

his  opponent  below the belt - and the  other  boxer

using  the tactics of Siamese boxing, who not  only

uses his fists but his legs as well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



And  the  boxer  who adopts Queens-berry  rules  of

boxing is punched, and in next to no time he is hit

not  only  on  the jaw but he gets a  kick  in  the

bottom as well!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago when the Labour Front Government

took  office  the reserves were $322  million.  But

five  years  later, in 1959 - the first year  of  the

P.A.P.  Government - these reserves had gone down  to

only $87 million. And on top of this discovery  was

the other discovery that in 1959 the Government was

heading for a deficit of $14 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were ample funds for the last Government to

deploy  for  development. In fact, they  used  over

$235  million  of the reserves. We do not  question

that  the last Government has not carried  out  any

development, but what we ask is how much have  they

got  to  show  for  the amount of money  spent?  We

maintain  that, given the same flourishing economic

conditions  which  the  post-Korean  War  boom  had

endowed the rubber industry in particular and trade

in  general, the P.A.P. Government can achieve much

more than what previous Governments have done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten went to great lengths

to  repeat  that  in 1955, the first  year  of  the

previous    Government,   6,734   dwellings    were

completed. Mr Speaker, I have no doubts about  the

personal charm of the Member for Mountbatten, but I

would  like to warn the House not to be deluded  by

her   figure.  The  figure  of  6,734  was  housing

provided  from three sources, namely, the Singapore

Improvement  Trust,  private enterprise  and  those

public  authorities which built quarters for  their

staff.  Half of these buildings completed  in  1955

came from the private sector which was enjoying the

post-Korean  War  boom.  The  contribution  of  the

S.I.T. was only 2,907 units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Point of information, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Hansard

will show that what I said was 6,734 built under

the previous Government, and 2,907 built by

Government.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Members of the Opposition have

been   critical  of  the  fact  that   the   P.A.P.

Government, in its first year of office,  has  done

little in the way of housing development. Since the

Member  for  Aljunied yesterday  claimed  that  the

buildings  put  up by the Housing  and  Development

Board  today are due to the Malayanisation  efforts

of the former Minister for National Development,  I

am   obliged,   on  behalf  of  the   Housing   and

Development  Board, to place certain  facts  before

this House. During the six months term of office of

the   Member  for  Hong  Lim  as  Chairman  of  the

Singapore Improvement Trust, work commenced on only

821 units. In the six months since he ceased to  be

Chairman,  the  Housing and Development  Board  was

formed, and under its direction, work was commenced

on   2,729   units.  The  slowness - admittedly   the

Government  was slow in getting housing development

to  start - was  due  to the depletion  of  technical

staff and the haywire changes in building plans.  A

total of 79 monthly-rated staff left the service of

the  S.I.T. They were dismissed, or they  resigned,

or  they  retired. And of these 79, 22 were  senior

officers, five being heads of departments and  five

were heads of sections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders for two phases for the Tiong Bahru fire

site  development  were  submitted  to  the  former

Minister for consideration in June 1959. These were

turned down, and instructions were issued for fresh

plans  to be drawn up to substitute communal  units

for  self-contained flats. On this new instruction,

a revised lay-out was produced, but again there was

a change of mind. Plans had to be drawn up all over

again, and eventually only 280 communal units  were

included  in  the  development.  Because  of   this

indecision and frequent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



changes  of mind of the former Minister, these  two

contracts were not officially approved for  letting

until  November 1959 and January 1960, a  delay  of

over five months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the Member for Hong Lim was a member of

the  Government, we, the Government, had  to  admit

liability  for  his mistakes. And as  a  collective

body  we have to accept responsibility for the fact

that our housing development programme has not  got

off to a fine start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board was constituted in February 1960

and  one of the first things it did was to  make  a

thorough study of the housing problem in Singapore,

it was estimated that to solve the existing housing

problem,  at least 14,000 dwelling units  per  year

should be built for the next 10 years. For the last

12  years,  from  1948 to 1959, a total  of  46,918

permanent dwelling units were completed,  of  which

43  per cent were built by the former S.I.T., while

38 per cent were constructed by private enterprise,

and  the  remainder 18 per cent by  Government  and

other  public  authorities.  The  former  Singapore

Improvement Trust built on the average 1.700  units

per  year,  and  during its best year  in  1958  it

constructed  3,841 units. To overcome  the  housing

problem a big leap must be made from the average of

1,700  units per year to at least 10,000 units  per

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has drawn up a Five-Year building

programme to provide some 52,842 units costing $230

million  within  the  next five  years.  When  this

programme is completed, it is anticipated that  the

critical  housing shortage will be  greatly  eased.

The programme is in implementation of the policy of

Government  to bring housing within  the  means  of

those  in lower-income groups least able to  afford

suitable living accommodation and whose needs  will

not be catered for by private enterprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Five-Year building programme concentrates

building  mainly in the City limits, in Queenstown,

MacPherson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



Road,  Kampong  Tiong  Bahru, Alexandra  Road,  St.

Michael's  Road,  Kallang, Toa  Payoh  and  certain

central urban districts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present 4,720 units are under construction, of

which  1,800 units will be completed at the end  of

this year, while 7,000 or more will be completed at

the end of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with our policy of observing the

special rights of the Malays, I would like  to  say

that  special  preference is being given  to  Malay

applicants  who  apply  for housing  built  by  the

Housing and Development Board. Two extra points are

given  to  each Malay applicant under  the  present

points system of allocation. At present, there  are

altogether  3,928 Malay families living  either  on

the Housing Board estate or in Government quarters.537 Malay applicants

are now on the waiting list of

the  Housing and Development Board, and we can give

an  assurance to them that their applications  will

be treated with due consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increasing development of built-up areas,

the   flood  problems  in  Singapore  have   become

increasingly  serious year by  year.  Briefly,  the

problems   of  flood  alleviation  deal  with   the

drainage of the following catchment areas:-

<pre>

                 Sungei Bedok and Ketapang;

                 Geylang River Catchment;

                 Singapore River and Sungei Ulu Pandan;

                 Bukit Timah and Stamford Canal;

                 Jurong River;

                 Sungei Whampoa, Sungei Kallang and Sungei Seletar;

                 Sungei Api Api and Tampines.

</pre>

<br><br>Of  these  seven  schemes, only  the  Sungei  Bedok

scheme has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Geylang flood prevention scheme is now two-thirds completed. Final stages will consist of the

construction of two main drainage channels  running

through Geylang Serai and Kampong Ubi.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore River and Sungei Ulu Pandan scheme

is also under construction. This scheme is designed

to  deal  with  flooding in the  catchment  of  the

Singapore  River with particular reference  to  the

Alexandra area from Delta Circus up to Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research will be made on the diversion of flood

waters from the Bukit Timah canal. One proposal  is

to  divert  the water from the canal  near  Holland

Road   southwards  through  tunnels   into   Sungei

Bangkong. This plan has certain merits in that land

acquisition  will not entail taking  much  valuable

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sungei Api Api is now being widened by the

Work Brigade for 2½ miles, and a tidal gate will be

constructed at the outlet of the river to keep  out

the  tide,  which  at present inundates  the  whole

downstream  area  at  every high  tide.  When  this

scheme  is completed in the next six months,  1,800

acres  of  the  Tampines area will be  relieved  of

floods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there are a number of other schemes

being  prepared,  to be carried  out  by  the  Work

Brigade.  These include two schemes in  the  Jurong

area,  one in the Malay Settlement off Jalan  Eunos

and  another for the main drain running North  from

Bukit Panjang into Sungei Pang Sua.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the City area, work has been going on in Nelson

Road  and in Orchard Road for the last year.  These

two  schemes will be completed this year.  In  this

year's  budget we have funds for schemes  at  Pasir

Panjang, the area between Bartley Road and Playfair

Road. All these will be completed in 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side by side with housing development and the

creation of industrial estates, more roads have  to

be  built. The expenditure on road works each  year

is  of  the  order of $10 million. At  the  present

time,   the  Roads  Section  is  engaged   on   the

construction of new Link Roads:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Between Jurong Road and Chua Chu Kang;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Between West Coast Road and Jurong Road;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Between Braddell Road and Serangoon Garden

Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure on agricultural track

construction  and  kampong road  construction  will

amount to half a million dollars this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further big programme for the erection of over

100 bus shelters throughout the Island has recently

been approved, and up to $200,000 will be spent  on

this work this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are about 30,200 people engaged in farming

and  fishing in Singapore. Although the  number  is

small, their production is considerable. This group

of   workers   annually   produce   750,000   pigs,

204,000,000   eggs,  18,500,000  fowls,   480,000

gallons  of milk, 34,000 tons of vegetables,  1,800

tons of fruit, 340 tons of tobacco and 11,300 tons

of fish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are interesting figures and they show

that,   given  the  opportunity, facilities,   the

correct  environment, our people can  devote  their

energies to productive work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25,000 farmers in Singapore now occupy about

16,500  acres  of  land  for  the  cultivation   of

vegetables  and  the rearing of livestock.  Another

19,000   acres  is  used  for  rubber  and  coconut

plantations.  Expansion  in  farming,  however,  is

limited  because  of  the  shortage  of  land;  and

further  settlement on land is curtailed since  the

use  of marginal land for agriculture must give way

to  more economically productive uses such  as  for

industry  and  housing.  Any  further  advance  and

progress  in  agriculture, animal  husbandry,  etc.

must therefore be qualitative. It is the policy  of

the  Government to assist farmers, and this  policy

must  be  based on teaching new techniques  to  the

farmers   so   that  their  output   will   improve

quantitatively as well as qualitatively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation to give farmers better

security  of tenure means that in those areas  best

suited   for   agriculture  and  animal  husbandry,

farmers should be given long leases and so have the

assurance   that  they  will  not  be  evicted   or

disturbed  for the period of the lease.  The  areas

are mainly those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



marked   in  the  Master  Plan  as  suitable   for

agriculture as well as other isolated pockets. The

ultimate use of marginal lands, i.e., those  which

have   poorer   soil   and   which   have   lesser

agricultural  economic  value,  must  be   weighed

ultimately  between the needs of  agriculture  and

other  more productive uses, such as industry  and

housing.   Eventually, however,  in  "land-hungry

Singapore" only good land can be reserved for long

leases. On such suitable land, long leases will be

of benefit to farmers and would provide inducement

for  more  improved farming techniques.  In  those

areas  which  have to give place  to  industry  or

housing, provision of compensation along the lines

of  the present Government scheme is to be written

into  the  new legislation. This legislation  will

come  before the Assembly in due course. It is  in

this  manner that this Government will ensure that

the interests of the farmers are protected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will assist vegetable gardeners by

using  tractors to help them plough  the  land  in

preparation for planting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme to assist the fishermen is now being

studied  and  it  is intended to hire  at  nominal

charge   outboard  diesel  motors.   A   fisheries

training scheme for boys living in the rural areas

will  also be conducted. In order to assist  Malay

fishermen  living  in  the  Southern  Islands   to

supplement   their  income,  the   Government   is

considering a scheme to distribute female goats to

them for rearing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now come to eggs and egg laying. It is a

pity  that the Member for Joo Chiat is not present

this  evening. It is presumed that he is having  a

busy  time with his hens. Sir, the Member for  Jon

Chiat  is no chicken in the political field. After

all,  he  was  one of the founder Members  of  the

Labour  Front. The Member for Cairnhill will  bear

me out. We are glad that after a year's silence he

has made his maiden speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All farmers know that when a hen has laid an

egg,   it   announces  the  event  with  quite   a

tremendous  amount  of  fluttering  of  wings  and

clucking,  a sort of maiden speech in the  poultry

world. It is true



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



that some white Leghorns do lay more than 200 eggs

per  year,  but these are champion  birds.  The

average white Leghorn lays 180 eggs per year,  but

after some time of residence like expatriates in a

tropical   climate,  their  egg-laying  propensity

diminishes,  because they cannot get acclimatised.

No  doubt the chicken is not as good as the mother

hen, and it is no use, Sir, laying eggs which  are

not  in popular demand. White Leghorn eggs do  not

sell  readily in the local market for some  reason

or other. Because they cannot sell their eggs, the

farmers  themselves show no enthusiasm  for  white

Leghorn   egg-layers.   The  Government   research

station at Sembawang has succeeded in producing  a

crossbreed that will lay 180 eggs per year. It  is

twice  the  output of the local fowl.  These  eggs

fulfill  the  local demand for colour and  flavour

and, therefore, find a ready market. Moreover, the

new  strain  is  smaller than the Leghorn  or  the

Hampshire. It costs less to rear them and, at  the

same time, they are productive for their size. But

egg-laying, Mr Speaker, is not only a science. It

is  also  an  art. The Member for Joo  Chiat  will

confirm  this.  The pullets of  hens  have  to  be

persuaded to increase the production of eggs.  One

way  of  coaxing the hens to lay more eggs  is  to

keep  them in artificial daylight, sort of  making

them  work overtime. But there are some hens which

will  just not lay at all, unless there  are  male

birds or cockerels around to coax them. Even  hens

have their vanity. The Member for Jon Chiat claims

to  produce  280  eggs  per  year.  Sir,  that  is

something   to   cluck  about.  He   is   in   the

championship class. We do not know how he  manages

it,   but  the  Government  research  station   at

Sembawang  would very much welcome  his  services,

and experimental hens at the station will no doubt

look  forward to a demonstration from  the  Member

for Joo Chiat.



<br><br>7.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  I  wish to draw  attention  to  the

speech of the Member for the Southern Islands, who

has   said  that  he  views  with  suspicion   the

Government led by the People's Action



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



Party. Mr Speaker, he says the reason is that  the

People's  Action Party, which holds  the  reins  of

Government,  is  not  positive  in  its  stand   on

colonialism  and  its action against  Communism  is

negative.  What does that mean? Is the  Member  for

the Southern Islands suggesting that we be positive

to  the extent that we could use aeroplanes to drop

bombs,   rifles  and  other  weapons?  It  is   not

necessary for us to wait until the Member  for  the

Southern   Islands   has  faith   in   the   P.A.P.

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the past, the Member for the Southern Islands has often mentioned the Malays, so

that  they  would hate the P.A.P. But  this  method

which  he  has adopted in the past was  a  failure.

This  time,  by using a new tactic to besmirch  the

People's  Action Party, which holds  the  reins  of

Government,   by  using  a  phraseology   such   as

"suspicion  and not positive in its action  towards

Communism", he hopes it will mislead the Malays and

the people of Islam so that they will be influenced

by  him.  However, this time, the Malays, including

the  people  of  Islam and other  races,  will  not

believe him, because the P.A.P. has made efforts in

the  religious  field and in matters affecting  the

Malays, whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



they  be  in  the Southern Islands or not.  Efforts

have also been made to provide them with houses, as

mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister. I hope that

the  Malays  and the Muslim people will not  follow

the  advice  or  take the attitude  that  has  been

adopted  by  the  Member for the Southern  Islands,

because  if  we  do so, the Malays and  the  Muslim

people themselves will stand to suffer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in addition, I would like to touch a little on matters which have become heated over the

past months. They concern the 16 resolutions put up

by the Hong Lim Branch of the P.A.P. and which were

raised here by the Member for Hong Lim, Mr Ong Eng

Guan.  At  the  conference of the  People's  Action

Party, he was not satisfied to let the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

Resumption of debate tomorrow?
