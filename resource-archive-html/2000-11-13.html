<div align="center"><b>(Preliminary report)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology if he will  provide

a  preliminary report on the causes of the crash of the  ill-fated  Singapore  Airlines flight SQ 006 in  Taipei  on  31st

October 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology when he expects the

investigation of the crash of flight SQ 006 at Taipei  to  be

completed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have

your permission to answer Question Nos. 1 and 2 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> First, let me express on behalf of

the  Singapore  Government,  our deepest  sympathies  to  the

families and friends of those who were affected by the  crash

of flight SQ 006. The Government is indeed deeply saddened by

this  tragic  accident. I will now update the  House  on  the

progress  of the investigations. The Aviation Safety  Council

(ASC)  of  Taiwan  is  leading the  investigations  into  the

accident, with the support of experts from the USA, Singapore

and Australia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



The  investigators will determine the cause of  the  accident

and  recommend  measures to prevent future  occurrences.   As

Members already know, preliminary findings revealed that  the

aircraft had taken off from the wrong runway, 05R, instead of

the designated 05L.  Investigators are trying to find out how

and why this happened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, the investigator-in-charge, Dr Yong Kay of

the Aviation Safety Council of Taiwan, has indicated that the

investigators would need to gather all factual  data  and  do

the  necessary analysis. He has indicated that it would  take

about a year to complete the investigation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

ask  the  Minister what is the prospect of our  three  pilots

facing prosecution by the Taiwanese government?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the Taiwanese authorities have

stated that they would let the investigations continue before

deciding what to do.

<div align="center"><b>HAND, FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Update on outbreak)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Acting Minister for the

Environment if he will (i) give an update on the outbreak  of

the  hand,  foot  and mouth disease; (ii) state  whether  the

disease  is  under control; and (iii) inform what  precaution

his  Ministry  will take to avoid similar  situation  in  the

future.

<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Senior Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik Sidek bin Saniff) (for the Acting Minister for the Environment):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hand, foot and mouth disease

(HFMD)  is a common mild childhood disease. Very rarely  does

it  result  in  deaths.   However, on  the  morning  of  30th

September,  two  siblings aged one and two died,  within  two

hours  of  each other.  Upon notification that  morning,  the

Commissioner of Public Health immediately activated the  Task

Force that was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



formed  two years ago following the outbreaks of HFMD in  the

region in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force recommended the closure of all pre-schools effective from 2nd October. The objective was to

isolate  the  children and protect them from contracting  the

disease.  The  Minister  for  the  Environment  accepted  the

recommendation. The directive went out immediately to all the

pre-schools on the same day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quick and decisive action by the Government,

together  with  the  concerted efforts of  the  public,  pre-schools,  media  and employers proved to be effective.  I  am

pleased  to  report to the House that the outbreak  has  been

brought  under control. The number of reported cases per  day

reached  a peak of 258 on 4th October, and declined  steadily

to  9  on  31st October. All pre-schools have reopened  since

16th October. The situation is now back to normal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the multi-agency task force, I would like

to  take this opportunity to thank the parents and members of

the public, pre-school and kindergarten teachers, doctors  at

the  Kandang Kerbau Women and Children Hospital, the National

University  Hospital,  the  Singapore  General  Hospital  and

doctors  in private practice, affected employers, and various

Government  agencies  for  their understanding,  support  and

cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HFMD is spread through close contact among children. The

most  effective  measure to prevent future  outbreaks  is  to

maintain a high standard of hygiene in pre-school centres and

at  home.  Parents and teachers also need to remain vigilant,

and  keep  infected  children away from other  children.  The

multi-agency   task   force  will  continue   to   strengthen

guidelines  relating  to  hygiene  standards  and  sick   bay

operations to prevent future outbreaks as much as we can.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, is the Minister

confirming that we have completely eliminated or at least  we

have brought it down to the level that it was at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



the  previous  outbreak  status in terms  of  the  number  of

children contracting the disease?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of precaution, is the Minister saying that just

cleanliness  and hygiene is an issue or can we actually  take

other  medical  precautions  to  prevent  our  children  from

contracting this disease in the first place?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Acting Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, the hand, foot and mouth disease is an endemic

disease, ie, it is there all the time.  Last year, before  we

imposed  the  compulsory reporting of HFMD, we had  about  25

cases  a week.  During the recent outbreak, it went up to  as

high  as 258 cases per day.  Since then, it has come down  to

about  10 cases per day.  10 cases per day will work  out  to

about  70 cases per week.  It would appear to be still higher

than the 25 cases per week last year.  However, there was  no

compulsory  reporting  last  year  whereas  today  there   is

compulsory reporting.  Our assessment is that at 10 cases per

day, we are now back to the normal situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh also asked whether beyond cleanliness,

is  there a medical solution.  Sir, at this moment, there  is

no  medical  cure  to the hand, foot and  mouth  disease,  in

particular,  the  EV71  virus.   There  is  also  no  vaccine

available.   However, I want to highlight that  when  we  say

"there is no cure", it does not mean that every child who has

contracted the disease will face the danger of death.   As an

illustration, in the outbreak in Taiwan, there were about 1.4

million  cases and over 70 death cases, ie, one casualty  out

of  20,000 cases.  I want to emphasise that there is no  need

for  the  public to be alarmed that the hand, foot and  mouth

disease is there all the time.  What is important is  for  us

to continue to take measures to reduce the number and to keep

it  to  as low as possible, bearing in mind that this disease

is, generally speaking, not harmful.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the Minister

whether, for the control

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



of  the disease spread, child care centre operators are being

facilitated  by  his Ministry on correct maintenance  of  the

child  care  centres  and  on the  proper  screening  of  the

students in the centres?  May I also ask whether there  is  a

new  protocol  for  vigilance and pro-active  closing  of  an

infected centre to curb the disease spread and also  avoid  a

nation-wide closure of the child care centres in the future?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are two types of

pre-school  centres in Singapore.  They are the kindergartens

and  the  child  care centres.  The child  care  centres  are

licensed by the Ministry of Community Development and  Sports

(MCDS)  and  the kindergartens by the Ministry of  Education.

Both  types  of pre-school centres are subjected  to  hygiene

guidelines   issued  by  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment,

Ministry  of Education and MCDS.  In fact, the last  time  we

updated  our guidelines was in March this year.  As a  result

of the recent outbreak, the Task Force has decided to further

update  the  guidelines.  A new set  of  guidelines  will  be

issued soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Dr Lily Neo's second question regarding the screening

of  children, it is true that many teachers and parents  were

not aware of the proper actions to be taken during the recent

outbreak.   What has happened was that we actually had  cases

of  children  who  had contracted the hand,  foot  and  mouth

disease  but continued to attend school.  For the child  care

centres, sick bay is a standard facility. We do not have much

problem because the infected children are isolated.   But  in

the  case of kindergartens, there is no practice of having  a

sick bay.  As a result, some of the children were allowed  to

continue to interact with the other children.  As a result of

the  recent outbreak, we have now issued clear guidelines  to

all  kindergartens that for those without  sick bay facility,

they  would  still  have to isolate the children,  using  the

principal's office or any other facility.  At the same  time,

they  have to notify the parents immediately.  This  practice

has  been  put  in place.  Over the last one  month,  we  are

seeing a very effective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>



decline in the number of cases.  So we intend to continue  to

enforce  such hygiene practices so that, hopefully,  we  will

not  see  another outbreak and we do not have  to  close  the

schools in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

whether  through  the process we have identified  any  highly

susceptible   facilities  like  sand  bays,  playgrounds   or

swimming pools and so on, that are actually causing a  bigger

probability of this disease being spread and are we going  to

review   the   building  and  maintenance  policy   of   such

facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question I have, which is still not very

clear, is why we have had this disease at a steady state  and

what was the reason for the sudden increase this time round.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, the spread of the disease is

basically  through  direct contact among the  children.   For

example,  if a child were to pick up a piece of toy and  puts

it  into  his  or  her mouth and before the saliva  dries  up

another child picks it up and puts into his or her mouth,  it

can  be transmitted.  Therefore, in the case of sand bays and

so  on,  it is probably not the primary mode of transmission.

What we have done, as I have mentioned earlier, is to enforce

the  hygiene practices in the schools.  For example,  in  our

hygiene guidelines, there is a clear regulation that all toys

must  be washed at the end of the day every day and any items

where  the children can put into their mouth are not supposed

to be placed in a common area for the children to share.  All

these guidelines will now be further enforced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the sudden increase, prior to 1st October, the

hand,  foot  and mouth disease was not a notifiable  disease.

As  a result, we have to rely on the reporting from the child

care  centres.  The  information  we  were  getting  was  not

complete  and not up to date.  Since 1st October  this  year,

all  hand,  foot  and mouth disease cases  will  have  to  be

reported  because it is now a notifiable infectious  disease.

Henceforth,  we  should  be  able to  monitor  very  closely.

Should there be any increase, we will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>



able to take responsive action before it gets out of control.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister what was the reason

for  the long delay in confirming the diagnosis of the recent

hand, foot and mouth disease occurrence, whether there is now

an  improved channel for speedier laboratory confirmation  of

the  hand,  foot and mouth virus, and whether  this  virology

testing  is available to all doctors for earlier and  correct

diagnosis?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the case of

unnatural death, it is a standard practice that we will do  a

post-mortem.   In the process, there are actually  two  steps

involved.   The first step is to detect the presence  of  the

relevant  virus.  And the second step is to identify  exactly

what  strain of virus it is.  Take, for example, in the  case

of the hand, foot and mouth disease, the most common virus is

the  family  under  the enterovirus, and there  are  over  60

different  strains.   Within a  few  days,  we  are  able  to

identify the presence of enterovirus.  But the next  step  is

to  identify  if it is a coxsackie A16 or EV71, or  something

else.   For that to happen, the medical laboratory will  have

to isolate the sample.  They have to culture the virus to see

whether there are any reactions.  So that typically will take

a few weeks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give you an example. We actually did the

isolation in parallel in a Singapore facility as well  as  to

send  a  sample to the CDC (Communicable Disease  Centre)  in

Atlanta.   In  fact, both centres identified the presence  of

EV71  almost  at the same time.  It shows that there  was  no

delay  on  our  part,  because even  with  a  very  reputable

facility in Atlanta, it takes about the same time.   This  is

because  we  have to go through that period of time  for  the

virus to be cultured, to be grown, and to be identified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to assure the public that we do have an up-to-date facility and that there was no delay in identifying

the  virus.  Unfortunately, the process does take time.   But

having  said that, it does not mean that we will not  further

invest in upgrading our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>



capability.  In fact, the Task Force is now looking into what

kind of new facilities and capabilities we ought to invest in

Singapore  so that in future, should there be any  infectious

disease outbreak, we will be able to continue to respond very

rapidly.

<div align="center"><b>ENERGY CONSERVATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(New measures)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development, in view of the rapid increase  in  oil

prices,  whether his Ministry is considering any new measures

for energy conservation.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (for the Minister for National Development) (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  1998,  an  Inter-Agency Committee  on  Energy  Efficiency

(IACEE)  was chaired by the Ministry of National Development.

It  was  formed  to address the concerns over the  increasing

consumption of energy in Singapore and to look into improving

the  efficient  usage  of energy.  When  this  Committee  was

formed, oil prices were low at about US$15 per barrel.   This

shows that the Committee was formed at a time when the prices

were  low and there was no knee jerk reaction to the  present

energy prices.  But now that it has gone up to over US$30 per

barrel, the need to act on energy conservation has become all

the more urgent and important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IACEE has completed its study and released its

recommendations  to  the  media  in  May  this   year.    The

recommendations  are wide-ranging, long term and  attainable.

Various   agencies  are  working  towards   achieving   these

recommendations.  In summary, Sir, these include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing and developing building regulations on energy

efficiency by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the Green Labelling Scheme under the Singapore

Environment Council

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>



which   works  in  cooperation  with  the  Ministry  of   the

Environment (ENV).  Under this scheme, equipment which  meets

certain efficiency and environment labelling standards  would

be allowed to have a Singapore Green Label, and I believe SEC

will be launching this label very soon;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporating energy efficiency as an objective of our

land  transport  policy.  Sir, you have heard  Dr  John  Chen

announce the hybrid car scheme; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring and reviewing the pricing of electricity, and

creating   awareness  amongst  consumers  on   using   energy

efficiently by the Public Utilities Board (PUB).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the current rapid increase in oil prices, the

IACEE   is  coordinating  the  efforts  of  all  the  various

agencies, including PUB, ENV and the Land Transport Authority

(LTA),  to roll out on an urgent basis a series of programmes

to  inform  and  educate the consumers on  ways  to  conserve

energy and use energy more efficiently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, can I ask the

Senior  Parliamentary Secretary which sector is  the  largest

energy consumer, whether it is the residential, commercial or

industrial  sector?   Secondly, he has  mentioned  a  lot  of

measures  to  be  introduced.  Can he tell us  whether  these

measures  are recommendations or with some enforcement  rules

attached to them?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> To his first question, which

property  sector  consumes the most  energy,  whether  it  is

residential,  commercial or industrial,  the  answer  is,  of

course,  industrial, because they are heavy users of  energy,

like  our  petrochemical companies.  But these are bottomline

focused  MNCs, so they know what they are doing.   And  I  am

sure  that  they would have factored the cost of energy  into

their  production, because they need to compete on  a  world-wide  basis.   But  we  found that  most  of  the  energy  is

channelled through air-conditioning as well as refrigeration.

So

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>



the  commercial and residential sectors have  more  scope  to

improve their energy efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the recommendations, whether they are achievable or

attainable,  yes,  of course they are.  These  are  long-term

objectives.  Although our energy efficiency is quite good, we

can  always  improve further.  We have put  together  various

recommendations.   The  agencies  are  looking   into   these

recommendations and rolling out their implementation plans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary whether the Government will take  the

lead  in this area and set the example by trying to make sure

that  public  buildings continually become more efficient  in

use of energy.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

indeed one of the recommendations of the report published  in

May.   The public sector is a large sector, and we intend  to

use the public sector as the leading sector to promote energy

efficiency.   But  having  said  that,  most  of  the  public

buildings  are  quite  new and they are really  very  energy-efficient.   So  the scope for improvement  may  be  limited.

But,  nonetheless, we are attempting for a start to band  the

energy  efficiency of all the bigger public  buildings.   The

BCA  has  compiled an initial list and it would be circulated

internally   to   all  the  various  statutory   boards   and

Ministries.  So within the Ministries, they will  know  which

building is more efficient, which is less efficient vis-a-vis

the other Ministry's buildings, and this will be compiled  on

the basis of floor area, usage hours, things like that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Hearing the Government's intent to band

and  grade their own buildings, would it be possible for this

list  to  be shared with experts and practitioners  from  the

private  sector,  so that we can have more transparency  into

how different buildings are performing?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will

take  that suggestion into consideration.  This is  only  the

beginning.  So we thought we will try out with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>



public sector buildings first, because it is easier for us to

collect energy data.  But certainly it is a step that we want

to advance in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Would the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary consider some incentives for  private

sector to be more efficient in their buildings?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> We are looking at the

examples  of  other  countries to see how  we  can  encourage

developers,  for  example,  to be more  conscious  of  energy

efficiency.   We  are  exploring this.  BCA,  I  believe,  is

talking  to URA and at some time they will talk to REDAS  and

all  the  other  contractors to  see  how  we  can  make  our

buildings more efficient.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development what is the current demand for public housing and

whether   the  Government  will  revise  the  public  housing

development programme to match the actual demand for the next

5 to 10 years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first nine months of this year, HDB

received 9,600 applications under its Registration for  Flats

System (RFS).  The average monthly application for new  flats

this  year  therefore  works out to about  1,100  per  month,

compared  to  about  800 in 1999 and  700  in  1998.   As  at

September  2000, there were 35,600 applicants on the  waiting

list for HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to monitor the demand closely and

adjust its building programme according to the demand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it appears

that   HDB   has  achieved  its  primary  role  of  providing

affordable housing to most Singaporeans.  Is it time now  for

HDB  to reduce its role, ie, to give the private sector  more

opportunities  to  meet the increasing sophisticated  housing

demands of Singaporeans?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is a

role  for both the public and the private sectors to play  in

housing  our  population.  In fact, the  HDB  has  more  than

achieved its purpose of creating communities where our people

can  live  in  good quality public housing.  At  the  present

moment,  more  than 85%, roughly 86%, of our people  live  in

public housing.  It has been discussed in both the public and

private  domains  that a long-term target  is  to  have  more

Singaporeans  living  in private housing.   Indeed,  this,  I

believe, is the aspiration of many Singaporeans, to  be  able

to upgrade to private housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1991 Concept Plan, for example, there was

discussion about increasing the mix of private housing vis-a-vis  public  housing.  This is now currently under discussion

in  the present Concept Plan review and this is where we will

be discussing the matter more extensively - URA together with

members  of  the public and other interested  parties.   When

that  discussion is complete, I think we will  have  a  rough

idea of which direction we are heading.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> May I ask the Minister, now

that  the  number of applications for HDB flats has  lessened

and  the  waiting time is less, can HDB give a more  accurate

completion time?  There are a lot of applicants who are  told

of  a certain time they can take over the flat, but now,  for

example,  they are very often told that in one year  or  11/2

years  the  flat will be ready, and they get panicky  because

they are not ready financially or physically.  Can HDB give a

more accurate target date for the completion of the flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member's

point  is a valid one.  In fact, we have been receiving quite

a  lot of feedback from Members of Parliament that, where  in

the  past,  applicants had to wait for a long time for  their

flats, now they are actually getting their flats faster  than

they want them, primarily because they have not been able  to

accumulate  enough savings in their CPF in order to  pay  for

the downpayment.  I think it is a happy state of affairs,  in

some ways.  But it is also incumbent upon the HDB now, with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>



slowing  demand  and with greater control over  the  building

programme, to be able to monitor more closely the progress of

the  building programme and to therefore give a more accurate

assessment, as the Member has mentioned just now.   HDB  will

be  looking into ways and means of matching supply and demand

more accurately.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, in relation to

the Minister's answer, I believe that the HDB has a scheme to

allow  the  20% deposit payment to be made in two instalments

for  those  who cannot afford it.  May I ask the Minister  to

extend this to 5-room flats too?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, this change or revision to the

policy  of allowing the deposit of 20% to be split  into  two

instalments was primarily to allow younger couples   who  are

not  able to afford the 20% downpayment to therefore get  the

HDB  flat, as it were.  The reason why the decision was taken

to  restrict this concession to the 4-room flats was that  if

you  are  actually applying for a 5-room flat  and  therefore

your  deposit is larger, then affordability should not be  in

the picture.  Therefore, in so far as this being a concession

is  concerned, the relaxation is only for the 4-roomers.   It

is  a question of affordability as well as being able to  get

their flats faster.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> May I remind the Minister that

because  of the shorter waiting period as well as the reduced

CPF payments due to the economic crisis, the ability to build

up  enough balances in the CPF for the 20% deposit  has  been

greatly impaired.  In that case, may I again ask the Minister

whether he will consider the 5-room option too, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I said, it is a question of

affordability.  And if it is a matter of not  being  able  to

build  enough balances in the CPF for a 5-room flat,  then  I

would  suggest that the young couple consider a  4-room  flat

instead  where together with the split, delayed  or  deferred

instalment,  I  think affordability would  no  longer  be  an

issue.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> In meeting the demand

for  housing  of  Singaporeans, may I  ask  the  Minister  to

clarify  the  HDB's position on the building of  smaller  and

smaller  flats while it seems that Singaporeans have a  great

energy  for  retaining the existing flats or even bigger  and

bigger flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, this matter came to the attention

of  the public recently by way of media reports that HDB  was

downsizing its flats.  Over the last 10 to 15 years, there is

no  doubt  that  there  had been several demographic  changes

taking  place,  not least of which is the downsizing  of  the

family unit.  So the average household size over the last  10

to  15 years has come down, to around four today and, if  the

trend persists, to something less than four.  That is one  of

the  changes  that is taking place that HDB  has  taken  into

account  in  its building programme.  But having  said  that,

there  is  no  intention at this point in  time  for  HDB  to

further  downsize its flats.  It has already done  so  slowly

over the last many, many years.  And currently, the intention

is  for  HDB to continue to build flats of this size  because

this  is the level of comfort and the level of public housing

that  we  believe  is  affordable for Singaporeans  and  also

affordable  for the state.   I think HDB has  made  it  quite

clear  that  there  is no intention to further  downsize  the

flats at this point in time.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on 13th October 2000, there was a 30% increase

in  the  share price of Singapore Telecommunications  Limited

("SingTel")  resulting in a sudden upward surge  of  the  STI

index on that day.  The increase in share price was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>



due to a last minute order to buy 2 million SingTel shares at

$3.50 each, keyed in by Nomura Securities Singapore Pte  Ltd.

The  order was given at 5.04 pm, just 1 minute before the end

of the pre-close session on the Singapore Exchange Securities

Trading.   662,000 shares, representing all  the  outstanding

sell positions during the pre-close session, were matched  at

$3.50,  causing SingTel shares to close at that  price.   The

Singapore  Exchange ("SGX") had confirmed that the trade  was

not an error trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regulator of the securities and derivatives market,

SGX is concerned with unusual price or volume fluctuations on

any  share  counter.   SGX will take  action  against  market

participants engaged in trading activities aimed to create  a

false market in contravention of SGX's rules and bye-laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on its investigations, SGX has ascertained that

there  could  be  a  possible  violation  of  the  Securities

Industry Act.  It is an offence under the Securities Industry

Act  to create a false or misleading appearance in the market

for  a share counter.  Accordingly, based on advice from MAS,

SGX  has  referred  the  matter  to  the  Commercial  Affairs

Department for further investigation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, is the Commercial

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said,

the Exchange has referred the matter to CAD and I assume that

CAD  is now investigating the matter.  I have not heard  when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, higher education

in   Singapore   is   provided  in   the   universities   and

polytechnics.  Currently, we provide places for  21%  of  the

Primary   1   cohort  in  universities  and  about   40%   in

polytechnics.   These cohort participation rates  for  higher

education are among the highest in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The polytechnics do not offer degree courses, and it is

not  the  Ministry's policy for the polytechnics  to  do  so.

Universities  and  polytechnics  serve  different  groups  of

students  and  different needs of the economy.   Each  higher

education   segment  focuses  on  providing  a  best-in-class

education to its students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polytechnic graduates are the largest group to graduate

from  our  education system and are well trained  and  highly

employable.   They  constitute some 40% of  every  cohort  of

students, and form the backbone of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do appreciate that polytechnic graduates, like other

Singaporeans aspire to upgrade themselves.  Currently,  about

1,200  polytechnic graduates per year are admitted to various

full-time  and part-time courses leading to degrees  in  NUS,

NTU  and  SMU.  Polytechnic graduates also upgrade themselves

by  attending  courses  at  the  polytechnics  that  lead  to

advanced and specialist diplomas.  Some polytechnic graduates

enrol  in  universities  in  other  countries.   My  Ministry

recognises the aspiration of polytechnic graduates to upgrade

themselves, and we are currently studying how more  upgrading

opportunities  can be provided for polytechnic  graduates  in

Singapore,  in the context of providing continuing  education

and life-long learning for all Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, when this question was last

raised  in Parliament on 9th May this year, the Minister  for

cases   against  the  CISCO  officers  involved   have   been

concluded.   Sir,  as  all  the  cases  have  not  yet   been

concluded, it is still premature to make any decision  as  to

whether the transport companies should be prosecuted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State why is

it  necessary to wait until all the cases against the  escort

riders  have been completed?  Is there or is there not enough

evidence now to charge the companies for offering the bribes?

Why do we have to wait?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> All the transactions are

related  because we are talking about 23 companies and  about

<br><br>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CISCO officers involved.  So in order to be fair  to  all

parties  concerned, it is prudent to wait till all the  cases

are  concluded before deciding whether or not to  charge  any

giver.   In fact, some will still be giving evidence  in  the

remaining  cases.   In order not to prejudice  the  remaining

cases  and,  for  the  sake  of justice  and  fairness,  this

decision  should  only be made when all the cases  have  been

concluded.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I tell the Minister of State that I

find  it difficult to understand his answer.  I take it  that

some of the cases or the majority of the cases against escort

riders  have been completed.  So the evidence must be in  the

possession of the public prosecutor.  Please tell us what  is

the delay.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I have said, these are not

separate  cases.  They may involve different  officers.   But

the  transactions  are linked because they involve  the  same

companies  and, in some cases, several companies gave  bribes

to  different officers, so the charges are also related.   So

for  the sake of fairness, it is better to wait till all  the

cases  have been completed before deciding whether or not  to

charge any of the givers.  Let me assure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>

decision to prosecute or not?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> This question does not

require  a  response.   The  public  prosecutor  always  acts

judiciously in the public interest and with fairness  to  all

looks  at all the evidence and facts and see whether  a  case

can be made out, and he prosecutes in the public interest.  I

For   self-employed  persons,  CPF  contributions   are   not

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL SURVEY ON LABOUR SHORTAGE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  his  Ministry will conduct a national  survey  among

employers  to  ascertain the extent  of  labour  shortage  in

various  sectors,  and review the foreign  labour  policy  to

ensure  an  even  and adequate supply of  foreign  labour  to

sustain  the  traditional  and new businesses  of  our  local

enterprises in line with the Government's current efforts  to

create a pro-enterprise environment.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> The Ministry of Manpower conducts quarterly and

annual  surveys  to obtain information on  job  vacancies  by

occupation and industry.  The survey results are published in

the  Singapore Yearbook of Manpower Statistics, the Quarterly

Labour Market Report, as well as in ad hoc reports.  MOM also

conducts  the Manpower and Skills Needs Survey on a bi-annual

basis  to  assess the employment outlook and skills needs  of

various industries for the next two years.  In addition,  our

officers  conduct  regular  company  visits  and  engage   in

frequent  exchanges with companies and unions  to  get  first

hand  information  on manpower issues.  We also  monitor  and

actively seek feedback from companies and workers to identify

emerging   problems.   All  these  channels,  from   official

surveys,  links with economic agencies and interactions  with

companies, have enabled MOM to identify short and medium term

manpower  needs  in various industries.  These  findings  and

projections  on manpower needs are presented to the  National

Manpower  Council.  The Council, which meets  twice  a  year,

sets  directions on the appropriate strategies to  meet  both

the short and long term manpower needs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet emerging manpower needs, various strategies

encompassing manpower development, manpower augmentation  and

industry   re-engineering  will  be  needed.   This  includes

welcoming and facilitating skilled foreigners coming here  to

work.   For  such  skilled  global  talents  coming  here  on

Employment  Passes,  we  do  not have  any  cap  or  sectoral

limitation.  In the case of semi-skilled or unskilled foreign

workers,  we will have to take a more balanced approach.   We

already have more than 450,000 low-skilled foreign workers in

Singapore.   Unlimited inflow of low-skilled foreign  workers

is  not sustainable and may undermine economic restructuring.

Employers  with easy access to low cost foreign  workers  may

lose  the  incentive  to invest in labour-saving  technology,

participate  in  workforce development, or re-engineer  their

work  processes to address their manpower needs.   There  are

also serious social and political costs in admitting too many

foreign workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore adopted a more holistic approach to

address industries' skilled and unskilled manpower needs.  In

response  to  the  shortage of IT workers,  for  example,  we

launched  the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme  (Info-comm) to encourage the conversion of local non-IT workers  to

take  up IT jobs.  This complements the liberal admission  of

foreign  talents  in  this  area.  The  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  has  been extended to cover training  of  cleaning

workers,  health  assistants and nurses,  and  other  sectors

facing   labour  shortage.   This  will  help  to   re-deploy

displaced workers, thus easing structural unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite these measures, there will still be gaps in

manpower demand and supply where the local workforce  is  not

able  to  fill.   Consequently, we will need to  augment  the

workforce with foreign manpower.  We will review the  foreign

manpower  policy  to ensure that they remain  relevant  while

taking  into  consideration  the social  and  economic  costs

associated  with  the admission of too many foreign  workers.

But foreign worker policies must be seen as part of the total

solution  to  industries'  manpower challenges  and  tailored

accordingly.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>



will continue to monitor the employment situation closely and

assist  both  large  and small companies  in  their  manpower

needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, there could be excess foreign

workers  in  certain sectors of our industries, such  as  the

construction sector.  Can the Ministry of Manpower not  allow

some  of  these  excess foreign workers to be transferred  to

other sectors, such as the service and manufacturing sectors,

to  meet the shortages so that these foreign workers can also

be put to better use which will benefit our economy?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, each company, each

sector,  will  have to justify its needs for foreign  workers

separately.  Although there may be excess in one  sector,  if

the  other  sectors or companies do not justify their  needs,

then we are not able to provide them with additional workers.

And, as I mentioned in my reply, we have to look at the total

picture.   We have to ensure that the needs of the industries

are  satisfied but, at the same time, we also have social and

political costs that we need to take into consideration.   So

it  has  to be a total approach.  Each sector, each  company,

must  be  able to justify its needs, and, if they can justify

their needs, then we will be able to consider them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, is this number

of  450,000 low-skilled foreign workers in Singapore too high

already?   There  is  talk of excess in the  building  trade.

What  I  am  saying is that there is a danger of  these  low-skilled  foreign  workers  taking  the  jobs  of  Singaporean

workers.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, in fact, we are

trying  to  get  more  skilled workers as  against  unskilled

workers  coming into Singapore.  We have to have  a  balance.

And  we  want companies to look at their processes  and  look

into  ways where they can cut their manpower needs by  taking

in  more  mechanisation processes.  I think this  has  to  be

taken as a whole.  Obviously, we cannot afford to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>



have  a  large  number of unskilled foreign workers,  because

there  are social and political costs.  So, while we want  to

welcome  foreign workers, we want to welcome skilled  workers

to  Singapore  rather  than unskilled  workers.   450,000  is

definitely  a  large figure and we should  try  our  best  to

moderate  the  demand  for unskilled workers.   But  we  will

obviously try and help those who need skilled workers to  get

their needs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I ask the Minister of State,

firstly, what criteria does the Ministry of Manpower  use  to

assess the need of a specific sector for foreign workers and,

secondly,  does  it take into account in its assessment  what

the  potential growth or the current situation in the  sector

is, in order to decide whether they should allow more or less

foreign workers to be employed by the sector?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

fact,  we  have  various sectoral limitations  for  unskilled

workers.  For the manufacturing sector, for companies  facing

greater  foreign competition, we allow them even  up  to  50%

foreign  workers  and, for the construction sector,  although

there is not a need now, we actually allow up to five foreign

workers for one local worker.  So we have got this way to see

what  are  their worker requirements.  Even for  the  service

sector,  we do allow 30% of the total workforce to come  from

traditional  sources.  Though we do not allow non-traditional

source workers to come into the service sector, we allow some

exceptions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the answer is, briefly, we have ways to find out how

to allocate the workers, and this depends on the needs of the

industry.   Obviously,  in  an area  where  there  is  strong

competition,  like  manufacturing,  we  are  pretty  liberal,

allowing up to 50% in some cases.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE TO SINGLE MOTHERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)

what other alternative assistance, if any, the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>



gives  to  help  a  single mother when  she  decides  not  to

terminate  the  pregnancy, and (b) whether the  benefits  are

spelt  out  to  the pregnant person during  the  2weeks  pre-counselling period before the actual abortion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  all  women, married or single, undergo compulsory  pre-abortion  counselling conducted by trained  counsellors  when

they  attend any registered medical clinic to request for  an

abortion.   At  least  48 hours must elapse  after  the  pre-abortion counselling before a woman can go for the abortion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the pre-abortion counselling the risks involved

in  the  abortion procedure and the possible consequences  of

abortion  are  explained. Depending on the circumstances  and

the  reason  for  seeking an abortion,  the  counsellor  will

discourage  women  from going through with  the  abortion  by

explaining  the benefits of keeping the baby,  which  include

the joys of parenting, the bonding of the family, and that  a

baby  is  not  a  burden  and will not jeopardise  a  woman's

career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the woman is single and decides to keep the baby,

assistance appropriate to her needs will be rendered.  She is

referred   to   shelters  for  pregnant  single   women   for

accommodation if she finds it difficult to stay  in  her  own

home.   She  is  also provided with information  on  adoption

procedures and alternative child care arrangements.   She can

be  referred  to agencies such as the Family Service  Centres

and  the  Pregnancy  Crisis Service for  social  support  and

services  like  mediation between the single mother  and  her

parents, arrangements to retain her in school and referral to

agencies for financial assistance and free antenatal care.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I notice pre-counselling does

not  include  material benefits, like food  or  free  medical

treatment  for the child.  Are there such benefits after  the

child is born?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If the single mother requires

financial assistance, there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>



various  agencies to provide this financial  assistance.   So

she  will  be  referred  to all these  agencies,  as  I  have

explained in my answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, other than the risks of

abortion  and  the benefits of a family, does the  Government

give other benefits to the single mother especially?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Our position is, if you bring a baby

into this world, you should be responsible for the baby.  But

in  the  case of a single mother, we understand that  she  is

probably in more financial difficulties and so we will  refer

her  to  all  the  various agencies.  There  are  no  special

benefits for single mothers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It would appear that the Government

prefers a single mother to abort the baby rather than to keep

her, and even, later on, with the hope of giving the child up

for adoption.  But does that not go against the policy of the

Government to encourage Singaporeans to have more babies?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We encourage more babies within a

family context.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b> asked the Minister for Health (a)

how  many public and private rehabilitative centres are there

in Singapore; (b) whether the current number is sufficient to

meet  needs; and (c) what is the projection for such  service

over  the next five to ten years in view of our rapid greying

population.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Rehabilitation services in Singapore

are provided at both acute hospitals and community levels  to

help  patients  recover from conditions such  as  stroke  and

fractured  hips.   All the 5 public hospitals,  namely,  SGH,

CGH, NUH, TTSH and AH provide rehabilitation services.  The 4

private  hospitals, Mt Elizabeth, Gleneagles, East Shore  and

Mt  Alvernia, also provide rehabilitation services  to  their

patients.  At the community level, four community hospitals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>



and  23  day rehabilitation centres provide among others  970

places  for rehabilitation.  Most nursing homes also  provide

rehabilitation  to their patients.  Half of  the  50  nursing

homes are run by private organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standalone rehabilitation centres are all run by

voluntary  welfare  organisations.  Based  on  our  provision

norms of 3.5 places per 1,000 elderly, we estimate that there

is  currently  a  slight overprovision of day  rehabilitation

places  by  about  150  places. This  is  borne  out  by  the

utilisation rate of day rehabilitation centres, which at  60%

is a little underutilised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have sufficient day rehabilitation places over

the  next 10 years, based on projected requirements and known

development  plans  over  the next  few  years.  However,  my

Ministry  reviews the provision of such step-down  facilities

regularly  so  as to ensure an adequate supply  to  meet  the

needs of our patients.

estates,  HDB acts as the agent of Government in  maintaining

them  and  is also responsible for their interim uses  within

approved planning parameters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this year's Committee of Supply debate when

the  issue  was  raised,  Ministry of  Law  and  Land  Office

reviewed the Temporary Occupation Licence (TOL) rates imposed

on  grassroots organisations for interim use of State land in

HDB estates.  We have decided to charge 30% of the market TOL

rates  that  would otherwise have to be paid for the  use  of

State  land in HDB estate as playing fields and courts.   For

example,  previously an annual TOL fee of  $4,800  ($400  per

month)  would be imposed on the grassroots organisations  for

using  a  piece of vacant State land, 1,000 square metres  in

immediate action to solve the problem.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, there are 48 residential properties at Pheng Geck Avenue

acquired  by  Land  Office (LO) for the North-East  MRT  Line

(NEL)   project  and  comprehensive  redevelopment.   Pending

redevelopment, these properties are let out to ex-owners  and

other  tenants by the Land Office's managing agent on Tenancy

Agreements (TAs) and Temporary Occupation Licences (TOLs) for

residential use.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land Office had earlier received a complaint about the

unauthorised  use  of  these properties for  housing  foreign

workers  and  the nuisance they caused to the  neighbourhood.

Following  up on the complaint, Land Office's managing  agent

had  on  5th October this year, served notices on 23  tenants

who  had  breached  the conditions of the Tenancy  Agreement,

requiring  them  to  vacate and return the  premises  by  4th

November  this year.  Another 4 licensees were informed  that

their licences would not be renewed when they expire on  14th

rented  out  to companies for the use of their employees  but

there  was  a limit on the numbers.  The nuisance  which  was

<div align="center"><b>(Price)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) what factors contributed to the lower cost of

the  Housing and Development Board flats published  recently;

and  (b) whether the price of HDB flats will stabilise at the

current levels.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB considers various

factors  in the pricing of new flats for sale.  These include

affordability  of the flats to the buyers, prevailing  resale

prices  of  comparable HDB resale flats,  the  locations  and

attributes of the flats and the overall development cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, HDB flats which are in more popular

towns/locations with more developed amenities and facilities,

such as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>



MRT/LRT  stations,  bus interchanges, shopping  centres,  and

sport  complexes, are priced higher than those  in  the  less

developed  towns.  The selling prices of flats may  therefore

vary  from quarter to quarter, depending on the factors  that

apply to the flats offered.  For example, the prices of  some

new  flats  offered in the 4th Quarter 2000 are  higher  than

those  of  flats offered in the 2nd Quarter 2000 because  the

new  flats are in the more developed Bukit Batok Town  within

the  Town  Centre and next to the MRT station.  On the  other

hand,  prices  of new flats offered in Punggol  town  in  4th

Quarter  2000  are  priced lower than those  offered  in  2nd

Quarter  2000,  to  reflect  their  location  nearer  to  the

expressway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will continue to use these factors to set the prices

of HDB flats and to ensure that they remain affordable.  From

time to time, HDB will make some adjustments to the prices of

flats  offered to reflect the location and attributes of  the

flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs what are the basic conditions that must exist  before

Police personnel can open fire aimed to kill a member of  the

public.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, let me first say that no police officer in doing his job

will  want to kill anybody.  It is not his job to kill.   His

job  is to ensure that life is not endangered.  Not just  his

own life, but also those of members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officers may use firearms when there is an

immediate  threat  to  life  or of  grievous  hurt.   Such  a

situation exists when:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1011</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the suspect has the means to inflict grievous

bodily harm on the officer or any member of the public;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the suspect makes threatening gestures or moves

at  the victim or police officer, which suggest that he  will

use violence and has every opportunity to inflict harm; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the victim or police officer is clearly in

imminent danger of death or grievous hurt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officers are trained to use firearms only as a

last resort.  And they only do so when the above conditions - which are very strict conditions - are present.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether

he  has  made a close study of sections 100 and  101  of  the

Penal  Code  and the exception to section 300  of  the  Penal

Code, exception (c), before I ask further questions?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> These are exceptions to

do not have the Penal Code with me.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have you made a study of all those

sections?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> In determining the position

to  take,  we  work  within the laws.  So  definitely,  these

conditions are within the framework of the law.  It  must  be

so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister of State: is he

aware that under exception (c) to section 300, the murder  is

reduced  to  culpable homicide not amounting to  murder?   It

does  not  result  in an acquittal or justification  for  the

killing.  Is he aware of that?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Surely it is up to the

coroner  or the court to decide on a particular case  whether

any  legal  provision kicks in.  In this case,  the  coroner,

with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1012</b></font><br><br>



all  the  facts on hand, had looked into the case and decided

that  the  officer had acted reasonably.  There was  imminent

danger  and,  therefore, the coroner decided  that  what  had

happened was justifiable homicide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister of State aware that the

finding  of  the  coroner was not that the policeman  was  in

imminent danger of being killed but there was imminent danger

that  he  feared for his safety?  Will the Minister of  State

look up the coroner's findings again?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the coroner held that his

safety was immediately threatened which encompasses his  life

because   when   his   safety  was   threatened,   in   those

circumstances, with the man charging at him with a 1.62-metre

iron  rod,  nobody knows what would happen. The coroner  also

held  that  he had no reasonable alternative to shooting  the

deceased.   And he also held that Sergeant Chan in this  case

had acted reasonably and professionally.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask whether it is a point of order.

If  we  are  discussing a particular case, surely that  is  a

finding of the court in question.  Is there not something  in

the Standing Orders on this point, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. Mr

Jeyaretnam, do you have any more questions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I have, Sir. Does the Minister of State

not  think  that  in  spite  of the coroner's  findings,  the

policeman  should  have been charged  in  court  for  him  to

persuade  the  court that it was not murder but manslaughter,

culpable  homicide not amounting to murder?  Because  if  you

look  at  sections 100 and 101, the right of private  defence

does  not  extend  to killing another man  unless  there  are

reasonable  grounds to suspect that his life is  in  imminent

danger.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I have said just now

in my answer, it is not the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>



police's intention to kill.  In those circumstances,  he  has

to  shoot to stop the man.  If the bullets kill him, that  is

the result of the action.  But in those split seconds, he has

to  act.   He  has to act reasonably, not only in defence  of

himself, but also passers-by and members of the public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Were there passers-by?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes. There was a driver of a

motor  lorry behind him who testified that he feared for  his

life  if  the man was not stopped.  Mr Jeyaretnam well  knows

that  a coroner's enquiry is part of the traditional process.

It is a coroner's court, well established, and the system has

worked well.  In fact, the coroner will not have the last say

because  it  is  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers  who  will

ultimately  decide  whether  or not  there  are  grounds  for

prosecution.   In this case, he decided that,  based  on  the

coroner's  inquiry and also his own assessment of the  facts,

there were no grounds for prosecuting the police officer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State

whether  he  has the number of fatal shootings  done  by  the

police  in the last year or whatever timeframe?  And  if  so,

how many prosecutions have resulted?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Over the last 15 years, there

have been only 10 cases of fatal shootings, and all the cases

went  before  a  coroner's inquiry.  Every one  of  them  was

justifiable homicide, except for one case which was  an  open

verdict.

<div align="center"><b>CERTIFICATE OF ENTITLEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Merging categories of private cars into single category)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology  whether  he  will

consider  merging  the Certificate of Entitlement  categories

for private cars into a single category as early as possible.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Sir, the present

two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>



COE  categories for cars, namely, Category A and Category  B,

were formed from the merger of four car COE categories in May

1999  following  a  review  by the  Government  Parliamentary

Committee for Communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its review of the Vehicle Quota System (VQS), the

Committee  considered merging the car COE categories  into  a

single  category  as it felt that this would provide  greater

liquidity  and  reduce  price distortions.   However,  public

feedback raised concerns that with a single COE category  for

cars,  buyers  of smaller cars were likely to  be  outbid  by

buyers  of  big  and  luxury cars.  The  Committee  therefore

recommended  that  the merger of categories  should  be  done

gradually and, as an intermediate step, recommended that  the

four car categories be merged to form the two categories.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 12 months, the COE prices of Category B

were generally higher or comparable to the prices of Category

A  except on a few occasions, such as in the October  tender,

when  the  COE  price of Category B fell substantially  below

that  of Category A.  This can happen and does happen because

in  a  closed  bidding  system, bidders  are  not  given  any

information  when  the bidding is in progress  and  they  are

therefore  unable  to  follow  up  when  the  demand  for   a

particular category of COE is weak vis-a-vis the supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority will be implementing the

open bidding system for COEs as a trial in the 2nd quarter of

next  year.   With the open bidding system, bidders  will  be

able to see the going prices during the bidding exercises and

make informed decisions when bidding COEs.  This will help to

reduce wide fluctuations in COE prices like the sharp fall in

Category B COE price in the October bidding exercise or  when

the  price  for  the big car COE fell to $50 previously.   We

should  therefore review whether to merge  the  two  car  COE

categories  into  one  after we implement  the  open  bidding

system.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, with the information available in

the open bidding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>



system, is it not equivalent to having a single category  for

all cars?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, it depends on the

reactions  of  the  bidders.  If they  choose  to  bid  in  a

particular  category  because  they  just  want  to   buy   a

particular  category car, then it may not be.   But  if  they

choose to buy any car as long as its COE price is the lowest,

then perhaps what the Member said is true.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, would the Minister of State agree

that in the previous discussion on this topic, the merger  of

categories allows buyers a greater freedom to buy  cars?   As

such,  open bidding with the information available  seems  to

suggest  that  the  segregation of categories  is  no  longer

necessary.   Given  this,  would  he  consider  merging   the

categories as soon as possible?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, from the transport

management  point  of view, it is logical to  have  only  one

category.   But  as I said, there are still  public  concerns

about  merging the categories, because they felt that  buyers

of  smaller cars will be squeezed out.  In view of  that,  we

are  prepared to implement the open bidding system first  and

then review the results.  And if what the Member says is true

and  that  people feel that there is no reason to  have  more

than  one  category,  then  we  will  consider  the  Member's

suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister how does one ensure that Category  A  COEs

cater  for  only those in that income group.   Is  it  not  a

reality that it is open to everyone to bid for it?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, we cannot dictate how

people  should bid.  Anyone, regardless of his or her  income

level, can bid for a car in Category A.  But the fact remains

that  people are still concerned about the effect  of  having

one single category.  Therefore, as I said, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>



will consider doing so if the concern becomes negligible.

<div align="center"><b>ECO-FRIENDLY VEHICLES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Incentives)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and  Information Technology whether he will consider granting

incentives such as a 50% rebate on road tax to encourage  the

importation and use of eco-friendly vehicles.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Communications and Information):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  eco-friendly  or  "green"  vehicles  generate

substantially less pollution than conventional vehicles.  The

environmental  benefits  of  using  eco-friendly  or  "green"

vehicles are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) lower emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) which

contributes to the "greenhouse" effect;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) lower emission of carbon monoxide (CO),

hydrocarbons   and   nitrogen   and   sulphur   oxides,   and

particulates; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) lower noise levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the Land Transport Authority, together

with  the  Ministry of the Environment and  the  Inter-Agency

Committee   on  Energy  Efficiency  (IACEE),  have   reviewed

measures  to  promote the importation and use of eco-friendly

vehicles in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently announced by my Minister of State, Dr John

Chen,  the Ministry has decided to introduce "green"  vehicle

rebates  for  electric and hybrid cars.   These  rebates  are

intended to lower the cost differential between "green"  cars

and  conventional cars.  To reduce the cost of  ownership  of

"green"  cars, a rebate equivalent to 20% of the  car's  Open

Market Value will be given at the point of registration.   In

addition, hybrid and electric cars will be given a  road  tax

rebate of 10% and 20% respectively.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on LTA's estimates, the effect of the rebate would

be  to  lower  the  difference in purchase  price  between  a

conventional  car and a hybrid car from 16%  to  10%  and  to

reduce the daily operating cost difference from 7.3% to 2.5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "green" vehicle rebates for electric and hybrid cars

will  be  implemented in early 2001.  These rebates  will  be

subsequently reviewed after three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority, together with the Ministry

of the Environment, will be announcing further details of the

"green"  vehicle rebates scheme for electric and hybrid  cars

within the next few weeks.  The announcement will also  cover

the  categorisation  of  green  vehicles  for  road  tax  and

Certificate of Entitlement purposes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I am not sure I understood the

Parliamentary Secretary correctly.  But if I got it right, it

is  still nominally more expensive to purchase and run either

a hybrid car or an electric car.  Is that correct?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> It is slightly higher than

a conventional car.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> In terms of land transport, a car is a

car.   It  should  be  on  par. In terms  of  efficiency  and

pollution,  the  hybrid car and electric  car  will  be  more

beneficial for our environment.  Should it not, if  anything,

be nominally cheaper?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, these are new

technology  cars.  We have to look at how the cost  for  each

car will evolve over time, because new models are produced as

technology improves.  At this point in time, it is also  very

difficult for us to ascertain between the different models at

what point we should equate the rebate to make them equal  to

conventional  cars.  This is a support by the  Government  to

encourage the use of eco-friendly vehicles.  And in  view  of

our  car ownership and land transport policies, it is better,

at this point in time, for conventional car and green car not

to be any different significantly to potential

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>



buyers   coming  into  the  market.   Should  we  lower   the

difference  substantially in favour of "green" cars,  we  may

attract  non-car buyers into  buying such a car just  because

it  is  much cheaper than conventional cars.  And that  might

undermine our land transport policies in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, if I may pursue the point just a

little  further.  On the pricing of leaded and unleaded  type

of  gasoline when this was available in Singapore, we did the

right  way by making unleaded gasoline cheaper.  Surely  this

should be the principle, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I think we have to

look  at  how the technology will evolve with time.  At  this

point  in  time, the development cost of such  cars  is  very

high.   As and when the technology becomes cheaper and  there

is  a  demand for such cars, then we will have to review  it.

But  at  this point in time, we feel that this is  the  right

level.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Parliamentary  Secretary  when the Ministry  anticipates  the

technology  might stabilise and when, as a  minimum,  we  can

expect  at  least parity in the cost of owning and  operating

eco-friendly vehicles versus conventional vehicles?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, at this point in time,

we  really do not have the answer because it depends  on  the

people  who  are  researching and manufacturing  eco-friendly

vehicles.   At  this point in time, our review was  based  on

demands  of  the  market.   As  and  when  there  are   other

developments, we will  review it.

<div align="center"><b>BIRD NUISANCE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether  there are any practical  and  effective

solutions to resolve the bird nuisance faced by residents  at

the  older  and  established Housing  and  Development  Board

estates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1019</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the main factors behind the

bird  nuisance problem are the easy availability of  roosting

places and food sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Parks Board (NParks) and the Town Councils

regularly  prune  dense  foliage to reduce  roosting  places.

Bird  nests  found are also removed during pruning  activity.

The  Agri-Food  and  Veterinary  Authority  (AVA),  with  the

assistance of the Singapore Gun Club and SAFRA Shooting Club,

will cull the pest birds wherever possible and safe to do so.

However, these are short-term measures. The pest birds  would

return to the roost when the trees regain their foliage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more long-term and effective solution is to reduce the

easy availability of food sources.  The Ministry of the

Environment has taken measures to require food stalls, shops

and households to store their refuse in covered bins to keep

them away from birds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To minimise the bird nuisance problems more effectively

in  the  long run, we will also need the cooperation  of  the

public.   The  Town Councils have made concerted  efforts  to

educate  residents not to feed the pest birds such as pigeons

or leave food scraps lying around.  The community, as well as

owners  of eating establishments, should help to ensure  that

food wastes are properly disposed.

but  have  not  been able to deliver in the  sporting  arena,

whether  his Ministry has an overall blueprint to  breed  and

cultivate  Singaporean  champions in  international  sporting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmug): Sir, our national table tennis player,

Jing  Jun Hong, reached the last four in women's table tennis

at  the  recent  Sydney Olympics.  This  is  no  small  feat,

considering that she was competing against the top players in

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 Asian Games, we garnered a total of 14

medals.   At  the  1999  SEA Games in Brunei,  Singapore  won

altogether 96  medals.  So I think it will be unfair  to  say

that our national athletes have not been able to deliver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Ong is right that there is growing public

expectation  for Singapore to pay more attention  to  sports.

As  already announced, I am chairing a Committee on  Sporting

Singapore  to  take  stock  of the current  sports  scene  in

Singapore,  and study how we can further develop and  enhance

our achievements in sports.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for

additional expenditure of $5.2 billion which was not foreseen

at the time of the FY2000 Budget when it was prepared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the additional provision, about $1.9 billion is

required  by  the Ministry of Communications and  Information

Technology  for payment to SingTel and StarHub, to compensate

them  for potential loss of revenue arising from Government's

decision  to  bring forward the introduction of  full  market

competition  in the basic telecommunications  sector  by  two

years, from 1st April 2002 to 1st April 2000. The net of  tax

compensation  sum  was arrived at using the  discounted  cash

flow  approach, which is the mainstream approach used by  the

financial  and  investment community to value businesses,  to

determine the difference in net present value terms  for  the

two   telcos   under   the  duopoly   and   the   accelerated

liberalisation  scenarios.  The telcos  have  agreed  to  the

compensation offers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1023</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of $3.3 billion is required for the Head of

Expenditure  on Financial Transfers. Of this, $2  billion  is

for  transfer to the Developmental Investment Fund which came

into operation on 1st April 2000. The Fund was established to

finance  investments with developmental  objectives  so  that

such outlays would be properly treated as investments and not

as  straight  expenditure, which would be  the  case  if  the

outlays were funded through the Development Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another $1 billion is required to fund the first tranche

of  the CPF Top-Up Scheme, part of the budget surplus sharing

package  announced by the Prime Minister in his National  Day

Rally  Speech  for  this year. Under this  scheme,  Singapore

citizens  aged  21  and  above on 31st  December  2000  will,

depending on their income levels and NS status, receive  top-ups  of $500 to $1,700 in their CPF Ordinary Accounts if they

have  contributed  at least $100 as CPF contributions  during

the  qualifying  period  between 1st January  1998  and  31st

December 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget surplus sharing package also included a

contribution of $300 million to the ElderCare Fund which  was

established  in  March  this year as an  endowment  fund  for

Government  funding  of  the  entire  range  of  elderly  and

continuing  care services by voluntary welfare organisations.

This contribution will bring Government's contribution to the

Fund  to  $500 million, one-fifth of the targeted  amount  of

$2.5 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Companies Act was last amended in 1998 whereby

a  set of amendments was made as part of a wider exercise  to

update  and  modernise company legislation.  The Bill  before

the  House today represents the outcome of the review of  the

company legislation since then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater part of the present Bill is devoted to the

disclosure  requirements in the Companies Act for  offers  or

invitations   to  the  public  in  respect  of   shares   and

debentures.    This  is  essentially  in  response   to   the

recommendations of the Corporate Finance Committee  (CFC)  to

make  Singapore  a  key  financial centre  for  international

corporate  fund-raising activity.  The  main  thrust  of  the

Corporate   Finance  Committee's  recommendations   is   that

Singapore  should  shift  from merit-based  regulation  to  a

disclosure-based  regulatory regime  to  promote  innovation,

entrepreneurship, efficiency and business flexibility,  while

protecting the integrity of the securities market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, the present Bill seeks to improve

provisions  relating  to the disclosure requirements  in  the

Companies  Act, exemptions from such disclosure requirements,

the  penalties  for  breach  of disclosure  requirements  and

submissions  of  financial statements.  The other  amendments

are  intended  to  enlarge the scope of  the  share  buy-back

provisions, improve the winding-up process of companies  that

are  being  used  for purposes against national  security  or

national  interest,  and  make  related  amendments  to   the

Business Registration Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also taking this opportunity to incorporate

miscellaneous  amendments to streamline  the  procedures  and

clarify existing provisions of the Act.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1025</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Improvement on disclosure requirements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 45 of the Companies Act currently sets out the

requirements  for  the  content of a  prospectus.   Clause  5

repeals  and  re-enacts  section 45 to  replace  the  current

checklist approach with a general test of what investors  and

their  professional  advisers  would  expect  to  find  in  a

prospectus to make an informed investment decision.  The  new

provision  provides for the general disclosure  test  in  the

main Act whilst retaining the Fifth Schedule as a checklist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 45A will be introduced under clause 6 to

provide  for  a  mini-prospectus or a  profile  statement  in

addition to a prospectus, subject to certain conditions.  The

profile  statement will be an abridged version  of  the  full

prospectus.  It is meant to provide essential information  at

a glance, and make the information easier to read and digest.

Investors  who  wish to do so can still  refer  to  the  full

prospectus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another step to improve the disclosure requirement is to

allow  the  issuance  and  lodgment  of  a  supplementary  or

replacement document after the original prospectus  has  been

lodged.   This is provided under clause 10, which  inserts  a

new  section 50A that specifies the circumstances under which

a  supplementary  or a replacement document could  be  lodged

with  the  Registrar  and issued to the public.  This  is  to

enable the issuer to update or rectify any statement that has

already  been  made  in  a prospectus or  profile  statement.

Currently, issuers have to either issue a fresh prospectus or

press advertisement to inform investors of such changes.  The

new approach will be less time-consuming and costly.

<br><br><i>Exemption from disclosure requirements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments under clause 16 are intended to improve

the   existing  provisions  on  exemptions  from   prospectus

requirements  under  section  106D  which  are   either   too

restrictive   or  outdated.   For  offers  to   sophisticated

investors, the limit of 50 persons will be removed.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>



definition of "sophisticated investor" will also be  refined.

Individual   sophisticated  investors  are  now  defined   as

individuals  with  total  net personal  assets  exceeding  $2

million  or  whose income in the last 12 months is  not  less

than  $300,000.  For corporations, the total net assets  must

exceed $10 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends section 46 to allow the Registrar to

make   an   Exemption  Order  in  relation  to  a  class   of

prospectuses.   This allows the Registrar  to  grant  blanket

exemptions  and stipulate the conditions to be complied  with

for the issue of "preliminary" prospectus, used by issuers to

gauge market interest before the actual issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 amends section 119 to allow any person or

class  of persons to seek exemption from compliance with  the

requirements  relating  to interests other  than  shares  and

debentures.  Currently, the exemption may only be granted  to

a  public  company  in  Singapore or a public  company  of  a

proclaimed country and is registered as a foreign company  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 amends section 400 to allow for direct sales

of   unit   trusts  to  the  investor,  subject  to   certain

safeguards.

<br><br><i>Civil   and  criminal  liability  for  breach  of  disclosure requirements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the shift from merit-based regulation to a

disclosure-based  regulatory regime,  all  parties  that  are

seeking funds from the public are expected to have collective

responsibility  to issue accurate documents that  the  public

can rely on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 amends section 55 to expand the scope of civil

liability for false or misleading statements or omissions  in

a  prospectus  or  profile statement.  The  new  section  55A

provides that the person liable for the prospectus or profile

statement is required to notify the issuer or offeror  if  he

is  aware  of any material deficiencies. Section 55B provides

for the defences to persons potentially liable for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>

the prospectus or profile statement under section 55(1).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 repeals and re-enacts section 56 to provide

for criminal liability for false or misleading statements, or

omissions  in  a prospectus or profile statement,  which  are

materially adverse from the viewpoint of an investor.

<br><br><i>Improvements on submission of financial statements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 20, 21 and 22 seek to improve the submission of

financial statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 introduces a new section 200(2A) to allow a

subsidiary, which is a foreign company, to end its  financial

year  within two months before its holding company.  This  is

to facilitate timely reporting of group accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 amends section 201 to shorten the time given

for   publicly  listed  companies  to  present  their  annual

reports.   Instead of the current 6 months, a  public  listed

company must now present its profit and loss account not more

than  five  months  after the financial year-end.  Clause  22

amends  section  201A to allow the Registrar  to  exempt  the

directors  of  a  holding  company from  complying  with  the

requirement for consolidated accounts to be issued only after

receiving  the  accounts of subsidiaries.   This  will  allow

auditors   to  express  their  opinion  on  the  consolidated

financial  statements  of the subsidiaries  without  all  the

financial  statements of the subsidiaries having been  signed

off by their respective auditors.

<br><br><i>Extension of Buy-back Provisions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides all these changes to the disclosure

requirements, we are also making some amendments to the other

segments.   Let me now turn to the extension of the  buy-back

provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, companies are allowed to buy back up to 10%

of  their issued ordinary share capital within a period of 12

months.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>



Clause 13 amends section 76B to extend the share buy-back  to

preference  shares, both redeemable and non-redeemable.   The

purpose  is to give companies more flexibility in determining

their  capital  structures and improving  the  efficiency  of

their capital deployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no volume limit on the buy-back of

redeemable preference shares as such shares are not part of a

company's  permanent  capital.  In  contrast,  non-redeemable

preference shares are part of a company's permanent  capital.

Hence,  they cannot be returned or otherwise cancelled except

in  the  event of a capital reduction exercise or liquidation

of  the company.  To protect the interests of creditors,  the

same  safeguards  for  the buy-back of ordinary  shares  will

apply  to  the buy-back of non-redeemable preference  shares.

Companies  will  be allowed to buy back up to  10%  of  their

issued  non-redeemable  preference  share  capital  within  a

period of 12 months.

<br><br><i>Improvement on the Winding-up process of Companies and De-registration of Businesses</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the existing Companies Act and the Business

Registration  Act,  there are currently  provisions  for  the

winding-up  of  companies by the Court  and  cancellation  of

businesses  by  the Registrar if the company or  business  is

used  for  unlawful purposes, or for purposes prejudicial  to

public  peace,  welfare  or good  order,  or  on  grounds  of

national  security or interest.  However, the actual  process

and  procedures of winding up or cancellation are  not  spelt

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments seek to make clearer the

circumstances under which a company or business may be  wound

up  on grounds of national security or interest.  The winding

up  process  in the Companies Act as well as the cancellation

process   under  the  Business  Registration  Act   will   be

harmonised  with the dissolution process under the  Societies

Act.   It  clearly  spells out that  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs  is  the definitive authority on what  constitutes  a

threat to national security or interest, and the process by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>

which such companies or businesses can be wound up.

<br><br><i>Other Miscellaneous Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other miscellaneous amendments are essentially to

update  the  Act, streamline the procedures  and  to  clarify

existing  provisions.  These include amendments to allow  the

Registrar  to  rectify  the  registers  where  there   is   a

typographical  or clerical error, to clarify that  no  person

shall  make a public offer unless a prospectus or  a  profile

statement  has been registered with RCB, and that options  or

warrants would also require prospectuses if they are  offered

to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I wish to speak in support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Second Minister for Finance has said, this Bill

is  introduced  with the purpose of improving the  disclosure

requirements of public listed companies and thereby elevating

the  standards of corporate governance.  Sir, the  importance

of  good corporate governance is well accepted.  Deputy Prime

Minister BG Lee Hsien Loong has said previously, and  as  the

Minister  has  just mentioned, that world class standards  of

corporate  governance are vital pre-requisites for  Singapore

to become an international financial sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to grow as a financial centre and to

attract more foreign institutional investors, Singapore  will

need  to  have  a  high  standard  of  corporate  governance.

However, I wish to remark that in Singapore's context,  there

are  still  occasions when rumour-mongering has affected  the

share prices of some counters in the SGX which led to a  fair

amount  of speculative trading.  Recent examples are counters

in  the  electronic sector where for many weeks,  there  have

been rumours of takeover by foreign companies which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>



were   denied  by  the  companies  themselves.    Sir,   such

undesirable  practices are detrimental to the good  image  of

the SGX.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that SGX should endeavour to

curb  such  speculative rumour-mongering and also  to  remind

companies  to exercise due care in preserving price-sensitive

information,  ensure early disclosure of any  price-sensitive

information  or  discussions,  and  avoid  possible   insider

trading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in support of all the amendments that the

Minister has explained earlier.  It is known that the MAS has

set  up a few committees as part of the Government's plan  to

review  the corporate framework for good corporate governance

in  Singapore.   I  feel  that there is  one  proposal  which

deserves   serious   consideration   and   in   fact    quick

implementation, that is, to introduce quarterly reporting  of

financial   statements  or  financial  results   for   listed

companies.  Quarterly reporting has already been in place  in

the  USA  for  several years.  Malaysia has also  implemented

this policy from this year and it was implemented smoothly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that Singapore should also adopt

this  requirement of quarterly reporting so as to ensure that

the local companies will disclose their financial performance

on  a  more  regular basis.  Although this policy would  mean

more onerous accounting and reporting by companies, I believe

it   will   ensure   more  transparency  of  the   companies'

performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for the

opportunity to speak on the Companies (Amendment) Bill  which

I rise in support of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed, Sir, let me declare my interest in the

subject  matter.   As  a  practising solicitor,  I  have,  on

occasions  and  from  time  to  time  in  the  course  of  my

professional  work,  to  deal  with  the  provisions  of  the

Companies Act and its amendments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to improve, among other things, the

disclosure  requirements in the Act for offers or invitations

to  the  public; the exemptions from disclosure  requirements

and  to  widen the scope of the share buy-back provisions  in

the  Act.  I believe these amendments are part of the ongoing

review  and  reform which the Government is undertaking  with

respect to the Act and the other related legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am agreeable to the efforts of the

Government to improve the provisions of the Act, I do have  a

number of concerns that are raised by the Bill and ones which

I hope to canvass before this House today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, there is the issue of the public offer.

One appreciates that an underlying objective of the Act is to

protect  members  of the public from unscrupulous  promoters.

Here  the  Act  makes a distinction between a  public  and  a

private  offer.  Where an offer to apply for shares or  other

relevant securities is made to the public, the Act requires a

full disclosure of all material information in the form of  a

prospectus  registered with the Registry of  Companies.   The

same,  however,  is not required in cases of private  offers;

presumably because the public at large is not at risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, as with most other common law jurisdictions,

uses  the concept of the "public offer" to determine  whether

or  not  an offer of securities ought to be regulated by  the

authorities.   However, what constitutes  a  "public  offer"?

Unfortunately, "public" is an open textured word.  Except for

very specific exemptions, there is not much in the Act by way

of  guidance  as  to the constitution of a public  offer.   A

random  offer of securities to just one member of the  public

who  is  not known to the offeror may constitute an offer  to

the  public.  On the other hand, an offer that is made  to  a

sizeable number of family members and friends, even if  these

people  are just acquaintances, are not typically treated  as

public  offers.   In the first instance, a  prospectus  filed

with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>



Registry  is  necessary  whereas it  is  not  in  the  second

instance.   For  many,  it is often a  judgment  call  as  to

whether or not an offer to investors is really a public offer

for which a prospectus is required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when you think of it, the distinction between a

public  offer  and a private offer is both an artificial  and

unrealistic one.  Why should an offer randomly made  to  just

one member of the public be more deserving of protection than

an  offer  made  to a wide group of people who are  tenuously

linked to the offeror?  From my limited experience, companies

raising  funds often compile information memoranda  that  are

circulated  among interested parties.  I have  seen  many  of

these  documents  around.  Such documents  are  intended  for

private circulation and consumption.  Often there are express

words to the effect that the information memorandum does  not

constitute a public offer and therefore is not registered  as

a prospectus for the purposes of the Act.  It seems that this

is   an  accepted  practice  in  the  industry  in  order  to

circumvent,  rightly or wrongly, the prospectus  requirements

of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will appreciate that to prepare a fully

compliant  prospectus is both a costly and  labour  intensive

exercise; and this is one reason why many promoters loathe to

stray  into  areas  that require prospectus  filing  and  the

preparation  of which is subject to extensive  due  diligence

exercises, filing and declaration requirements.  In fact,  in

relation to the size of the capital to be raised, the  effort

of  compiling  and filing a prospectus may not be  worth  the

while.  Sometimes companies, especially the technology start-ups  that  do require capital are not the ones who are  in  a

position  to pay for the high transactional costs  that  come

with  the  preparation of a prospectus.  I suspect  that  the

reality  is  far from the ideal.  Many promoters, I  believe,

canvass the public widely for funds even if it was ostensibly

done in a private manner and without the proper filing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This difficulty is often compounded by the fact that the

policy  of  public  protection has  never  been  consistently

maintained.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>



For  now,  this  Bill recognises and seeks to protect,  in  a

highly  regulated and demanding manner, members of the public

in respect of investments in securities.  However, Sir, as  I

have  maintained in previous sittings of this House,  such  a

regiment  of  protection is not similarly  applied  in  other

forms of investments.  I did mention in previous sittings  of

this  House about investment promotions in Singapore of  real

estates  overseas,  of investments in time-share  apartments,

and   of   purchases  of  ostrich  eggs,   as   examples   of

inconsistency  with  which  the  subject  matter   has   been

approached by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to decide on a consistent approach on the

issue  of investor protection.  If the principle is one which

I have heard before, and that is caveat emptor, then the same

approach  should also be applied in the case of public  offer

of securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not just use the concept of a public offer as

forming  the  basis of deciding whether or not  the  activity

ought  to be regulated.  Rather, we should consider the issue

of  balance and proportion.  Does it make sense to go through

the  whole  routine of prospectus filing  for  a  small  fund

raising exercise?  Are there alternative ways to raise  funds

that  would  afford  a  better level of  protection  for  the

investors and yet at the same time not put too many obstacles

and demands on the promoter?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Sir, there are some who are of the view

that  the  onerous requirements of prospectus filing  may  be

dispensed with for small capital raising exercise.   In  such

cases,  because the exposure to the public is rather  limited

in  scope, a full compliance with the prospectus requirements

of  the  Act may not be necessary or required.  In Australia,

for   instance,  under  the  Corporations  Law,  small  scale

offerings  are  permitted  without  the  requirement   of   a

prospectus, if a person makes `personal offers' of securities

to  no  more  than 20 or fewer persons with no more  than  $2

million being raised in any rolling 12-month

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>



period.    The   Australians  have  presumably  applied   the

principle  of  caveat  emptor.  One would  suppose  that  the

limited nature of the offering in numerical terms would  help

to  moderate  the risk of massive fraud in the absence  of  a

registered prospectus.  In Singapore, for the reason that  we

have applied the principle of caveat emptor in most areas  of

investments,  we should perhaps in a consistent manner  adopt

the  example  of the Australians and similarly dispense  with

prospectus requirements for small scale offerings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having set out my comments on the broader picture, I now

turn my attention to some of the drafting details in the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the new section 45 of the

Act.   Section  45 prescribes the contents which prospectuses

must  have.  These would include, inter alia, all information

that  investors  and professional advisers should  reasonably

require  to make an informed assessment.  Incidentally,  such

prospectuses should contain information only to the extent to

which  it  is reasonable for investors and their professional

advisers to expect to find in a prospectus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to require prospectuses to contain all information

that   investors   and  their  professional  advisers   would

reasonably  require  is  to  place  unnecessary  and  overtly

onerous  burden on the people concerned.  While every  effort

would  be made by the directors and professional advisers  to

provide  all information, whether or not all information  has

been  provided  is  always determined  with  the  benefit  of

hindsight.   Until then, one can never be certain whether  or

not  all  information  has  been  provided,  and  until  such

information is challenged, the parties concerned would always

be  unsure  as  to whether or not they have discharged  their

duties in this regard.  I note that under subsection (2), the

information required should relate to what is reasonable  for

the  investors and their professional advisers to find in the

prospectus and such information extends only to what is known

and  in  the  circumstances ought  reasonably  to  have  been

obtained by making enquiries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>



Nonetheless,  the  burden still remains and  the  element  of

uncertainty will always be there.  I would therefore urge the

Minister to consider moderating the language of section 45 in

order  to  reduce the extent of the burden placed  on  people

providing such information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsections 3(b) and (d) of section 45 appear to be

repetitive at first brush.  On closer examination, it appears

that  information is to be provided on the corporation  whose

shares are the subject matter of the offer whether or not  it

is  the corporation that is offering the shares or the person

having  a  controlling  interest in the  corporation  who  is

offering the shares.  If that were the case, subsections  (b)

and   (d)   should  have  been  drafted  as  one  subsection.

Additionally, in the way it is drafted, subsection (d)  gives

rise  to uncertainties as there is no definition of what  the

word  "control" means and the words "underlie  the  offer  or

invitation"  could  have simply been  substituted  with  "the

corporation whose shares are being offered".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 38 of the Act by replacing it

with  a new provision.  On a plain reading of the new section

48(1) and (2), it seems that subsection (1) is repetitive and

could  have  been  done  away  with  altogether.   Sir,  both

subsections  deal with the prohibition against advertisements

unless  the provisions of the Act are complied with.  I  fail

to  see, Sir, why subsection (1) should be there in the first

place.  Perhaps the Minister could explain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under subsection (4) of section 48, it is a further

requirement that an advertisement of an offer or an intention

to  offer shares must contain certain additional information.

These   would   include,  for  instance,  a  statement   that

identifies the offeror and the shares or debentures or  units

of  shares  or  debentures.   Unfortunately,  Sir,  what  the

section does not indicate is how the information required  by

the  section  is  to be passed on to members of  the  public.

Very  often, Sir, either in the print media or on television,

the  obligatory reference to these statements is carried  out

either in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>



fine  print or in quick flashes across the screen, such  that

it  made  a  mockery  of the mandatory requirement  that  the

information be set out clearly in the advertisement.  This is

clearly  an  instance where the people concerned  would  just

notionally  comply with the requirements of the Act  but  are

not  necessarily in keeping with its spirit by ensuring  that

the  information  required under subsection  (4)  is  clearly

passed on to the readers or the audience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (8) of section 48 provides that an

advertisement   or  publication  does  not   contravene   the

prohibition  in  the section, amongst other  things,  if  the

document is a notice or report by the corporation or  one  of

its  offices about its affairs to the Exchange or is a report

by  the  corporation  or  one of its  offices  of  a  general

meeting.   There are several other exceptions in the section.

It  would  appear  that  this section  presupposes  documents

calling  attention to an offer to be advertisements.  Against

this  white canvass, rather detailed exceptions are set  out.

Sir, in law, we have the principle that express inclusion  is

implied exclusion.  While the proposed amendment seeks to set

out  a comprehensive list of documents that would be exempted

from  the  advertising  restriction,  it  nonetheless  raises

queries  in respect of other documents that are not  referred

to  therein and that may therefore potentially qualify as  an

advertisement  for  the purposes of the Act.   For  instance,

section  210  schemes may inadvertently  be  caught  by  this

definition  because there are potentially schemes that,  when

implemented, would draw the public's attention to an offer of

shares  or  intended  offer of shares.   Additionally,  there

could  also  be  certain directors' reports  which,  on  some

occasions,  may  be publicly published that are  not  covered

under the exceptions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than clearing any confusion, specific exemptions

on  some  advertisements give rise to the greater concern  of

whether other documents not referred to in the subsection are

necessarily  advertisements  simply  because  they  are   not

specifically  mentioned in the subsection.  After  all,  Sir,

express inclusion is implied exclusion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill revises section 55 of the Act,

Sir.   Section 55, Sir, as you are aware, sets out the  civil

liability  for false and misleading statements and omissions.

Under  subsection (1), the Act provides that persons referred

to in subsection (3) shall be liable to compensate any person

who suffers loss or damage as a result of false or misleading

statements in or omissions from the prospectus or the profile

statement,  even  if  such persons are not  involved  in  the

making  of  false  or misleading statement or  the  omission.

Subsection  (3)  sets  out a list of  such  persons  and,  in

particular,  includes a person named in the  prospectus  with

his  consent  as  having  made the  statement.   That  person

typically  would  refer  to  the  professional  such  as  the

accountants, the valuers and the solicitors.  Subsection 3(e)

also  provides that the person named in the prospectus  shall

be  liable  in respect of the inclusion of that statement  in

the document.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subsection (e) when read with subsection (1) is not

clear.  While it is understandable that a valuer who puts his

report  in  the prospectus would be liable for the  valuation

and  nothing  else,  one would like  to  know  the  scope  of

liability  for,  say, the solicitor in the  prospectus  whose

name has been included in the prospectus with his consent but

whose  involvement  in the drafting of the  prospectus  would

make  it  difficult  for  him  to  be  attributable  to   any

particular   statement.   Indeed,  one   would   have   great

difficulty   locating  any  specific   statement   as   being

attributable  specifically to the solicitor  or  the  auditor

since they typically provide broad and general advice on  the

drafting of the prospectus.  Indeed, in some cases, it is the

solicitors  who  are  responsible for  the  drafting  of  the

prospectus.  Does it mean therefore, Sir, that the  solicitor

or  the auditor is responsible for the entire content in  the

prospectus or the profile statement since subsection (1) says

the  person  shall  be  liable even if such  person  was  not

involved  in the making of the false or misleading  statement

or  the  omission?  If it were so, the burden would  be  very

heavy on the professional advisors indeed.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>



flipside,  on  the other hand, is that professional  advisors

would  take  extreme  caution  in  the  preparation  of   the

prospectus  and the profile statement.  This would invariably

add to the cost of documentation.  I am not sure whether such

an outcome would necessarily serve the interest of Singapore.

Perhaps, the Minister could clarify the ambiguity here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends section 76(B) of the Act by widening

the   scope  of  share  buy-back  to  include,  inter   alia,

preference  shares as well.  In our earlier debate  when  the

Act  was  amended to accommodate share buy-back, I understand

that  the 10% threshold was a ceiling arbitrarily set because

of  the  relative uncertainty as to how share  buy-backs  are

likely  to  be  implemented  in Singapore.   Looking  at  the

overall scheme of things, one wonders why there needs  to  be

any  ceiling  on  share buy-backs at all.   Ultimately,  what

matters most is that the company must be solvent at the  time

when  the  share buy-backs exercise is carried out.   If  the

company  wishes to run its capital down by a margin  of  more

than 10%, I cannot see why we should put any restrictions  on

the  company to undertake such an exercise if the company  is

solvent.   I  would therefore like to urge  the  Minister  to

consider,  for future exercises, whether or not to  lift  the

10% restriction in respect of share buy-backs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the amendments to protect the interests of investors.

I  agree  with  the  need for greater disclosure  and  better

governance.  However, I am a bit disappointed there  was  not

the same level of zeal to protect the interests of employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review the Minister spoke about has apparently not

covered this aspect.  Employees are important.  They make  or

break   the   enterprise.   And  if  the  enterprise   fails,

shareholders  will only lose the money they invested  in  the

enterprise.   Employees, on the other  hand,  stand  to  lose

their  livelihood if the enterprise fails.  Through salaries,

employees maintain their families, their standard of  living,

send  their children to school, service their homes,  housing

loans and a whole lot of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>



things.   The  price of losing one's livelihood  compared  to

losing money in an investment is very much more painful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 328 of the Act gives greater retrenchment

benefits,  workman's  compensation, CPF contributions,  leave

pay, preference in the event of a liqudiation.  This is right

and  it is good.  However, the maximum of five months' salary

or  $7,500, whichever is lower, was fixed in an amendment  in

1993.  It was seven years ago.  The average wage in 1993  was

$1,918.   In  1999,  the average monthly wage  has  risen  to

$2,813.  This reflects an increase of nearly $900 or 47%.   I

submit that it is actually time to adjust this figure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect I would like to see is an amendment

regarding judicial management.  It is silent over monies owed

to  workers.   Under  judicial management,  workers  are  not

preferential  creditors.  Workers tend to  lose  if  judicial

management  fails.   This appears to be a contradiction  with

section  328  of the Act.  I therefore urge the  Minister  to

consider these aspects and make amendments to better  protect

the interests of workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

Bill.  However, I would like to make a couple of comments  on

clauses affecting the financial statements.  I would like  to

express relief that foreign subsidiaries will, in future,  be

allowed  to  adopt a financial end which is up to two  months

earlier than that of the parent company.  In addition,  there

will  be  the  avenue for a specified or class  of  companies

within   the  group,  whether  incorporated  in  or  out   of

Singapore,  to  be  exempted  from  compliance  with  section

201(a)(6).   For a long time now, groups have been  agonising

over the provision of section 200 which requires a subsidiary

to  have  a  year end which is coterminous with that  of  the

parent  company  and section 201(a) which requires  that  the

audited  accounts  of all the subsidiaries must  be  received

before the audited consolidated account of the parent can  be

issued.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon for groups to comprise 50 or more

companies.  Making it compulsory for all the companies in the

group  to have a coterminous year end stretches the resources

of  the  accounting department.  If some of the  subsidiaries

are  established  in  countries  where  there  is  a  limited

accounting resource and where the accounting needs are vastly

different  from the standards set in Singapore, it becomes  a

nightmare.  The proposed changes are therefore welcomed as it

provides vital relief to a problem faced by a growing  number

of  companies as they regionalise.  The requirement  proposed

by  the  Bill  is  to gazette exemption from compliance  with

section  201(a)(6).  As few members of the public would  have

access  to the gazette, I suggest that the directors'  report

should disclose this fact on the face of it together with the

grounds  for the exemption.  This will alert the  readers  of

the  accounts  that such exemption has been granted  and  the

reasons  behind it so that they can form their own  judgement

and react to the exclusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a relief that public listed companies have to

hold  their AGM within five months of the financial year end.

It has been rumoured that the change would be to require such

AGM  to  be  held  within four months in  the  light  of  the

forthcoming application of certain new or revised  accounting

standards  which  expands the disclosure  regime.   In  time,

public listed companies would be eager to hold their AGM even

earlier  to  demonstrate their efficiency and good  corporate

governance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me thank

Members for their comments and various suggestions.   Let  me

first explain the context by which this Amendment Bill is put

up.   As  Members are aware, we have three committees led  by

the  private  sector to look at the whole  range  of  issues.

There  is the Committee on Company Legislation and Regulatory

Framework  which will review the Companies Act.   The  second

committee is on Disclosure and Accounting Standards

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>



which  Mr  Gerard  Ee  referred to.  And  there  is  a  third

Committee   on  Corporate  Governance  on  what   constitutes

corporate  governance and how we should bring  our  standards

closer to the best practices in the world.  While these three

committees  are  doing  and reviewing  their  work  and  they

project  that  they  will  be able to  come  out  with  their

recommendations some time next year, we felt it necessary  to

make  these  amendments to the Companies  Act  following  the

recommendations of the Corporate Finance Committee.  So  this

Amendment Bill is very much a work in progress while many  of

the  other  issues  which  Members  raised  are  still  being

resolved by the three committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to assure Members who raised these

suggestions that these issues are indeed taken care of by the

three committees, as I am sure you are all aware, and in  the

course  of  their deliberations, they will take the  Members'

views  into consideration.  So I would like to thank  Members

for  their comments.  But for the purpose of putting in place

some  of  the recommendations put up by the Corporate Finance

Committee,  we felt it necessary to introduce this  first  so

that  it  does not impede the workings in the companies.   We

all  know that the business world is very varied and a single

Act like the Companies Act will have to cover a wide range of

circumstances  and therefore this requires  quite  a  lot  of

deliberations and work.  So I hope Members will bear with  us

while we let these three committees do their work and we will

come  back  to  the  House  some time  next  year  with  more

comprehensive amendments to the Companies Act after  we  have

done a review of the accounting and disclosure standards  and

after   we   have  gone  through  the  corporate   governance

standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>OATHS AND DECLARATIONS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current law on oaths and declarations can be

found  in three Acts: the Oaths Act, the Oaths of Office  and

Allegiance  Act,  and  the Statutory Declarations  Act.   All

three  Acts  were enacted in the late 1800s.   Last  year,  a

Committee  established by the Attorney-General  reviewed  the

law  on  oaths and declarations and recommended that  it  was

timely  to  amend  and consolidate the three  Acts  into  one

comprehensive Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Oaths and Declarations Bill gives effect to the

Committee's  recommendations and will repeal and  consolidate

the  provisions of the three Acts into one Act.  In  drafting

the  Bill,  we  have also taken the opportunity to  eliminate

obsolete   provisions  from  the  three  existing  Acts   and

modernise the language used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also sever links with the UK Statutory

Declarations  Act  of  1835  brought  in  by  virtue  of  the

Statutory  Declarations  Act which  simply  states  that  the

United  Kingdom's  Statutory  Declarations  Act  is  part  of

Singapore  law.   The Bill will enable us  to  have  our  own

legislation on statutory declarations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight some salient features of the

Bill.

<br><br><i>Part II (Oaths)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of four provisions, Part II of the

Bill  re-enacts the provisions of the existing Oaths  Act  in

modern language and drafting style.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two provisions concern the power of courts to

allow  oaths and affirmations in customary forms  other  than

those  provided  in  the Act.  These provisions  are  largely

historical and were intended to cater to our largely  migrant

society in the past, where different

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>

communities carried with them different customs on how  oaths

were to be made.  They are no longer relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third provision which has not been re-enacted

concerns  the  summary power of the High Court and  Court  of

Appeal  to  summarily  punish a  witness  who  has  committed

perjury before it for contempt of court without the need  for

a  separate trial.  This provision is unnecessary as specific

powers  of  punishment for contempt in the face of the  court

are  already found in the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and

the Subordinate Courts Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth provision which has not been re-enacted

is  the  one which says that the Oaths Act does not apply  to

proceedings  before courts martial.  There is no  reason  why

the  provisions of the Oaths Act re-enacted in Part II of the

Bill,  except for clause 7 which deals with form of oath  and

affirmation, should not apply to courts martial.

<br><br><i>Part III (Statutory Declarations)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provisions of Part III of the Bill on statutory

declarations  are  drawn mainly from similar  laws  found  in

Australia,   New  Zealand  and  Hong  Kong.   The  provisions

prescribe the form and manner in which statutory declarations

may be made in Singapore, and the manner in which they may be

made outside Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The making, use or attempted use, of a false statutory

declaration  is  an offence under clause 14, punishable  with

imprisonment of up to three years and a fine.  If  the  false

statutory  declaration  is  made  for  use,  is  used  or  is

attempted  to be used, in any stage of a judicial proceeding,

the maximum imprisonment term is increased to seven years.  A

false  statutory declaration made outside Singapore which  is

used  or  intended to be used in Singapore is also punishable

under clause 14.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a consequential amendment is made by clause 20 to

the  Criminal Procedure Code to include the offence in clause

14  among  the offences for which the sanction of the  Public

Prosecutor  is  required before a prosecution  can  be  made.

This brings the clause 14 offence in line with other perjury-related offences.

<br><br><i>Part IV (Oaths of Office and Allegiance)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Part IV essentially re-enacts the provisions of the

Oaths  of  Office and Allegiance Act in modern  language  and

drafting style.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is another example of law reform efforts

undertaken  by the Government to modernise and  simplify  our

laws, to make it more accessible to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

<div align="center"><b>ESTATE DUTY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Budget Speech this year, I announced a series of

measures  to encourage innovation, creativity and  enterprise

in  Singapore.   To create a more conducive  environment  for

entrepreneurial development, one of the measures was to allow

a Singapore residential property used for business activities

to  also  qualify for estate duty exemption.  This is allowed

so  long as the residential character of the property is  not

materially affected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change will support the Technopreneur Home Office

Scheme introduced last year.  It will also allow small

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>



businesses to be carried out from a residential home  without

the  property  being automatically disqualified  from  estate

duty  exemption.   Accordingly,  the  proposed  amendment  to

section  14(5A) seeks to include residential properties  used

for businesses under the $9 million exemption for residential

properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in section 14(6) is a change in the

definition  of  "dwelling house" as used in the  Estate  Duty

Act.   This  amendment will explicitly exclude  quarters  and

hostels  from dwelling houses.  This will make it clear  that

residential properties used as hostels and quarters will  not

qualify for the $9 million exemption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two amendments in this Bill seek to improve

the estate duty procedures administered by IRAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the estate duty affidavit will be replaced by an

estate duty return.  At present, affidavits are required  for

estate  duty  submissions, one for non-dutiable  estates  and

another  for  dutiable estates.  These  are  sworn  documents

which  require the endorsement of a Commissioner of Oaths  or

the Commissioner of Estate Duty.  The estate duty return will

do away with the need for the oath.  There will be a standard

form for dutiable estates, and another standard form for non-dutiable  estates.  The return for non-dutiable estates  will

be much simplified compared to the current affidavit: it will

ask  for  fewer details.  The return continues to be a  legal

document  admissible as evidence in court.  The administrator

has  to  make  sure  that the return  is  free  of  error  or

misrepresentation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second proposal allows the Commissioner of Estate

Duty to delegate his authority to his senior officers to sign

the   certificates,  schedules  of  assets  and  Notices   of

Assessment  under  the Estate Duty Act.   The  delegation  of

authority  will  improve overall efficiency  and  allow  IRAS

greater flexibility in case processing.  The quality  of  the

assessment will not be compromised as the authority  will  be

delegated  only to experienced senior officers in supervisory

positions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I rise to support the Bill. I think that

it  is  very tidy to relook at the laws and bring  them  into

consistency with other new initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that spirit, may I raise another anomaly in the

Estate Duty Act for the Ministry to consider.  Sir, in making

these comments, I appreciate that the general trend in estate

duty  has  been  to make it less onerous in  order  to  allow

people  who  have worked hard in their lifetime  to  pass  on

property to their loved ones after their death.  And this  is

especially for dwelling houses, an exemption of $9 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the present law, if a person owns a house

solely and this person dies, there is no estate duty so  long

as  his  house is a dwelling house and it is valued  at  less

than  $9 million.  The anomaly I would point to, however,  is

that  it  differs if he has purchased the house in the  joint

names of himself and his spouse - his wife or her husband.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, under the standing provision of

section  8(1)(b), if a man buys a house with his own purchase

money  and  puts it in the name of himself and his  wife  and

then, if he should unfortunately die within five years, this,

I  understand,  is  treated as a gift and  would  be  subject

therefore  to estate duty tax.  This seems to  me  to  be  an

anomaly, because, as I said, if he had purchased it and  kept

it  solely  in his name, there would be no tax accruing.   It

also  seems to me to be a potentially unfair decision on  the

surviving  spouse since there will be more tax  payable  and,

perhaps, at a late stage in life, there may not be that  much

cash to meet the tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry might consider this anomaly

and,  if  it is found justifiable, to remedy it in a  further

provision.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> My Ministry will look again into

this  particular clause, but I want to point out that if  the

transaction is made within the 5-year period, then of  course

the issue does not arise.  It is only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>



when  a  person dies before the 5-year period that  the  gift

condition applies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>ACCOUNTANTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House seeks to amend the Accountants

Act  (Cap.  2A) to enable accounting firms to  be  formed  as

accounting  corporations  with  limited  liability;  and   to

improve  the registration and de-registration procedures;  as

well  as the disciplinary and inquiry proceedings for  public

accountants.

<br><br><i>Allowing incorporation as an additional business structure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, accounting practices in Singapore can operate

only  as  sole proprietorships or partnerships.   Hence,  all

partners  in  an  accounting firm can be  sued  if  a  single

partner is errant.  This may have been all right in the  past

when  accounting  firms were expected to  be  small  set-ups.

However, in today's globalised environment, this is no longer

realistic.   The Bill will allow for accounting corporations,

in  addition to existing business structures.  The Government

is  not  advocating  that accountants  adopt  any  particular

business structure or model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main features of accounting corporations are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it allows for a better framework for professional

accountability,   where  the  innocent   public   accountants

practising in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>



an accounting corporation will not be jointly liable with the

errant  ones.   The errant public accountant  will  still  be

liable under the law of tort, without a statutory cap on  his

liability.    This  is  to  ensure  that  public  accountants

maintain high standards of professional duty and care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, corporatisation allows accounting practices to

raise   external  capital.   Access  to  external   financing

increases  the competitiveness and global reach of accounting

corporations, and is in line with the Government's drive  for

regionalisation and globalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it allows non-public accountants to be directors

and  shareholders  in an accounting corporation,  subject  to

regulatory  safeguards.  In an accounting  partnership,  only

public accountants can be partners.

<br><br><i>Regulation of accounting corporations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounting corporations will be incorporated under the

Companies Act and will be subject to the Companies Act.   The

corporation  must also be approved by the Public  Accountants

Board.    Some   of  the  key  safeguards  to  maintain   the

independence   and   professional   standards    of    public

accountants,  who  are  key  players  in  ensuring  effective

compliance with disclosure requirements and the integrity  of

our corporate environment, include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the primary object of the accounting corporation

must  be  to  provide  public  accountancy  services.   These

services  include audit and reporting on financial statements

and  other  acts that are required to be done by an  approved

company  auditor under the Companies Act or under  any  other

written  law.  They do not include services such as  taxation

and consultancy services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, accounting corporations must have a minimum

authorised   share  capital  of  $50,000.   To  ensure   that

ownership  and control of accounting corporations  remain  in

the  hands of public accountants, at least two-thirds of  the

voting shares of an accounting corporation must be owned by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>



corporate practitioners.  A corporate practitioner refers  to

a  director or an employee of the corporation who is a public

accountant and is practising as such in that corporation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to ensure the independence of the accounting

corporation,  all  shareholders  must  be  natural   persons.

Shareholding by nominees and securitization of any  share  in

an  accounting corporation are prohibited.  This  is  because

accounting corporations will be auditing other companies, and

we need to ensure that these audits are independent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, to ensure that parties contracting with an

accounting corporation are adequately protected in the  event

of  a  breach  of contract or negligence on the part  of  the

accounting   corporation,  it  is  mandatory  for  accounting

corporations  to  take  up professional indemnity  insurance.

The minimum amounts are as stated in the Bill.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing for the incorporation of accountants will

facilitate  the  creation of a more vibrant  and  competitive

accounting services sector in Singapore, to better  meet  the

challenges of the global economy in this new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to the

Public Accountants Board's Sub-Committee, chaired by the then

Accountant-General, Mr Goh Khee Kuan, and  members  from  the

Institute  of Certified Public Accountants of Singapore,  the

Nanyang Technological University, the Singapore Exchange, the

Attorney-General's  Chambers, and the Registry  of  Companies

and  Businesses,  for working on the issues  which  form  the

content  of  this Amendment Bill.  Inputs were also  obtained

from the Association of Banks in the drafting of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I wish to speak in support of

the Accountants (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in total agreement with the proposal that

accounting  firms should be allowed to form Public Accounting

Corporations  (PACs).   Essentially, this  means  that  local

accounting firms will be allowed to corporatise. The  benefit

is  that  after corporatisation, local firms can look towards

mergers  to  form  bigger  companies  or  to  form  strategic

alliances  with  overseas  firms. Corporatisation  will  also

enable local firms to adopt more professional practices which

will  facilitate recruiting and retaining of good  staff.  It

also  removes  the  onerous responsibility of  unlimited  and

collective responsibility as in the case of partnerships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to take this opportunity to raise a point

not  covered  in  this  Bill and that is  on  advertising  by

professional  firms.  I note that current rules which  govern

the  conduct  of professional firms such as accounting  firms

are  that  they  are  not allowed to openly  advertise  their

services.   I would like to suggest that this restriction  be

reviewed.   Professional firms should be allowed to  do  some

limited  form  of  responsible  advertising.   I  feel   that

permitting  advertisement will be beneficial, especially  for

the  smaller local firms.  Large accounting firms, especially

the  foreign  ones, are already very well-known  and  do  not

require   advertising  to  publicise   their   services   and

expertise.   Moreover, large foreign firms  get  ample  press

coverage of their activities or coverage of events which they

can afford to sponsor.  On the contrary, small firms have  no

means  of  publicising their expertise and  services.  Hence,

there  is a need to review and relax on the advertising rules

so  that  small firms can advertise and let their prospective

clients know more about the services that they can offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to point out that the Government should

consider similar relaxation of rules on advertising for other

professional firms such as the lawyers, architects, engineers

and  others,  and  also  allowing them to  corporatise  their

services.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, I stand to support the Accountants

(Amendment) Bill.  However, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



would  like to seek clarifications on several parts  of  this

Bill.

<br><br><i>New section 18A - Approval for accounting corporation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new section 18A(3)(b), c(i) and c(ii) incorporates

the phrase "as may be prescribed".  I am of the view that the

aforesaid phrase creates an area of ambiguity as to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) who may make the prescription; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the mechanism prior to making such a prescription.

Should there not be an additional clause added at the end  of

this part to clarify the aforesaid ambiguity, for example,  a

clause  titled  "Rules  on  Accounting  Corporations"?   This

clause can be worded in the same manner as section 81H and of

the  Legal  Profession  Act (Cap  161  of  the  1997  Revised

Edition), namely:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Minister may, after consulting the Board, make

rules for the purposes of this Part;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) without prejudice to the generality of sub-section

(1),  any  rules made thereunder may provide for  prescribing

anything which may be prescribed under this Part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Minister whether there is a

typographical   error  in  new  section   18A(3)(b)   namely,

"$50,000".   Is  it correct to have a comma  at  the  end  of

"$50,000"?

<br><br><i>New section 18(I) - Shares of accounting corporation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new section 18(I)(7) does not state the

commencement  date of the grace period, whereas  new  section

18(I)(9)  sets out the commencement date.  In this regard,  I

am  of  the  opinion  that new section  18(I)(7)  creates  an

uncertainty as to the commencement date of the grace  period.

I  am of the view that without the necessary clarification as

to  the  commencement  date, the same  is  capable  of  being

interpreted as follows:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the date of application to the Board;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the date of the Board's order;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the date of cessation as a public accountant; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the date of cessation as a director or an employee

of the accounting corporation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it not be better to have new section 18(I)(7) read

like  new  sections  18(I)(8) and  18(I)(9)  to  clarify  the

commencement date for new section 18(I)(7)?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also notice that the said clause does not state

the consequence of a non-transfer of the voting shares.  Will

it  not  be more complete if another clause can be  added  to

this  part  on "Additional grounds for winding up  Accounting

Corporation"?

<br><br><i>New section 18(K) - Management of accounting corporation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am of the view that this clause, in particular,

the  one-month period to source for another public accountant

to  fill the vacancy of directorship may be difficult for  an

accounting   corporation   with  only   two   directors   cum

shareholders  to comply with in the event of the directorship

being vacated.  May I ask the Minister whether the accounting

corporation  can be permitted to apply to the  Board  for  an

extension  of  time  to comply with this  clause  before  the

expiry  of the one-month period?  May I also suggest that  an

accounting corporation be granted the right of appeal against

the Board's decision to the Ministry in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, before

I  proceed  to  comment on the Bill, I  wish  to  declare  my

interest  as a partner in a Big 5 public accounting firm  and

as  the  Vice-President of the Institute of Certified  Public

Accountants.   I  was  also  a member  of  the  sub-committee

established by the Public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



Accountants   Board  to  study  the  incorporation   of   the

accounting profession which led to the introduction  of  this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard this House engaged in a lively debate

earlier this year to allow legal practitioners to set up  law

corporations,   members  of  the  accounting  profession   in

Singapore  generally  expect that the option  to  incorporate

will  be  extended to accountants.  The introduction of  this

Bill   to  allow  public  accountants  to  establish   Public

Accounting  Corporations  (PACs) has  therefore  been  widely

anticipated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Government's adoption of the

principle  for  professionals in  Singapore  to  incorporate.

Right  now, the engineering, architectural, medical and legal

professions  can  opt  to  adopt the incorporation  route  in

Singapore.   The  passing  of this Bill  will  enable  public

accountants to similarly elect to embrace a corporate model.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the Government for recognising the need to

grant the professions in Singapore the option to incorporate.

It   is  imperative  that  members  of  all  professions   in

Singapore,  including  public  accountants,  are  given   the

opportunity  to incorporate. After all, accounting  firms  in

jurisidictions,  such as the United States  of  America,  the

United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Hong  Kong

can opt to incorporate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment in Singapore, however, accounting firms

can only operate as sole proprietors or partnerships based on

unlimited  joint and several liability.  If the firm's  asset

is inadequate to meet a claim, the personal assets of all the

partners in the firm are liable for the claim.  Given today's

incredulously massive amount of claims, all it takes  is  for

just  one  partner's  deficiency  to  annihilate  the  entire

lifetime  earnings of the other partners in the  firm.   This

unlimited  liability factor can act as  a  deterrent  to  the

growth of the accounting firm and the profession as a whole.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a PAC, an accountant's liability will no longer be

unlimited in respect of his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



partner's  shortcomings.  This, it must be  noted,  does  not

mean  that  the  clients of a PAC will not be protected.   In

this  regard, ample safeguards have been provided for in  the

Bill.   A  minimum capital of $50,000 is required to  form  a

PAC.   A  PAC is also required to have an adequate  level  of

professional  indemnity  insurance  cover,  ranging  from  $1

million  to $50 million, depending on the number of corporate

practitioners and the gross income of the PAC.  As  with  the

legal  profession,  limited liability  will  not  affect  the

professional standards of accountants in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my other reason for supporting the Bill is because

incorporation   will   allow  professionals   to   reposition

themselves  in  the  New  Economy  business  landscape.   The

digital  transformation has attached a high  premium  to  the

application   of  human  know-how.   In  our  knowledge-based

economy,  intellectual asset has become critical  and  highly

valued.   Incorporation will lend a hand to accounting  firms

seeking   to  counter  the  fierce  clamouring  for   limited

knowledge  resources.  It will render it easier for  PACs  to

recruit  and  retain valued staff against the ardent  rivalry

for  talents  from other corporations and institutions,  both

locally  and  internationally.   By  offering  more  flexible

remuneration packages, including employee stock options, PACs

will be better positioned to be the employer of choice in the

marketplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incorporation will also facilitate PACs to raise more

capital to gain a wider reach for their services.  The leeway

to  allow  one-third  of the PAC's shareholders  to  be  non-practitioners  will breed a more multi-disciplinary  business

orientation  within the PAC, greatly enhancing  its  capacity

and  capability  to  provide clients  with  seamless  service

delivery,   whilst   still  maintaining   the   PAC's   audit

independence.    Hence,   incorporation   can   provide   our

professionals with the critical structural support to elevate

them  to a platform to compete with the world's best.  But  I

must qualify that incorporation is not a panacea for business

woes.  It is not a pill prescribed to resurrect failing  sole

proprietorships or partnerships.  Instead, this Bill is meant

to enable the accounting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



profession, as a whole, to move forward with the times,  keep

pace  with world-wide development in the profession and  meet

the  growing needs of the business community.  It will create

an environment that is more conducive for the development and

better  practice of the accounting profession  in  Singapore.

The  introduction of this Bill is therefore  appropriate.   I

would  like, however, to raise two points for the  Minister's

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my first point is on the capping of liability. We

should  make a clear distinction between the PACs  and  other

companies  under  the  Companies Act.  This  is  because  the

claims  against  professionals in general and accountants  in

particular are grossly disproportionate to the fees that they

earn.  Such claims are neither fair nor equitable.  They  are

not  fair,  as the claims made against accountants  are  many

manifold  times  the amount of fees charged.   They  are  not

equitable,  as  the  claims  made against  the  auditors  are

usually   more  excessive  than  that  pursued  against   the

management   at  fault.   Because,  unlike  the   PACs,   the

management  do  not  need  to take up mandatory  professional

indemnity insurance cover under the Companies Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is absurd to expect an auditor, who clearly did

not  connive  to  bring  down a  company,  to  be  sued  more

excessively than the management directly responsible for  the

company's  collapse.  There is no question that if at  fault,

the  auditor  must be personally liable.  But it  is  clearly

unreasonable  to penalise the PAC and auditor  more  severely

than  the management for a failure that the auditor  did  not

directly bring to bear upon the company.  If the accountant's

exposure  to claims remains unlimited under the law of  tort,

there  is little incentive for a sole proprietor or  a  small

accounting practice to convert to a PAC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned to the House in January this year,

the    tendency   for   escalating   claims   made    against

professionals, including lawyers and accountants, is  due  to

the "deep pocket" syndrome.  Claimants

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



are  somehow erroneously led to believe that accountants  and

other   professionals  can  afford  grossly  disproportionate

claims  due to their extensive insurance cover.  In  reality,

the  indemnity pockets of the professionals may not  be  deep

enough.   This is because, on the one hand, the  capacity  of

the professional indemnity insurance market is shrinking.  On

the other hand, the quantum of claims has been escalating  to

such  astonishing levels that it has become really impossible

for  individual  accountants or accounting firms  to  recover

from  large claims.  Instead, a single successful  claim  can

easily  and  completely  wipe out the life-time  earnings  of

individual  public accountants.  If there is a threshold  for

reasonable  claims,  the current sky-high  amount  of  claims

against  professionals has crossed the threshold  many  times

over.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, professionals are caught in a vicious

indemnity   cycle.   For  genuine  fear  of  the  impact   of

escalating  claims, the professionals are usually  left  with

little  option,  but  to take up a high  level  of  indemnity

insurance coverage that renders them more prone to law  suits

and claims.  Sir, there should be a capping on the amount  of

claims  against professionals, so that the amount  of  claims

bears a fairer resemblance to the fees charged.  For example,

the  claims could be capped based on a fixed multiple of  the

amount of fees charged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first proposed the capping of liability for

professionals in the debate on law corporations earlier  this

year,  the  Minister of State was concerned that the  capping

may  lead  a  lawyer  to  lower his guard,  and  hence  lower

professional standards.  This should not be a concern, as the

capping  can  be  at a reasonably high but  not  astronomical

level.    In  any  case,  the  Bill  has  provided   adequate

safeguards  in  respect  of the  PAC.   A  PAC  must  provide

adequate  insurance  cover  of between  $1  million  and  $50

million,  depending  on the size of the practice.   Negligent

practitioners  can  be  struck off  the  Register  of  Public

Accountants  and lose their livelihood through the  practice.

More significantly, as an individual public accountant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



will be liable under the law of tort, whilst his partners are

not jointly liable in their personal capacity for claims,  we

can  expect individual accountants to be more circumspect  in

their  statutory  roles.  Hence, I am of the  view  that  the

capping   of liability will not affect professional standards

and  substance.   On  this  basis, can  the  Minister  please

clarify whether a capping on the liability for professionals,

particularly   public  accountants  in  the  PAC,   will   be

considered?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point concerns exempt private status. I

wish   to   seek  clarification  on  whether  a  wholly-owned

subsidiary  of the PAC can be deemed to be an exempt  private

company.  According to the Bill, PACs will be granted  exempt

private  status.   A  PAC may decide  to  give  some  of  its

departments  more autonomy to manage their own  finances  and

operations.   The  PAC  directors  may  decide  that  in  the

interest of growing the business, these departments should be

restructured as wholly owned subsidiaries of the PAC, so that

they  can  be more autonomous in operations.  Also, different

HR policies and salary structures may give rise to a need for

a  line  of  business to be hived off under a separate  legal

entity.   A PAC should be given the freedom to structure  its

business   in  this  way,  with  its  subsidiaries  similarly

enjoying  exempt private status.  But this should be  on  the

basis that the subsidiaries must be wholly owned by the  PAC.

So long as the PAC is not disqualified and continues to be an

exempt  private  company,  can the Minister  clarify  whether

wholly  owned  subsidiaries  of  a  PAC  will  similarly   be

considered exempt private companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these two points which I hope the Minister can

consider, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

Bill.   Being the fifth speaker and speaking after  the  Vice

President  of  the ICPAS, I find that much  of  what  I  have

planned  to say have been said.  So, I shall zoom in to  lend

support to the two points that I share great concern.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is on the capping of liability. The objective of

the  public  accounting corporations  is  to  afford  limited

liability to the members as opposed to a partnership.  As the

Minister has said, under tort, the individual would not enjoy

such protection and can be sued for unlimited amounts.  I can

see  that,  in  practice, no individual will  be  willing  to

accept the responsibility for signing off accounts unless  he

obtains  cross  indemnity from the rest of his  members.   If

that  happens,  it  would negate the benefit  that  a  public

accounting operation serves to provide.  Therefore, I wonder,

as  Mr Ong wonders, whether it is possible to legislate a cap

on the quantum of a claim from a piece of work to be based on

a multiple of the fees charged for that piece of work.   This

will  certainly achieve a more equitable relationship between

practitioner and client.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Leong, I would like to make reference also to a

relaxation of advertising rules.  The Bill hints  on  such  a

possible   relaxation.   New  section  48(2A)(b)  refers   to

advertising or holding itself out or describing itself in any

way  to  be an accounting corporation or to be authorised  to

provide public accountancy services in Singapore.  Currently,

the  rules on advertising prohibit a public accountant or his

firm  from seeking professional work by means of advertising.

And  "advertising"  is  defined as "a  communication  to  the

public  of information as to the services or skills  provided

by  a public accountant or firm of public accountants with  a

view  to procuring professional business."  I am hoping  that

in  the  spirit  of  new  section  48(2A)(b),  the  rules  of

advertising  will be amended.  With a liberalisation  of  the

advertising rules, I expect to see more articles  on  various

business  aspects  to be made available  which  will  provide

nuggets of information of value to the public.  As it stands,

whilst  in  the rest of the developed world one could  easily

access interesting websites produced by accounting firms,  we

in  the  accounting profession here in Singapore  agonise  in

having  to tell people to log-on to our US or other  overseas

websites to learn more about doing business in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I answer

Members'  questions, I would like to thank all  of  them  for

supporting the Bill itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now take their questions in the order in which

they  were raised.  Mr Leong Horn Kee and later Mr Gerard  Ee

have   suggested  that  accountants  should  be  allowed   to

advertise  their services in a controlled way, in particular,

the  smaller firms which are not well known and therefore are

unable  to  compete with the larger firms.  I would  like  to

point out that the rules governing advertising by accountants

are   determined   by  the  Institute  of  Certified   Public

Accountants of Singapore (ICPAS).  I understand that ICPAS is

reviewing the issue and I will refer the Members' suggestions

to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for the questions that

she  raised  as  it gives me the opportunity to  clarify  the

ambiguities.  Dr Neo is concerned that the use  of  the  word

"prescribed" in new section 18A(3)(b), (c)(i) and (c)(ii) may

create  ambiguity.  The word means prescribed by the  Act  or

subsidiary  legislation made thereunder,  as  provided  under

Part  I, section 2(i) of the Interpretation Act.  In the case

of  the  Accountants Act, it is the rules made by the  Public

Accountants  Board with the approval of the Finance  Minister

under section 58.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On new section 18A(3)(b), the comma after "$50,000" is

not a typographical error.  It is common practice to insert a

comma before the qualifying phrase "or such other sum as  may

be prescribed."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo is also concerned that uncertainty could arise

because section 18I(7) does not state the commencement period

of  the grace period.  I do not believe that there should  be

ambiguity.   Section 18A makes it clear that  only  corporate

practitioners can own two-thirds of the protected fraction or

more  of  the  voting shares.  If the protected  fraction  of

shareholding  is not affected as a result of the  shareholder

ceasing  to be a public accountant or corporate practitioner,

neither the accounting corporation nor the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



person will apply to PAB for a grace period.  They will apply

only if the protected shareholding fraction is affected.  The

grace  period they will ask for will be from the date of  the

event  of disqualification which took place.  Otherwise,  the

accounting  corporation cannot be said to  be  in  compliance

with  section 18I at all times, thereby rendering it open  to

disciplinary action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also notes that section 18I is silent on the

issue  of the non-transfer of voting shares.  The consequence

of  non-transfer of voting shares is addressed in new section

21A(1)(f).   In  the event of a non-transfer, the  accounting

corporation  will not be in compliance with section  18I  and

its  status  as  an accounting corporation  can  be  revoked.

After  revocation, the company can still provide professional

services  other  than  public  accountancy  services  in  its

capacity as a company registered under the Companies Act  and

according to its articles of association.  The company cannot

then  hold itself out as an accounting corporation and  would

have  to  operate  under  revocation under  a  revised  name,

subject  to  the approval of the Registrar of  Companies  and

Businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo is also concerned that after the one-month period

allowed for the filling of a vacant directorship, it might be

insufficient  in  the case of an accounting corporation  with

only   two   directors.   In  this  case  of  an   accounting

corporation with only two directors, only one of  them  needs

to  be a public accountant.  If the vacancy created is for  a

director who is not a public accountant, filling the  vacancy

should   not  be  a  problem  within  the  one-month   period

stipulated.   If  the  vacancy  created  is  for   a   public

accountant  and the accounting corporation has difficulty  in

filling it within the one-month deadline, it may apply to the

Public Accountants Board for an extension of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would point out that if an accounting

corporation  is  dissatisfied  with  the  Public  Accountants

Board's  decision on this issue, it can appeal  to  the  High

Court,  as provided under section 21A(1)(f) and under section

22.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong, and later Mr Gerard Ee, have both said

that  they  would  want  a cap on the  accountant's  personal

liability,  otherwise there would be no incentives  for  sole

proprietors to form accounting corporations.  I would like to

say  that,  as  far  as  the  Government  is  concerned,  the

intention  of  this  Bill  is neither  to  encourage  nor  to

discourage    accountants   from   setting   up    accounting

corporations.   It  is  to allow for an  additional  form  of

business   structure   for   accountants   over   and   above

partnerships.    A  statutory  cap  on  auditors'   liability

suggests  that we can statutorily pre-determine the potential

damage caused by an errant auditor.  There are also two  main

disadvantages to statutory capping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, setting such a cap on the auditors' liability may

be unfair to the plaintiff as he may suffer damages caused by

the  public  accountant in excess of the cap.   Second,  high

standards of public accounting are crucial to the development

of  Singapore  as an international financial  and  investment

centre.   Statutory  capping  may indirectly  compromise  the

standards  as  the  incentives for public accountants  to  be

thorough in their work may be lowered with the knowledge that

they  will  not  be hurt badly in the event of  a  law  suit.

Other  professions  have  been  allowed  to  incorporate   in

Singapore,  namely,  the lawyers, engineers,  architects  and

doctors,  and  none of them have statutory capping  on  their

liabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Ong has also suggested that the subsidiaries

of  accounting corporations should also be treated as private

exempt   companies.   I  believe  it  would  depend  on   the

activities of these subsidiaries.  In most instances, I would

assume that the subsidiaries of auditing firms are formed  to

do  mostly  non-auditing work.  If this is the case  and  the

subsidiaries are performing non-auditing work, there would be

little  ground  for  granting  them  private  exempt  status.

However,  this  is  an area which I will undertake  to  study

further.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee:</b> Just a clarification, Sir. The

advertising rules actually appear in

advertising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Public Entertainments Act plays an important

role in maintaining law and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



order  and  public  safety, as well  as  safeguarding  public

morality and decency.  The Act regulates the different  forms

of  entertainment  to which the public has  access,  ensuring

that  the  entertainment is not carried out, for example,  in

places  not  suitable to its nature, or  with  little  or  no

regard  for  public safety, or in a manner that is  indecent,

immoral, offensive, subversive or improper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not, for instance, allow discos and nightclubs to

be  set up within residential estates, or game centres to  be

set  up in HDB shophouses.  We also ensure that the operators

of  entertainment outlets and organisers of events,  such  as

rock   concerts,  take  proper  and  adequate  crowd  control

measures to ensure public safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act was last amended in 1979 to ensure its

relevancy.   MHA is now proposing several amendments  to  the

Act  to  improve  the administration of public  entertainment

licences.    Essentially,  these  amendments  will  encourage

licensees to exercise self-discipline whilst making it easier

and  more  convenient for businesses to apply for  and  renew

their  public  entertainment  licences.   Changes  are   also

proposed to update the scope and penalties of the Act.

<br><br><i>Demerit Point System</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, let me touch on the demerit point system.

Police  will  be introducing a demerit point  system  in  the

administration of public entertainment licences of  permanent

establishments  such  as  computer games  centres,  pubs  and

discos.   Conceptually,  the demerit  point  system  will  be

similar to the Road Traffic Driver Improvement Points  System

(DIPS).   Under  this system, Police will adopt  a  graduated

enforcement  approach against licensees  for  infringing  any

licensing  conditions.   Licensees  would  be  given  demerit

points for breaching any licensing conditions.  Depending  on

the  number of demerit points accumulated, appropriate action

would  be  taken against the licensee.  This can  range  from

curtailing the operating hours of the licensee's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



business,  or  requiring the licensee to put  up  a  security

deposit.  When the licensee accumulates the maximum number of

points,  which will be prescribed in the rules, the licensing

officer  can  cancel the PE licence and forfeit the  security

deposit.   Details  of  the  demerit  point  system  will  be

contained  in  the  rules, which will  be  published  in  due

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new demerit point system improves the administration

of  licences  in  that a licensee would know  the  number  of

demerit   points  that  he  accumulates  for  breaching   any

licensing  conditions.  He also knows  that  if  he  were  to

breach  any licensing condition again, he would face  tougher

actions.   Hence,  there  is  greater  transparency  in   the

administration  of licences compared to the  current  system.

Currently, the licensee does not know with certainty what  he

would  face  if he were to breach a licensing condition.   He

could,  for  example,  receive a warning,  have  his  licence

suspended or cancelled, or face court prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the new demerit point system provides early

warning  for  minor breaches and encourages the  licensee  to

exercise  self-discipline.  Each time the knot is  tightened,

he  would  have  prior  notice that  action  is  contemplated

against  him.  He would then have an opportunity  to  explain

why  such  action should not be taken.  Further, the licensee

can appeal to the Minister if his explanation is rejected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8, 9, 11, 12 and 14 of the Bill make the

necessary amendments to the Act to put in place the framework

for a demerit point system and related procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licensing officer would still retain the powers, as

provided under section 14(1) of the existing Act, to  suspend

or  cancel a licence immediately, if the situation calls  for

it.   An  example would be where the public entertainment  is

wholly or in part indecent, immoral, offensive, subversive or

improper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act would also be amended to give the licensing

officer discretion to cancel or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



suspend a licence if he is satisfied that the licensee is  no

longer  fit  and  proper  to  hold  the  licence.   What   is

contemplated  here  is where a licensee  is  convicted  of  a

serious criminal offence during the term of his licence, such

as drug-related offences, serious sexual offences and violent

criminal offences.  This is to safeguard public interest.

<br><br><i>Improving the Administration of PE Licences Validity Period of Licences and Renewal of Licences</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also introduces changes to the validity

period of public entertainment licences to make it easier and

more  convenient for businesses.  Clause 6 of the Bill amends

section 8 to remove the maximum validity period of 12  months

for  a  licence.   Clause 7 amends section 9  to  remove  the

requirement for the renewal of a licence to be treated  as  a

fresh  licence  application.  Hence, the  new  approach  will

allow  the  licensing officer to issue licences  with  longer

validity  periods  exceeding 12  months,  as  well  as  renew

licences  without  the  need for licensees  to  submit  fresh

applications.   These  changes will  not  only  simplify  the

administration  of  public entertainment  licences  but  also

reduce business costs for licensees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, clause 10 of the Bill amends section 13 to

allow  the  licensing  officer to refuse  the  renewal  of  a

licence.   It  also provides an avenue for  the  licensee  to

appeal  to  the Minister against the refusal of the licensing

officer to renew his licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the other amendments in the

Bill.

<br><br><i>Composition of Offences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently all offenders under the Act or rules either

receive  a police warning or are prosecuted in court even  if

the  licence is cancelled or suspended.  This rigid  approach

is  not  satisfactory.   Why?  Because  some  cases  are  not

serious enough for Police to charge the offender in Court but

letting  the  offender off with just a warning is inadequate.

To deal with minor breaches more effectively and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



expediently, clause 14 inserts a new section 18B  to  empower

the  licensing officer to compound offences under the Act  or

rules.   For  example, licensees who fail  to  display  their

licence  prominently or breach licensing conditions,  may  be

offered  composition  fines  instead  of  being  charged  and

prosecuted  in  Court.   The amendment  gives  the  licensing

officer  the flexibility to deal with minor offences quickly.

Offences to be made compoundable would be prescribed  in  the

rules.

<br><br><i>Updating the Scope of the PE Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 16 of the Bill seek to amend the Act by

transferring   the  definitions  of  "public  entertainment",

"film"  and  "pin table" from section 2 to a new Schedule  to

the  Act.   Under  the  new subsections 2(2)  and  2(3),  the

Minister  would  be empowered to amend, add to  or  vary  the

Schedule  by  order published in the Gazette, which  will  be

presented   to   Parliament.   This  approach  provides   the

necessary   flexibility  to  the  Ministry  to   update   the

definition  of "public entertainment" in the Act to  keep  up

with   latest   developments  in  the  public   entertainment

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "public entertainment" as specified in

the  Schedule  has  also been updated.  Activities  that  are

already  covered in other Acts, for example, the  display  of

fireworks,  which is regulated under the Dangerous  Fireworks

Act,  have  been removed.  Activities that no longer  pose  a

threat  to  public  order, such as charitable  distributions,

auctions  and sales of goods for philanthropic or  charitable

purposes,  garden  parties, and trade fairs  have  also  been

removed.  This will make it more convenient for organisations

and businesses to conduct these activities, as they would  no

longer need to apply for a PE licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised definition of "public entertainment" will

expressly  include  "computer games  centre"  and  "amusement

centre" to remove any doubt that a licence is required  under

the Act for such forms of public entertainment.  On the other

hand,  obsolete provisions such as "exhibitions  of  abnormal

persons" will be removed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Exempting Statutory Bodies from the PE Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 3(e) of the proposed Schedule to the Act seeks

to  make  it clear that public entertainment provided  by  or

under  the  auspices of the statutory bodies  listed  in  the

Schedule are exempted from applying for a PE licence.   There

is   no  need  for  the  licensing  officer  to  license  the

activities  provided by statutory bodies as they are  already

subject  to  the  supervision  of  their  respective   parent

Ministries.   The  Schedule sets  out  a  list  drawn  up  in

consultation  with  the  parent Ministries  of  38  statutory

bodies.   These  are  statutory bodies which  provide  public

entertainment from time to time.

<br><br><i>Security Deposit for Ad-Hoc Licences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the licensing officer is unable to forfeit

the  security deposits imposed on ad hoc licences for one-off

events,  for  example, rock concerts, even  if  there  is  an

infringement,  as  the infringement is  usually  detected  or

reported  after  the event is over and when the  licence  has

already  lapsed.  To overcome this problem, clause 9  of  the

Bill  inserts  a  new  subsection  11(4)(c)  to  empower  the

licensing officer to forfeit the security deposit, even after

the  licence  has  lapsed,  if the public  entertainment  was

provided in contravention of the Act.

<br><br><i>Increase in Penalties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the maximum fine for offences under the Act

is  $5,000.  This was last revised in 1979.  Clause 13 of the

Bill  amends  section 18(1) to increase the maximum  fine  to

$10,000  to  ensure that deterrence remains  effective.   The

revision  would give the Courts the discretion  to  impose  a

higher penalty where appropriate.

<br><br><i>Change of Name</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend the title

of  the  Act  from  "Public Entertainments  Act"  to  "Public

Entertainment and Meetings Act".  The change

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



in  name is to reflect more accurately the scope of the  Act,

which  also includes public meetings like rallies, talks  and

forums.

<br><br><i>Exempting Other Activities via Exemption Orders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these amendments to the Public Entertainments

Act,  MHA  has  also  reviewed other areas  relating  to  the

licensing of public entertainment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has decided to exempt from the ambit of the Act,

certain  activities,  such  as shows  for  children,  fashion

shows, and busking, subject to conditions that safeguard  law

and order, public morality and safety.  Community activities,

such  as dance performances, karaoke singing and magic shows,

organised by or on behalf of the elected Member of Parliament

in  his  constituency, would also be exempted.  To  safeguard

law  and  order, public morality and safety, these activities

will similarly be subject to conditions such as no vulgar  or

obscene  gestures  or  remarks  being  made  by  any  of  the

performers  and  the  performers are  not  to  be  indecently

attired.   These changes will be effected by way of exemption

orders   and   do  not  require  amendments  to  the   Public

Entertainments Act.  Police will announce the details in  due

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Police is studying the feasibility of

setting  up  a  One-Stop Licensing Centre to  coordinate  the

processing  of licence applications, so that businesses  need

to  go  to  only  one  place to apply for  all  the  licences

required to set up an entertainment outlet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as society evolves, people's

aspirations  change.  MHA will continue to  regularly  review

the Act from time to time to ensure its relevancy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in support of the Amendment Bill moved by Assoc.  Prof.

Ho Peng Kee.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passing of this Bill, the existing Public

Entertainments Act will become the  Public Entertainments and

Meetings  Act.   A notable amendment is in new  section  14A,

that is, the demerit point system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demerit point system is similar to the one

applicable to our driving licence.  From the social point  of

view, this can be said to be very special, because under  the

Bill,  there will be an element of self-discipline for  those

licensees to conduct themselves in accordance with  the  law.

I think this is an indication of the maturity of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also notice that the amendment to the Bill does not

take  away  the  power of the police to  revoke  any  licence

whenever necessary.  The power still remains. In the case  of

any  performance,  which is obscene, vulgar  or  immoral,  or

touching   on   the   racial  or  religious  sensitivity   in

Singapore,  the  police  reserves the  right  to  revoke  the

licence in keeping with the interest of the public.  I  think

this is right and proper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill, in my view, will not have much

impact  on  commercial  activities.   But  I  feel  that  the

amendments  may affect some of the non-commercial activities.

For  example,  I  have  in  mind  some  of  the  customs  and

traditional practices of  the Chinese community, particularly

the seventh-moon festival or the Hungry Ghost Festival.  This

new  Amendment  Bill may have some impact on them.   We  know

that the Hungry Ghost Festival is a kind of gathering for the

Chinese  community which incorporates some kind of charitable

activities, like the auction of auspicious articles with  the

proceeds   going  to  charitable  causes.    Most  of   these

activities  would  include getai (song performances),  puppet

shows  or even traditional provincial operas.  In his  Second

Reading   speech,  the  Minister  of  State  mentioned   that

activities such as the auctions at the Hungry Ghost  Festival

may   be  exempted  from  the  Act.   In   other  words,  the

organisers  do  not  need to apply for a licence  to  conduct

auctions.    I  think  it is a piece of  good  news  for  the

Chinese community.  But it is not very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



clear    whether  the  staging  of  getai,  puppet  show   or

traditional  provincial opera in connection with  the  Hungry

Ghost Festival will also be similarly exempted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Schedule, the so-called "public

entertainment" is defined very widely to include performances

such as drama, singing, music, dancing. All these come within

the   definition  of  "public  entertainment"  and  therefore

licences  are  required.  So my question  is  whether  getai,

puppet  shows,  etc,  could be exempted.   I  hope  that  the

Minister of State could clarify on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hungry Ghost Festival or Seventh Moon

Festival, activities are usually conducted within the densely-populated HDB estates.  Generally speaking, the organisers of

such  activities will have to apply for permission  from  the

town  council or the HDB to make use of the car park  or  the

vacant land for the conduct of such activities.  In the past,

they   also  had  to  apply  to  the  police  for  a   public

entertainment licence as well.  Now, they do not have  to  do

so.   So  I think it is a good way to help them.  If  we  can

consider such activities are traditional in nature and exempt

them from having to apply for a public entertainment licence,

it will be a great convenience to the organisers.  I hope the

Minister of State will consider my suggestion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to start by

welcoming some of the changes that the Minister of State  has

announced and emphasised in reading the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demerit point system seems to me to be a good one to

enhance  self-discipline and transparency for  the  permanent

establishments.   When the Minister of State  was  discussing

discos,  pubs and entertainment centres, I was more concerned

about  artistic performances and political and  public  talks

which  are  also covered under the Act.  I think  the  Public

Entertainments  Act (PEA) may be covering in that  sense  too

many  types  of different entertainments of very diverse  and

different character.  For while I am sometimes entertained by

public political

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



speeches, sometimes in this House too, it is clearly  a  very

different  form  of enjoyment from a pub  or  disco.   And  I

wonder   whether  the  system  and  the  personnel  who   can

administer one are really suitable to administer both and all

types of entertainments and meetings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments then go on to remove some activities from

the  list that require licensing.  It is however widening the

title  to  reflect  their  work  brings  in  these  political

meetings  under the Schedule (I believe it is paragraph  2(m)

"any play-reading, recital, lecture, talk, address, debate or

discussion").   I  think in that sense, we have  probably  to

consider  if  the time may have come for us to have  separate

schemes  and personnel to distinguish between entertainments,

such  as  discos  and meetings, and these  public  talks  and

artistic performances.  There has been controversy and change

in  the  administration of the Public Entertainments  Act  of

late concerning these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to quickly point out four examples of this

controversy and change.  First, the Government has  seen  fit

to establish a Speakers' Corner.  Second, as clarified in the

last  sitting of Parliament, elected Opposition MPs from  now

are  allowed  to speak at community functions  in  their  own

constituencies and, I believe if I have heard the Minister of

State correctly, that they can now sing at these meetings too

without  real problems.  And both of these measures  increase

the  freedom  of people to speak in public.   The  third  and

fourth  examples  go the other direction.  Recently,  it  was

reported that a group of gay and lesbian Singaporeans  wanted

to  organise  a public forum in Singapore, but  was  refused.

And  fourth, and more recently, the performance of  the  play

"Talaq" by the civic group Agni Kootthu was refused.  This is

despite an initial approval by the National Arts Council.  In

these  latter two examples, the licensing authority had  used

the PEA to restrict freedom of speech.  These trends may seem

contradictory to some.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On what basis should we allow or restrict freedom of

speech  and assembly under this Act?  A process should govern

the   decision   making.   Article  14  of  the  Constitution

enshrines the right of Singapore citizens to speak freely and

to  assemble  peaceably  in public.   These  rights  are  not

absolute, of course.  The right to assembly can be restricted

in  the  interest  of security and public  order,  which  the

Minister of State has emphasised.  But how do we decide  when

security  and  public order are at stake?  Who decides?   The

Government, of course, is the primary actor.  It should  not,

however, in my view, be the only one.  To balance our freedom

to  speak, with due concerns of security and public order, we

must have a good reading of public opinion.  After all, it is

not  just  what somebody might say, but how it is  said  and,

most importantly, how people react to the speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example of the play "Talaq" points to the diversity

of  opinions among Singaporeans.  The play had been performed

before.    It   attracted  some  controversy  and  attention.

Similarly, in the past, when the licence was permitted for "M

Butterfly"  with  a  nude male figure  on  stage,  this  also

attracted  some controversy, perhaps a little curiosity  too.

But  none  of these things led to violence or public disorder

and  disturbance.  Instead, we have actually  benefited  from

the discussion of the issues that ensued.  Even in the denial

of  the  licence to have a forum on gays and lesbians,  there

was  a  spirited debate, both for and against, in  the  Forum

pages of the Straits Times. And I believe such discussion  is

healthy in a democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore has disturbed some people in Singapore to

hear  how  decisions are made - one moment  allowed,  another

moment disallowed.  And it is hard to see, it is hard  to  be

assured  that  the state's view really reflects the  majority

view  or whether it reflects the objections of really a vocal

minority.  It should therefore be welcomed to have a one-stop

centre  for  licensing, as the Minister  of  State  says  the

police  will now consider.  However, one should guard against

a  one-stop centre becoming a place to stop one.  That is  to

say, we put such an emphasis on a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



one-stop   centre  to  ensure  that  this  centre  is   truly

reflective of the broad society and decisions therefore  need

to  be  more transparent.  They cannot be left to a policeman

or  bureaucrat  sitting by himself in the  isolation  of  his

office.   Nor  can  a decision be captured  by  a  particular

interest.   Otherwise,  we  risk acting  on  each  and  every

special sensitivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one has its sensitivities - every ethnic group,

every  religious group, political views, animal  rights,  gay

activists,  women's  groups, whatever.  We  cannot  make  our

decisions  as  an  accumulation and aggregate  of  all  these

prejudices.  We have to decide for the broad majority and  to

allow   diversity.   Because  public  debate   and   artistic

performances, in particular, will almost always challenge the

ideas  that some people will hold.  It provokes us to  think,

and  that  is good.  So long as the line is that  we  provoke

thought rather than violence and disorder.  In this sense, my

first  suggestion  is that we must include  citizens  in  the

decision-making  about  public  entertainment  licences.   We

should  have  an advisory panel for the Public Entertainments

Act.   If we want to cover an even wider array of activities,

it  is  critical  to have expertise and a broad  and  diverse

range  of  opinions,  not captured by any minority  interest.

The  Government, of course, in the end will have to make  the

decision after hearing the different views.  But it should do

so  after hearing all sides and weighing the overall interest

of the wider society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion, Sir, is that the Government should

use  its powers to impose special conditions for the approval

wisely.  It does this already.  But I want to point out  that

it may continue to have performances in form or even warn the

respective  audience  beforehand of its  contents,  and  then

those  who  may  be offended simply need not  attend.   These

suggestions are not new.  They are in line with the  practice

of  censorship of films and publications in Singapore.  Under

the Ministry of Information and the Arts, a panel of citizens

gives  advice to the bureaucrats on what to censor and  gives

them  a  good sense of the pulse of the people of  Singapore.

And so we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



"RA"  classification, advisory statement of the content, etc.

And in this sense, my suggestions on this Bill are simply  to

bring  it  into  line with the practices on  film  and  other

areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion, Sir, relates to the Speakers'

Corner.   This  experiment has been running for  some  months

now.   There have not been, to my knowledge, any breaches  in

security or public order and I do not believe there have been

any  other  breaches  of law, such as  defamation.   In  this

regard,  the  Speakers' Corner should be seen as  a  success.

People  have spoken and nothing has caught fire.  Yet,  there

are  also  concerns that the success of the Speakers'  Corner

will be limited, in part this is because of the venue and the

means  of communication.  In our tropical city, both  weather

and  traffic  noise  work against an  open  air  venue  where

microphones are not allowed.  I therefore ask the Ministry to

consider  designating an indoor venue for a second  Speakers'

Corner with a speaker system to support the speakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the civic society group, the Roundtable, of

which  I  am  one, first proposed free speech venues  with  a

variety  of  places and types.  When the Government  took  up

this  idea, it only licensed Hong Lim Park.  This is  because

it  is  a historical site and I have got nothing against  it.

But  I  do hope the Government will review the scheme to  add

more supportive venues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to express my

distaste  for  this Bill.  But may I make it  clear  that  my

objections  do  not  flow  from the  requirement  for  proper

licensing  and  regulation of animal circuses and  those  who

operate  pin  tables and games of chance.  My  objections  to

this Bill and, indeed, to the main Act itself, stem from  the

fact  that the main Act and this Bill make a mockery  of  our

Constitution  in  that, as Mr Simon Tay has pointed  out,  it

seeks  to  include public meetings and to lump them  together

with  circuses  and exhibitions of animals and operations  of

games of chance, and what else.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked several times by

foreign  correspondents and visitors whether I did not  think

that the Government was liberalising its restrictions on  the

freedom  of speech, and my answer has always been  "No",  and

they then wonder why I take this view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill confirms my view. One would have thought that

the  Government might have considered that the time  has  now

come to remove the restrictions on public meetings, talks and

lectures.   But  no,  it  seeks to include  public  meetings,

lectures  and talks in this total control over  any  form  of

public expression in this country.  It makes, as I have said,

a mockery of the constitutional right expressed by Article 14

of our Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay would appear to suggest that there should

be  a separate scheme for meetings and talks.  I do not agree

with  that.   I  am  saying the time has  now  come  to  lift

completely,   and,   I   repeat,  to  lift   completely   any

restrictions  on public meetings and talks or lectures  of  a

serious  nature and allow complete freedom of speech,  as  is

required  by  the  Constitution.  That is  why  I  felt  very

unhappy  when  I  saw this Public Entertainments  (Amendment)

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in spite of all its avowed statements

that  there  was freedom of speech, freedom of expression  in

Singapore,  the Deputy Prime Minister telling  the  BBC  that

anyone is free to debate in Singapore, they still see fit  to

introduce  a  Bill  tightening further, if  I  may  say,  the

restrictions on meetings of a serious nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say it makes a mockery of our Constitution. I say, Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that the Public Entertainments  Act  violates

Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution.  If you look at Article

14(1)(a), Mr Speaker, Sir, what do you find?  "Every  citizen

of   Singapore  has  the  right  to  freedom  of  speech  and

expression."   May I repeat: "Every citizen of Singapore  has

the right to freedom of speech and expression."  However, it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



continues, by Article 14(2)(a), to give Parliament the  right

to  impose  "such restrictions as it considers  necessary  or

expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any

part thereof."  I do not wish to read the rest of it, but the

operative part of this is, to impose "such restrictions as it

considers necessary".  It does not say that you can  abrogate

the  right  of  the citizen.  The right of the  citizen  must

remain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By requiring the citizen to first go and obtain a

licence from a police officer is to take away his right under

the  Constitution.  If one has to obtain a licence, then  one

cannot  truthfully say that one has the right.  His right  is

made  dependent on the whim of the officer to whom he has  to

make the application.  It is no longer a right.  It becomes a

licence  granted by the Government, and not a  right  of  the

citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I say, Sir, that the Act itself is a complete

negation  of Article 14(1)(a) of our Constitution.  And  this

Act  should  have  been  amended, once the  Constitution  was

brought  into force, to take out of the Public Entertainments

Act the provisions relating to meetings, lectures, talks of a

serious  nature,  and,  particularly, meetings  organised  by

registered  political parties.  That should have  been  done,

but was not done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Minister and the Government that the

Constitution  itself  enjoins,  requires  the  Government  to

modify  the law so as to accord with the right given  by  the

Constitution.  But nothing was done to modify  the  law,  and

the  total  ban on public expression in the form of  meetings

and  talks  was continued.  So, I say, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

whole thing is a mockery of the Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at section 13 of the parent Act, what do you

find, Mr Speaker, Sir?  It reads: "The licensing officer may,

in  his  discretion, refuse any application for  a  licence."

There   you  have  it.   The  Act  says,  forget  about   the

Constitution.  We can refuse any application for a licence to

speak  and  we can stop anyone speaking out in  public.   One

would have thought

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



that,  in  the Amendment Bill, perhaps an attempt would  have

been  made  to  spell out clearly the grounds  on  which  the

licensing  officer  may refuse the application.   Instead  of

that, this carte blanche freedom is continued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that perhaps we should consider now changing

the  designation  of  the officer as "Licensing  Officer"  to

"Licensing  Czar"  under the Government.  That  perhaps  will

explain  clearly  that  the  Government  continues  to   hold

unrestricted  control over the right of anyone  to  speak  in

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at section 14 of the parent Act, it again

gives this "licensing czar" grounds to cancel or suspend  any

licence without again tying him down.  I say this because, if

you look at section 14(1)(d), you will find the words "If  it

is  contrary  to the public interest."  So this  official  is

given  the  authority to decide what is the public  interest.

But  the  Constitution says clearly, in no  uncertain  terms,

that  it is in the public interest that every citizen  should

have   the  right  of  freedom  of  expression  without   any

restriction  put  upon it, except in the very  limited  areas

specified under the Constitution.  And what is more, the  Act

did  not provide an appeal to the courts against any decision

and this is continued in the Bill that is now before us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a matter so important as the right of citizens to

speak up, should not the decision be left to the court rather

than  to  the  official, and from him  to  the  Minister?   I

mentioned not very long ago that the licensing officer, in  a

case   where  we  were  charged  with  violating  the  Public

Entertainments  Act, said on oath in the witness  stand  that

applications   from   political  parties  are   automatically

referred  to the Minister. The decision is taken out  of  his

hands  and the Minister decides whether it should be  granted

or not.  If that is the case, what on earth will be served by

allowing the political party to appeal to the Minister? He is

asked  to  review his own decision, not the decision  of  the

licensing officer?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is sincere in its oft-stated desire to

invite our citizens to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak up, there should have been an opportunity for the

citizen to take his case to the  court so that the court  may

decide  whether  the  right under the Constitution  is  being

violated  by the decision of the Minister.  I would seriously

urge  the Ministry to refer the whole Act, not just the Bill,

to  the  Constitutional Court for an opinion whether the  Act

and  the  scheme of licensing provided under the Act  violate

Article  14(1) of the Constitution.  I see that the  Minister

for  Home  Affairs laughs at my suggestion that it should  be

referred  to the Constitutional Court. That is what I  always

have had when I suggest that it be referred to the court.  It

shows  very little respect for the court.  And please do  not

tell  me in reply that I can always take it up to the  court.

If the Government is accountable to the people, as it says it

is  an  accountable Government and it is transparent  in  its

decision-making, it would immediately, upon a complaint  that

any  legislation violates the Constitution, refer it  to  the

Constitutional  Court.  So  please  act  responsibly  as  the

Government is accountable to the people and not laugh away at

any suggestion that we should refer the matter to the court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I commend to the Ministry that if they do not wish

to  refer the Bill, along with the Act, to the Constitutional

Court,  it  should  now  withdraw this  Bill  and  reconsider

whether it should proceed with the Bill as at present  before

the  House.  I would ask the Ministry to consider taking  out

completely  from the Bill sub-paragraph (m) in  the  Schedule

which defines "public entertainment".  Sub-paragraph (m),  of

course,  relates  to  play-reading, recital,  lecture,  talk,

address  debate or discussion.  And introduce in  this  Bill,

other  provisions  that require not the applicant  to  get  a

licence  but require the police to object for grounds  stated

to  any  intention on the part of any political party or  any

party or association to hold a public meeting or talk.  May I

ask what is the objection, and I do want a serious answer  to

this.   What  is  your  objection to a public  meeting  in  a

private  closed  place like a hotel or  somebody's  house  or

building?  One can understand some objection if it is  to  be

on  a  public  street or in a public area, but  what  is  the

objection

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



to  a meeting in a closed room where the public is invited to

attend?   The  OSC,  of  which I am Chairman,  has  held  two

forums.   True, we got licences, but after having to  satisfy

the  licensing officer that we were not going to  be  talking

about  subversion, and we were only given the licence  almost

at the last minute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, Sir, that if this Government wishes to show

itself  as  law-abiding  and respects  the  Constitution,  it

should  take away this requirement for the licence and  bring

in  provisions to require the police to lodge any  objections

with  a  Magistrate  to  any proposed meeting  of  which  the

applicant should give three weeks' notice before the  meeting

and  then the Magistrate or some officer, hearing both sides,

decides  whether the meeting should be allowed or not.   That

would  accord  with the Constitution and would prove  to  the

world  that this Government is serious when it says  that  it

wishes  to  promote  public  debate  and  discussion  by  its

citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay says that the Speakers' Corner has been a

success.  I do not know on what grounds he says that.  It was

only  yesterday that I read in the Straits Times which  asks,

"Is  the Speakers' Corner dying a natural death?"  There  are

very few speakers and very few people listening to them.   I,

for  one,  may  I  say, am glad that it has  been  completely

ignored by responsible Singapore citizens because I have said

it  right  from  the beginning that I was not going  to  show

myself   up  there.  That  would  lend  credibility  to   the

Government's  claim  that the Speakers' Corner  is  proof  of

democracy in this country, where there is no such thing.  The

Speakers'  Corner  was intended to be a showpiece,  like  the

wayang  kulit and to proclaim to people that, there you  are,

we  have  got  democracy, we have got freedom of  expression,

when  this Bill and the Act completely take away that freedom

of expression of the citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do seriously urge the Government to do one of two

things.   Withdraw  this  Bill  and  refer  the  Act  to  the

Constitutional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



Court  for  a pronouncement on whether the ban on  talks  and

lectures  violates Article 14(1) of the Constitution  and  if

the Government is not willing to do that, as I have said,  to

reconsider  whether the whole scheme of licensing should  now

be revised in relation to public meetings, talks or lectures,

particularly  those organised by political  associations  and

that  would  include  not only political  parties  registered

under  the  Societies Act, but NGOs and civic groups,  groups

like my organisation, the Open Singapore Centre.  Then, as  I

have  said,  it  would  speak volumes for  this  Government's

sincerity to promote discussion and debate in Singapore.   If

it  does  not do that, may I say it is all empty  words,  all

hocus-pocus, that Singapore enjoys freedom of speech, freedom

of expression.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, first, I wish to express my concern about  the

possible negative impact the proposed amendments will have on

arts and civil society.  I, like many other Singaporeans,  am

delighted to have witnessed  the growth of arts in Singapore.

I must compliment the Government for the vision and effort to

nurture the development of arts here.  But I feel that it  is

timely that we have specific legislation that will be able to

guide  this development.  Of course, we also need  to  ensure

that  the social norms and the acceptable moral standards  of

our society are protected and not compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artistes are like scientists - researching,

questioning, experimenting and sometimes pushing and  testing

conventional  acceptable norms of the  day.   Therefore,  the

Bill  must  reflect  the tolerance for  a  possible  negative

outcome  of  this experiment, but make clear  the  boundaries

within  which the arts groups are allowed to operate.   I  am

therefore  concerned that instead of taking this  opportunity

to  refine the Bill to be more specific to the arts, we  have

enlarged  it  to include perhaps just about anybody  else  by

including  meetings  under  this  amendment.   I  would  have

preferred that all other matters of public order be  included

in other legislation,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



such  as  the Penal Code, the Miscellaneous Offences  (Public

Order  and  Nuisance) Act and the Societies Act.   There  are

enough   legislation  to  regulate  such   public   meetings.

Otherwise, as it stands now, the legislation may be  seen  as

too  restrictive  for an otherwise very liberal  and  growing

arts scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By enlarging this Bill, I am afraid that we will not be

able  to  solve the perception problems caused by the charges

brought  against Chee Soon Juan when he launched his book  at

Raffles Place sometime ago.  Many outside Singapore interpret

the   use   of   the  Public  Entertainments  Act   and   the

Environmental and Public Health Act as a desperate attempt by

the  Government to use inappropriate legislation  against  an

opposition  figure.   Clearly,  we  do  not  deserve  such  a

reputation  but neither do we need to give others  an  excuse

for  perceiving us as such.  Although Singaporeans are  fully

aware  of his defiant attitude resulting in the charges being

made  against him, the use of the Public Entertainments  Act,

for example, has caused some confusion.  Therefore, we should

take  this  opportunity to make this Bill purely  for  public

entertainment  and  not  for any  other  offences.   We  must

separate  arts  from  politics and make a  clear  distinction

between   the  regulations  for  entertainers  and  that   of

politicians.   Even  if  this amendment  is  made  purely  to

enhance  our image overseas and ensure that people  have  the

right view on this matter, it would be a worthwhile exercise,

because what others think of us matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on a number of specific issues. Clearly,

section 13 should be read in conjunction with Article  14  of

the  Constitution which guarantees citizens the right to free

speech,  assembly  and association.  I  have  very  different

views from Mr J B Jeyaretnam, because I think the significant

point  in Article 14(2)(a) empowers Parliament to impose  any

restriction it considers necessary and expedient to serve the

purpose  inherent in eight stipulated grounds of  derogation.

Thus, when someone puts in an application for a licence,  the

licensing officer is constitutionally required to approve the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



application unless it falls within one of the eight heads  of

Article  14(2)(a).  If the licensing officer  feels  that  he

must reject the application for one of these reasons, and for

those   reasons  only,  he  must  give  reasons.   Therefore,

amendment  should be made to section 13(2)  to  reflect  this

default position.  Thus, the onus is on the licensing officer

to  give  reasons  for  his denial of  an  application.   The

applicant  need  not  have to ask for  the  grounds  for  the

decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, in the recent Talaq case, the licensing officer

has consulted other relevant bodies.  But why not embody this

process  in  the  Bill  to reflect a more  participatory  and

consultative  style of government?  Why  not  spell  out  the

bodies  or  organisations which need  to  be  consulted?   Or

establish a body which has a representation from a wide cross-section  of  the  society to advise the Public  Entertainment

Licensing Unit?  It will then give some of the bodies a legal

status  to make its decision and recommendation and  possibly

avoid  the  confusion caused by the recent issue.    In  this

instance,  the licensing officer has consulted  the  National

Arts Council and other bodies.  But who really is making  the

decision?  Is it the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit?  Is

it  the  National  Arts Council?  Or is it the  Majlis  Ugama

Islam Singapura?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these groups are to be relied upon to give advice,

what  and  how  much  weight must be given  to  their  views?

Should  not the licensing officer consult these bodies  first

before  making  a final decision?  Thus, the  procedures  and

processes in making this decision must be clearly spelt out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For civil society, Sir, it does not exempt groups

organising talks and seminars and the like from applying  for

a  licence unless it is a "members only" meeting.  Thus, if a

civil society group decides to hold a talk for an "invitation

only" audience, technically, the group will still have to get

a public entertainment licence.  This is not helpful at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a demerit point system is interesting,

but totally lacking in detail.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? What is the rush in pushing this Bill through?

Although the Minister has stated that details of the  demerit

point  system will follow, why can we not come  up  with  the

scheme  before voting on it?  I would have thought  that  the

demerit  point  system should be debated and  scrutinised  in

Parliament.  Otherwise, this is very much like having traffic

rules and demerit point system, but the driver does not  know

what  are  the  rules and how the demerit point system  works

against  him.   If there are OB markers, as it should  be  in

some cases, why not spell them?  Otherwise, the vagueness and

the  lack  of clarity make it confusing for arts  groups  and

civil society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J B Jeyaretnam spoke about the Speakers' Corner. I

am  extremely disappointed with his attitude.  I  would  have

thought  that with the establishment of the Speakers' Corner,

it is precisely the Opposition groups who will take advantage

of this, because they have been clamouring for more space and

opportunity  to speak to the public at large.  And  the  fact

that  Mr Jeyaretnam has taken the attitude and the fact  that

he  is  not here to listen to the reply from the Minister  is

something that I find very disturbing myself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speakers' Corner is not just a reflection of the

society  at large but, certainly, the state of the  Speakers'

Corner  is  a reflection of the Opposition members themselves

and  other groups who want to have an additional platform  to

make their views known.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  sure  the  Minister  of  State  will  answer  Mr

Jeyaretnam's points, but I would just like to say one  thing.

Frankly, I am quite astonished at the suggestion or the legal

theory  propounded  by  him that  there  is  a  duty  on  any

government  to  challenge  its own  Bills  on  constitutional

grounds.  I have never heard of such an argument put  in  any

jurisdiction that I know of.  Obviously, the simple  case  is

that  if a citizen feels aggrieved and he has a locus  standi

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



standing  to raise an issue before the courts, he can  always

go  to  the courts for a declaration.  There is no such thing

also  as  unrestricted constitutional rights  to  freedom  of

expression, even in that most democratic of democracies,  the

United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I may be allowed to speak in relation to

the  Bill.   I  support this Bill in so far as  it  seeks  to

update the law and especially by removing activities that  no

longer  require  licences and by streamlining procedures  for

issue  and  renewal of licences.  This is an important  Bill,

coming  as it does in the wake of earlier concerns in January

this  year  about the operations of the Licensing  Unit  and,

more  recently, of course, about the play Talaq that was  not

allowed to be staged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this debate, I would like to touch on two sets

of  issues.   The  first relates to issues of substance,  ie,

what  are  the  factors to be considered in the  granting  of

licences  and  whether there will be changes in  this  regard

after  the enactment of the Bill.  The second relates to  the

process and procedure of obtaining a licence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of public entertainment, there is always an

issue of balancing the objective of encouraging creative  and

new  art  forms,  and what may be called the  maintenance  of

public decency and order.  In the Films Act, for example,  we

have an elaborate system of obtaining licences or permits  to

show films and to have films censored.  In the case of public

entertainment  falling within the Public Entertainments  Act,

the  same concerns arise.  What is the proper balance  to  be

struck between allowing our artistic talents to entertain the

public and maintaining public decency and order?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sitting on 17th January this year, the Minister

for  Information and the Arts gave an answer which  is  quite

relevant  in  today's debate.  The Minister referred  to  the

need  for artistes to obtain licence for new art forms,  such

as  forum,  theatre and performance arts, where there  is  no

script and encourages participation of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



audience.   Controversy arose in this case  because  of  some

indecent  and unconventional behaviour on the part of  actors

during a performance several years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer given by the Minister - may I be permitted

to  summarise  -  contains four factors that should be  taken

into  account.   First, the broad factor of  risk  to  public

order and decency; second, the exploitative nature of the art

form  to  educate  audiences on volatile issues;  third,  the

propagation  of beliefs and messages of deviant groups;  and,

finally, the use of the art forms as a means of subversion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to these factors because the fundamental issue

of substance for having a licensing scheme to regulate public

entertainment   is  striking  that  proper  balance   between

artistic  freeedom  and  maintenance  of  public  order   and

decency.  The Bill appears to make the Licensing Unit and the

Minister  in  charge, namely, the Minister for Home  Affairs,

responsible  as  the guardian of public order  and  morality,

unlike  the Films Act, for example, where there is an  appeal

to  a  wider  body  known  as the  committee  of  appeal.  In

substance,  both the showing of a film and the staging  of  a

play,  for  example, are not different.  I  am  puzzled  that

there  is such a distinction made here and that there  is  no

appeal body in this particular piece of legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can also be seen from the factors referred to that

there  are  very  broad considerations  that  involve  public

morality which probably could be better gauged by a  body  of

individuals culled from various segments of society.  I know,

for  instance,  that  in the recent controversial  play,  the

permission  to  stage it was withdrawn after objections  from

MUIS.    Why   not   have   an  appellate   body   comprising

representatives from organisations such as MUIS  or  National

Arts  Council, who could then recommend to the Minister on  a

more regulated basis?  If we are serious about improving  the

cultural  arts  scene in Singapore, we may  need  more  civil

society  mechanisms  to ensure that we are  not  erring  from

excessive caution.  I would like therefore to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>



urge  the  Minister of State to consider  such  a  scheme  as

appropriate for the Public Entertainments Act, as it  is  for

the Films Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also proposes to implement a demerit point

system.  Such systems are common in Singapore, principally in

matters relating to public health and road safety.  Again,  I

should  like  to ask the Minister of State for clarification,

as  some  of the speakers earlier have done so.  What purpose

would  such  a  demerit system serve in the  area  of  public

entertainment?  We can see the need for such a scheme in  the

areas of public hygiene and road safety, where the public may

be  subject  to daily risks of dirty food or unsafe  driving.

But  in  public  entertainment, the harm that may  result  is

surely not as direct or severe as to require a demerit  point

system.   Has  the  situation deteriorated so  much  that  we

should consider implementing a demerit point system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Minister of State can provide an

explanation  as to why such a system should be put  in  place

and  how  it would operate.  And, in particular, I  echo  the

issue that was raised by Mr Zulkifli whether it would have an

undesirable  effect  on  the  cultural  and  arts  scene   in

Singapore.  The harm that we would want most to avoid is that

our  most  creative  artistes go  abroad  and  develop  their

talents  instead of remaining at home.  This must not happen,

as  a  result of a scheme that is seen to be too restrictive.

I  would  urge the Minister of State to let Members  of  this

House  and the public know what are the principles that  will

be  used to administer this demerit point system.  And it  is

unfortunate that the rules relating to such a scheme are  not

placed before the House at this time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to other issues that arise from the

Bill.  While matters of substance are very important, matters

of  procedure may also be important in that a long drawn  out

procedure  to  obtain licences may be viewed as unsympathetic

to  the  growth  of a vibrant public entertainment  scene  in

Singapore.   While  the  Bill positively  aids  in  promoting

public entertainment maybe in the new provision that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



groups  performing  under the auspices of  certain  statutory

bodies  like the People's Association, National Arts Council,

MUIS  and  the National Library Board can now provide  public

entertainment  without requiring a licence.  There  are  many

statutory  bodies that are given this exemption.   But  there

may  be  a  case  for  including other  bodies  such  as  the

Singapore  Academy of Law and Info-Communications Development

Authority  of  Singapore.  These are not in  the  list.   The

question  is:  why  are they not because  they  too  have  on

occasions put on public shows?  On the other hand, it is  odd

to  find the inclusion of the Professional Engineers Board or

the  Board  of  Architects on this list.  In  fact,  not  all

professional  bodies are on the list. For  example,  the  Law

Society of Singapore, which regularly runs meetings and  road

shows  to  advise people of rights and so on, is not  on  the

list.   Perhaps  the Minister of State can clarify  how  this

list  came  about and whether it would be revised at  regular

intervals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the problem I raised earlier in January

concerning  the  time taken for processing applications.   In

January  this year, the Minister for Home Affairs answered  a

question  relating  to  this matter and  his  answer  was  as

follows, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Police has publicly pledged to process 90% of all

establishment licence applications within eight weeks and  ad

hoc licence applications within three weeks.'



It  further  added  that  in  1999,  more  than  50%  of  all

applications  were  processed within a week  while  91%  were

processed  within three weeks.  This may suggest a  situation

that  is  relatively under control and that the police  acted

reasonably  speedily  and they should  be  congratulated  for

that.  But I hope that the Minister of State can reassure  us

that there will be a better effort made to expedite licensing

procedures and also ultimately to cut down on the  number  of

activities for which a licence is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, creative talents require a certain space where

involvement of people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>



should be spontaneous and immediate.  Such situations are not

likely  to  occur in Singapore if we exert too  much  control

over  the  expression of creativity in public.  I agree  that

there  must  be some control where public safety,  health  or

order  is threatened by such activities.  It may be right  in

such  situations to expect licensing.  But there must be many

other  situations where we should be able to enjoy the public

performances of our multi-talented population and others with

a minimum of red tape.  The need for the Public Entertainment

Licensing Unit to take a balanced view is critical and I hope

that   the  new  measures  will  not  be  a  step  back  from

cultivating   a  vibrant  art  and  culture  environment   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, let me

thank all the speakers for speaking on the Bill and thank all

the  other speakers, except Mr Jeyaretnam, for supporting the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speakers have caught the spirit behind these

amendments.    PELU  does  not  stand  still.    The   Public

Entertainments Act does not stand still.  It  has  been  fine

tuning its regime over the last few years.  For example, some

Members  who  know will realise that now for  rock  concerts,

dancing   is   permitted  provided  safety   conditions   are

satisfied.  Also, in some of these pubs where jazz  music  is

played,  if  the space is appropriate and if the operator  is

confident  that  there  will be no law  and  order  problems,

members  of  the  audience can also join  in.   Indeed,  over

time,  not  so  much in a major way, certain activities  have

been exempted from the Act, for example, films that are shown

in cinemas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a big exercise because the time is ripe to look

at how the Act can be further amended to make regulation even

lighter,  a lighter touch to regulation.  One approach  will,

of  course, be class exemptions.  Mr Goh Choon Kang has asked

whether  or  not getai will also be exempted.  Indeed,  getai

will be exempted from the Public Entertainments Act.  Already

this  year  a lighter touch was used to regulate the  Seventh

Month Festival where there were exemptions given

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



under the Miscellaneous Offences Act for auctions.  But if we

do this for auctions and do not do that for getai, there will

be  anomaly.   For  this year, public entertainment  licences

were still required for getai.  But under the class exemption

approach, public entertainment licences will not be required.

So Seventh Month Festival operators will know that there is a

regime  here where there is no need for exemptions  but  they

will  have to satisfy certain conditions, which is fair.   As

long  as  they satisfy those conditions, they will be allowed

to organise their functions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One condition would be for them to notify police at

least  seven days in advance of the event.  This  is  not  to

hinder  them or to put a blanket on their activities.  It  is

good  for police to know where some of these getais  will  be

operating  because in the Seventh Month Festival period  many

will  be  performed all over Singapore.  So Police will  have

pre-knowledge of where possible problems may  arise.   It  is

not  that they will arise but it is good for the local police

division to know that.  That is something which I am sure all

Seventh  Month Festival operators will be very  happy  about.

This  year's event went off well despite the fact  that  many

people  had  to  adjust, including the operators,  grassroots

leaders and so forth.  When we take this approach, it will be

a win-win situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point is the scope of the Bill. Here

again,  these amendments signify the fact that the  Ministry,

Police  and  PELU know that the Act cannot be  over-reaching.

As  Members  read in the amendments, certain categories  have

been  removed  from  the ambit of the Act,  events  that  are

already covered in other Acts like fireworks display and also

events  that do not pose law and order problems.  This  shows

an active mindset on the part of the Ministry, the police and

PELU  to  see which activity can be taken out.  Indeed,  with

class exemption, even more activities will be taken out.  But

the question then arises: can more be taken out?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point has been made by many speakers whether or not

talks and meetings should be regulated, in particular

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



indoor  talks and meetings.  Mr Jeyaretnam may call  for  the

total taking out of all talks and meetings.  But I think many

Members  in this House will agree that for outdoor  talks  in

particular,  it  is  very  important  to  have   the   public

entertainment  licence because in outdoor settings,  law  and

order problems can arise.  But does it therefore mean that in

an  indoor setting there is no need to regulate these  talks?

The answer is no, because in multi-racial and multi-religious

Singapore,  there is still a need to see what are  the  talks

being  conducted on the ground, in particular talks that  may

be subversive or inflammatory in terms of race and religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be also other topics, for example, one of the

indoor  talks  that PELU rejected was a talk  on  picking  of

locks.  This was rejected in January 1999 because police felt

that this is not a very good topic.  It may attract all kinds

of people who may want to learn how to pick locks.  We learn,

for  example, over the Internet how to make bombs.   That  is

coming  on  stream.  If we allow people just  to  give  talks

without  some regulation in compact, multi-racial and  multi-religious  Singapore, that is not advisable.   But  the  real

question  is:  has the regime hindered the giving  of  talks?

Here  the  answer is a clear no, because PELU has  all  these

years administered the Act with a light touch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in 1999, out of about 6,000 applications

processed,  only  64  applications, ie,  1%,  were  rejected.

These  were rejected for good reasons.  The point I  want  to

make  is  that some of these perceived hardships that  people

very  loosely  talk  about  do  not  exist.   In  fact,  even

Opposition  party  members will know  that  though  they  are

required  to  apply for licences from PELU, these  have  been

very  freely  granted.  They have organised  many  talks  and

forums.  If they apply in good time they are also approved in

good  time.   Indeed, the class exemption will  also  benefit

Opposition  MPs  on the ground because in a  community  event

some  of  these activities like karaoke singing and so  forth

will now be exempted.  That is an important point to note.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act is not to catch targeted groups of people. Mr

Zulkifli  talks  about civil society groups.   Civil  society

groups  will,  if they put hand to heart, know that  the  Act

also  does not inhibit them.  Indeed, some will even say that

over the last two or three years there has been a renaissance

in  this area because many talks have been organised by  many

civil   society   groups  over  this   time,   including   Mr

Jeyaretnam's  Open Singapore Centre.  The  Think  Centre  has

organised  some  forums.  Other groups like the  Partner  for

Active  Community  and the Working Group Committee  on  Civil

Society, and those Members who are in the societies will know

that  they have been able to secure licences for these talks.

There  is  no question that these amendments or PELU  or  the

Public  Entertainments  Act  inhibit  the  growth  of   civil

societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental point is this. Is the Act

unconstitutional?  Mr Jeyaretnam makes a song and dance about

it.   Again,  he makes no new points.  He repeats old  points

and he does not make correct points.  Worse, he does not stay

in  the House to listen to what is the correct position.   He

is  not here.  As Mr Zulkifli,  a layman, points out, section

14  does  not say that every Singaporean has a right to  free

speech  and he can say whatever he wants, wherever he  wants,

whenever  he  wants.  If that happens, what happens  in  some

other  countries where there may be freer speech will  happen

in  Singapore.  The courts have in fact decided that the  Act

is constitutional.  That is the main point.  This is really a

red herring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the discretion that is exercised under the

Act?   Mr  Jeyaretnam again makes a song and dance about  it.

Mr Zulkifli mentions it.  The Act does give discretion to the

licensing  officer.  But let us not forget that he  does  not

act  alone.  He acts in consultation with relevant  agencies.

For example, he will consult, if it is an establishment of  a

pub,  the  local police division, and look at the suitability

of  the site.  He will consult the NAC.  In fact, except only

in  those rare cases where, for example, there may be  racial

and religious

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



sensitivities, NAC's views have prevailed.  That is what PELU

tells me because NAC is, in fact, the body to advise on  arts

topics.   But  all  of  us would agree  here  that  in  those

instances    where    there   may   be   higher    overriding

considerations,  as  happened in the  recent  Talaq  example,

where  MUIS had come out with very strong objections  on  the

performance of the play, even with the conditions  that  were

proposed by NAC, PELU ultimately decides.  It takes all these

views  into consideration.  It may accord greater  weight  to

some of these views. But ultimately it will decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion has been made whether or not PELU is the

correct  agency  to do this.  PELU currently  is  a  one-stop

agency  for  all  these  activities.  Prof.  Chin  makes  the

argument,  and  Mr Simon Tay makes a strong pitch,  that  the

arts  should  be treated differently because it  may  not  be

strictly  law and order.  There may be a need to balance  the

need  for  artistes to express themselves against  the  wider

public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first say that there is reason for PELU to be

involved because there could be law and order considerations.

For  example,  if  a  play does invoke racial  and  religious

sensitivities and does agitate a community, it  may  lead  to

unhappiness  in  the  community and  disharmony  in  society.

Having  said this, in the specific area of arts performances,

there  is  some  basis for a review to be done  by  PELU   on

whether  it  should be the one-stop agency.   Let  me  assure

Members that the point is taken and PELU will do a review and

MHA  will  consult  MITA  on what is the  best  position  for

Singapore, taking into consideration the development  of  the

arts and also the need to preserve public interest and public

safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to the licensing officer's discretion. He does not

exercise  discretion in vacuo.  Because if you  look  at  the

Act,  section  14  states  the broad  grounds  on  which  his

discretion will be exercised, whether it may lead to a breach

of peace, whether it may be offensive, immoral or subversive,

or whether it would lead to any injury.  So

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



these  are  the broad factors.  Within this framework,  there

are  also specific factors, both for ad hoc licences and  for

establishment licences.  Indeed, Mr Simon Tay  has  raised  a

parliamentary  question on this, asking  what  these  factors

are,  and we have replied.  So it is no secret.  For example,

PELU  will look at the suitability of the applicant,  whether

he   has  got  an  adverse  record,  and  also  look  at  the

suitability of the place.  If it is an establishment licence,

is  it in a residential area?  PELU will look at what is  the

nature  of  the entertainment being provided.  So  these  are

some of the factors PELU will look at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say that in practice, especially for

establishment licences, when there is this to-ing and fro-ing

between  PELU  and  the  applicant,  and  ultimately  if  the

application is turned down, he will have a sense  as  to  why

his application has been turned down.  And indeed, if he does

not, he can ask for reasons. Mr Zulkifli makes a point -  why

not PELU give the reasons upfront.  So let me assure him that

PELU has nothing to hide.  The Act provides for the applicant

to  ask for reasons within seven days and when he does  that,

reasons  are given, after which he has 14 days to  appeal  to

the Minister.  So even though the licensing officer does have

a  discretion, ultimately should there be a rejection and  an

appeal,  it  is  the  Minister,  a  representative   of   the

Government, who will determine according to policies that are

laid  down,  in  particular public interest,  public  safety,

public order, whether or not the event should go ahead.   And

I  think  that  is  constitutional  and  proper  because  the

Minister is an elected representative and he has to  bear  in

mind  all  these  wide considerations.  If the  appellant  is

still  unhappy, he can go to court.  He can ask for  judicial

review.  So the courts are always there.  Mr Jeyaretnam seems

to  allude  that there is no recourse to court.   He  is  not

correct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung makes this point about the demerit

scheme  which I think Mr Zulkifli also makes.  Let me  assure

the  Members that this scheme is not something to  catch  the

applicants or make it more difficult for them to comply

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



with  conditions.  You must understand this  scheme  and  the

spirit  of  the Bill, which is to liberalise it,  which  will

make  punishment  more  transparent, more  certain  and  more

graduated.  This demerit scheme only applies to establishment

licences, not ad hoc licences.  So there is nothing  to  fear

that   with  a  demerit  system,  ad  hoc  applications   for

performance  of  the  arts  or  meetings  or  talks  will  be

affected.   The scheme cannot fit into an ad hoc  mould,  but

only  for establishment licences, because there is a standing

relationship where the licence is granted for one  year,  two

years,  three years, and the person runs the pub.  And  there

will be conditions given to him when he is given a licence to

run  the  pub,  for  example, closing hours,  maintenance  of

register  of  employees, he must not employ  illegal  foreign

workers  or  there must not be gambling or drug  taking.   So

these are conditions.  Some of the conditions, of course, are

more serious than others.  So not maintaining a register  may

not  be  so  serious.   So just like the  Driver  Improvement

Points Scheme (DIPS), all these will be set up, and then  the

points  will be allocated.  So he will know where  he  is  at

this  scale, and what he must not do.  Because he  will  then

know  that if he breaches these conditions, then this  number

of  points will be added on and this penalty will then befall

him.   Even  in  terms of penalty, this demerit scheme  gives

flexibility to PELU because new penalties will be added, like

imposition  of a security deposit  -  that is a penalty  that

will  be  added  on this list  -  or curtailment  of  closing

hours.   At  any  point in time along this  scale  should  he

commit an act whereby a certain penalty is attracted, he will

be  given notice.  Like I have said in my speech, he will  be

given  notice  that  this action is  impending  and  then  to

explain to the Minister or to plead his case.  So that is the

spirit behind the points scheme.  It should work well because

it  would mean that people can operate their businesses  more

effectively and more efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether or not the Speakers' Corner

can  be extended in concept to indoor stadiums.  Again,  this

is  not a new point.  I think he will know that.  But like  I

have said just now, there is no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



need to do that because if you have a talk inside a hotel  or

other premises, you apply for a licence, you will get it.  It

is  better  in fact not to restrict people to one venue.   In

fact,  under  the present scheme, there are so  many  venues.

You want to have a talk inviting the public, you apply for  a

licence,  and the point, like I have said, is the  ease  with

which applications are granted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about the timeframe. Yes, in an

earlier answer, we have said that for establishment licences,

the  current target is eight weeks; for ad hoc licences,  the

current  target is three weeks.  All these will  be  lowered.

Because  now  with the improvement in the  Act  in  terms  of

administration,  with less applications coming  to  the  PELU

officer,  these timings would be lowered.  So PELU will  work

towards lowering the timeframe taken for application.   I  am

quite certain that with all these improvements, the time will

indeed  be lowered.  So that is something that all applicants

can look forward to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think those are the main points that I have answered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I have a clarification, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, Mr Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, regarding these ad hoc and

establishment licences, in the case of Potong Pasir, we  have

a  series of events throughout the year, can we apply for  an

establishment  licence in the sense that we get  one  licence

for the whole year's activities?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> That is a series of ad hoc

events.  So it is not like operating a pub or a lounge,  that

is  an  establishment licence.  So I am afraid Mr Chiam would

have to apply, but it is not a problem applying.  He has been

granted many of these licences.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But is the Minister willing to

consider giving the Potong Pasir

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



Town Council one licence for the whole year?  Then we do  not

have to apply again and pay separate fees.   Instead, we just

pay one fee alone.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think Mr Chiam knows

that,  first, events may change.  You are not sure  what  you

will  do  nine  months down the road.  I think Mr  Chiam  did

apply   for  a  licence  for  a  talk  in  his  Potong  Pasir

Neighbourhood  Park, but then there was a last minute  change

because his organisers said that Mr Chiam could not make  it.

That happens, you see.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am talking about the regular

events  that we normally have.  We have got table tennis,  we

have got ---

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Chiam says it is regular.

I  think all of us who work the ground know it, even PAP MPs.

You  may say it is regular, you may have a schedule, but then

nearer  the  time of the event, you may travel,  or  you  are

indisposed.  So I think it is only fair to PELU, for  you  to

apply  when the event is more certain, and if it falls within

the  ambit of the Act, and now it has been relaxed, you  will

get your licence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I seek a point of clarification from

the Minister of State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point of clarification is about the advisory

panels.   The  Minister of State has said in his  reply  that

they  do listen to some other people, but we are not certain,

it  is not predetermined who will be heard most.  What is his

reply  to the suggestion about a fixed advisory panel on  the

lines  of the Films Act and censorship of films?  Why  is  it

any different?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of clarification I seek from the

Minister  of  State  is his reply on the  suggestion  for  an

indoor  version of the Speakers' Corner.  His reply was  that

one  can apply for a licence anywhere, and therefore is  that

not  better.  But surely, Sir, does the Minister of State not

realise that the efficacy of a Speakers' Corner (Hong Lim) is

the  speed of the licensing process?  You go down there,  you

get it within 15 minutes or half an hour, and that is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



same  idea that would distinguish an indoor Speakers'  Corner

from  the `apply three weeks in advance you can speak in  any

hotel' idea.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I will take Mr Simon Tay's

first  point.   On  his  suggestion  for  a  panel  involving

citizens,  the  films model, when the review is  being  done,

this  can  be  considered, because if  MITA  takes  over  the

function,  I am sure they will look at what model works.   On

the other point, let us look at the timeframe.  Currently, it

is three weeks.  But, like I have said, PELU is determined to

bring  it down.  So with the shorter timeframe, the time  lag

that Mr Simon Tay talks about will be less.  The other point,

of  course,  is  whether  we want to  have  a  setting  of  a

Speakers'  Corner in an indoor setting with microphone,  with

people  in  close proximity and speaking whatever they  want.

Because  for a Speakers' Corner, as it is, as is well  known,

even the topic is not known.  So in an open setting where  it

is  visible,  where  you  do  not  use  the  microphone,  the

possibility  of  law  and order problem arising  is  reduced,

which  experience  has  borne  out.   I  think  it  is  quite

different in an indoor setting with a microphone where  there

will  be  more  heckling, people are in close proximity,  and

adherents   of  different  opinions  will  then  jostle   for

attention and who knows, fisticuffs may take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the system now is a better approach. Let us

leave  it  at that where if there are indoor talks where  the

public  is  invited, tell us what the topic is, and  if  PELU

sees  that  the  application deserves approval,  it  will  be

approved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> I understand that the Act

exempts activities organised by grassroots organisations like

the  PA.   Would the Minister of State consider  also  giving

exemption  to  community activities organised  by  Opposition

MPs,  like Mr Chiam has just raised, activities organised  by

the   Town   Council,   or   activities   organised   by   my

constituency's committees?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, for the community events

which involve magic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



shows, puppet shows, karaoke, under the class exemption, they

will already be exempted.  But the talks, I think, is another

matter.  Not that we want to restrict your desire to speak to

your residents.  The reason is because the relaxation  -   in

fact  this was a relaxation announced in Parliament  just  at

the  last sitting  -  is so that the elected MP can speak  to

residents  of  his  own  ward  in  an  outdoor  constituency,

community  setting.  Right now, it will  be  up  to  PELU  to

decide,  based on the facts of the case whether or  not  this

requirement has been satisfied.  So I think it is better  for

PELU to make a decision, because if you think that, yes, this

is  a constituency community setting, so you fall within  the

Act,  and you organise it, and lo and behold, 800 people turn

up,  half of whom are from outside the constituency, then you

will  be  caught by the Act.  So let us not go  through  that

trouble.  I think Mr Chiam's experience has shown that if you

apply,  PELU looks at it objectively, if it falls within  the

ambit  of the relaxation, the licence will be given  in  good

time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will allow one last clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> The Minister of State in his

clarification earlier has mentioned a review.  Can I ask  him

whether this is just simply an ongoing constant review, as he

alluded  to earlier, or would he commit to a definite  review

on  certain points such as an advisory panel, with a reply to

this House at a definite date?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> As I said, a review will be

conducted.   So  it is a specific review looking  at  whether

this should be done by some other agency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

custody of the children.  If there is no such person present,

Police  officers  will  allow the  offender  to  contact  the

spouse,  next-of-kin  or friend to look after  the  children.

Alternatively, the offender would be asked to consider asking

his/her  neighbour  to help take care of the  children  while

waiting for the spouse, next-of-kin or friend to arrive.

* An adult or older child assessed to be sufficiently mature.

This judgement will be exercised by an officer.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  whether  believers are allowed  to  burn  joss

sticks  and  incense  in front of their house  in  a  private

housing  estate and how a police officer will  mediate  in  a

quarrel and a fight started by a neighbour who disagrees with

such practices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burning of joss sticks and incense is governed by

guidelines  issued by the Ministry of the  Environment.   ENV

does not object to the burning of joss sticks and incense  in

front  of houses in a private housing estate as long as these

guidelines are complied with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a quarrel or a fight between neighbours is

reported, the Police's main role is to maintain law and order

and ensure that there is no breach of the peace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Police arrival, if no fight has taken place, or a non-seizable offence such as voluntarily causing hurt has been

committed,  both parties will be interviewed and  advised  to

observe  the peace.  Where appropriate, they will be  advised

Mediation Centre (CMC) to resolve their dispute.

<div align="center"><b>MAINTENANCE OF EXTERNAL WINDOW SURFACES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for National

Development, in view of many maids who have fallen off lately

from window ledges that they were cleaning, whether it is the

management  committee's duty to maintain the external  window

surfaces  since these and the external surfaces of  buildings

are considered common property under the Land Titles (Strata)

Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For strata-subdivided buildings, windows installed in

the   external  walls  of  the  buildings,  unless  otherwise

specified, are common property and the Management Corporation

(MC) is responsible for the maintenance. However, the MC may,

under   a  resolution,  decide  on  how  to  discharge   this

responsibility. For example, they can pass a by-law  to  make

the  owners  responsible for cleaning the  windows  in  their

units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, owners have sometimes taken it upon

themselves to clean the external windows when they are dirty,

since  they have the access from inside their flats. The  MCs

may have difficulty stopping the owners from doing so.

Although  there are some domestic workers who have fallen  to

their deaths from heights, the number is small in relation to

the  population of more than 100,000 domestic workers working

in Singapore. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is

very concerned with the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons why domestic workers fall from

heights. Hence, it is not possible to solve the problem using

any single solution. MOM has adopted a multi-pronged approach

in dealing with the issue. It has mounted several initiatives

to educate both employers and their domestic workers on the

importance of safety at work in the home environment. These

include producing an information kit for the employers, an

orientation video for the workers and the recently launched

"Handy Guide for Foreign Domestic Workers". MOM will be

coming out with new programmes to enhance the level of

professionalism of employment agents in Singapore, including

a review of our existing regulatory framework. It has also

worked with CDCs to help organize safety courses for domestic

workers. In this regard MOM will continue to work with

community and non-governmental organizations to conduct

safety courses for domestic workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who are criminally negligent in unnecessarily

exposing their domestic workers to work hazards will be

prosecuted under the Penal Code.  Employers also have a moral

responsibility to ensure that their domestic workers work

safely and are not exposed to unnecessary work hazards. This

responsibility cannot be passed on to a third party including

the Government. Employers would have to be prudent in using a

safe method when they or their family member or domestic

worker clean the window.

<div align="center"><b>MIFEPRISTONE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health  (a) since Mifepristone is not dispensed in Singapore,

whether  the  Government  sees a need  to  adopt  appropriate

measures  to  stop any transaction of this drug  through  the

Internet; and (b) whether the Government has the intention of

legalising  this drug in due time to be consistent  with  FDA

guidelines in the United States.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Medicines Act, importers and distributors of

medicinal products must be licensed by the Ministry.   Buyers

of  unregistered medicinal products such as Mifepristone  can

be  prosecuted for importing or procuring medicinal  products

without a proper licence. The Ministry of Health has strongly

advised  the  public  not to purchase  unregulated  medicinal

products  through the Internet as the quality and  source  of

such products cannot be vouched for.  Given the nature of  e-commerce, it would be difficult to prevent Singaporeans  from

buying prescription drugs through the Internet.  However, any

postal items that are suspected to contain prescription drugs

from   overseas  are  referred  by  the  Customs  and  Excise

Department to the National Pharmaceutical Administration  for

inspection.   NPA  will  continue to monitor  local  internet

sites  and take appropriate action against sites found to  be

offering prescription drugs for sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has not received any application for the

registration of the abortion pill, Mifepristone, widely known

as RU 486.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All drugs are evaluated for quality, safety and efficacy

before they are registered for use in Singapore. The Ministry

considers  all  the scientific and clinical  data  submitted,

including  information available from other established  drug

regulatory   agencies.    We  also  consider   the   clinical

applicability  of  the drug to our local population  and  its

potential  side  effects.   Local clinical  experts  and  the

Medicines  Advisory Committee, an expert committee  appointed

under  the Medicines Act, are consulted.  While we take  note

of  decisions made by overseas regulatory agencies  like  the

FDA,  the  decision to register a pharmaceutical  product  in

Singapore  will  need  to take into consideration  our  local

clinical context and our healthcare practices.

<div align="center"><b>TEENAGE ABORTIONS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Health,  in view of the recent demand from the community  for

parental  consent in teenage abortions, whether he  will  (i)

seek  broader  discussions and consensus on  this  matter  by

forming a review committee to reappraise the issues and  (ii)

adopt  a fresh look in reviewing the Termination of Pregnancy

Act  to  strengthen  some  level  of  monitoring  on  teenage

abortions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry reviews the regulations and procedures in

the  Termination  of  Pregnancy Act  regularly.   We  welcome

feedback and suggestions on how to improve them.  Many of the

points  raised  in the recent debate on parental  consent  in

teenage  abortions  are  not  new.   If  there  are  specific

suggestions  on  how  to  improve the monitoring  of  teenage

abortions, we are prepared to incorporate them.
