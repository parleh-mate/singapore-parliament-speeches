<div align="center"><b>(Conversion into park and children's playground)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law

and   National  Development  if  he  will  consider

converting the open space at Thomson Garden  Estate

(Mukim  18, Lots 12-13 and 12-14) into a  park  and

children's  playground and, if so,  when  the  work

will be carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the open space at Thomson Garden Estate at the

junction of Jalan Pintau and Jalan Chempah  is  one

of  the  20  open spaces earmarked for  development

into    parks-cum-playgrounds   for   the   1971-72

financial year. Work on this project is expected to

commence towards the later part of this year.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BONUS INCENTIVES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FOR FACTORY WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if he will request factory owners  to  set

aside  a  certain  percentage  from  the  factory's

annual profits so that the amount set aside can  be

given to workers as annual bonus incentives.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, section 46 (1) of the Employment Act,

1968,  (No. 17 of 1968) already provides  that  the

contract of service or collective agreement between

an  employer  and  his  employees  may  contain   a

provision   for  the  payment  of  an  amount   not

exceeding the equivalent of one month's wages of an

employee   as  bonus  or  ex  gratia  payment.   In

addition,  section 46 (2) of the  Act  states  that

nothing  in subsection (1) of section 46  shall  be

construed   as  preventing  an  employer   at   his

discretion  from  paying  as  bonus  or  ex  gratia

payment  an  amount that exceeds the equivalent  of

one  month's wages as an incentive to his employees

to  increase their productivity or as a reward  for

their  services. Bonus up to one month's salary  is

now therefore a negotiable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



item  between employer and employee. And it is  not

necessary to request factory owners to set aside  a

certain   percentage  from  the  factory's   annual

profits  to  be given as an annual bonus incentive.

In  fact, the wise factory owner will also  usually

make an allowance for incentive or reward bonus  in

his  calculations  without being  told  to  do  so,

although  some  timely urging on the  part  of  the

unions always helps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already stated in the debate on the

Government  financial policy that when the  effects

of  the  accelerated  military run-down  have  been

clearly  overcome, we shall have  to  consider  how

best  workers  should be enabled to  share  in  any

increased  profits where they result from increased

productivity  or  from a general expansion  of  the

economy.  One  of the ways would be to  make  bonus

payments  negotiable beyond the present  limitation

of one month's salary. This has been legislated for

in certain countries and is the practice in others.

In  our  own  situation,  however,  this  could  be

against  our  main  policy  of  attracting   middle

technology   industries.  We  want   more   capital

intensive   high  skills  and  high   value   added

industries in Singapore. They come mainly from  the

Western  industrial countries where the payment  of

bonus is not a practice. West European and American

companies  prefer to pay higher wages  rather  than

bonuses. They want concealed benefits reduced to  a

minimum  so  that they know where they  stand  from

year to year. This philosophy treats profits as the

result  of efficient management, and losses as  the

result  of the ineffective use of expensive labour,

since all employers pay their workers the same rate

for  the  job.  We  shall  make  a  decision  after

carefully weighing the pros and cons. Our  decision

must  advance  our purpose, namely,  to  raise  the

living standard of Singapore workers through higher

skills and higher productivity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, will the Minister

for   Finance   consider   requesting   established

factories  which  have over  the  years  made  good

profits  to  make  ex  gratia  payments  to   their

employees?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I have already stated that there

is  in the law a provision for unions to take  this

up.  Although  bonus is not negotiable  beyond  one

month,  I said that some timely urging on the  part

of  the  unions  always helps  in  making  payments

beyond what may have been negotiated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, it may be true that such

practice  may be going on. But I am told that  many

employers make use of the Employment Act as a lever

in  their  negotiations with unions on the question

of bonus.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have nothing

to  add  to what I have said. The position is  that

the  employers will negotiate on bonus payments  up

to   one   month's   wages  in   their   collective

agreements.  Beyond one month, this is  at  present

discretionary.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  does the Minister for Finance not think  that

foreign  investors should do in Singapore what  the

Singaporeans  do in respect of bonus  payments?  In

other  words, should they not try to adopt a simple

practice like that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, that is a philosophy which

we   cannot  adopt  in  all  cases.  For   example,

Singaporeans have not carried out industrialisation

previously,  and  if  you apply  that  very  simple

philosophy to what Singaporeans have been doing  in

the past, then there would be no industrialisation.

In  the same way I do not think that the fact  that

some  companies  pay  bonuses  means  that  Western

industrialised companies should do the same.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, does the Minister for

Finance  realise that he has thrown a  red  herring

into the whole issue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

for   Finance  has  mentioned  just  now  the  word

"discretion" used by employers in respect of  bonus

payments.  Is  he or is he not aware  that  a  good

number  of  commercial firms make good profits  and

the  Employment Act prevents the unions from asking

for better bonus payments?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I am aware of the

provisions  of  the law and I am  aware  that  some

companies make profits and some companies quote the

provisions  of the Employment Act. I  have  already

said  that  this is a matter which  is  being  very

carefully considered. There are pros and cons and a

decision  will  be made after a study  of  all  the

factors.  Whether  we  should legislate  for  bonus

payments,  or whether we should encourage companies

so  that they consolidate bonus payments into wages

and  then stimulate higher productivity, is a  very

controversial  matter  and  requires  very  careful

consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, is the

Minister aware that some of the American firms  pay

bonus?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Yes, I am aware.

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Control measures)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  how many illegal immigrants were  detained

during  the  period 1st January to  28th  February,

1971; and what plans he has to stop the social  and

security  threat posed by the unceasing  inflow  of

such persons.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of illegal

immigrants detained during the period 1st  January,

1971, to the 28th February, 1971, is exactly 119.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of illegal entry into Singapore is

under  the  constant attention of  the  Immigration

Department. However, a fully effective air, sea and

land  control system to prevent illegal immigration

entails a sizable increase in expense and manpower.

Concerted  action is being taken by the Police  and

Immigration  Departments  to  guard  the  Singapore

coast-line  against acts of illegal entry.  Special

police  constables  are constantly  being  deployed

around certain beaches as shore patrols, while  the

Marine   Police  patrol  boats  cover  the  coastal

waters. In addition, spot checks and investigations

and raids are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



conducted  by  the Immigration Department  and  the

Police   from  time  to  time  to  detect   illegal

immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When illegal immigrants are arrested, action is

taken  forthwith against them under the Immigration

(Amendment)  Act,  1970.  Traffickers  of   illegal

immigrants are severely dealt with under the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflow of illegal immigrants continues.

However,   the   number   of  immigrants   entering

Singapore  illegally does not constitute  a  social

threat.  As regards security, the position is  well

under  control  and  there  is  no  threat  to  our

security.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

can  the  Minister for Home Affairs say  from  what

countries most of the illegal immigrants come?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, I cannot give the actual

number  of  illegal immigrants from any  particular

country.  But most of them come from Indonesia  and

Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, will the Minister be kind

enough to give the number of illegal immigrants who

were  detained during the period as  asked  for  in

this question?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> I thought I had given the

figure  earlier.  The number of illegal  immigrants

detained during the period is exactly 119.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of debate on Question (23rd March,

1971),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced  by $10 in respect of subhead 1001."-  [Mr

Teong Eng Siong].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.44 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1301 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Committee was discussing the

first amendment to Head 1301 - Ministry of

Finance - when it was interrupted at the Moment

of Interruption last night. The Question is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  at the Moment of Interruption  last

night,  I was trying to explain, in answer  to  the

Member  for  Whampoa, that our civil service  rules

and   regulations  are  not  revised  at   specific

intervals but are being continuously looked into so

that  revisions can be made as and  when  they  are

conceived,  and  they are then put into  loose-leaf

registers.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Whampoa knows of any particular

deficiencies in the service conditions, perhaps  he

will  be good enough to let us know what these  are

and I shall be very grateful and make the necessary

amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also some criticism by the Member for

Telok  Blangah  of  the manner in  which  personnel

relations  were being handled in my  Ministry.  The

suggestion was that it was desirable to emulate the

private   sector  in  their  personnel   management

practices and that we should introduce more  modern

management techniques. Like all institutions, there

is  room  for  improvement in our Ministry  and  we

shall,  of  course,  try our best  to  improve  our

techniques.  In  fact,  my  officers  have  already

started courses in modern management techniques  in

the  Staff Training Institute, and we shall try  to

include  in  them personnel management courses.  At

the  same time, I think our officers are doing very

well, in spite of the shortage that we have in  the

General  Administrative Service,  in  tackling  the

various  problems  that  are  coming  in  from  the

Ministries. I think it is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



comparatively  less  complex  matter  to   be   the

personnel  manager of a firm with 10,  15,  100  or

even  500  workers  than  to  be  in  charge  of  a

Government  Ministry where the workers are  counted

in  tens  of  thousands. Even if you  consider  the

private  sector,  when you come to  companies  like

General  Motors or Imperial Chemical Industries,  I

think you will find that the need for uniformity in

treatment,  in  service conditions  and  any  other

company  practices are not dissimilar to  those  in

the  Government Ministries, and that the  decisions

have to be consistent, and if you have a precedent,

you must be prepared to apply that precedent to all

other employees in the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a comment that the grievances of

the  various civil service organisations  were  not

being  handled  expeditiously. It was  stated  that

there  was only one Executive Officer to deal  with

the  daily-rated  workers. This  is  certainly  not

correct.  If the Member will look at the Government

Directory,  he  will  see  that,  apart  from   the

Permanent Secretary, the Deputy Secretary  is  also

in  charge of service conditions, and there  is  an

Assistant Secretary dealing specifically with daily-rated  workers, although a Higher Executive Officer

also handles them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the claims of grievances of

workers,  I  believe that last year we handled  the

problems of the technical services, as a result  of

which  a  new  scheme  of  service  conditions  was

implemented in October last year. I hope this gives

some  satisfaction at least to the Member for Telok

Blangah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other services, I think we have

already   stated  that  as  far  as  education   is

concerned,  we  are ready to proceed  with  further

discussions  with  the teachers  after  the  budget

session.   The  Cabinet  has  appointed  a   review

committee  to deal with the Police grievances,  and

we  will  follow  in  short  order  with  the  Fire

Brigade,  and the Customs and Immigration services,

while  in  the  Ministry of Finance itself  we  are

looking into the clerical services scheme. That  is

all I have to add at this stage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, the Minister for Finance

yesterday made the point that Government can  never

compete on an equal footing with the commercial and

industrial  sectors in the matter of  salaries  for

civil  servants. He said that even if  he  were  to

grant  a  20  per cent increase in  all  the  civil

service salaries, this would not take care  of  the

problem.  While I do recognise that it is virtually

impossible  for Government to match  salaries  with

the  commercial and industrial sectors, I  do  hope

that  the Minister will not just throw up his hands

and  say, "No increase at all," because I do  think

that  some  inducement  is  necessary,  and  I   do

recognise  that people are not solely motivated  by

higher  salaries,  as the Minister  himself  is  an

outstanding example of this, because, before he got

into  Parliament,  he was apparently  earning  much

more than he is getting now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hon, do you want to answer

this? I thought you had answered it last night.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Perhaps I can make a counter

comment. The position is that we will be prepared -

in   fact,  we  have  considered  the  question  of

superscale  salaries. I will take into account  the

opinion  of  the Member for Whampoa that  increases

are  justified for the top echelons  in  the  civil

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  before I withdraw my amendment, I would  like

the Minister to clarify two points. Last night when

he  replied to my questions, he admitted  that  the

prices  of daily necessities were actually  on  the

increase.  He  also did not agree that  a  loaf  of

bread should be increased by five cents. He thought

that  actually  there should  be  only  a  one-cent

increase. I would like to ask him what measures  he

will take to check this spate of price increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that his reply rather

conflicts with that given by his Minister of State.

Yesterday  his  Minister of  State  said  that  the

Government  would try its best to help promote  the

setting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



up  of a consumers' association in order to protect

the interest of the consumers, whereas the Minister

himself was not too keen to help set it up. Who  is

actually  right? I would like the Minister  or  his

Minister of State to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, there was no

misunderstanding on the setting up of a  consumers'

association. At a later stage I made it quite clear

that  we  would be prepared to help this consumers'

association if they require assistance,  either  in

the  matter  of  statistics  or  prices  which  our

inspectors  can investigate, or in  the  matter  of

quality  control which the Singapore  institute  of

Standards  and  Industrial Research  will  help  to

test.  The answer, therefore, to the first question

-  in  what  way  can we help? -  is  to  help  the

consumers' association help themselves. I  think  I

made it quite clear that I would not be inclined to

advocate  price  control,  because  this  would  be

detrimental to further supplies coming forward  and

would  not  be a solution, but we will, of  course,

take  cognisance of any increase in prices, and  if

there  are possibilities of lowering prices  by  an

increase in imports from cheaper sources,  we  will

try our best to encourage this.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

detailed explanation given by the Minister  and  my

hope  that he will take practical measures to carry

out his suggestions, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1102.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister for

Finance  what  are the qualifications required  for

the post of Senior Economist, and whether this post

is  currently filled. I notice that in  the  entire

Ministry of Finance there is only one post  for  an

economist. Sir, economists are rather indispensable

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I would like to find out from

the Minister why there is only one such post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the post of

Senior  Economist in the Economic Section  has  not

been filled. This post was at one time known as the

Director of Projects in the Economic Planning  Unit

and  was  converted to that of Senior Economist  in

1969.  It  is not expected to fill this  particular

post  easily. Our practice has been to try to  fill

it by posting from the Administrative Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should clarify the position that in our

Economic  Section there is not just one such  post.

In  fact,  a Deputy Secretary is in charge  of  the

whole function of economic research, and there  are

quite  a  number of economists as well as engineers

and  others in our Economic Section. We  have  some

difficulty  in  getting  more  economists  to  come

forward,  and  we shall be glad if the  Member  for

Whampoa can introduce any additional economists  to

us.  What we have been trying to do is to  get  the

Economic  Research  Centre  of  the  University  of

Singapore  to co-operate with us by seconding  some

personnel. They have, in fact, done so in the past.

They  have agreed to make available, on an  overall

supervisory  basis  a  senior  economist  for   our

purposes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I notice there are a lot

of  engineers in the Economic Section. I do not see

how  engineers can perform the work of  economists.

There are economists and economists. I am concerned

not  just  with  the  ordinary economist,  but  the

economist  spelt with a capital "E"; that  means  a

well-trained  economist.  May  I  know   from   the

Minister  for  Finance why he  has  not  started  a

scholarship scheme or a fellowship scheme  to  send

bright  people abroad, and to maintain a  corps  of

very  competent top-grade economists who  are  well

trained?  Sir,  we cannot just go  on  the  present

makeshift  basis  whereby  we  have  people  do  an

analysis that such and such a thing went up  by  so

many percentage points or went down by so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



many  percentage points. They should  make  a  real

analysis.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I was hoping that the

University  of Singapore would turn out  sufficient

economists  for  our use. In fact, they  have  been

turning  out economists in increasing numbers,  but

again we are in competition with the private sector

for the recruitment of these graduates. I think the

people  who go overseas to study do not always  all

come  back into Government service. In many  cases,

like  the  Member for Whampoa himself,  they  would

rather serve the University upon their return  than

go into Government service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, yesterday I talked about

Ministers  passing the buck or the  ball.  Here  is

another example. I have asked the Minister  why  he

has  not started a scholarship programme for  Ph.D.

economists,  and  he has passed  the  buck  to  the

University  of Singapore. I think this  is  a  very

serious matter, jokes aside.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I agree that this is a very

serious  matter,  and  I  wish  the  University  of

Singapore  would  turn out their  own  Masters  and

Ph.D.s.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, in such matters I do not

think we could, because we do not have enough  top-grade  people to train as good Masters and  Ph.D.s.

The  question is: why do we not send  them  to  the

top? In Mathematics, there is a concept called  the

derivatives - the first derivative and  the  second

derivative. If we send our bright people  to,  say,

the  top  ten universities in the world where  they

have  the  cream  of the professions,  they  become

derived  products of these top people.  When  these

products,  i.e., the first derivatives, come  back,

they train other people, and we then get the second

derivatives,  because very few people ever  measure

up to the qualities of their teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the question of incentive,

which  may  be  lacking in Government  service  for

Masters and Ph.D.s. I raised this point yesterday,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Minister just brushed it aside and  said,

"Well,  money  is not the only thing that  matters.

What is two or four increments?", and so on. But to

a  young  man  starting out  on  a  career,  a  few

increments can make a great deal of difference.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we can

go on arguing indefinitely how economists should be

trained,  or whether they should be sent  overseas.

We  have  sent quite a number of them overseas  and

some  have  returned; and we hope that  the  second

derivatives will have already been in evidence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, since it appears that I

have won the argument, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1373.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only raising a point of clarification, Sir,

because  there  was no similar provision  for  last

year   in   respect  of  "Housing   Allowance   for

Expatriate    Engineers,    Architects,    Quantity

Surveyors".



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the reason for this

allowance  is  that  last year  we  recruited  five

officers,  i.e., four engineers and one  architect,

from overseas. These officers, who assumed duty  in

March 1970, were appointed on contract terms for  a

period of three years and, in accordance with their

terms  of  service,  were eligible  for  Government

quarters or housing allowance in lieu thereof.  The

eligibility for housing allowance only  applies  to

the first term of contract.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rates of housing allowance payable are as

follows:



<pre>

         Single officer       $250 per month



         Married officer      $350 per month



         Married officer

           with children      $550 per month

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision we have entered in the 1971-72

Estimates is to provide housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



allowances for about 20 engineers whom we  hope  to

recruit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1461.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I have your permission, Sir, to range over my

next amendment*?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1466.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, yesterday reference was made

in this House to the upgrading of civil servants in

terms of salary scales. Reference was also made  to

the  academic qualifications of civil servants.  My

concern is whether action is being taken to improve

the performance of our civil servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the Minister

for  Finance  on  the establishment  of  the  Staff

Training  Institute. He has given adequate  details

in  his  speech  at the official  opening  of  this

institute.  I note that the courses will  not  only

benefit  administrative  officers  but  also  other

subordinate  categories  of  staff  who   will   be

included in this training scheme. The Minister  has

generally  clarified the sort of courses that  will

be   provided.  If  I  may  ask  a  few  incidental

questions on this. Is it correct for us to  presume

that  the  instructors will come  from  within  the

civil  service itself as well as from  outside  the

service? I observe that a certain sum is designated

as  allowance  to instructors. May I ask  what  the

rates of allowance will be?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fundamentally, may I suggest that a basic

full-time  staff be established for this institute,

and that ancillary staff could be composed of part-time instructors, either from within or without the

civil  service? In this way it will be  easier  for

integrated packages of courses to be designed which

will  afford  training in depth  and  result  in  a

fundamental  improvement in the  calibre  of  civil

service  officers in the various grades.  Moreover,

by having a corps of full-time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



staff,  it will be more convenient  and  more

easily manageable for evaluation of the effects  of

such courses to be made and for appropriate follow-up action to be organised. I hope also that courses

will  be  conducted  in creative  learning-teaching

situations without too much subscription  to  chalk

and  talk  and rows of civil servants listening  to

the  guru  who  may happen to be a  senior  officer

handing it out to those who sit at his feet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not notice that even under O. C. A. R, there

are  votes  for audiovisual equipment. I hope  that

when  courses  are given, every appropriate  resort

will  be made to devices in terms of the format  of

the  course as well as in terms of equipment, which

will   facilitate  training  and  result  in  civil

servants   considering   it   a   worth-while   and

interesting endeavour to have participated in  this

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would also like to know what is

meant by "on-the-job training". If it is considered

that on-the-job training is important to supplement

on-course training, what is being done to formalise

or  institutionalise  such procedures,  apart  from

flinging the Instruction Manual at a new incumbent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the courses

which  are  being  run have been  mentioned  in  my

speech to which the Member for Katong has referred.

In  1971 we will begin with an intermediate  course

in   Management   and  Public  Administration   for

administrative  officers, and  go  on  to  advanced

courses in Management and Public Administration for

more senior administrative officers. We will induct

and  provide  intermediate courses for officers  in

the  General  Executive and Clerical  Services.  We

will   have   courses   for  Personal   Assistants,

Receptionists,  Telephone  Operators,  and  Counter

Clerks. We have courses in the Outward Bound School

and  in  the  National  Youth  Leadership  Training

Institute  for  officers in supervisory  positions.

And  we  will  have Language courses  for  officers

required to pass language examinations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructors for the courses will come from

various  sources. I think the major  part  will  be

drawn  from the civil servants themselves, but  for

the  intermediate, advanced and induction  courses,

experienced  and  senior civil  servants,  together

with  officers  from statutory  boards,  will  give

lectures. But we will also invite qualified persons

from  the private sector and institutions  such  as

the  University  of Singapore, Nanyang  University,

the  Singapore Institute of Management,  and  other

bodies   to   give  courses  in  their  fields   of

specialisation,   especially   in    relation    to

management practices and techniques which have been

mentioned  by  Members  in relation  to  the  civil

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allowances which will be paid to instructors

and  lecturers  vary  according  to  the  level  of

instruction and nature of the courses. Generally, I

think   the   intermediate  and   advanced   course

instructors  will be paid up to $25 an hour,  while

in  the  case  of  language instruction  there  are

various  rates;  maybe  the Adult  Education  Board

scale  of fees will be adopted. These vary from  $4

to  $10 an hour. Staff members of the institute who

also  give lectures will not be paid any fee. There

will be some permanent members, but in view of  the

very wide field that we are going to cover, it will

not  be  possible  for us to have  full-time  staff

lecturers in all the various courses that we want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to equipment, the Member for Katong is

quite right - at the moment we have no audio-visual

equipment, but we hope that as we go on this can be

provided. It is always possible, of course, to  get

it  on  loan from the various organisations.  Until

the  need  is proved, I do not think we  should  go

immediately into the purchase of this equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to what is meant by on-the-job

training,  it  means that, instead of just  getting

new recruits into the administrative service thrown

into  the  jobs,  as was the case before,  we  will

provide   a  more  supervised  kind  of  on-the-job

training.  We have, therefore, in the  Ministry  of

Finance created a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



Deputy Secretary's post and the officer will be  in

charge of all matters relating to training as  well

as supervision.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer will see that the new recruits are

properly  looked after in relation to  the  courses

attended.  It  is not so much a question  of  posts

requiring to be filled by officers as the  training

of  the  administrative officers. Supervision  will

mean   that  from  time  to  time  there  will   be

interviews   with   the   administrative    officer

concerned to see that he is making progress.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I referred

to  the  possibility of a full-time  staff,  I  was

thinking especially of the problem of evaluation. I

think  it  is  necessary to keep a  watch  on  what

effect  these  courses  are  having  on  our  civil

servants so that we can make improvements as we  go

along.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to make is that one

cannot  really  do  a  good  teaching  job  without

resorting judiciously to teaching equipment: just a

question of exposing a formal course to an audience

is  not  enough. I do not know whether the Minister

would like to answer, but in any case I withdraw my

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Deputy Secretary, who is a

career  officer, will do it. She is a lady  and  if

you regard her as one of the permanent staff of the

institute, then we have a permanent staff for  this

post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (6) *. May I indicate

to  the  Member for Whampoa that he  had  the  same

amendment   under  Head  0201  -  Prime  Minister's

Office.  The  answer was given by the  Minister  of

Defence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I am concerned with the

economic aspect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is the same. Anyway, please

carry on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (3) of  subhead

2091*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have correctly pointed out, Sir, the

matter  I  wish to raise is similar to  the  one  I

raised  under the Prime Minister's Office. But  the

reply  given  to  me  at that  time  was  that  the

increased    provision    was    due     to     the

commercialisation   of  the   Government   Printing

Office. But it seems to me that the sums which have

to be paid are rather exorbitant. Is the Government

Printer not being put in a position of monopoly  in

respect of the printing of such materials?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, to some

extent, the price must be the same as that for  the

Prime Minister's Office. The Government Printer  is

going  to charge all departments for the work  that

he does. In some cases, it is not possible for this

work  to  be done by printers outside, for example,

confidential  Gazette Notifications or,  I  assume,

maybe  even  the  Hansard. But in  other  cases  we

expect  the Government Printing Office to be  in  a

competitive  position with printers  outside.  They

will  also  be  allowed  to  compete  for  business

outside Government Ministries and departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the amount that is being provided,

there  are two parts here. One is $18,640 which  is

expected to be for the requirements of the Ministry

of  Finance. Then there is a sum of $5,000 which is

subject to Treasury sanction. We have provided  for

various  small  sums  to be spent  in  the  various

Ministries  and  departments  which  may  not  have

sufficient  money for the necessary vote.  In  such

cases we will pay out of this $5,000.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as long as

there  is  some means of ensuring that  the  prices

being charged by the Government Printing Office are

competitive,  I  am  satisfied.  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2093.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to

refer  to Hansard, Volume 29, column 704,  when  in

the course of debating this particular subhead last

year,  my  colleague, the Member for Anson,  raised

the  question of uniforms for office boys, postmen,

etc. He described the material for the uniforms  as

being  coarse and unrefined, and that the  uniforms

did  not look smart. His proposal was to change the

uniform  for  one made of better refined  material.

The   then  Minister  for  Finance  said  that  the

proposal  of the Member for Anson was an  excellent

one  and  that he would look into the matter.  Sir,

during  the  present debate, the Member for  Mountbatten has also raised the question of uniforms for

our  postmen. I think it is time that  our  postmen

and  other uniformed employees be supplied  with  a

uniform  made of material which is not only durable

but  also comfortable to wear. I hope that at least

by the end of the current year, the Government will

do  something  about changing the uniforms  of  our

uniformed staff.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Anson  raised the question of uniforms at the  last

budget  session and my predecessor had promised  to

look into the matter. In fact, action to change the

material  for the uniforms was taken in April  last

year.  However, as the supply of uniforms to office

boys and other Division Four grades is a matter  of

agreement  with  the Amalgamated  Union  of  Public

Employees,  we had to consult them to  see  whether

they  agreed on this matter. Following an agreement

on the change of uniform, a circular to this effect

was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



issued  in December. All departments were  informed

that when the present stock of the drill cloth  was

exhausted,  uniforms  made  with  a  new  material,

composed  of  65 per cent teteron and 35  per  cent

viscose,  would  be  used. The  following  are  the

grades of officers who would be provided with these

uniforms:  the National Museum janitor,  laboratory

assistants, library attendants, messengers,  museum

attendants, museum collectors, office boys,  office

keepers  and  lift attendants. I think  the  Member

suggested  at  the last budget sitting  that  there

should  be  no  increase in the price of  uniforms.

This  is not possible and the estimated expenditure

has therefore risen from $43,000 to $50,000 for the

ensuing  financial year. However, we will  use  the

old stock to keep the initial cost low.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I am pleased to hear of

the  change of uniforms. I hope our uniformed staff

will  also be pleased with the new uniform.  I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2099.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead is in respect of expenses in

connection   with  visits  of  experts,   advisers,

consultants,  etc.  I wish to  find  out  from  the

Minister  in  detail  the  number  of  experts  who

visited  us  last  year;  that  is,  what  are  the

categories  of officers and what is the  nature  of

the  expenses  incurred  in connection  with  their

visits, and why is there an increased provision  of

about $60,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

central  vote for the services of experts  for  the

whole  of the civil service. The number of  experts

provided by the various organisations from 1970  to

1971  was as follows: There were three experts from

the  International Executive Service  Corps  -  one

expert to assist in the establishment of the  Anti-Evasion  Unit in the Department of Inland  Revenue,

and two experts to help in the landscaping of parks

and open spaces.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had two experts from the International

Monetary  Fund to advise on the setting up  of  the

Banking  Unit  which now comes under  the  Monetary

Authority of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had one representative from the International

Bank  for Reconstruction and Development, who  came

on a visit to Singapore at our invitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the International Labour Organisation we

have one expert to advise the Ministry of Labour on

the collection of labour statistics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had several representatives from the Asian

Development   Bank  who  came   to   Singapore   in

connection with the regional transport survey.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had two examiners from Malaysia to conduct

Part  II  of  the  Membership  of  the  Society  of

Radiography examination: two examiners  to  conduct

the  annual Health Inspectors' examination, and one

expert to advise on actuarial matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We obtained three experts from Germany to help

the  Ministry of Education in setting up a printing

school at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We obtained from the United Kingdom eight experts

as  Directors  of Studies and tutors in  connection

with vocation courses for teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had one expert from Israel for the Primary

Production  Department  in  connection   with   the

development of hydroponics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among local consultants, we engaged a firm to

advise  on the organisation and accounting practice

of the Government Printing Office which, as we have

just  now  disclosed, will operate on a  commercial

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure included contributions towards

the    experts'    salaries,   stipends,    housing

allowances,  transportation claims, hotel  charges,

and  fees  in  the  case of local consultants.  The

expenditure on each expert depended, of course,  on

the   agreement  under  which  his  services   were

obtained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked me to explain the

increased  provision of $62,400. When the provision

was  first  considered, we thought it desirable  to

have the same provision as for last year, which was

$200,000.  The  expenditure  the  year  before  was

$187,900. We, therefore, thought that $200,000  was

satisfactory.  However, subsequently the  Technical

Education Department requested an extra $62,400  to

meet  the expenses of eight German experts who will

be  in Singapore from 1971 to 1972 to assist in the

establishment   of  a  printing  school.   It   was

considered more appropriate to make this  provision

under  the  Ministry  of  Finance  instead  of  the

Technical  Education Department. This was  how  the

provision of $262,400 was arrived at.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I thank the Minister for his

kind reply, and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead is in respect of a subsidy for

building standard cargo vessels, and the amount  is

a very big one - about $6 million. Can the Minister

let me know the details of this expenditure item?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has

for  some  considerable time been able to construct

many  kinds  of  small ships -  tongkangs,  yachts,

fishing vessels, tugs, water boats, patrol vessels,

customs launches, barges, etc. It has no capability

as yet of constructing large ocean-going vessels of

the   more  sophisticated  kind.  In  view  of  the

importance   of   the  shipbuilding   industry   in

stimulating the very wide range of skills  required

in   industrial  development  and  its  effects  on

supporting    industries    producing    machinery,

equipment,  fittings and other  materials  required

for  the  ships, the Government has considered  how

best to acquire the capability of building these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



larger  vessels. The answer would appear to  be  to

start  with the construction of standard-type cargo

vessels.  Training  in  such construction  will  be

systematised  and  productivity  can   be   rapidly

increased  with the construction of each succeeding

ship  of the same kind. By this means, it is  hoped

that  after  the  first  few  ships,  the  cost  of

building  large  cargo  vessels  will  have  become

internationally competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the earlier stages, however, it will be

necessary   for  Government  to  provide  financial

assistance,  first, in training and,  secondly,  in

subsidising  the  difference between  international

costs  and  costs in Singapore arising out  of  the

initial  lower  productivity. The  Government  has,

accordingly, jointly with Jurong Shipyard (Private)

Limited,   Ishikawajima-Harima   Heavy   Industries

Limited,  and  the Development Bank  of  Singapore,

established   the  Jurong  Shipbuilders   (Private)

Limited   for  this  purpose.  The  shipyard   will

construct Freedom-type cargo vessels which are  the

standard type of vessels and are versatile in  that

they  can take both general and bulk cargo with  an

approximate deadweight of 15,000 tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial assistance which has been provided

for  training  workers  is a  subject  of  a  later

question  by  the Member for Whampoa,  and  I  will

explain it in that amendment. The subsidy financing

for  initially  lower productivity will  cover  the

first  15 Freedom-type vessels and will be  subject

to  a  limit of $14 million. For the year  1971-72,

the subsidy required and entered in the budget will

be   for   two  ships  and  will  cost  $6,030,000.

Subsequent  subsidies will fall  very  rapidly  per

ship  in accordance with the learning curve of  our

workers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, as I understand from the

Minister's  reply,  this is going  to  be  a  joint

venture with a Japanese shipyard. It seems that the

principle of a subsidy, or a lump sum grant to  any

industry, is well taken provided that the  learning

process has to be established and the technological

capability has yet to be learnt. In other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



words,  the  people are totally new to  the  entire

process. But here I gather we have a joint  project

with  well-known shipbuilders. So  I  am  wondering

about  the economics of the issue and whether  they

really deserve such a big subsidy - $14 million for

15  ships,  if I understood the Minister correctly,

which  amounts to a great deal even on a  per  ship

basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the shipyard,

of  course,  is  going to be run  by  Ishikawajima-Harima  Heavy Industries as one partner, the Jurong

Shipyard  as the second partner, and the Government

and  the Development Bank of Singapore as the third

partner  in equal shares. As far as the  I.H.I, is

concerned, there is nothing for them to  learn  and

the subsidy is not really in relation to the I.H.I.

but in relation to the training of our workers. The

training,  as I have explained, will be on  another

vote.  But in this particular case, the subsidy  is

for   the   lower   productivity   which   is   the

productivity  not  of I.H.I, workers  but  of  the

Singapore  workers  who  are  sent  to  Japan   for

training  and who, on their return, will still  not

have the same productivity as their counterparts in

Japan.  So  in order that we can sell ships  at  an

internationally competitive price,  the  difference

must be made up in some way, and this is the way in

which we are providing the difference by a subsidy.

Whether this is the best way of going about getting

the  capability is a matter of opinion. But at  the

time when we entered into this agreement, there did

not seem to be an alternative.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, can the Minister say

whether the alternative of providing a loan, albeit

on   softer   terms  than  commercial  loans,   was

considered?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> We tried to get the best terms

possible  and,  in the end, it was found  that  the

only  way in which we could do this was by  way  of

subsidy. Loan terms are also being provided for the

ships, because these ships have to be sold. And  in

most cases, purchasers pay 20 per cent down and the

rest of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



the 80 per cent would be on deferred payment terms.

Again, these deferred payment terms would be  on  a

percentage  basis which is below the normal  rates.

But  this  is  the practice in all countries  which

have shipbuilding industries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I get a very

curious feeling in my economic bones that this is a

give-away.  But without any firm facts,  I  am  not

able  to  dispute  with  the  Minister  concretely.

However,  can the Minister say what is the  selling

price per ship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The first two ships, I believe,

were  sold at US$3.2 million, which is roughly  $10

million.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I thank the Minister for his

reply  and I do not think it would be fair  for  me

not  to  withdraw  my amendment.  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2161.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead is in respect of the Labour

Research  Unit  which  I presume  is  the  N.T.U.C.

Labour  Research Unit. I just want to find out  why

there is a big increase of more than $200,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Whampoa is

quite  right that this subhead refers to the Labour

Research Unit of the N.T.U.C. In the 1970-71 fiscal

year,  the  provision  was for  $320,000,  but  the

actual  expenditure in that year came to  $464,824,

the $144,824 being savings from the previous fiscal

year.  The  provision for 1971-72 is  $553,960  and

there  is  really an increase of $89,136. The  main

reasons for the increase were the setting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



up of a Chinese Section in the Labour Research Unit

and   the  recruiting  of  six  officers  for  that

section;  the  setting up lately of the  leadership

training  courses;  and  the  purchase  of   office

equipment and training aids and so on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I am wondering whether

this  vote is meant more as a subsidy to the labour

movement, or whether it is intended to provide  the

Labour Research Unit with real research capability.

If  this  is  so, may I know from the  Minister  of

State  what are the actual attempts being  made  in

this direction?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, this is an effort by the

Government  to assist the N.T.U.C, so that  it  can

help its affiliated unions in the various fields of

industrial  relations.  In  order  that  the  trade

unions can stand up to the employers who can afford

to engage experts at the negotiating table, so also

must the unions be assisted with expert advice  and

assistance. Hence the Labour Research Unit was  set

up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> I fully applaud the idea. But

I  am just wondering whether there are attempts  to

recruit people on a permanent basis, train them  up

so  that  they  can engage full-time  on  a  career

basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Yes, that will be the objective

all the time.

and beg leave to withdraw.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2244.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister concerned enlighten me on

the  amount  estimated  for the  Economic  Research

Centre?  Can  he  also explain how the  expenditure

will be used in the Research Centre?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the sum of

for the cost of furniture or for other things?

is  to meet the local cost of the expenditure which

expenditure on foreign exchange components  is  met

by the Ford Foundation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2283.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1960 the People's

Association  has  been  actively  engaged  in   the

promotion of recreational activities for our people

and in youth and mass organisation work. It is also

responsible for the promotion of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



multi-racial    understanding   and   communication

between  the people and the Government.  We  should

give   credit   to   what   it   has   done.   But,

unfortunately, recently the senior staff in  charge

of  the People's Association have been running  the

Association in such a way that it has resulted in a

lot  of heart-burning among the other staff.  There

are  several points I wish to bring up now, because

the staff dare not speak up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it is in relation to the transfer of

staff.  I  have  been  given  to  understand   that

recently  the supervisors of community  centres  at

the  headquarters of the People's Association,  who

are  very  old  and  experienced staff,  have  been

demoted because they do not know English, and  have

been  sent  to  take  up  the  post  of  Organising

Secretaries in the various community centres. I  do

not  understand why the officers-in-charge  of  the

People's  Association  still harbour  the  colonial

thinking  that the English language is supreme.  We

know   that   these  old  staff  of  the   People's

Association have made a lot of sacrifices  for  the

Association.  Their loyal contributions  have  been

very great indeed, in spite of their deficiency  in

the  English  language.  But,  instead  of  getting

promotion  and recognition, they have been  demoted

to  the  post  of  Organising  Secretaries  in  the

various community centres. I do not object  to  the

requirements of bilingualism, but as far as I know,

the  senior  administrative staff at  the  People's

Association  are mostly monolingual. Most  of  them

know  English but not Chinese. How is it that these

people  are  not demoted? There should be  a  fixed

principle and criterion to go by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point relates to the lack of

understanding between the administrative staff  and

the    people.   The   People's   Association   has

contributed  much  to  our political  and  economic

stability.   As   we  know,   in   the   past   the

administrative  staff  in the People's  Association

went to the masses to find out the feelings of  the

people, and to come into contact with the community

leaders at grass-root



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



level.  At  present,  perhaps   because   of

reorganisation  in  the  People's  Association   or

because  they have no time, a lot of administrative

staff  do  not go down to the grass-root level,  to

the community centres, or to the constituencies  in

order  to  understand  the  actual  conditions  for

policy   administration.   For   example,   in   my

constituency,  when recommendations were  made  for

membership  of  the  Women's Sub-Committee  of  the

Management  Committee, these administrative  staff,

who enjoy working in air-conditioned rooms, did not

understand the actual problems involved and so they

rejected   the   recommendations.   Instead    they

recommended somebody else who was about three miles

away  from  my  constituency as  a  member  of  the

Women's  Section of my Management Committee.  I  do

not  understand the theory and thinking behind this

kind  of  recommendation. I think  this  is  rather

unrealistic and inapplicable to the community  work

in  the  area.  I  wonder whether  such  a  way  of

thinking  will make any contribution to  our  local

community  work.  I  am  not  blaming  anybody   in

particular  or  the authorities concerned.  What  I

want  them to do is to try to understand the  local

conditions  of each constituency before  they  make

any  decision. They should at least go and get  the

views of the M.P. concerned before they come to any

final decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is in relation to the training of

Assistant Organising Secretaries. Over the past  10

years  the People's Association has achieved a  lot

of   success.  All  this  is  attributable  to  the

contributions   from  the  staff,   including   the

Assistant  Organising Secretaries.  But  after  the

reorganisation  we  understand that  these  serving

Organising Secretaries have been forced to  go  for

further  training  in the National  Youth  Training

Institute. Some of them are already quite  old  and

they  have  been asked to participate  in  rigorous

training  in  various fields and subjects.  In  the

case   of  women  officers,  they  face  a   rather

difficult  situation. Actually  they  already  have

enough experience in organisation and they understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



the  people.  Over-enthusiasm  in  rigorous

training is unnecessary. If, in the opinion of  the

People's  Association, all  the  officers  must  be

qualified  as  well  as rugged, then  training  and

selection  should be undertaken before  recruitment

and  final  confirmation. Otherwise, if experienced

old staff who have served for ten years have to  go

for  training,  perhaps the Minister will  consider

starting  such training for all, from the  Director

himself  down to the gardener below. Then  you  can

say  it  is  equal treatment; otherwise  those  new

senior staff will just sit down and enjoy the  ease

and  peace  obtained and fought for  by  the  older

staff. Instead of thanking and promoting these  old

staff for their achievements, they are demoting and

forcing  them to go for another course of  training

for the purpose of reorganisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points that I have raised are, in my view,

worthy of consideration by the Minister, and I hope

he will give a satisfactory answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  it is not  true  to  say  that

Inspectors in the People's Association are  removed

from  their  posts  or  demoted  because  of  their

deficiency in English. In fact, as far as  I  know,

there was at least one person among those who  were

so transferred who came from an English School. The

posts of Inspectors in the People's Association are

not  in  the  promotional grade. They are  held  by

promising  Organising Secretaries on trial  with  a

view  to  assessing their suitability for promotion

to  the next higher grade of Assistant Supervisors.

The  duties of an Inspector involve the supervision

of  a  number of community centres, giving guidance

to the central staff, and representing the Director

at   Management  Committee  meetings.   The   posts

themselves  carry  no  increment  except  that  the

Inspectors are all paid each an allowance of $30  a

month  for  discharging duties  more  onerous  than

those  of  the  Organising Secretaries.  There  are

instances  where  Organising Secretaries  who  have

performed their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



duties satisfactorily in the centres have failed to

live up to expectations in their new posting in the

Inspectorate.  As  a  result, communication  breaks

down between the Association's headquarters and the

Management Committees. The transfer of the staff in

question  back  to  the  community  centre   is   a

necessary  step  in  the  reorganisation   of   the

People's Association's headquarters to ensure  that

its  administrative machinery will  not  be  bogged

down.  It  is appreciated that the staff  concerned

have  given  many  years of loyal  service  to  the

People's Association, but it is also imperative  to

make  sure that promotion is based on merit  rather

than  seniority, and that the ambition of the young

and intelligent workers is not frustrated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar may be further informed

that the persons concerned have suffered no loss in

salary  as  a result of the transfer.  A  few  have

already  been  actually  working  in  the  People's

Association's   headquarters  since   1969,   doing

clerical  work since they were found  not  suitable

for their duties in the Inspectorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the appointment of members in the Women's

Sub-Committee, the appointment of such  members  is

governed by the rules of that Sub-Committee. One of

the rules is that the persons appointed must either

live  or  work  in the constituency  in  which  the

community centre is situated. In the specific  case

mentioned  by the Member, I was given to understand

that the person recommended by him was found to  be

neither living nor working in the constituency. She

was  therefore not accepted. Subsequently a request

was  received  by the People's Association  from  a

volunteer  worker  to  serve in  the  Women's  Sub-Committee of one of our community centres.  As  she

was working in the Paya Lebar constituency, she was

therefore recommended to the Member for Paya  Lebar

for  consideration, but unfortunately she  was  not

accepted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Members need not bother about this now

because the rules of the Women's Sub-Committee have

been amended since last September to allow for more

flexibility  in the appointment of members  to  the

Committee. So long as the Member of Parliament  for

that  constituency is satisfied that the person  is

useful  for  that  particular  area,  she  will  be

appointed  to the Women's Sub-Committee  regardless

of  whether  or not she is residing or  working  in

that area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also add that not all of the staff in the

People's Association are working in air-conditioned

offices;  only one or two of the more senior  staff

have this facility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of sending the Assistant

Organisers  for  training  in  the  National  Youth

Leadership  Training Institute, I  would  say  that

this  is  the proper thing to do in order to  widen

the  scope  of  their perception so that  they  can

perform their work better in the community centres.

No  doubt  those whom we have sent are rather  old,

but  not  all  of them are old. Many  of  them  are

actually  under the age of 40 years. I  can  assure

the Member that the course in this Institute is not

so  strenuous as to break them. The purpose  is  to

see  that  they are given proper training  so  that

they  can  do their work well. There is  a  Chinese

saying  Huo tao lao hsueh tao lao, which means  "as

long  as  we live, we must take the opportunity  to

learn."  So these Assistant Organisers are sent  to

the  Institute for training. So what! Do you  think

they  cannot  stand the rigours of the training?  I

can  still remember that three years ago  I  myself

went  through certain training in the Army.  I  did

not find it too bad, although at times it was quite

strenuous.  I thought it was a very good  idea.  In

fact, I regretted that this training was instituted

at  such  a late stage. That is because there  were

not enough vacancies in the Institute. But since we

have   already  trained  almost  every   Organising

Secretary in the People's Association, we therefore

extend the training to Assistant Organisers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to supplement what I have said and to

raise a few more questions. I do not object to what

the Minister's contention is, that we must learn as

long  as we live. But we must learn what is useful.

lf  we learn something which is useless, it is  not

worth learning at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to stress is the fact that

most of the Organising Secretaries are females.  Of

course, biologically they are quite different  from

our  Minister.  If,  after they  have  given  birth

several  times,  they are made to  run  for  a  few

miles, it is very troublesome for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter I wish to raise with the Minister

is  this.  He has said that those people  who  were

demoted have not lost anything by way of salary. My

point  is, if anybody has made a mistake,  then  he

deserves  to  be demoted. But I know at  least  two

persons, and a few others who were affected but who

have  not complained to me, that although they were

appointed as Inspectors, they have been sent to the

community  centres  as Organising  Secretaries.  So

morally it is wrong to put them in cold storage  by

demoting them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I do not think the

Assistant  Organising Secretaries are sent  to  the

Institute to learn something which is not  relevant

to  their  work. The training in the  Institute  is

quite relevant to their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for sending female workers to the Institute, I

do  not  see why there should be any discrimination

as  to  the sex. I do not want to mention  anything

about the female sex, but I think they are able  to

take  the  training given to them in the Institute.

As  I have already said, the inspector grade is not

a  promotional grade, but a transitional step. They

are  put there on trial to see whether they can  be

promoted  to  the next higher grade.  If  they  are

found  not suitable, they are posted back to  their

original  grade. They cannot stay in the  posts  of

Inspectors forever, because these are not posts for

them to fill. This is just a scheme to assess their

ability and to see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



whether  they can be promoted. There is no question

of sending them to places where nobody wants to go.

The  community  centre is far  from  being  such  a

place. It is, in fact, a very lively place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like

to  ask  the  Minister if he will  exempt  the  old

female  Assistant Organising Secretaries  from  the

very difficult physical training that they have  to

undergo.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I think most of them, whether

male  of female, are sent there for training  under

the age of 40. I have no idea what sort of training

they   are   giving  to  the  Assistant  Organising

Secretaries, but I am quite sure that  it  is  such

that  almost everyone, regardless of sex, can  take

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,  the  Minister  for   Culture   has

explained just now that we must learn as long as we

live.  I  agree with him. But once you are past  30

years  of  age, particularly in the case of  women,

and  are sent to the youth training centre,  it  is

quite a different story. Women who have passed  the

age  of 30 are no longer regarded as young. Perhaps

the  word  "young" should be deleted and  the  term

"middle age training" should be substituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise for clarification

is  this.  The Minister has said a few moments  ago

that  the rules governing the Women's Sub-Committee

have  been  made flexible by amendments.  I  agree.

What  about  the Management Committee  regulations?

Are  there  any amendments to be made or have  they

already been made, so that those who are not living

or  working in the constituencies are also  allowed

to become members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, the question of whether

a woman can be considered young when she is past 30

years is arguable. I am already 40 years old and  I

do not know whether I should be considered young or

middle  aged.  I  should  say  that  most  of   our

Assistant  Organising Secretaries are not  so  old,

and,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



therefore,  they can be sent to the Youth  Training

Centre without any disqualification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rules of the Women's Sub-Committee, I

have  already  said  that they  were  amended  last

September  to suit the requirements of  the  place,

that  is to say, regardless of whether a person  is

living or working in that area, so long as she  has

the  recommendation of the Member of Parliament  in

that area, she will be appointed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Point of

clarification, Sir, I know about the amendments  to

the  rules of the Women's Sub-Committee. But I want

to find out whether there are similar amendments to

be made to the Management Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I beg the Member's pardon. We

have not found it necessary so far to do that.  But

if it is considered necessary, we will proceed. But

I  do not see why this has to be done, because if a

person is civic-minded and he wants to serve in one

of our community centres, there is no reason why he

cannot serve in the community centre nearest to his

place  of  work or residence. But if in a  specific

case   where  the  Member  of  Parliament  in  that

constituency  thinks  that  a  certain  person   is

indispensable,  whether or not  he  is  working  or

living  in  that  area, he will be  considered  and

accepted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister told us that the Inspectors  were  on

trial.  But, as far as I know, two inspectors  have

been   demoted  after  they  have  served  in  that

capacity since 1962. So the trial period cannot  be

more  than eight years. It is even more curious  to

note  that this demotion has taken place after  the

reorganisation. So you just cannot put a person  on

trial    for   eight   years   and   then,    after

reorganisation,   and  after  the  English-educated

senior staff have taken over, say that he has  been

put  on trial and it has been found that he is  not

suitable.  This is rather difficult to explain.  If

the  Minister  can clarify, I will be  prepared  to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, I have already said that

the   Inspectorate  is  not  a  grade.  It   is   a

transitional step, a place where people are put  on

trial. If they are not suitable for promotion to  a

higher grade, they either remain there or they have

to  be  sent back to their original post.  Some  of

them may have been there since 1963, but the reason

why  they were posted there and have remained there

since  then is that they have been found to be  not

suitable  for promotion. Otherwise they would  have

been promoted. They cannot be there forever because

they  have to make way for others to be sent  there

on trial.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Do you wish to withdraw your

amendment, Mr Tay?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I wish to clarify

this  point, Sir. If these people are not  suitable

for  promotion,  is it because  they  do  not  know

English  and because they do not know how to  write

their reports in English?



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I have already said that

there  is  at  least one of them who came  from  an

English  school.  The  reason  why  they  are   not

considered suitable for promotion is not that  they

cannot write or speak English, but simply that they

cannot perform their work well.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I understand the Member for Paya

Lebar wants to withdraw his amendment after this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. -



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2305.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead of expenditure relates to the

Singapore  Anti-Tuberculosis Association.  I  would

like  to  know why the provision under this subhead

has been decreased by half.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, we have allocated $80,000 for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  Anti-Tuberculosis  Association  for  the

ensuing fiscal year, although it spent only $65,000

last  year. We therefore consider that the  sum  of

$80,000 for the next financial year to be adequate.

The  standard  of medical health in  Singapore  has

improved.  We  give credit to the  Singapore  Anti-Tuberculosis Association for their work. We do  not

require a bigger sum than $80,000.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Social Affairs knew how to speak English too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have noticed earlier that there is also a

decrease   in   the   allowance  for   tuberculosis

patients. May I ask why we do not think in terms of

improving the quality of our services? For example,

we  should give more aid to each person rather than

allow   the  Finance  Ministry  to  cut  down   the

expenditure  and  keep the per  capita  expenditure

constant.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member dwelling on the

Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, this is related to S.A.T.A.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> When the Member has moved an

amendment  to  one  particular subhead,  he  should

stick to it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  know  that the Member for  Whampoa  is  a

specialist.  He  should know very clearly  that  if

there is no tuberculosis patient, there is no  need

to  allocate any money. We know that the number  of

T.B. patients is decreasing every year, and a large

sum  of money from the Ministry of Finance does not

serve  any  purpose.  This  is  quite  obvious  and

natural.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary

has entirely missed the point. All I was saying was

this.  The  number of T.B, patients has  decreased.

Why  cannot  we  think in terms  of  improving  the

quality of the services, that is, spending more  on

each  patient rather than keeping the  per  patient

expenditure constant?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  not sure what the economic  expert  is

thinking.  Is he thinking that if people  are  sick

and  we  give  them more money, they  will  recover

quicker?  A patient in S.A.T.A. receives  $30  each

month  by  way  of  assistance.  According  to  the

opinion  of  the Member for Whampoa,  this  is  not

sufficient. If he has other opinions to express  on

how to improve the condition of the patients, he is

at liberty to do so.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Social

Affairs is so arrogant, I refuse to withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, I only wish to

make  an observation on the comments by the  Member

for  Whampoa which were most unfortunate. I  wonder

if  he  will consider withdrawing the remarks which

he  made earlier in this House when he said that he

thought  that  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Social Affairs  knew  how  to  speak

English.  I am sure that Members who have  been  in

this House for several years have no doubt about my

colleague's proficiency in the English language.  I

hope  the Member for Whampoa realises that  we  are

allowed to use four languages in this House. If  he

should  make a speech the next time, I look forward

to listening to it in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I hope I can expect some

courtesy in this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member shows discourtesy to

other Members, he will get it back.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not saying

that the attitude of the Member for Whampoa is  not

right. He thinks that everyone should talk English.

I  am not prepared to quarrel with him. Even if the

Member  speaks  in  English, I can  understand  him

quite  well. I am not really concerned  whether  he

speaks in English or in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary is

getting on to the question of languages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2312.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead is in connection with voluntary

institutions  for children. Sir, I  would  like  to

know why there is a decrease in the provision under

this subhead.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is really simple

economics! The provision -



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Objection, Sir, that is not

economics.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> The Ministry did request a

standstill  provision of $200,000 for  the  ensuing

financial  year.  Unfortunately,  the  Ministry  of

Finance made a provision of only $170,000. However,

at  the  same time, it indicated that if  the  vote

proved  insufficient  during  the  course  of   the

financial year, a virement would be considered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

sure  whether or not this is a case of passing  the

buck  again. Why cannot the Minister insist on  the

provision  which he wants? Sir,  as  far  as  I  am

concerned, this is a very serious matter. At a time

when  our economy is doing so well, surely one  can

improve the quality of our services, especially for

children. At a time when we are not only  enjoying

economic   progress  but  also,   with   increasing

urbanisation, an increase in the population growth,

there  must  be more and more children in  need  of

help.  Their  diet can certainly be  improved.  The

kind of services rendered and the care rendered for

these children can also be improved.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, we did insist on the

original provision, but if the Ministry of  Finance

said that that was the amount that they could give,

there was nothing else that I could do. However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



they  did  indicate  that  should  there  be

insufficient funds, we could ask for more.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, as a matter of principle

we  can point out that we are spending millions  of

dollars on economic development. We have just voted

$6  million as a subsidy to a shipbuilding firm; we

have  built  the  Jurong  Bird  Park  costing  $4.5

million, and its admission charges are so high that

the  poor  people cannot get in. I am wondering  if

socialism in Singapore is strictly for the birds!



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> It is not so, Sir. I have said

that  the $200,000 which was spent last year  would

be  enough for the financial year 1971-72.  I  have

stressed  that if there are insufficient funds,  we

will  ask for a virement. This argument can  go  on

forever, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> As long as the Minister has

indicated  that he will ask for more money,  and  I

hope  he  will  ask for more and that  it  will  be

double the amount, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2316.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my intention in moving this amendment is to

urge  the  Minister to have a permanent Grand  Prix

circuit for the republic. The Minister has answered

my  question  by  his statement in today's  Straits

Times  before I can even speak in this House.  Sir,

after  a  long wait for more than ten years,  I  am

happy to note that we are going to have a permanent

Grand Prix circuit. This, of course, will make  the

Member  for Nee Soon happy, because the  Urban  and

Rural  Services  Committee can put in  more  street

lamps, thus lighting up the place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to elaborate on

this subject further by saying where, when and  how

we are going to have this Grand Prix circuit.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, a special committee,

comprising  representatives from the  Motor  Sports

Club and Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



Ministries and departments concerned, was  set

up  some  time  ago to look into the  matter.  This

committee   has   considered  various   alternative

requirements  and  sites, and a  comprehensive  and

commendable report was submitted to the Government.

The  proposal is to establish in a scenic and  good

location  away  from  residential  areas  a  multi-purpose  circuit  which can be fully  utilised.  It

will  also  serve as a social amenity  and  tourist

attraction.  The  acceptance of the recommendation,

which  must  at  this  stage be confidential,  will

depend  on  land  availability,  finance  and   the

utility  and viability of the circuit. I appreciate

very  much the concern of the Member about the lack

of a permanent Grand Prix circuit, and I would like

to  assure him that my Ministry will do all that is

possible to bring one about as soon as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, in view of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2406.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just wish to seek clarification on why

there  is  a  decrease  of $1  million  under  this

subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this provision is part of

the  total cost of a crash programme to develop the

skills required for the shipbuilding industry. Some

two years ago, the Ministry of Finance initiated  a

crash  programme to train 250 workers initially  in

Japanese shipyards.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was in addition to the programmes undertaken

by   the  Technical  Education  Department  of  the

Ministry  of Education and the provision  available

under the Public Service Commission for training of

workers  abroad.  The  total  cost  of  this  crash

programme was estimated to be in the region of  $2�

million,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



and this was to cover expenditure over a period  of

two  to  three  years. The training  programme  was

started  in 1969, and accordingly 250 workers  were

sent to Japan for training with training periods of

from  12 to 18 months. A sum of $500,000 was spent in  1969  and  $l� million in 1970.  The  training

programme  is  now  coming  to  an  end   and   the

expenditure for the current year is estimated to be

$500,000. Hence the provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to mention that with this nucleus

of  trained skilled workers in Singapore shipyards,

it  will be possible now to undertake this training

in  Singapore  with  a saving of  foreign  exchange

costs.  It  is also the intention of the Government

to  send  a  further batch of some 250  workers  to

Japan  for upgrading training in the year  1972-73.

It  is  hoped,  however,  that  the  cost  of  this

training   could   be   defrayed   from   technical

assistance from the Japanese Government as well  as

Japanese industries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, I am glad to note the

progress  of  this  particular training  scheme.  I

thank  the  Minister of State for Finance  for  his

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1305 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to speak about the corrupt practices

by  some  of the customs officials at the Woodlands

customs checkpoint. Most of the officers who  check

the  baggages  of passengers coming into  Singapore

from the Johore causeway are honest, but there  are

a few who are corrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once when I was coming from Johore Bahru, I saw

three passengers in a taxi coming from Johore Bahru

and  they had big baggages in the boot of the taxi.

They were allowed to pass through the customs check-point without their bag-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



gages  being checked. When I reached home, I  asked

one  of  the  passengers, who is a friend,  how  he

managed to pass the check-point without his baggage

being  checked. He told me that the  passengers  in

the taxi each paid a few dollars to the taxi driver

to  give to the customs officials to let them  pass

through  without their baggages being checked.  The

driver,  after receiving the money, did get through

the  customs without the baggages being checked.  I

was following this taxi, but I did not see the taxi

driver  handing the money to the customs  officials

and  the informant did not see it either. But I  am

reliably  told  that there are  signs  and  signals

between taxi drivers and the officials who man  the

customs post, and the officials are told to collect

the  money  from the drivers later on to avoid  the

risk of being caught.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Finance may ask why I did not make a report there and then. I could not do so because I did not have sufficient evidence to prove corruption or allege anything.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> You can make the report now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Only after I came home, I was told

by my friend that he paid a few dollars to the taxi

driver  in  order  to pass the customs  check-point

without his baggage being checked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Maybe the taxi driver pocketed

the money!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> It may be so, but it is also true

that there are signals between the taxi drivers and

the   customs   officials.  By   and   large,   our

administration  is  known to  the  whole  world  as

honest and incorruptible. But a few black sheep  in

the  lower ranks here and there may spoil our  good

name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to bring this incident to the notice

of  the House so that the Ministry of Finance  will

take  steps to stop corrupt practices and  keep  up

our good name.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government,  of course, is always very  jealous  of

its  good name and of the incorruptibility not only

of its top political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



leadership  but also of all  Government  civil

servants.  I  should have thought that  the  Member

should have known better, and after inquiring  from

his friend and what he saw, he should have reported

the   incident  to  the  police  or   the   Customs

Department  or  the Corrupt Practices Investigation

Bureau.  An  investigation could then be  conducted

straightaway  so  that any guilty person  could  be

appropriately    punished.   But   coming    before

Parliament to make such an allegation now makes  it

a  bit difficult for us to do anything. However, if

the  Member will even at this late stage supply  me

with  the information, I shall be pleased to  cause

an investigation to be conducted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Sir, the Customs Department has been

taking  all  possible steps to prevent  corruption.

Since last year, senior officers have been assigned

round the clock to exercise on-the-spot supervision

at  the  Woodlands customs complex. Junior  customs

staff  are required to declare the amount of  money

they  have  with them when reporting for  duty  and

when  they go off duty. Surprise checks on  customs

officers are made from time to time. This is not to

say  that corruption is rampant. In fact, there has

been  no case reported for the last 12 months.  The

last  known case was on the 28th of February, 1970,

when  a  probationary customs  officer  was  caught

accepting  a  bribe  of $20 and his  services  were

terminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, circulars were also handed to transport

operators   warning  them  not  to  bribe   customs

officers. Customs officers were also instructed  to

arrest  transport operators, drivers and attendants

who attempt to offer them illegal gratification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, close liaison is also

maintained with the C.P.I.B.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1306 -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1306 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Property Tax Division comes under the

Inland  Revenue Department. In the newly  developed

as well as old housing estates, the annual value of

properties has been increased by 100, 150 and  even

200 per cent during the last two years. Some of the

houses  are  owner-occupied and some are  let  out.

Property  tax  for  owner-occupied  houses  becomes

higher  when the annual value goes up. The Property

Tax Division gives a concession to owner occupiers,

but  there  is  no guarantee that the property  tax

will remain the same. The Property Tax Division can

withdraw this concession at any time and can charge

the  property  tax of 36 per cent on the  increased

annual value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rented houses, the landlords pass the

increases on to the tenants and the tenants suffer.

In  most cases in Sennett Estate, the rent has been

increased by 100 to 200 per cent. Can the  Property

Tax  Division  value properties at some  reasonable

figure?  It  seems  that  its  valuers  value   the

properties  at  any  rate they like.  In  the  same

estate, some houses are valued at a higher rate and

some at a lower rate. I have known instances where,

although  the properties are in the same area  with

the same floor space and the same type of building,

the values differ. The annual value of one property

is  $2,000, but about three houses away,  the  same

type  of property is valued at $6,000 or $7,000.  I

notice  that the Minister of State for  Finance  is

shaking  his head and saying that it is  not  true.

But I can produce the annual value notices to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point that I want to bring to the

notice  of  the House is that, although  a  certain

property  is  assessed at a certain  value  by  the

valuers  in  the  Property Tax Division,  the  same

property  is  valued,  for  the  purposes  of  land

acquisition, at half the rate or sometimes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



even  lower than that. It seems the Government  has

double   standards.  When  it  wants   to   acquire

property,  it  wants to pay less for  it.  When  it

wants  to  collect  property  tax,  it  values  the

property at a higher rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister of State for Finance look into

these matters?



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I have only one point

to make regarding property tax. Formerly the annual

value  of  my estate was $900. Now it has increased

to  $2,500.  How many hundred per cent increase  is

that?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindaswamy, what do you mean

when  you  say  your "estate"? Do you  mean  a  few

hundred acres?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He is another rich man!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very sorry. When I say "estate", I mean the Windsor Park Estate. The Property Tax Division has increased the valuation of the houses in that estate. I think the Minister of State wants more money and therefore the property tax is increased. I hope to get a

reasonable reply from him.:



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the general

principle of valuation is fairly simple. The annual

value of a house is the value of the rental that it

can  fetch in the open market. Of course,  in  time

the  annual  values  of  houses  go  out  of  date.

Therefore,  a  revaluation  is  done  so  that  the

property accurately reflects the rental that it can

fetch. This is the general principle. In particular

cases,  like those quoted by the Members for Potong

Pasir  and Anson, it simply means that the  rentals

that  these properties can fetch have gone up.  Let

me take the case quoted by the Member for Anson. He

says  that  the annual valuation of his  house  was

raised from $900 to $2,500. But let me also ask him

this question: If he were to let out his house now,

would he not get more than $200 a month for it?  If

the  answer is yes, the annual value of  his  house

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



have  to  be  raised  so that  it  will  accurately

reflect that rental. I do, of course, realise  that

there  has been a big increase in rentals. However,

for owner-occupiers, there is a special concession,

and  they  will not be asked to pay more than  what

they  previously  paid.  I  am  sure  this  can  be

confirmed  by  both the Member for  Anson  and  the

Member for Potong Pasir who had some experience  in

my Ministry regarding this matter. I am in sympathy

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own case, for example, the annual value of

my  house was originally only $1,320, and now it is

raised  to  $4,200.  I cannot complain  about  this

really,  because the house in which  I  am  staying

could  fetch  up  to  $600 a month  with  furniture

thrown in. But I do not pay anything more. I  still

pay  my  old  property tax because of this  special

concession.  There is, therefore, no  hardship  for

owner-occupiers. However, I was told by the  Member

for  Potong  Pasir that it would be a hardship  for

tenants because the landlords pass the property tax

element  on to them. I think the Member for  Potong

Pasir  has  forgotten the cause and effect  of  the

matter. The higher valuation is only the effect  of

the  increased rental. Even if we were not to raise

the  annual value of the property, the tenant would

still have to pay the higher rent. In fact, what we

do  is to take away from the landlords in the  form

of  property tax part of that higher rent  so  that

they  would not get the whole lot of the  increased

rental.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote an example. If a house has been

valued  at $2,000 and is let out at $500  a  month,

the  proper annual value should be $6,000.  If  the

Government  does not increase the annual  value  of

the  house, the owner will still collect the $6,000

but  he will keep the difference between $6,000 and

$2,000  to himself. Because the Government has  now

increased the annual value of the house to  $6,000,

it  is  able  to collect tax on the higher  rental.

Therefore,  there should be no hardship either  for

the  tenant or the owner-occupier. So the landlords

themselves,  who have properties to let  out,  will

get less return than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



they would otherwise, but this is property tax  and

when  landlords  let out their property,  they  are

expected to pay property tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, can the Minister of State

guarantee  that  the concession granted  to  owner-occupiers  will not be withdrawn? He has said  that

owner-occupier house-owners need not pay more  tax,

but  this  is  only just eyewash. At any  time  the

Property Tax Division can demand the full  rate  by

withdrawing the concession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State has also said that the Property Tax Division has raised the annual value of properties because the landlords have collected increased rents. But the landlord did not raise the rents of the houses in Sennett Estate, which were built in 1952, until the Property Tax Division

raised their annual value. Can the Minister tell us

whether   this  concessionary  rate   will   remain

forever?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, can you guarantee that

this concessionary rate will remain forever?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it

would  be foolhardy of me if I were to give Members

of the House that guarantee. What I can say is that

so  long  as the economy is buoyant and the  growth

rate  is  satisfactory, and there are other sources

of  raising  revenue, we shall do our best  to  see

that  owner-occupiers get this concession. I  think

it  is up to everybody in this country to work hard

to  ensure that the economic growth of our  country

is  at  a  rapid  rate so that we do  not  have  to

withdraw the concession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's second point, he says that the

rent  of the houses in Sennett Estate, which is  in

his constituency, was not raised until the Property

Tax  Division raised their annual value.  I  wonder

whether this can be true. The law, however, clearly

states   that  the  annual  value  must  accurately

reflect  the  rental of the property  that  can  be

fetched  in  the  open market. If, for  example,  a

house  could be let out at $400 a month, I  do  not

see why a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



house-owner  should let it out at  $100  unless  he

rents  it  to  his own relative or  to  some  other

dependants.  To  that extent it is  unfair  to  the

Revenue.  So  the  Government comes  in  and  says,

`Look, the market value is $400. Why do you let  it

out  at  $100?  You  must  furnish  a  satisfactory

answer.  Otherwise the annual value  of  the  house

will  go  up." I do not really see how in the  same

row  of  houses the annual value is $2,000 for  one

house and $6,000 for another, as was earlier quoted

by  the  Member. In that case I would  ask  him  to

supply   me  with  the  information  and   I   will

definitely look into the matter. Perhaps the  lower

annual value will go up by $4,000!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I will certainly supply the

information concerning the disparity in the  annual

values of the two houses to the Minister of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is not well informed about the landlord

passing  the  increase in the annual value  to  the

tenants  in Sennett Estate. I remember I  wrote  to

him  about 14 months ago on this matter.  He  might

have forgotten about it. I shall give him the facts

again.  I want an answer from him about the  double

standard of annual values set by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, land

acquisition  is not properly within  my  Ministry's

portfolio   and   I  think  it  would   be   rather

presumptuous  for  me  to say  anything.  I  would,

however, point out that annual values are put  into

a  yearly Valuation List. If a house is acquired, I

think  the  owner would be on very firm  ground  in

asking  for  compensation according to  the  annual

value as it appears in the Valuation List. That  is

all I can say.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Though I am not satisfied with

the  answer given by the Minister of State,  I  beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Head 1306 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1306 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1191.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of our citizens are not happy about

having to pay compounded fines for late renewal  of

their  Radio  and  T.V. licences. Late  payment  of

renewals  is  often due to an oversight.  Sometimes

notices  of renewal might have gone astray  in  the

post  or  might have failed to reach the licensees.

Very  few  licensees, I believe, have  deliberately

tried  to evade or to ignore payment. In any  case,

the  amount of a licence fee is not large, only $36

per  annum  and it can be recovered throughout  the

duration of the whole year. Moreover, the Radio and

TV.  Licensing Section is not understaffed. Notices

of  reminders  should be sent out to  licensees  to

remind them to pay up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, I would like to suggest

that,  in place of compounded fines, a late fee  of

$2 be charged for late payment of renewal fees. The

Property  Tax Division also charges late  fees  for

late  payments. If this proposal is accepted, there

will  be  no unpleasantness caused by bringing  the

offenders  to court and fining them simply  because

they  are  reluctant  to pay  the  compounded  fine

offered  by  the Radio and T.V. Licensing  Section.

Moreover, we do not want the public to accuse us of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



being too harsh to them just because they refuse to

pay $10 to compound the offence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the

present  system  of  renewal  of  T.V. and   Radio

licences,  a combined licence and renewal  form  is

issued  to each and every licensee one month before

the  date of expiry of his licence. This gives  the

licensee  ample  time  in  advance  to  renew   his

licence, as it can be renewed one month before  the

expiry date. Where a licensee has a good reason for

failing   to  renew  his  licence  in   time,   the

composition can be waived. The payment of a sum  of

$10  to  compound the offence of late  renewal  is,

therefore,  not  too harsh since the  licensee  has

been reminded in ample time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion by the Member that the sum of the

composition  be  reduced to $2  is,  I  am  afraid,

unacceptable  because it would lose  its  deterrent

effect. The non-receipt of a renewal form is mainly

due  to  the failure of the licensee to report  his

change  of  address  to the department.  Since  the

licence form clearly states that the licensee  must

report any change of address to the department, the

non-receipt of a renewal form by reason of a change

of address cannot be accepted as an excuse for late

renewal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1970 the total number of licences renewed was

190,788,  and  the number of cases  compounded  was

6,408, i.e., only three per cent. If 97 per cent of

the licensees could manage to renew in time, it  is

clear  that  the three per cent had only themselves

to  blame  for failure to renew in time, for  which

they  suffered  the penalty of the composition.  If

they  paid  the  composition,  they  would  not  be

brought to court. Of course, if they chose  not  to

pay, then court proceedings would follow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In view of the answer, Sir, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1306 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2063.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that the vote for Advertising

Charges  under the Property Tax Division  has  been

increased  by  $13,240 over the previous  year.  Is

this  not  because  of the tremendous  increase  of

house  property tax as mentioned by the Member  for

Potong  Pasir and the Member for Anson, and  is  it

not  also  because of the increased cost of  living

that the department has to tell the people, through

advertisements either in the newspapers or on T.V.,

that they have to pay their property tax?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry has the machinery to send out

notices  of assessment of property tax to each  and

every  house owner. Therefore, why is it  necessary

for the Ministry to spend such a large sum of money

on advertisement charges?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the provision in this

subhead  is  for the purpose of meeting expenditure

for advertising in the press and over radio and  on

T.V. in January, February, July and August of each

year   to  remind  property  owners  to  pay  their

property tax promptly. It is true that the Property

Tax  Division  sends out notices of assessment  and

that these advertisements are not really essential.

However,  it is considered desirable to have  these

reminders as an additional service to taxpayers  to

make it quite sure that they do not overlook having

to  pay  in  time  to  reduce the  number  of  late

payments, so that they need not have to pay a  late

payment fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,500 shown in the 1970-71 estimates

was  provided  to meet advertising charges  in  the

press  only. Up to July 1969 advertising over radio

and on T.V. by Government departments was free.  In

preparing  the estimates for 1970-71  the  Property

Tax  Division overlooked the fact that they had  to

make  provision  to meet advertising  charges  over

radio   and  on  T.V.,  although  such  advertising

charges  had  been in force with  effect  from  1st

August,  1969. This subhead, therefore, had  to  be

supplemented in the course



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



of the year by a virement of $13,240, making a

total of $14,740 for that year. Hence a similar

provision is made for the ensuing financial year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, can the Minister of State

inform us of the result of putting these

advertisements over radio and on television? Is it

good?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, it is satisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I am not satisfied with the

reply, and I will not withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $5,944,360 for Head 1306 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1401 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The amendment also stood in the names of Messrs. N. Govindasamy and Ng Yeow Chong)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Home Affairs is a new

Ministry. It plays quite an important role  in  the

Government. Under this amendment, I would  like  to

bring  up two questions. The first is in regard  to

the  way in which police personnel carry out  their

duties.  The  second is in regard to the  arrogance

shown  by the police telephone operators in  Police

headquarters. In the last few years our  Government

has  tried its best to promote co-operation between

the police and the people in order to eradicate the

image of the police being bullies and oppressors of

the  people.  Now  that we are an  independent  and

sovereign  republic,  the  police  should  be   the

friends  of the people, and the protector  of  life

and  property. Therefore, it follows that they must

adopt   a  proper  attitude  in  performing   their

services to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have received complaints from certain

people. Let me quote an example. There was a hawker

in my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



constituency who, because he was willing to  devote

some  of  his  time to community centre  work,  was

nominated  to  be the secretary of  the  Management

Committee  of  the community centre.  At  the  same

time,  he  was  also  a  committee  member  of  the

Citizens' Consultative Committee. Naturally he is a

law-abiding citizen. One evening about a month  ago

when  he  was  working at his stall  with  his  two

assistants, a police inspector suddenly arrived  on

the  scene saying that he wanted to arrest his  two

assistants. The hawker was very surprised and asked

him for the reason for the arrest. Unexpectedly the

police  inspector roughly said, "Do not  talk  too

much.  If  you want to find out, go to  the  police

station."  So  he  followed the  inspector  to  the

police  station  to  find out the  reason  for  the

arrest of his two assistants.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On arriving at the police station the inspector

asked some police constables to drive him away. The

hawker  was  very angry then and protested  against

this course of action. He told the inspector not to

create  unnecessary trouble. It was only then  that

the inspector realised that he was at fault himself

and  released  the hawker's two assistants  because

they  were  innocent. Mr Speaker, Sir,  from  this

incident  we can see that there is plenty  of  room

for  improvement in the way police personnel  carry

out their duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise some other points. The

police  should at all times be courteous to members

of  the public. If they are rough and discourteous,

they  will  leave  an  unfavourable  image  amongst

members of the public. In time to come a feeling of

antagonism  will be created between the police  and

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerns the way in which police

investigations    are    carried     out.     These

investigations  are not thorough.  The  police  are

often careless



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



and  sometimes arrest the wrong persons.  This  has

resulted in members of the public losing confidence

in the way police personnel carry out their duties.

I  would  urge the Minister to instruct the  police

force  to  carry out their duties properly  and  to

assist our people in solving their problems and not

to create unnecessary trouble and worries for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to reduce the incidence of crime and to preserve law and order, we must not only improve the discipline and working efficiency of the police force, but we must also seek to obtain maximum co-operation from the people. In order to do this, our police force will

have  to  show  that they are the  friends  of  the

people.  They  must  maintain a  friendly  attitude

towards the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not lack people with public spirit in our society. For example, people who serve on the management committees of community centres are often public spirited. They are willing to devote their time to community work and try their best to help solve the problems of the

people. They are willing to assume these duties for

the  benefit of the people. Therefore,  the  police

force  must  adopt a co-operative attitude  towards

the people because only in this way can they expect

to  carry out their work more efficiently. I  think

concrete steps should be taken to improve  the  co-operation  between the police and the  people.  For

example, some time ago, meetings were held  between

the  police  and the people in order to break  down

the  barrier  that existed between  them.  I  think

meetings of this kind are very useful and should be

held   regularly.   For  instance,   "Unity   Week"

organised by the police and the public will help to

consolidate  and strengthen the links  between  the

police  and the people. Through the unity  and  co-operation of the public, the police will be able to

work  better  for the welfare and  benefit  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point relates to the telephone operators

in Police headquarters. It is very difficult to put

calls  through at Police headquarters. Some Members

raised this point last year. The Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



replied that he would investigate and take steps to

improve  the situation. However, after a  lapse  of

one  year, it is still very difficult to put  calls

through  at Police headquarters. I do not know  the

reason for this. I hope the Minister will carry out

an immediate investigation into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received many complaints from people

that the telephone operators in Police headquarters

are   arrogant  and  discourteous  and  that  their

working  efficiency  is low. Sometimes  a  call  is

unanswered  for  a long time. Some members  of  the

public  are wondering if the operators are "playing

the  fool." I hope the Minister will carry  out  an

investigation  and  adopt  the  necessary  remedial

measures.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

authorities  in  South-east Asia.  Because  of  the

efficiency  and  dedication of the members  of  the

police  force,  crime in the  republic  is  not  so

rampant  as it is in some other countries. Law  and

order  is  indeed well maintained.  Therefore,  our

citizens   enjoy  living  in  peace  and  security.

However, we cannot afford to have some black  sheep

in the police force who take the law into their own

hands  and  bring  disgrace and  discredit  to  the

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very unfortunate to have to mention

that  the  Police Department has recently  received

bad  publicity with regard to some members  of  the

force  who  were involved in corruption,  abuse  of

power, such as in rape cases, stealing property  in

the   course   of  investigation,  and   committing

robbery, etc, resulting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



in  the  dismissal of some officers and members  of

the  rank  and file. It would appear that  all  the

above  incidents  occurred  so  rapidly  one  after

another.  For instance, two detectives are  alleged

to  have  removed personal articles  from  a  house

where  they were assigned to investigate a case  of

housebreaking.  A patrol crew in a  radio  car  are

alleged  to  have been found collecting money  from

lorry  operators for a favour not to book them  for

traffic  offences. As a result of this, the Corrupt

Practices  Investigation  Bureau  probed  into  the

Traffic  Branch  and some of the  police  personnel

were   transferred  out.  Again,  one  probationary

police  inspector  and  his  staff  sergeant   were

sentenced to imprisonment for raping a woman and  a

girl  under threat. A detective corporal  was  also

sentenced  to  imprisonment for committing  robbery

with his service gun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot afford to allow the acts committed

by  these black sheep to affect the discipline  and

morale  of  the police force as a whole.  Normally,

the  public  turn to the police for  protection  of

their  property and lives. But they will eventually

lose  faith and confidence if some of the  officers

in  the police force, instead of rendering valuable

assistance,  take advantage of their  authority  to

harm innocent persons, especially the females.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have a clean and efficient

police  force, these black sheep should  be  weeded

out  without any mercy and sympathy. Singapore  has

achieved  progress and prosperity through the  hard

work  of  all  strata  of  society,  including,  of

course,  members of the police force. Since  police

personnel are part and parcel of the republic, they

should work hand in hand with the people to achieve

peace and security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, notwithstanding the misdemeanours of a few officers in the force, personally I have a high regard for some of our officers and members of the rank and file for their exemplary conduct and excellent performance. They have been able to adapt themselves to the change

from the colonial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



days  to meet the demands of the society of  today.

In  order  to  maintain the high  standard  of  our

police  force,  I sincerely urge the  Minister  for

Home  Affairs  to  see  to it that  capable  police

officers,  senior as well as junior, be  given  the

opportunity to fill the existing vacancies  in  all

ranks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to support what the

Member  for  Sembawang has said  about  the  police

telephone exchange at police headquarters. Will the

Minister  also  consider improving  the  system  of

communication by installing direct telephone  lines

at  all  divisional stations? At present all  calls

made to the police must be transmitted through  the

number  72001.  I  would  also  like  to  urge  the

Minister to look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity of

asking the Minister a few questions. First,  is  he

satisfied with the general efficiency of the police

force  and,  if  not, what steps will  he  take  to

improve their efficiency?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, is the present strength of the police

force  sufficient to maintain law and order in  the

republic now and in the near future?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, what measures are being taken by the

Minister to curb the present increase in crime?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, does he deem the indulgence of some

members  of  the police force in corrupt  practices

serious  enough  to justify some reorganisation  of

the force?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, when will the salary scales and conditions

of  service  for  members of the  police  force  be

revised  on lines similar to those of the Singapore

Armed Forces so as to attract capable and young men

to join the force?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, will a school for detectives be set up in

the  Police Academy to train our detectives in  the

modern techniques of crime detection?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  two  days  ago  while  I  was  entering   the

Parliament  gate, the policeman on duty raised  his

hand  towards  me and, raising his voice  slightly,

said,  "Hey,  where are you going?"  Being  a  very

patient man and quite understanding,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



I just gave him a smile and told him that

I  am  the  Member for Bukit Ho Swee. His immediate

reaction was to stand to attention. I strongly feel

that   police  constables  require  some  kind   of

courtesy course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it courtesy to Members of

Parliament?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> It should be courtesy to

everybody in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I see.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in Singapore we tend to take for granted  the

existence  and  the functions of the police  force.

Policemen  have  been  with us  for  so  long  and,

because   they   have   discharged   their   duties

efficiently but quietly, we have tended  to  ignore

them,  following,  as  it were,  the  principle  of

letting   sleeping  dogs  lie.  In  contrast,   the

Singapore   Armed   Forces  have   been   glamorous

subjects,  much  written  up  by  journalists   and

written  about  by  parents  as  well  as  national

servicemen themselves, until the latter were warned

by the Minister of Defence that this practice was a

breach  of the Queen's Regulations. I have  nothing

against  our  Armed Forces or against  glamour  for

that  matter. I am in favour of both. But think  we

have  been hard on our police force. For five years

since we became an independent republic, the police

has  been sandwiched in the M.I.D, between Ministry

and Defence, with the result that Interior, or Home

Affairs  as  it  is  now  known  today,  has   been

relegated   to   the   background   and   virtually

forgotten.  The  police force has been  undermanned

and  underpaid; sometimes misunderstood,  at  other

times maligned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of students in an agricultural

college  in  a  neighbouring country  who,  several

years  ago,  complained in  the  press  that  their

profession,  agriculture,  which  is  the   world's

second oldest profession, was taken for granted and

forgotten.  These students pointed out  that  their

profession  was  more  respectable,  probably  more

useful in an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



economic if not in a social sense, than the world's

oldest profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is time that our police force got

the  attention and appreciation which is their due.

The resurrection of the Ministry of Home Affairs is

a step in the right direction. The appointment of a

committee  of inquiry into the terms and conditions

of  service of the police force is another step  in

the   right   direction.  The  reduction   of   the

allocation  in respect of this Ministry  is  not  a

step  in  the  right direction. In  recent  months,

although  the police force has achieved  a  certain

measure of notoriety as expounded by the Member for

Mountbatten,  it has, nevertheless, achieved  other

notable successes in crime detection and it  is  to

be    congratulated.   Perhaps    this    increased

productivity  on  the  part  of  the  force  is  an

additional reason for an overdue salary revision. I

feel  safe  and secure in Singapore and  I  believe

that  most of us do as well. The crooks should not.

This safety and security cannot always be found  in

many  cities  of  the world. I hope  that  we  will

always  feel safe and secure in Singapore.  But  we

must  recognise that we will have to pay  for  this

and,  therefore.  I  do  not support  the  proposed

reduction in the allocation.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, first let

me  say how much I appreciate the interest shown by

the  Members for Sembawang, Mountbatten,  Bukit  Ho

Swee  and  Ulu  Pandan in the  functioning  of  the

police  force. The police force, unlike  the  Army,

has  no other policemen to look after them: to  see

whether they do their work or not. For this reason,

I  appreciate  so much more the interest  shown  by

these Members in the functioning of the force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan has indicated quite

clearly that the police force has, as a whole, done

an  excellent  job  and  I  am  quite  prepared  to

substantiate  this in figures. How can  we  measure

the  efficient performance of the police force?  It

may  astonish Members to know that there is no such

thing  as  a crime-free society. In fact, the  only

society  which  is crime free happens  to  be  very

primitive



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



society,  and  I  do not think any Member  in  this

House wishes Singapore to move in that direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years, our crime rate has been

rather low, fluctuating around 10 crimes per  1,000

of  the  population, and it has  not  substantially

changed. Last year there were a few cases of rather

notorious crimes, like the Chartered Bank  robbery,

which happened to be the biggest in the history  of

Singapore.  But Members will note that  the  police

within a rather short time caught the criminals. In

fact, last year the number of offences per thousand

persons  in  Singapore  was  9.56.  This  shows  an

increase  of  about 0.7 per cent over the  rate  in

1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the inadequacies? The Member for

Mountbatten has quite rightly pointed out that  the

number of instances where policemen committed  rape

and  robbery  did show the police force  in  a  bad

light. However, by and large, our policemen are not

like  this. After all, there are good students  and

bad  students.  There  are good  teachers  and  bad

teachers.  There  are  good  and  bad  Members   of

Parliament.  This  is  in  the  nature  of  things.

However,  the important point is that we must  take

the  whole picture into consideration and  come  to

the proper perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the rudeness and arrogance of police

officers,  I  myself think that such  instances  do

occur,  because I have received complaints. I  have

investigated and sometimes the complaints are  true

but  sometimes  they are not.  If  they  are  true,

disciplinary measures are taken, although I  cannot

tell Members what they are. The police force is  an

interesting  force.  It  has  different  kinds   of

punishment for different kinds of offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to note that the Member for

Bukit  Ho  Swee  mentioned the  case  of  a  police

officer  in Parliament House who did not  recognise

him.  I  will  certainly take  very  stern  measures

against this police officer if the Member will just

give  me  the  specific particulars. This  is  very

important because I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



not  tolerate  any member of the police  force  not

paying  due  courtesy to Ministers, to  Members  of

Parliament   and  to  members  of   the   Citizens'

Consultative  Committees. For, as  already  pointed

out  by  the  Member for Sembawang, if  the  police

force is to function efficiently, it must have  the

support  of the community, and discourtesy  is  one

factor  which  places the force  in  a  bad  light.

Nevertheless, having said all this, it is  also  my

duty  to  explain  to  Members that  policemen  are

instructed   to  be  courteous  and  they   receive

lectures  on  this. And judging by  the  number  of

complaints that reach me, it would seem that  there

have been -occasional lapses in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards wrongful arrests. I am not quite sure

whether this sort of thing happens at all. In fact,

I presume that people are called in for questioning

and,  after that, they are asked to go home.  After

all, whether a person is wrongfully arrested or not

will finally be decided by the law courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has suggested that the

Ministry should consider having a "Police Week". In

fact, I can reveal to Members that such a week will

be  planned this year and Members of Parliament and

members  of  community centres  and  the  Citizens'

Consultative   Committees   will   be   asked    to

participate.  This, I think, is very  necessary  to

establish good relations between the police and the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of difficulties of

getting  telephone calls through to the  police,  I

have  not looked up the debates last year and I  do

not  know whether my predecessor did, in fact, make

such  a promise. But since the Member for Sembawang

has said that it was promised, I presume that it is

so.  At  the  moment,  we are  in  the  process  of

installing   a  P.A.B.X. system  which   will   be

operational some time this year. We hope that  when

this is completed, communication will improve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rudeness on the part of the telephone

operators,  here  again I  say  that  it  is  quite

possible  that such instances might have  occurred.

But, by and large, the operators are polite. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



is   quite  possible  that  there  might  be   some

linguistic  difficulties in this  connection.  When

someone speaks another language, and not too  well,

a   person  well  versed  in  the  language   might

interpret the inadequacy as rudeness. Members  must

understand that when an operator receives  a  phone

call,  he is confronted by people speaking  several

languages and often dialects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten asked me some very

specific questions. Firstly, he asked whether I  am

satisfied  with the police force. I have  indicated

earlier  that  the  level  of  our  crime  rate  is

relatively  stable  and low, and  perhaps  that  is

really the best criterion of the efficiency of  the

police force. I think some kind of comparison  will

bring  the  state  of efficiency of  the  Singapore

Police Force into proper perspective. I have stated

earlier  that our crime/population ratio  has  been

relatively   stable  over  the   last   10   years,

fluctuating  around 10 per one thousand  people.  A

comparison with Hong Kong will bring the  situation

into perspective. Hong Kong, like Singapore, is  an

immigrant  society with a similar social  structure

and crime pattern. In 1968, the last year for which

Hong Kong's figures are available, in so far as the

Ministry  is concerned, the crime/population  ratio

stood  at  10.33.  For that year,  the  figure  for

Singapore was 10. It is interesting to compare  the

position of the ratios for 10 major cities  in  the

United  States,  another nation of immigrants.  For

1969,  the  ratios  varied between  17.5  and  47.3

crimes  per  one thousand persons with Los  Angeles

topping  the list. I hope the figures will  satisfy

the Member for Mountbatten with regard to the state

of efficiency of our force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards corruption, naturally I cannot

tolerate it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up, Prof. Wong. Mr N.

Govindasamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

express  my  misgivings about the police  force,  I

want to take this opportunity to congratulate them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



on  the efficient manner in which they have tackled

major  crimes,  as the Minister has mentioned  just

now,  and in apprehending the law-breakers  in  the

republic. We can be proud of them, as the  Minister

is,   for  effectively  giving  credence   to   the

proverbial  long arm of justice and thus  deterring

more   anti-social  elements  from   indulging   in

robbery, kidnapping, raping and other reprehensible

crimes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has mentioned

the  Chartered Bank robbery case. The  recovery  of

the  money and the arrest of the criminals involved

in   this  case,  and  the  apprehension   of   the

kidnappers of a millionaire recently are  proof  of

the mettle and calibre of our police force.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the police force, as a whole, appears to

have  made  a glowing impression on the  public  as

well  as  the  Minister himself, unfortunately  the

morale among the rank and file members seems to  be

not what it should be. What I am about to refer  to

may  be  considered as a serious reflection on  the

integrity  and dedication of our police force,  but

it  is a matter of vital importance that I think it

should be aired in this House so that investigation

may be made into it and remedial measures taken  to

rectify  it.  In the course of my constituency  and

trade  union work, I have come across remarks  made

in  all seriousness, by responsible citizens to the

effect   that  even  the  mata  mata  try  to   make

themselves scarce at the scene of traffic accidents

or minor crimes. It seems that policemen also share

the  layman's  aversion to court  proceedings,  and

intensely  dislike the amount of  paper  work  they

have  to  do in connection with any traffic offence

or  minor  crime  they  may  have  witnessed.  Such

dislike  may probably be accounted for by the  fact

that  minor offences do not count much in  relation

to   the  promotional  prospects  of  the  officers

involved.  I am also told that the additional  time

involved  in making reports, and having  to  go  to

hospital in accident cases, if done outside duty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



hours,  cannot  be  taken  into  consideration   as

working  hours for the purpose either  of  overtime

pay  or  for taking time off. If this is so,  steps

must be taken to rectify this anomaly. If there  is

any  truth  in  the  remark  that  policemen  avoid

apprehending  criminals because  of  the  attendant

cross-examination  by  defence  counsel,  then  the

policeman  concerned should be  given  training  in

court  craft. The fact that junior police  officers

lack  confidence when it comes to court proceedings

implies that there is much room for improvement  in

the  training  programme devised  for  them.  Court

craft  and correct orientation to their duty should

form  a  major part of the curricula of the  Police

Academy.  I wonder if this is being done, There  is

too  much compartmentalisation of our police force.

Traffic  officers  do  not  seem  to  worry   about

anything else unless it is associated with  traffic

offences. Other officers in uniform, even those  in

patrol   cars,   pretend  not  to  notice   traffic

offences.   These  are  problems   which   can   be

eliminated  by  correct orientation of  our  police

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to refer to another matter.

Recently   traffic  compounded  fines   have   been

increased. This may give rise to a situation  where

many   traffic  offenders,  instead  of  paying   a

compounded  fine,  may think it  cheaper  to  offer

bribes  to the traffic police. In other words,  the

temptation to bribe is made greater by the increase

in  the  compounded fines. Can this be one  of  the

causes  for the recent investigation by the Corrupt

Practices  Investigation Bureau into corruption  by

our traffic police?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I have some points to make.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you give the Minister time to

reply first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for  Telok  Blangah talked about the low morale  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



police  force. It has been suggested that this  has

something  to do with their salaries and conditions

of  work. If this is true, I think the solution can

only  come  after  the Lee Soo  Ann  Committee  has

presented its report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of court attendance

of  police officers and their fear that they may be

grilled  in  the court and therefore  they  do  not

perform their duty, let me first inform the  Member

that not all police officers are required to attend

court to testify for the prosecution. They only  do

so  when  the accused person claims trial. Even  if

they  do,  it is not very often that they  have  to

undergo   severe   cross-examination   by   defence

counsel.  Generally, this happens only in cases  of

serious crimes. With the training given to them  on

court  procedures, there is no reason for  officers

or  members of the rank and file to fear  narrating

the true facts of the case as required of them when

testimony is called for. Since it is just  as  much

their  duty to testify - in court as to  attend  to

offences  committed  in their presence.  I  do  not

really  subscribe to the view that failure to  take

cognizance   of  the  crime  when  it  happens   is

attributable to their fear to testify in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also complained that officers off duty

or  officers not asked to do a particular  job,  do

not attend to offences committed in their presence.

The  Police  Force Orders require that  any  police

officer  in  such  a situation should  perform  his

duty. As I have said earlier, the police force  has

no other people to check any negligence on the part

of  its members in this matter. If anyone seriously

believes  that a police officer has  not  done  his

duty,  he  can  complain in writing to  the  Police

Commissioner   and   he  will  do   the   necessary

investigation.  However. I suspect this  is  really

not generally true.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, may I ask just one more

question?  Is  it true that if the police  officers

perform  duty  over  and beyond their  duty  hours,

these hours are not taken into consideration? As a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



result,  they tend to close an eye to minor crimes,

but  not  major ones. They are very good  in  major

crimes.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, let me put it this way.

It is quite true that police officers working extra

hours  or  beyond their duty hours do  not  receive

extra emoluments, but due recognition is given  for

doing this extra work. For police constables who go

beyond the usual tour of duties, normally they  are

compensated by a rearrangement in their  subsequent

tour  of duty. For good work done, certificates  of

commendation  of various grades are given  to  both

officers and members of the rank and file.  In  the

case of the latter, they also qualify for some form

of  monetary  reward, depending  on  the  grade  of

certificate awarded. Subsidiary awards based on the

present  system  in  regard to the  rank  and  file

members  qualify  them  for  certificates  and  the

payment  of  monetary rewards on the basis  of  the

points accumulated over a given year.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Including the rank and file

members?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> I believe this is so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, we have just heard about

the  crime  rate  given by the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng, will you give a chance to

Mr Ramaswamy to say something?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I have an amendment* to move

under subhead 1151. May I speak now because what  I

am   going  to  say  is  related  to  the   present

discussion?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment, standing in the names of Messrs. Ramaswamy and Conceicao, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1151.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I have three points to bring

to the notice of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, cases of petty theft, burglary and

extortion    in   and   around   my   constituency,

particularly in Sennett Estate. Extortion  is  also

being  carried  out in the Kolam Ayer  district.  I

have  reported  this matter to the Commissioner  of

Police   but   without  much  result.  The   Police

Department has replied to me saying that they  have

taken  action, but the cases of theft and extortion

have  not decreased in number. My constituency  may

not be like Toa Payoh, which my colleague refers to

as  the "Chicago of Singapore". The incidents in my

constituency  are  not small in  number.  Will  the

Minister for Home Affairs overhaul the police force

and  take  action on these incidents? I  have  a1so

tried  my  best and have given some  clues  to  the

Commissioner  of Police about the persons  who  are

involved in extortion in the Kolam Ayer district.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is about

corruption  in the traffic police. I am  told  that

they  do  take  bribes from lorry and  pirate  taxi

drivers who commit traffic offences. I notice  that

though some people park their cars in certain areas

which  are  not allowed for parking, they  are  not

summoned.  They commit the same offence  every  day

but  no action is taken against them. If any  other

car  is  parked at the same place, the  owner,  who

probably  does not bribe the traffic  police,  will

get a summons very quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about ambulance chasing and

the  traffic  police. Whenever there is  a  traffic

accident,  certain  legal  firms  who  normally  do

ambulance chasing are at the place of the  accident

even  before  the  relatives know about  it.  These

legal  firms  are supplied with reports  and  other

necessary news -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does this come under the Minister

for Home Affairs, Mr Ramaswamy?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Yes, Sir, the traffic police is

under the Ministry of Home Affairs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right, carry on. I am not

stopping you, Mr Ramaswamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> These legal firms are supplied

with  reports and other necessary news more quickly

than  other  firms.  I am told that  sometimes  the

reports   are   tailored  to   suit   the   lawyers

representing the complainant of the accident. These

firms bribe the traffic police personnel regularly.

I   do   know   that  the  Government  has   passed

legislation  to  plug the loopholes  in  ambulance-chasing  cases, but this has failed  to  stop  this

corrupt  practice.  I  am  glad  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for  Home  Affairs  is

himself   a  lawyer,  and  he  is  aware  of   this

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> What is the implication?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I hope the Minister will do

something to stop the practice.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would you like to listen to Mr Ng

also, Prof. Wong?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> All right, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, the Minister seems to be

satisfied  with the crime rate which he  gave  just

now, somewhere in the region of 10.2 per cent. This

rate  is comparable to that in Hong Kong. I believe

there  is  still  plenty of room  for  improvement.

Certainly we want to aim for higher performance  by

our police force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to bring out is that the

Minister  has  not answered my last question  about

the  setting up of a school for detectives  within

the  Police  Academy. I would  be  obliged  for  an

answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, point of

clarification, I have never called my  constituency

the "Chicago of Singapore". In fact, I am trying to

discourage   people   from   calling    it    that,

particularly the press.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I say

that  the state of crime in Singapore does  reflect

that our police force has shown a higher degree  of

operational  efficiency, I do  not  at  any  moment

suggest  that it is not trying to reduce the  crime

rate. I am trying to say that our crime position is

not alarming.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the school for detectives, a group

of  people are working on the reorganisation of the

Criminal  Investigation Department.  One  of  their

proposals is that we should have such a school, and

its  desirability and feasibility is at the  moment

under review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At various times Members of the House have

referred  to  cases of corruption  of  the  traffic

police. Investigation is still going on, and  I  do

not  think  it is proper for me to say anything  at

this  point  of  time. But I do want  to  take  the

opportunity  to  say that if some  members  of  the

traffic   police  are  moved  out  of  the  Traffic

Division, there should be no conclusion at all that

they  are  involved,  because  some  of  them   are

transferred out merely as a matter of routine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has raised the

question  of  victimisation  on  the  part  of  the

traffic  police. Last year alone there were 260,735

reports  of traffic offences. I should have thought

that if a policeman wants to victimise anybody,  he

would be standing there and could not be doing  his

duty  properly. But I think the traffic police  has

been  enforcing the law impartially, and  the  fact

that there are so many cases of traffic offences is

an  indication in that direction. However, this is

not to suggest that such a thing might not happen,

as  in  the  instance mentioned by the  Member  for

Potong  Pasir.  As  I  have already  said,  if  the

instance which was raised did, in fact, occur, will

he give me all the details so that an investigation

can  be  carried out? And if the Member is correct,

action will be taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of ambulance-chasing, I

believe  this is a matter that has been brought  up

many  times in Parliament. As far as we know, there

is no evidence to show that it is a serious matter,

but  if  there are any further instances I will  be

glad  to  look into it. I think I should take  this

opportunity  to  say something  very  important.  A

policeman's job is a very difficult one, allegation

of  corruption being an occupational hazard. I have

received  numerous complaints and  every  complaint

has  been  investigated. More often than  not,  the

investigation  suggests  that  the  complaints  are

founded  on  malice rather than on  fact.  And  the

surprising thing is that the police force has borne

all these complaints with fortitude. This is really

a tribute to the force itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be

accorded  the  same  privilege as  the  Member  for

Potong Pasir to speak on this?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I

would   like to commend the Minister  for  having

dealt  with all the questions that have been raised

with such courtesy and for having injected into his

answers  a  note  of sweet reasonableness.  If  his

example is followed by his officers and men in  the

police force, I am sure there will be a very,  very

great improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that, Sir, I would like to make

one or two remarks, the main burden of which refers

to  the  traffic policemen. Sir, I do not  wish  to

make matters more difficult for this unit than they

already  are,  but I feel that a few  observations

have  to  go on record. First, I do not think  that

the  establishment  of  the  Traffic  Division  has

sufficient  personnel to tackle the  enormous  task

which  it  faces. Reference has been made  in  this

House  to  the  administrative backlog  of  traffic

offences.   Happily,  new  procedures   are   being

introduced to overcome these difficulties. However,

there remains other evidence to show that the  task

of  the  traffic police has perhaps been found  too

formidable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



It  may  be pointed out, Sir, that the large amount

of  fines  collected as a result of  police  action

against traffic offenders indicates some success in

enforcement. On the other hand, the fact  that  one

can  see  drivers  getting off with  all  kinds  of

infringements  of  traffic  offences,  despite  the

large  number of bookings, testifies to the  dismal

side of the picture. Sir, I am sure all of us would

like  to  see enforcement so successfully  achieved

that traffic offences are the exception rather than

the rule. But I am afraid that this is not so, that

the   traffic   regulations  are  not   universally

applied,  not  because there is any  discrimination

but  because  there are not enough people  to  deal

with  the  situation. The person  who  succeeds  in

drawing the attention of the traffic police to  his

transgressions feels aggrieved that he has had such

bad  luck,  while others have got away.  I  do  not

think  it  is  necessary to  detail  all  sorts  of

offences that one can meet with when one drives  on

the  road.  But  what  is the  reason   for  this

syndrome?  I  think one can attribute this  to  the

poor  quality also of traffic enforcers. I wish  to

speak  carefully, Sir, because I  do not  wish  to

make  any remarks that would reflect badly  on  the

people  who  are in charge, but there  is  a  large

percentage  of  members of the traffic  police  who

seem to me not to be adequately trained. It is  not

unusual  when  passing a crossing  to  see  obvious

breaches  of the traffic regulations being  ignored

by  people, by traffic policemen on points duty.  I

have also seen several instances of a slow motorist

hugging the centre of the road or hugging the right

side  of  the  road, holding up  a  whole  line  of

traffic,  and passing by on the left is  a  traffic

policeman on a motor-bike and he does not  pay  any

attention  at  all.  He  is obviously  looking  for

something else. [Interruption] Yes, I would like to

know what!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the main cause why there is this

lawlessness  on the road in respect of breaches  of

the  traffic  regulations is that we  do  not  have

enough people, and a lot of the people whom  we  do

have  have  not been adequately trained.  I  think,

too, that it is possible for the traffic police  to

play



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



a  greater  role in educating the public  regarding

traffic  regulations. There are  many  cases  where

people somehow or other seem to have forgotten  the

rules  of  road courtesy, or they may  have  learnt

these  rules simply to pass their driving test  and

have  conveniently forgotten it afterwards.  It  is

necessary perhaps to institute some system  whereby

if  a  person  has  committed a certain  number  of

offences he has to take a test again, or some  such

rule.  Again this would mean increasing the  number

and   improving  the  quality  of  traffic   police

personnel.  [Interruption] Sir, lots of suggestions

are  coming  from  the  Backbenches!  I  shall  not

proceed  any  more, as I think that is an  adequate

indication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move out of that to another little point

not  connected  with  the traffic  police.  It  has

something to do with the Commercial Crimes  Branch.

I  wonder  if  the Minister will tell  us  to  what

extent  proper training in the detection  of  fraud

and  such like occurrences is given to, or will  be

given to, members of the Commercial Crimes Branch.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, can I just bring up one

point  so that the Minister can answer at the  same

time?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, my point concerns the

revision  of  salary scales and service  conditions

for  the  rank  and file. I believe a committee  of

inquiry  has  been set up. In fact, the  point  has

been  raised  by  me and it seems to  me  that  the

Minister has missed giving me an answer. Can I  ask

him to oblige me?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, before I answer the

Member  for Mountbatten, perhaps he could  ask  the

question again. He has asked so many questions that

I  am  not quite sure which particular question  he

wants  answered, although in respect of the  matter

of the committee of inquiry --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Revision of salaries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> He wants to know when it is

coming out, is it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> The findings.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Findings? Well, I have to

wait  until  the report is submitted before  I  can

disclose the findings. At the moment, I think it is

still  in the process of deliberation and of making

recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding traffic offences, can I say that they

are not generally regarded by members of the public

in  the  nature  of  criminal offences.  Therefore,

there  is  no  odium attached to the committing  of

traffic  offences. It is quite true  people  speed:

when I drive along a certain road on my way home, I

see everybody is speeding. Of course, ideally if we

could  post a policeman at every street  corner  we

could   catch  every  one  of  them.  But   it   is

unfortunate  that the number of policemen  one  can

have  in  the  force is determined, first,  by  the

cost, and, secondly, by the availability of men. As

I  have  stated earlier, in connection with another

question, last year alone 260,735 traffic  offences

were  committed.  This is a very high  figure.  The

best  way  to reduce the number of traffic offences

will be for the public to realise that they have  a

responsibility  and  that they  should  as  far  as

possible obey the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards commercial crimes, I believe a

somewhat  similar  question was  asked  last  year.

Since   then  arrangements  have  been   made   for

personnel  in the Commercial Crimes Branch  of  the

C.I.D. and other police officers to attend courses

conducted  by the Extramural Studies Department  of

the   University  of  Singapore  to  give  them   a

background  in  banking  and  accounting   matters.

Having regard to the fact that crime in this  field

is  liable to vary and become more sophisticated as

Singapore  becomes  more an international  business

centre, a separate bureau in the Attorney-General's

Chambers with experienced staff will be set  up  to

investigate  offences in connection  with  commerce

and industry. It can be envisaged that the officers

attached  to such a section will have the expertise

and be trained for commercial crime detection.

satisfactory  and  acceptable,  I  hope  that   the

into  practice by the police officers in  improving

the police force, and I believe that this will give

better service to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1331.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears to me that the strength of the

Guard and Escort Unit is not quite adequate to meet

the  present  demands of the business community.  I

have been told that a great number of regular users

of the services of the unit have recently had their

services  withdrawn  from them  without  sufficient

warning.   I   have  also  been  told  that   fresh

applications  for  the services of  the  Guard  and

Escort  Unit  are  no longer being  entertained.  I

would  like  to take the opportunity of asking  the

Minister  what plans he has to expand the  services

provided by this unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of our inability to provide the

services  required,  I  would  also  like  to  know

whether  the  Minister  will  allow  private  firms

providing similar services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



to  be adequately armed. I believe that the present

position  is  that  they are  not  allowed  to  arm

themselves.  So long as we allow valuable  property

to  go  unprotected, it seems to me  that  this  is

rather  a dangerous situation and we are, in  fact,

indirectly encouraging the commission of crime.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is quite

true that of late the Guard and Escort Unit has not

been  able  to  accede to a number of  requests  to

provide escort services. Let me put the position in

its proper perspective. The authorised strength  of

the  Guard and Escort Unit is 13 officers and 1,227

men.  However, its actual strength is  12  officers

and  1,034 men; that is to say, it is short of  one

officer  and  193  men. On every working  day,  the

Guard  and  Escort Unit provides  services  to  151

banks, Government departments, statutory boards and

commercial  firms, in addition to providing  guards

for  specific duties in other places.  All  efforts

are   being  made  to  accommodate  requests   from

business  houses  for  escort services.  In  recent

times the demand for the services of the Guard  and

Escort  Unit has increased largely because  of  the

increased  public  awareness of the  advantages  of

security  protection. At the  moment  the  National

Productivity Centre is being asked to make a  study

of  the  Guard and Escort Unit so as to render  its

services  more  businesslike  and  to  meet  public

demand.  It  is hoped that some time this  year  we

will  reorganise  this  unit by  recruiting  enough

personnel to provide the necessary services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards arming the private security firms, I

would  like  to  put  the position  in  its  proper

perspective.  Let  me  give the  figures  of  armed

robbery in Singapore. In 1969, there were 26  cases

of  armed robbery where firearms were used.  Last

year the number was 25. It has gone down by one. In

respect  of bank, goldsmith and pawnshop robberies,

there were 11 cases in 1969.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



and  10  cases in 1970. In view of this  situation,

the  Government sees no justification of arms being

issued to security firms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

thank the Minister for his explanation. I beg leave

to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1357.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since I have two other amendments

coming up in succession, may I be allowed to  range

over them as well?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are the subheads related?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> No. I am thinking of making use of

the opportunity to move from point to point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the Member had better

concentrate on this particular subhead 1357.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> As you please, Sir, I would just

like to have some information why there seem to  be

various  grades  of qualifications required  for  a

Force Education Officer. I would imagine that there

would  be a certain job specification for  him.  In

relation  to  that job specification,  you  seek  a

person with the required qualification. There  seem

to  be  four  different  levels  of  qualification.

Perhaps  the  Minister  can enlighten  me  on  this

point.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the primary

function  of  the  Force Education  Officer  is  to

provide  general  education  as  well  as  language

training for junior officers and constables. He  is

also  responsible for the organisation and  conduct

of  language and competitive examinations  for  the

rank  and  file. The duties of the Force  Education

Officer include, first, the organisation of general

education classes from Secondary I to Secondary  IV

level. Second, the organisation of language dialect

classes for recruits, junior officers and trainee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



inspectors. Third, the organisation and  conducting

of  examinations  in  languages  as  well  as  Non-Commission Officers qualifying courses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Force Education Officer has also

administrative  duties.  These  include   financial

administration,  payment of salaries  to  part-time

instructors,   purchase  of   education   material,

supervision  of professional part-time  instructors

and   liaison   work   with   various   educational

institutions  capable of providing these  part-time

instructors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four categories under this particular subhead

pertain to a specific grade of officer who  may  be

appointed as Force Education Officer each with  its

own  salary  scheme. Any one of  these  classes  of

officers can serve as Force Education Officer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1601.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This subhead relates to the Commandant, Vigilante

Corps.  I wonder if the Minister can enlighten  us

on  the  sort of instruction or training  given  to

members  of  the  Vigilante Corps,  vis-a-vis,  for

example,  their general behaviour at  functions  or

outside when they are in uniform. Let me talk about

their general behaviour at functions because I  had

some  experience  of this. I attended  a  Vigilante

Corps  function once and I was rather impressed  by

the  parade, especially the marching of  the  first

few columns. However, when it was all over and when

the  drinks  were served, I had to step aside  very

agilely  in order not to get trampled in  the  rush

for these refreshments. Perhaps they need a certain

amount  of training in behaviour. This may be  just

an  indication  of their behaviour.  I  think  some

advice  on  how  to behave under such circumstances

may be necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish to raise some questions relating  to

the Vigilante



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



Corps.  As  far  as we know, they  had  a  glorious

history  a  few  years ago when we were  confronted

with  the  problem of internal security.  In  fact,

many people responded to the call of the Government

by  joining  the Vigilante Corps and  played  their

part well in helping the police to preserve law and

order   and  maintain  public  security.  In   this

respect,  we must express our appreciation  to  the

volunteers  who  took part in the  Vigilante  Corps

activities. However, as far as I know,  the  number

of  volunteers has diminished greatly in  the  last

year  or  so.  At the beginning there  were  10,000

volunteers in the Vigilante Corps. In the last  few

years  the number has gone down to 2,000  or  3,000

volunteers. I would like to know the reason for the

decrease  in  the  number  of  volunteers  in   the

Vigilante  Corps. Is it because of the question  of

training,  or  because we do not give  them  enough

allowance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we know that the number of national

servicemen  serving in the Vigilante Corps  at  the

moment  exceeds  10,000.  This  is  quite  a  large

figure.   National  servicemen   serving   in   the

Vigilante  Corps have to undergo six months'  basic

training. After that, they have to undergo training

once  or  twice a week. This is quite adequate.  My

question  is  this. Have these national  servicemen

been detailed for patrol duty so far? And have they

carried out their duties in the same manner as  the

volunteers  who were sent out in the  old  days  on

patrol  and  to  assume  guard  duties  in  various

places?  If they have been sent out, what  kind  of

duties   have  they  been  performing?  Has   their

performance been satisfactory? I would like to know

whether  the  people  who  have  undergone    the

training can perform their duties well.

Vigilante  Corps training  centres  along   Dunearn

Road.  We  were  briefed on the objectives  of  the

Vigilante Corps and shown some of its activities. I

think  we  should look beyond such minor issues  as

the  table manners of the Vigilante Corps trainees.

I  do not know the reason, but it could possibly be

that they were kept from the food for too long by a

lengthy speech, thereby leading to hunger on  their

part.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us may not realise that the V.C. trainees

comprise  largely  young men  who  are  not  highly

educated  in  a formal sense, i.e.,  they  may  not

necessarily  possess Master's or Doctor's  degrees.

They are also a very large number, about 18,000  of

them. These young men are being given opportunities

to learn such useful skills as fire fighting, first

aid  and  other related subjects of civil  defence.

They are also being given opportunities, which they

might  not otherwise enjoy, to take part in a  wide

variety   of   recreational  facilities   such   as

gymnastics,   judo,  fencing  (both   Western   and

Eastern),  and cultural pursuits, like playing  the

harmonica in brass bands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Citizens' Consultative Committee members and I

were  highly  impressed  by  the  efforts  of   the

Vigilante  Corps to promote good citizenship  which

we  observed  in the two training centres  that  we

visited. The instructors and the trainees came from

all races and spoke a wide variety of languages and

dialects. But they were one in evolving a sense  of

belonging  to the Vigilante Corps and  of  national

identity.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

my Minister has asked me to reply to the queries on

this subhead as he has assigned the Vigilante Corps

to  my care. I will immediately begin by expressing

my  appreciation especially to the Member  for  Ulu

Pandan  who has, in fact, done most of  my  job  in

answering  the queries and confirming the wonderful

effort that is being carried out by the Vigilante



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



Corps.  In  view  of what the Member  has  said,  I

extend a ready welcome to all Backbenchers to visit

the  Vigilante  Corps  headquarters  so  as  to  be

apprised  of the development and the progress  that

we are making over there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may attempt to answer the queries

raised  by  the Member for Sembawang, the Vigilante

Corps initially was founded upon volunteer manpower

six years ago. In 1967, the V.C. began its role  as

an  organisation for national servicemen under  the

Vigilante Corps Ordinance. The concept of the Corps

is  the  same  today as it was at the time  of  its

inception. It is a youth training organisation.  It

takes  in our youthful citizens from various levels

of  our  society.  National  servicemen  enter  the

Vigilante  Corps  and are trained to  be  efficient

individuals,  good citizens, responsible  neighbours

and    loyal   national   servicemen.   There   are

limitations  in a national servicemen  organisation

like   the  Vigilante  Corps.  But  despite   these

limitations,  I  am able to say that  the  officer

levels, both in the non-national servicemen  level and national servicemen level,

are   doing  a  magnificent  job  in  training  our

youthful   citizens  to  become   disciplined   and

responsible members of a uniformed organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some development of late in the

Vigilante Corps. Today the Corps is being  prepared

for  a  civil defence role, which means that  there

has  been  a  reorganisation  of  the  schedule  of

service.  Where  previously  it  was  intended  for

example,  to assign members of the Vigilante  Corps

to  constituency duties at the end of  their  eighth

year  of  service in the 42-year part-time national

service,  the  schedule of  service  has  now  been

altered to provide for Vigilante Corps training  in

the  first  four years, civil defence training  for

the  second four years, after which members of  the

Corps  will be assigned to constituency  duties  in

the  last  four-year  phase, which  is  termed  the

"reserve  phase'.  To that extent,  therefore,  the

schedule of service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



in  the  Vigilante  Corps has been  changed.  Thus,

answering  the specific query raised by the  Member

for  Sembawang, Vigilante Corps members, therefore,

will  not be assigned to constituency duties  until

after  the eighth year on the present new  schedule

of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why volunteer members in the Corps are

diminishing  in number, the reason is  simply  that

the  Corps today is basically a national servicemen

organisation.  And  the  number  of  volunteers  is

diminishing in view of this fact. I can inform  the

Member  for  Sembawang  that  all  members  of  the

Vigilante   Corps  receive  reasonable   rates   of

allowance to assist them to attend parades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's query on the performance of

the Corps today, I am able to say that, considering

the  tremendous  size of the organisation  and  the

fact  that  it takes, as I have said, our  youthful

citizens  from all levels of society, the Vigilante

Corps  is indeed performing a magnificent job,  and

not  least  the  officer levels  are  performing  a

magnificent  job in training such a vast  uniformed

organisation.



Answering the Member for Katong, Sir, I agree  with

him  that there could be occasions such as the  one

he  has  described where members of the Corps  have

demonstrated their over-enthusiasm for tea. But, in

fact,  I  have  taken  note of such  incidents  and

brought them to the attention of the Commandant  of

the  Corps,  and he and his group of  officers  are

attempting  to  gear  this  uniformed  organisation

along lines of gracious living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I trust that I have answered all the queries

of Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that,

as  a result of my raising what I confess now to be

a  relatively trivial issue, a great deal of  light

has been thrown on the more fundamental aspects  of

the work of the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2176.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask what sort of courses have been

conducted for officers and what sort of courses are

anticipated which will incur expenses amounting  to

$8,400?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, the provision of $8,400

in  the 1971-72 estimates is for 100 teachers  from

the  secondary  schools who are  potential  officer

material  to  undergo  residential  basic  training

courses  at  the Police Academy. The  officers  are

provided with meals and with tea during the  course

at  a  cost of $2 per head per day. Each year there

are  two basic courses, the first during the March-April  school holidays, and the second  during  the

November-December school holidays. Each  course  is

of  six weeks' duration and caters for 50 officers.

This year the courses are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first course commences on 22nd March for 50

officers  at  $2 per day for 42 days, amounting  to

$4,200.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second course begins in November and the

amount  voted for is the same, making  a  total  of

$8,400.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his

reply and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $53,797,630 for Head 1401 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindasamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1402 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Immigration Department is another

department     which    is    always    considering

applications. Applications for visas are considered

for  a  very long time before decisions  are  made.

Many  of  our  citizens apply  to  the  Immigration

Department  to  bring  in  their  wives,  children,

friends,  etc., for a visit to Singapore.  When  an

application  is  made,  supporting  evidence   like

marriage  certificates, birth  certificates,  etc.,

are  called for. Even after the submission  of  the

required  evidence,  it  takes  the  department   a

considerable  length of time before a  decision  is

made.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enquiries about the application evoke the reply

that   it   is  under  consideration.   When   this

consideration  takes  a long time,  one  begins  to

wonder  whether  the application  is  really  under

consideration  or  whether it  is  filed  away  and

forgotten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sore point concerns citizens with wives

or  husbands born in Malaysia. In many cases  their

marriages  were  solemnised  by  the  Registrar  of

Marriages in Singapore and yet permanent entry into

Singapore  is  denied to them. In such  cases,  the

wife  or  husband stays in Singapore on a visitor's

pass. They have to go for a fortnightly renewal  of

their  visas  either at the Immigration check-point

at  Woodlands  or at South Quay. Some  people  even

take  a fortnight's leave to Johore Bahru and  come

back with a new chop. Sometimes this visitor's pass

is extended to three months. One has to pay $10 for

the  renewal  of  a three-month visitor's  pass.  I

wonder whether it is cheaper to pay $10 and  get  a

three-month   visa   or  have  it   stamped   every

fortnight.  To  all intents and purposes,  some  of

these  people  who  have their  wives  or  husbands

permanently  staying in Singapore, with  periodical

extensions of the visitor's pass, own shops or  are

otherwise  self-employed.  I  can  understand   the

difficulty of their not being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



able  to obtain Singapore citizenship, but I cannot

understand  the difficulty of their not being  able

to  obtain permanent stay here even though they are

holding permanent jobs or are self-employed and are

capable  of maintaining their families. If you  say

they  do  not  earn enough and deny them  permanent

stay,  they  will keep their wives here continually

on  a visitor's pass. I would like the Minister  to

inform  the  House  why these people,  who  to  all

intents  and purposes have been residing  here  for

years, are denied permanent stay in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  under  this subhead I would like to  ask  the

Minister one or two questions. The Member for Telok

Blangah has raised some questions, and I share  his

sympathy for the people affected. I would  like  to

ask   the   Minister   in  what  circumstances   an

application for permanent stay can be approved.  As

the  Member for Telok Blangah has pointed  out,  if

the husband is a Singapore citizen and the wife  is

from  Malaysia and there is a marriage  certificate

to  prove  their relationship, and  also  there  is

proof that their children are born in Singapore, in

such  a  case  the  Immigration  authorities  would

normally give her only three to six months stay  in

Singapore  instead of permanent residence.  I  have

received  complaints  that  last  year  they   were

granted a stay here for as long as a year, but this

year  they have reduced the one year's stay to  six

months, with a provision of renewal of their  pass.

This   causes   the  people  concerned  unnecessary

inconvenience, because the husband would definitely

have  to  shoulder  his responsibility  in  looking

after  his own family, including his wife. This  is

not  a  point which our own Government should worry

about.   The  question  of  giving  such  a  person

permanent  stay  here  is a  reasonable  matter  to

consider. I therefore ask the Minister what are the

conditions to be satisfied before an application is

approved for permanent stay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I would like to

support  the comments made by the Member for  Telok

Blangah.  I  myself have come across a very  tragic

case.  A man had worked in a British hospital  here

for  16 years and had settled down here. He married

a Singapore citizen, had two children who were born

in  Singapore, and bought a Housing and Development

Board  flat.  After his discharge from the  British

Armed Forces, he was sent back to Malaysia, and his

family  was left alone in Singapore. At the  moment

he  is  still shuttling back and forth to have  his

visitor's  pass stamped every fortnight.  I  wonder

whether  the  Minister for Home Affairs  will  give

sympathetic consideration to such cases.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that some

Members of Parliament should raise this question of

entry  of  wives and children of Singapore citizens

is  to  be expected. In fact, I believe this is  an

almost annual affair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the complaints of long delays, I have

asked  the  Controller of Immigration how  long  it

takes to process an application, and he has replied

that  it  takes  about three weeks to  process  the

application, provided all the necessary information

is  given. If it is not given, the processing takes

a longer period. This is the mechanics of things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question asked by the Member for Sembawang is

quite  a  pertinent one. This is  the  question  of

application of permanent residence. Let  me,  first

of  all, state that getting permanent residence  in

Singapore  is  neither a right nor an  entitlement.

There   are   many  considerations  involved.   The

rationale  is a very simple one. We have  only  224

square  miles.  If  more  people  become  permanent

residents  in Singapore, we might relieve temporary

hardship for a number of cases, but we are going to

compound the hardship for the next generation. This

is the general criterion. When we consider cases of

wives  and children of Singapore citizens,  we  ask

ourselves  very  basic questions. Can  the  persons

concerned support their families? If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



they can, we admit them. If they cannot, we have to

say,  "Well,  it is a very difficult case  and  we

have difficulty in approving the application."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh raised a very specific

case. I am not fully aware of all the details,  but

I  presume  the man is not a Singapore citizen.  If

that  is  the  case, the general practice  is  that

wives  and children follow the nationality of their

husbands. Therefore, he goes back to Malaysia if he

is  a Malaysian citizen. That is how things are.  I

know  he has to undergo hardship, but getting entry

into  a  country  is  a very difficult  matter,  as

anyone  who  tries  to enter another  country  from

Singapore will know.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Minister has made a

very  important point, that is, whether the husband

is able to support the wife. Sir, the wife has been

here for years on a visitor's pass, renewable every

three   or   six  months.  The  husband  has   been

supporting  her for two years, and  if  he  can  do

that, surely he can also look after her. Whether or

not  permanent entry is given to her, she is  still

in  Singapore. Renewal of a visitor's pass  is  not

too  difficult. How do such people become a  burden

to us? The husband is a Singapore citizen. His wife

is  not asking for citizenship, but just a right to

stay  with  him with official sanction, instead  of

going  every  two  weeks to Woodlands  to  get  her

visitor's pass extended.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, such people are

permitted to stay if they get the necessary  social

visit  passes. It is not necessary for them,  every

two  weeks, to go all the way to Woodlands  to  get

their  visas  stamped.  If,  in  fact,  the  person

concerned can really support his wife and children,

that  is  the reason why they are here.  Getting  a

social  visit  pass is very different from  getting

permanent  residence. He might not be able  to  get

permanent  residence,  but  he  could  still  enter

Singapore on a social visit pass. Permanent  status

leads to other questions of citizenship.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, if the wife also owns a

business here and is paying local income tax,  will

the  Minister consider that sufficient  ground  for

her to be granted permanent stay in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> I would ask the Member to let

me  have  all  the  necessary details  and  I  will

consider the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Thank you, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, on this point of

permanent  status and the visitor's  pass  for  the

wives and children of Singapore citizens, will  the

Minister consider giving passes, say, valid  for  a

year  or  two, to these people rather  than  having

them  go every two weeks and renewing their passes?

In other words, recognise that they are going to be

here in any case; save them the bus or taxi fares.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, I think the Members for

Telok  Blangah and Sembawang have raised  questions

why  sometimes the passes are for one  month's  and

sometimes  six  months' stay in Singapore.  I  will

look  into  this matter and rationalise  the  whole

position.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, will the Minister also,

at  the  same  time, look into the  possibility  of

doing  away  with  the $10 fee  for  renewal  of  a

visitor's pass every six months?



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Sir, I will consider the

matter.
