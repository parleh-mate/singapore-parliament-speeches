<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Building programme)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  how many new Housing and Development  Board

(HDB)  flats  will  be built in FY 2001/2002;  (b)  how  many

existing  HDB  contracts have been tendered but not  awarded;

and  (c)  how  many of these flats are tendered  or  will  be

tendered using Design and Build procurement method.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB plans its building programme according

to  the  demand  for new flats.  It has yet to  finalise  the

building programme for FY 2001/2002 because part of  it  will

involve  flats  to be offered under the pilot  Build-to-Order

system.   For this pilot project, the number of flats  to  be

built  will  depend on the number of flats  selected  by  the

applicants.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the status of HDB tenders, tenders for four contracts

consisting of 2,800 flats were closed in February  and  March

2001.   HDB  is evaluating the tenders and intends  to  award

them in the next few months.  Three tenders for another 1,600

flats  are currently in progress.  Of these, about 500  flats

are tendered using the Design and Build procurement method.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister

whether  HDB  will  consider building  more  flats  now  when

construction costs are at rock-bottom?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, HDB's building programme must be

based upon demand.  As the Member may know, demand was at its

peak  in  1996-1997.  The waiting list then was over 100,000.

If you compare that to today's situation, the waiting list is

slightly less than 30,000.  The demand has fallen sharply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, the building programme must

also  necessarily fall sharply.  It does not  make  sense  to

build  flats because the construction costs are low as it  is

only one of the costs involved.  There are many other holding

costs involved.  To build flats and keep them in cold storage

because  nobody  is queuing up for the flats  does  not  make

economic sense.

<div align="center"><b>CHICKEN FARMERS IN CHUA CHU KANG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Smell reduction)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development whether his Ministry has  any  plan  to

help  the chicken farmers in Chua Chu Kang to deal with smell

reduction.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, complaints from residents in Chua Chu Kang

of  smell  nuisance  from the four poultry  farms  at  Sungei

Tengah Agrotechnology Park have intensified over the last two

years.   A study commissioned by the Agri-Food and Veterinary

Authority (AVA) found that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>

major  cause  of the smell nuisance is the improper  handling

and composting of poultry waste by the farms.  The problem is

aggravated  during the times of the year when the wind  blows

from the poultry farms towards Chua Chu Kang Town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To contain the smell effectively, the farms will need to

improve  their  current  mode  of  operations  to  take  into

consideration  the impact on their surroundings.   They  will

need to put in place smell control measures.  In fact, one of

the farms has recognised this need and has started doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would like to urge the other farms to

follow  the example.  However, we recognise that not all  the

farms  may  want  to  make  further  investments  into  their

operations.   If they wish to cease operations  because  they

will   not   be   able  to  meet  the  ENV's  smell   control

requirements,  the  Government will offer them  an  ex-gratia

payment to ease their early exit.  For the farms that  choose

to  continue  operation, they will have to take  measures  to

meet the ENV's smell control requirements by April 2002,  ie,

one year from today.  AVA and ENV have assessed that this  is

a  reasonable  time-frame for the farms to put in  place  the

required smell control measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVA and ENV officers have met with the farmers to

outline to them the details of the offer of ex-gratia payment

and  explain how AVA and ENV will help them to implement  the

necessary smell control measures by April 2002 if they opt to

continue poultry farming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understandable for residents in Chua Chu Kang to

want the smell nuisance removed quickly.  However, we need to

give  the four poultry farms a reasonable period of  time  to

put in the smell control measures.  I would therefore like to

seek  the understanding and patience of the residents in Chua

Chu  Kang  Town.   AVA  and  ENV  are  confident  that,  with

understanding  and cooperation of the four farms,  the  smell

nuisance can be removed.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>

will monitor their implementation closely during this interim

period.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, I

would like to ask the Minister of State to elaborate a little

bit  more  on the smell control measures so that the  farmers

will  be able to comply with them.  I would also like to  ask

whether the measures are economically viable for the farmers.

If  not, why should there be such measures to curb the  farms

from operating?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, ENV has got standards

that would require the farms to comply with and one of  these

standards is to treat the smell.  There are many technologies

that  they  can use for waste treatment, but the concern   is

the smell that is generated from this treatment.  One method,

for  instance, is to enclose the building and scrub  the  air

that is discharged. ENV will help the farmers and explain  to

them what kind of standards ENV would require.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers will then have to assess whether the

investment  that they have to put in is viable  economically.

If  they  feel  that  it  is  not  economically  viable,  the

Government  is prepared, on a goodwill basis, to  ease  their

early  exit  by offering them an ex-gratia payment.   But  if

they  feel  that  they  can still be  competitive  with  this

investment, they are welcome to do so.  ENV and AVA can  also

help   them  to  apply  for  assistance  under  the  relevant

Government schemes, for example, the PSB schemes for SMEs, to

ease their implementation.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, if the farmers agree

to  invest  in the facilities, as stated by the  Minister  of

State,  will  the Government consider extending  their  lease

because  the current 20-year lease will expire in six  years'

time?   If  such  a  significant amount of  funds  is  to  be

invested in the anti-pollution measures, I think it  is  only

fair  for  the Government to extend the lease if they  comply

with the regulation.  Could the Minister of State respond?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, it is still too early to

say whether there will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>

other  development needs come 2007.  What we are prepared  to

say is that nearer 2007, if there is no urgent need for other

developments and if the smell nuisance is controlled, then we

can consider extending the lease on a short-term basis.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, investment in the farm

is  not a small sum of money that people talk about.  We  are

talking about $7-$10 million of investment.  If we are asking

the  farmers to invest now and yet, at the same time, we  are

not quite sure whether in six years' time their lease can  be

extended or not, I think it is very unfair for the farmers at

this  moment  of time to comply with the regulations.   Could

the Minister of State respond?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, if I were a farmer, I will

work on the basis of seven years from now.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD SHOP PREMISES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Rentals)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (1) to what extent have the rentals  of  Housing

and  Development Board (HDB) shop premises let out by  recent

tenders  gone  down as a result of decreasing demand  for  or

oversupply  of these shop premises in both existing  and  new

estates; and (2) whether HDB will consider a general downward

rental adjustment of all HDB shop premises in response to the

adverse market conditions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, rentals for HDB shops

had come down over the last five years.  The average tendered

rentals  last  year  were about 46% and 12%  lower  than  the

rentals   in   1995  for  older  estates  and   new   estates

respectively.   To help shop tenants tide over the  difficult

economic  conditions and lower their business cost,  HDB  has

given  them rental rebates since December 1997.  The  current

rebates  consist  of three categories:  (i)  across-the-board

rebate;  (ii)  a rebate to bring down the rentals  nearer  to

January 1999 market level; and (iii) a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>

rebate  arising from property tax reductions  which  is  then

passed on by HDB as the landlord.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, the rebates amount to 16% in 1998, 25%

in  1999, 23% in 2000, and between 12%-13% this year.  HDB is

currently  reviewing  the  present rental  rebates  and  will

finalise the review in about three months' time.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, in the light of the

predicament  faced  by  many of the shopkeepers  in  the  HDB

heartland, particularly because of this high rental and  poor

business due to these mega supermarkets and shopping  centres

in the HDB estates, would the Minister consider giving a once-and-for-all  cut in rentals and also adopt other pro-business

practices to ensure that business returns to these  shops  in

the HDB heartland?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there are two parts to the

Member's  question.   The first is the question  of  bringing

business  back,  and the second aspect is  lowering  business

cost.   In  so  far as the second aspect is concerned,  as  I

explained  earlier,  HDB has given back  to  the  shopkeepers

rebates  in  rentals over the last four years.   Indeed,  the

rental rebates are still in place and will be reviewed  again

in   the  next  three  months.   But  that  would  not   help

shopkeepers if the business is not there in the first  place.

This is the reason why, in the recent package of measures  to

assist  HDB  shopkeepers,  which I announced  in  Parliament,

there are elements to help the shopkeepers to bring back  the

business,   for   example,  assistance  measures,   upgrading

measures, franchise measures, measures for shopkeepers to get

together to improve and upgrade the environment, and  so  on.

I  think those measures are just as important as any measures

taken  by  HDB  to  reduce rentals.   There  are  also  other

programmes  in  place,  for example, greater  flexibility  in

subleasing the shops, greater flexibility in changing the use

of  the shops, and so on.  Last, but not least, for those who

really wish to exit the trade, there are also measures put in

place to facilitate their exit.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures taken together will, I believe, help

to  a certain extent.  But I would like to emphasise that the

shopkeepers themselves must make the effort.  They must avail

themselves of these measures.  They must make the  effort  to

get  together.  They must make the effort to approach PSB  to

upgrade  their  shops and to take advantage  of  the  various

schemes  that  are  available. Without the efforts  taken  by

them, I am afraid that just talking about a rebate and a  cut

in  rentals alone would not suffice.  I hope the Member  will

help to spread this message.

<div align="center"><b>PASIR RIS COMMUNITY CLUB</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Housing of Association of Muslim Professionals' new headquarters)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Community

Development  and Sports if he can provide an  update  on  the

latest  status  of plans for the Pasir Ris Central  Community

Club's  co-shared  facilities to  house  the  Association  of

Muslim Professionals' new headquarters and services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, the Government is providing space

for  the  Association of Muslim Professionals  (AMP)  at  the

Pasir   Ris   Central  Community  Building   to   house   its

headquarters  and  for some of its approved core  programmes.

The  premises currently occupied by AMP at Jalan Tembusu have

been earmarked for development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, the Government decided on a new

policy  on  the  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to   all

Government-assisted NGOs which provide community services  at

multi-service  centres and community  club  premises.   Under

this  policy, Government will fully fund the construction  of

the  facilities  and  then rent out space  to  NGOs  such  as

voluntary  welfare organisations and community organisations.

They in turn will be offered a 3+3 year tenancy, which can be

renewed.  They will also receive a rental subsidy and will be

subject to stipulated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>

terms and conditions governing the use of the premises.   The

premises should be used only for programmes approved  by  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, AMP was offered a Government grant of up to

$6.75  million, to cover 90% of the construction cost of  its

new premises at the Pasir Ris Central Community Building.   A

gross floor area of 3,700 square metres, comprising 6 floors,

was  envisaged for the premises.  With the change of  policy,

the Government has now reviewed the offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMP will be offered space at the Pasir Ris Central

Community Building under the terms of the new policy.  It may

use this space for approved programmes which support the core

objectives  of self-help groups.  The Government has  decided

that  these  will include students' remedial  and  enrichment

programmes,  workers' training and certain  types  of  social

services.   Approved programmes will not include AMPRO, AMP's

business  arm, and RIMA, which is AMP's subsidiary  providing

consultancy and research services.  Neither will they include

childcare centres and kindergartens which should not be  core

programmes  of  self  help groups,  as  such  facilities  are

already  readily  available, and  provided  by  other  groups

catering to Singaporeans of all races and religions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the space requirements of the supportable

programmes,  MCDS  has offered the AMP 1,470  square  metres,

comprising 2 1/2 floors of one wing of the Pasir Ris  Central

Community   Building.    Government   will   pay   the   full

construction  cost  and  will also  give  AMP  a  90%  rental

subsidy,  to pay for the 3+3 year tenancy.  AMP is  presently

considering the offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the space at Pasir Ris Central Community

Building  will  be  used for a much-needed polyclinic,  which

will be ready by the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMP currently operates a kindergarten at its Jalan

Tembusu  premises.   And  to  give  the  AMP  time  to   make

alternative arrangements for this kindergarten, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>

Land Office has agreed to allow AMP to continue to operate it

at   Jalan  Tembusu  until  the  current  batch  of  children

graduates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, there has been a

perception that the measures that are put in place now are  a

result  of  the AMP mooting the collective leadership  issue.

Could  the  Minister clarify whether there is any linkage  to

that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, I think that is a convenient

tack  to say.  But AMP and others must also realise that  the

new  policy  applies  to  all NGOs which  are  co-located  at

community buildings, and not only to AMP.

<div align="center"><b>TRIPARTITE COMMITTEE ON PORTABLE MEDICAL BENEFITS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress report)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

he will give a progress report on the Tripartite Committee on

Portable Medical Benefits.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, the

Tripartite Committee on Portable Medical Benefits has reached

a  consensus on three key principles to form the basis of the

portable  medical benefits scheme.  Firstly, the new  medical

benefits scheme should ensure continuity of medical coverage.

Employees  should  be  allowed to accumulate  unused  medical

benefits  for  future needs, for example,  when  they  change

employment  or  when  they retire.   Secondly,  the  proposed

scheme  would incorporate co-payment and deductible  elements

to  encourage individuals to take greater responsibility  for

their healthcare.  Thirdly, it should ensure affordability of

basic  healthcare for the employees.  The scheme should  also

not undermine employers' cost competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tripartite Committee is currently examining an

appropriate  framework  for  the  portable  medical  benefits

scheme.   Under this framework, the current employer-provided

inpatient

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>

medical  benefits scheme could be restructured to incorporate

new features.  Employers would make an appropriate additional

monthly  contribution to their employees' Medisave  accounts.

The amount should be adequate to meet the premium for a basic

medical insurance, for example,  MediShield Basic.  Employees

could  also  use  any  balance  of  the  additional  Medisave

contributions  to  purchase  an  enhanced  level  of  medical

coverage  according  to  their own  needs,  purchase  medical

coverage  for  their  dependants, or save  for  their  future

needs.   This is a key advantage of the proposed scheme  over

the existing system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for outpatient medical benefits, the Committee is

exploring  a scheme which is modelled on the Civil  Service's

Outpatients Scheme.  Under this scheme, employees  would  co-pay  a  small  portion of their outpatient bills.   Employers

would  set aside an annual lump sum per employee to be  drawn

down  for the employers' portion of the employees' outpatient

bill.   Any unused portion of the employers' annual lump  sum

would be credited into the employees' Medisave account.   The

advantages of the proposed outpatient medical benefits scheme

are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it encourages the responsible use of outpatient

benefits  and  allows employees to save their unused  medical

provision for future medical needs; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the cost of providing outpatient medical benefits

would be more predictable for companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee is studying the amount that employers

could  set  aside  as  the  annual  lump  sum  to  cover  the

employers'  portion  of  outpatient  expenses.   It  is  also

studying  tax measures that could be introduced to facilitate

the early adoption of the portable medical benefits scheme by

employers.   The  Committee  had  received  feedback  on  the

MediShield Scheme, particularly its co-payment and deductible

elements  and  this would be discussed by  the  Committee  in

consultation with the Ministry of Health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of converting the existing employer-provided

medical benefits

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>

scheme  to  a portable medical benefits scheme is  a  complex

one.  While there is agreement on a framework of the portable

medical  benefits  scheme, the SNEF and NTUC  representatives

have asked for more time to study the proposed scheme and how

to  introduce it to existing employees.  They need more  time

to  consult their members.  Their views and feedback would be

carefully considered by the Committee.  The Committee expects

to  complete its study and submit its recommendations to  the

Government in a few months' time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the

Committee  be  looking  at the issue  of  older  workers  who

actually  need  this  medical payment and  do  not  have  the

resources  to accumulate for future use?  They need  it  now.

In portability, how would he intend to handle this issue?

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the Committee will

study  all  the  issues connected with the  portable  medical

benefits scheme.  In fact, one of the concerns is that  older

employees, particularly if they have to change jobs and  they

go  to  a  new  company when they have not accumulated  their

medical benefits under the current scheme, which is employer-specific, they would have problems about their medical needs,

especially  when it is the time where employees  change  jobs

more often because of the restructuring of the economy.   The

issue  of older employees and how their medical benefits  can

be  taken  care of is one of the concerns which we  are  also

tackling.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

what  is the general reaction of employers towards this  idea

of portable medical benefits scheme.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Actually, the employers

are  concerned about the cost impact of the new scheme.  That

is why we are also looking at the tax aspects.  They are also

concerned that if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>

there  are  too  many  schemes in the company,  one  for  new

employees and another for existing employees, there would  be

problems in administering them.  They are concerned  how  the

new  scheme will be implemented and therefore they need  more

time to study it.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Withdrawal of voluntary contributions by self-employed facing financial difficulties)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether he will allow those persons who are self-employed and

have  made  voluntary  contributions  to  their  own  Central

Provident Fund (CPF) accounts to withdraw that part of  their

CPF  comprising  voluntary contributions to tide  over  their

present financial difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, self-employed persons are not required to contribute to the CPF

beyond  the  Medisave  component.  Those  who  wish  to  make

additional    contributions   do   so   voluntarily.     Such

contributions are subject to prevailing CPF withdrawal rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government encourages the self-employed to

contribute to the Central Provident Fund as they also need to

save  for their old age.  Self-employed can claim tax  relief

on  these  contributions and enjoy a minimum guaranteed  tax-free return of 2.5% per annum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the difficulties faced by some self-employed persons. However, releasing the CPF savings to

meet  immediate financial needs would defeat the  purpose  of

such  savings.  We need to take a long term view.   The  most

sustainable  way for people in financial difficulties  is  to

get  a  job to support themselves and their families.   Self-employed  whose businesses or trades are not doing  well  may

want  to  consider  taking a job  for  the  time  being.   My

Ministry will help the unemployed to look for new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans suffering financial hardship, the

Ministry of Education has a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>

scheme  to  help pay the educational expenses of school-going

children  in their families. The Ministry of Health  operates

the Medifund to help those who have difficulties paying their

medical  bills incurred at public hospitals.  For the  needy,

whose  savings  are running out and who lack family  support,

there  are  also community assistance programmes administered

by   the   Ministry  of  Community  Development  and  Sports,

Community  Development  Councils,  the  National  Council  of

Social  Service, self-help groups and other voluntary welfare

organisations.    These  are  part  of  the  Government   and

community   support  available  to  those  who   are   facing

difficulties.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, from what the

Minister has said, there is, in fact, no advantage at all  in

putting  money  into one's CPF account.  If  a  self-employed

were  to  put  his money in a bank, in times of hardship,  he

could  go  to  the  bank and withdraw  his  money.   In  this

particular case, the person came to me and said, "I am broke.

My  wife wants to leave me.  My children want to disown  me."

He  is in a real financial hardship, because his business has

failed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Chiam, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. Is it possible for the CPF

Board to allow him to borrow from his CPF account?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I think it is wrong for Mr Chiam

to  imply  that  there is no benefit for a  self-employed  to

contribute voluntarily to his CPF account.  The advantages of

such contribution are quite obvious.  One is tax exemption on

the   CPF   contribution.   Second,  the  guaranteed  minimum

interest  the  CPF Board will pay.  So, he  cannot  say  that

there  are no advantages. There is a trade off.  You get  tax

exemption and guaranteed minimum interest.  And the trade off

is that you abide by the CPF withdrawal rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot operate a CPF system on the basis of a

savings  bank.  If a self-employed wants to save  some  money

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>

withdraw as and when he needs the money, then it is best  for

him,  with his surplus income, to put that money in a savings

bank,  whether  it  is the POSBank or some other  banks,  and

withdraw those savings when he needs them, rather than put it

in  the CPF.  The CPF is a place for long-term savings for  a

person's  old-age needs.  It is not a place for  you  to  put

money  aside for a few months and then take out as  and  when

you feel that there is a greater need for those savings.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, would the Minister consider some

exceptions in really extenuating circumstances?  For example,

some taxi drivers may not have enough savings to top up their

Medisave  accounts, and they can only renew their  vocational

taxi driver's licence if they top up their Medisave accounts.

Can  they  borrow  money from their Ordinary  accounts  on  a

temporary basis for the purpose of topping up their  Medisave

accounts to renew their taxi driver's licence?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the Member has raised a totally

different  issue, but I will try and address it, because  the

contribution  for  Medisave account by the  self-employed  is

mandatory.  It is a requirement.  They have to contribute  in

order  to renew the vocational licence, whether he is a  taxi

driver  or  a  hawker.   This is to  ensure  that  our  self-employed, particularly this group of self-employed, also  put

aside  sufficient savings to meet their old-age  requirements

for  healthcare expenses.  On top of that, if they choose  to

contribute voluntarily to the rest of the CPF accounts,  they

are  welcome to do so and they enjoy the same benefits, which

I  have outlined to Mr Chiam a moment ago.  I think we should

not  mix the two streams of savings.  We should encourage the

self-employed to continue to contribute a small  amount  from

his  trade income for his Medisave requirement.  There should

be  no  difficulty, because the contribution  is  actually  a

percentage  of  his  trade income.  It is  not  an  arbitrary

figure decided by the Central Provident Fund Board.  What  he

contributes,  whether it is 6%, 7% or 8%,  is  based  on  his

trade  income.  If his trade income is low, his  contribution

rate will be equally low.  It is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>

proportional.  So it is not an unreasonable request  on  him.

It  is a request which I think every self-employed should  be

able to comply.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry intends

factories.    This   will  be  done  progressively.    Hence,

workplaces with more safety and health risks such  as  health

care  and  catering  establishments would be  covered  first.

Office  premises would be included in the later phase as  the

work   activities  carried  out  in  offices  are  much  less

hazardous compared to these workplaces.

Speaker, Sir, the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) affects cloven-hoofed animals, such as cattle, pigs and sheep.  It does  not

affect  human  beings and is therefore not  a  public  health

risk.   It is also unrelated to Hand, Foot and Mouth  Disease

(HFMD) that affects humans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a FMD-free country. To maintain our FMD-free status, the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)

does  not  allow cloven-hoofed animals and their meat  to  be

imported from FMD-affected places.  Following the outbreak of

FMD  in  some  European countries, AVA has suspended  imports

from  these countries.  Similar restriction was also  imposed

on  milk  and  milk  products from affected countries.  These

measures are in line with international practices.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC SITUATION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Assessment)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

(1) what is his assessment of the economic situation in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  having regard to the current US economic  slowdown

and  regional  uncertainty; and (2) what measures  are  being

planned  or  taken  by  the  Government  to  save  our  local

businesses and jobs in anticipation of the worsening economic

situation.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, US economic growth

has slowed rapidly from 5.6% in the second quarter of 2000 to

1.0%  in the fourth quarter of 2000.  US growth in the  first

quarter this year has also been marginal.  The consensus view

is  that  the US economy will grow by about 1.9%  this  year,

down  from 5.0% last year.  More pertinently for us,  the  US

economic slowdown is driven by a major correction in the high-tech  sector  of the economy.  This has affected  the  global

electronics industry and caused a sharp worldwide decline  in

electronics production.  These factors have dampened  exports

and  growth  of  the  regional  economies  which  are  highly

dependent on electronics exports and the US market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weaker external environment has caused Singapore's

economy  to slow rapidly.  In the first quarter, our  economy

is estimated to have grown by 4.6%, down sharply from the 11%

in  the  fourth  quarter of last year.  On a  3-month  moving

average basis, manufacturing output growth eased from 19%  in

December last year to 7.3% in February.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the less favourable economic conditions, MTI

has  revised  down the 2001 growth forecast for Singapore  to

3.5-5.5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, in response to the Asian crisis, we

introduced  major  cost-cutting measures.  Several  of  these

measures  have not been fully lifted, as we had expected  the

economy  to  take some time to recover fully.  These  include

(a)  restoration  of  the remaining 4  percentage  points  of

employer's  CPF  contributions;  (b)  the  25%  property  tax

rebate; (c) lower foreign worker levies; and (d) the 13%  JTC

and  HDB  rental  rebates.   In addition,  SMEs  continue  to

benefit  from  easier financing through  the  Enhanced  Local

Enterprise Financing Scheme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FY 2001 Budget contains several new measures. These

include  lower corporate tax rates, especially for the  small

and  medium  enterprises, a property tax cut of 2  percentage

points, and measures to help HDB retailers.  The property tax

rebate  expires  in June this year.  However,  this  will  be

offset by the reduction of the property tax rate, from 12% to

10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and HDB will take the prevailing economic outlook

into  consideration  when they review the  industrial  rental

rebates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CPF, it is premature to commit to the next steps of

restoration now. The Government will decide later in the year

whether to restore further part of the remaining 4 percentage

points  of employer's contributions in January 2002, and,  if

so, by how much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, I urge companies and unions to speed up the

implementation  of  the monthly variable component  in  their

wage  structure.  This will promote greater wage flexibility,

and  help  companies to manage costs and save jobs  during  a

downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the outlook has turned less positive, all is

not  gloom  and doom.  The Euroland economy is still  growing

steadily;  likewise, China and India.  Our  companies  should

take  advantage of these pockets of growth, while they  await

the  broader recovery associated with a turnaround in the  US

economy.   Despite the slowdown, we still expect  to  achieve

positive growth this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible for the Government to fine-tune its

economic policy to even out every dip in the business  cycle,

and keep the economy growing at a constant rate regardless of

external  conditions.   Our economy  is  too  open,  economic

prospects are too uncertain, and Government pump priming  and

cost cutting cannot completely make up for a loss of external

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>

demand and a slowdown in the developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present situation is unlike that we faced during the

Asian  crisis.  The problem this time is a cyclical  downturn

in  the US, not a systemic crisis in Asia.  If the US economy

recovers  by  the  end of this year, as most experts  expect,

Singapore should recover with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this cyclical slowdown is superimposed on the

continuing  restructuring  of the  Singapore  economy.   Some

workers  are  being  retrenched in the manufacturing  sector,

even  as  new  jobs are being created.  The SMEs,  especially

retailers, are also having a difficult time.  We need to help

companies  and workers to cope with this restructuring.   The

right  way  to do it is by upgrading industries and  training

and  retraining  workers.  For the  retail  sector,  we  need

schemes  to  raise the standard of retailers, through  better

management  and  customer service, as well as  incentives  to

encourage  marginal  retailers  to  exit  the  business.  The

Government  is  already doing this.  These  focused  measures

will  be  more effective and appropriate than an  across-the-board  package  of  cost  reductions and  rebates,  like  the

November 1998 package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore be measured in our response, and

ride the present slowdown until it passes.  The Government is

keeping  a  close watch over the economy.  If  the  situation

deteriorates  (I  say "if" the situation  deteriorates),  and

further  measures  to  help  businesses  and  workers  become

necessary, we have the means and the will to implement them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Two supplementary questions, Sir. There

is  some  concern among analysts as to the rapid depreciation

of  the  Singapore  dollar  vis-a-vis  the  US  dollar.   The

question that I would like to ask the DPM is whether  we  are

using  the  currency as a means to get out  of  this  slowing

economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this. In the light of the bad

economic situation in the USA, the Federal Reserve last night

reduced the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>

interest  rate by half a point to ensure that the US  economy

can  be  on track for economic recovery.  I am just wondering

whether, on the part of the Government, we can also introduce

measures like these which can also kick-start the economy  so

that  we  are on track to achieve the original goal  of  6-7%

growth,  and  also  whether some of  the  measures  that  the

Government  introduced during the recession in  1998  can  be

relooked  at again, because some of the agencies,  like  JTC,

have  already brought up some of their rentals closer to  the

market  price.  So I am wondering whether the Government  can

look at some of these measures to be introduced not only on a

short-term basis but on a long-term basis.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Singapore

dollar-US  dollar  exchange rate, the  Government  put  up  a

monetary  policy statement update, I believe  last  week,  to

state  the position, and it was carefully phrased  there.   I

will  paraphrase  it, but the position is  exactly  what  was

stated  last  week, namely, we stated that we settled  on  an

appreciating  currency band for our policy for the  Singapore

dollar,  measured  against the trade-weighted  index  of  our

trading partners, not just the US dollar but a trade-weighted

index.   Our policy remains to maintain a gently appreciating

band.   If you look at the actual trade-weighted index  since

February when we set and announced this policy, the index has

weakened but it has remained within the band.  Our policy has

not changed, and we will review it again in the middle of the

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are not using the exchange rate as an instrument

to  depreciate the currency and maintain our competitiveness.

We  are maintaining a slightly strengthening exchange rate on

a trade-weighted basis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates

last  night,  and  the Member asked whether  we  should  also

reduce  interest rates or do something similar.  There  is  a

difference  between  our position and the American  position.

They are the locomotive.  We are being pulled

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>

along.   They  have  an  enormous  economy.   They  set   the

regulator to keep it going just right, not too fast, and  not

too slow.  And when it slows down, they adjust the regulator;

the  economy, hopefully, will respond and will speed up.  And

indeed last night, after the US Federal Reserve cut the  rate

by  50 basis points, the stock market went up.  There was  an

immediate psychological reaction.  But they are a big economy

and  there is internal feedback which determines whether they

are  going  too  fast or too slow.  For us, we  are  a  small

economy,  and it is the external environment which determines

whether  we go fast or not.  And our external environment  is

set  by the US, Europe, Japan, and to some extent also by our

region.   So we hope that the Americans recover, and we  will

go with it.  But we do not have instruments like the exchange

rate which we can adjust and, as a result of that, boost  our

businesses  in  Singapore, because so much of our  demand  is

overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as for the measures in 1998, particularly the

JTC  and HDB rentals which the Member referred to, as I  said

in my answer, we will be reviewing the rental position of JTC

and  HDB,  and we will take the environment into  account  in

deciding  this.   Once  you  have measures  to  deal  with  a

difficult economic situation, I appreciate that it  is  quite

hard  to  take away the measures, because everybody  is  very

happy when the rental comes down; and everybody is very happy

when  the  economy recovers.  But when the  moment  comes  to

remove  the  concessions, everybody says,  "I  haven't  quite

recovered  yet.   Can I have the medicine for  a  little  bit

longer?"   This year, there might even be a case, because  it

depends on how the economy develops, and we will see.  But as

I  have  explained in the main answer, what we need  in  this

situation is not what we needed in 1998, because it is not an

across-the-board  problem.  Across-the-board,  we  are  still

expecting  to  make positive growth this year.   But  certain

sectors  of  our  economy  have structural  problems,  either

because  of upgrading or because our whole economic structure

has changed.  The retailers have difficulties in HDB estates;

our market

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>

stallholders,  many  of  them, have difficulties;  our  older

workers  have difficulties.  So what we should do is to  have

targeted  measures  to  deal with these structural  problems,

rather than across-the-board stimulative measures to try  and

make up for the slower external environment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, in view of the reassessment of

the economic situation, can the DPM give an assessment of its

impact  on  the labour market, in terms of job loss  and  job

creation?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> We will have to see. The

unemployment  rate went up in 1998 during the  crisis.   Last

year,  it  had come down considerably, although not quite  to

the  pre-crisis level.  We have not got any figures this year

yet.   So  I  cannot say how much it will go up.  It  depends

partly on whether we see more retrenchments and prospects for

some  retrenchments coming, because you can see the signs  in

America.   Cisco  has  just  retrenched;  Ericsson  has  been

talking  about it.  Other electronics manufacturers are  also

significantly  affected.  It is very unlikely  that  this  is

going to pass us over and leave us untouched.  So we have  to

be psychologically prepared for that.

Trade   and   Industry  (a)  how  much  of  the  $1   billion

technopreneurship fund has been disbursed; and  (b)  how  has

the fund been affected by the current problems affecting many

technology start-ups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the US$1 billion

Technopreneurship Investment Fund (TIF) was launched in April

1999.   By  the end of last year, about 85% of the fund  have

been committed in 45 funds.  But only about 28% (S$407

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>

million) of TIF's commitments have been disbursed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TIF has not been badly affected by the global slump of

technology stocks for two reasons.  First, we have teamed  up

with  strong  VC  partners who are amongst the  best  in  the

industry.   Second, the disbursement of committed  funds  has

been gradual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of TIF is invested with established VCs.

Several  were  able  to raise more than their  targeted  fund

sizes, though some of the first time early-stage funds (which

are  meant to help develop local VC expertise) are  seeing  a

slow-down  in fund raising and deal flows.  Overall,  the  VC

funds  in which TIF has invested have raised US$11.7  billion

out of the US$12.1 billion targeted fund size.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These VC funds will continue to invest in promising

companies  here and abroad.  They made more than S$1  billion

of capital injection into 194 companies worldwide in the last

quarter of 2000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> In view of the many problems

facing  technology  start-ups, I would like  to  ask  if  the

nurturing  entrepreneurship or technopreneurship for  such  a

programme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, developing the VC

industry is a long-term commitment.  The current downturn  of

the technology stocks is in fact an opportunity for Singapore

to  take advantage of industry consolidation and forge  ahead

of  our  competitors.  Singapore's response to this  downturn

will  be  watched by the investors and VCs.  We want to  send

out  signals  that  Singapore is serious  to  develop  as  an

entrepreneurial hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a long-term undertaking. We will push on with our

efforts  to  build an enterprise eco-system,  which  includes

developing  Singapore into a major centre for the  global  VC

industry.   We  have  stimulated the  local  VC  industry  by

establishing TIF in 1999, as I have said just now.   But  the

industry is still at a fledgling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>

stage.   To  sustain this development, we may need  to  build

upon  this momentum generated by TIF1 and also signal to  the

VCs,  investors  and companies that we are  serious  players,

despite   the  current  downturn.   Hence,  we  are  actively

reviewing the need for a second tranche of TIF which is still

in discussion.

to  compel,  by legislation, all or only the more  successful

companies  to join the proposed Singapore Business Federation

(SBF),  to  the extent of hindering the membership drive  and

growth  of several hundreds of our local and foreign business

chambers and trade associations; and (2) what meaningful role

does  his  Ministry  expect  the  three  ethnic  Chambers  of

Commerce and Industry to play in the SBF bearing in mind that

the  SBF  will  be  out to compete with  them  in  membership

recruitment and service delivery.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the formation of the Singapore

Business  Federation  (SBF) as the apex business  chamber  in

Singapore  was  a proposal from the Singapore  Federation  of

Chambers  of  Commerce  and Industry (SFCCI).   SFCCI's  five

constituent  members, which include the  Chinese,  Malay  and

Indian Chambers, agreed that a strong apex organisation  like

the  SBF  would  help  co-ordinate  and  promote  Singapore's

private  sector interests both locally and abroad.  SBF  will

strengthen  representation  by our  business  sector  in  key

domestic,  bilateral  and multilateral  forums  such  as  the

National  Wages Council, ASEAN, APEC, ASEM and our  bilateral

business councils.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI supports the formation of such an SBF. It will

benefit  our  business  community.  My  Minister  has  stated

publicly   and   in  this  House  that  MTI  will   introduce

legislation to require larger

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>

companies  to  be members of the SBF.  This is  necessary  to

ensure  that the SBF garners sufficient support and  adequate

funds to carry out its objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only companies with paid-up capital of more than half a

million dollars will be required to be members of the SBF and

contribute  to  it.   The  great majority  of  our  companies

including   most  SMEs  will  be  exempted   from   the   SBF

contribution.   It is hence unlikely that the  membership  of

our   existing  local  and  foreign  chambers  and   business

associations will be threatened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, many of our chambers and business associations

serve  the  specific needs of their members.   Many  of  them

organise  trade missions to help their members  expand  their

business  overseas.  Others offer sector-specific  activities

for  their  members  to  network  and  collaborate  with  one

another.   Membership in these organisations  will  therefore

continue  to  be  strong  as long as  they  continue  to  run

programmes and provide services to benefit their members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our chambers and associations form a rich matrix of

industry  networks that will help support and strengthen  the

SBF.  To be an effective and representative apex chamber, SBF

needs  to  engage not just the individual companies but  also

the   ethnic  chambers,  other  local  business   and   trade

organisations and foreign business chambers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethnic chambers are especially important in this

matrix  as  our  local small businesses tend  to  be  aligned

according  to  the  different  ethnic  groups.   The   ethnic

chambers will fulfil a valuable and unique role in the SBF by

representing these ethnic business communities.   It  is  for

this  reason that the Chinese, Malay and Indian chambers will

have  a permanent place in the SBF Council and therefore have

an influence in the direction and activities of the SBF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately the success of the SBF depends on the support

of   the  individual  business  chambers,  associations   and

companies.  The SBF Council will be structured

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>

such  that  it includes the key stakeholders - both  business

associations  and  companies - in its decision-making.   This

will ensure that the SBF caters to the needs and reflects the

voice of the wider business community.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, there is a serious concern among the

chambers  of commerce, particularly the ethnic-based chambers

of  commerce and the business community, that once the SBF is

set  up, it will become the premier business organisation  in

Singapore   and  representing  Singapore  both  locally   and

overseas.   So  there is a serious concern  that  the  ethnic

chambers of commerce will lose their importance and many  may

even  stop joining this organisation as members and, instead,

join the SBF directly, particularly the bigger organisations.

In fact, it is these big business organisations  ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ravindran, could you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the question is whether the

Ministry,  in  moving the legislation to set  up  SBF,  would

consider making provisions whereby membership is through  the

existing chambers of commerce or other business organisations

and  whether, if such a set-up is allowed, membership fee  to

SBF  can  be  given on a discount basis, perhaps 30%  or  40%

discount,  to those who are members of the existing  chambers

of commerce.  If they want to join SBF, they will be given  a

discount  in the membership fee so that the existing chambers

of  commerce can be relevant and many will continue to remain

as members or join as members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> As I have said just now, there are

roles  to  be  played by ethnic chambers.  Each chamber  will

have  to provide services to their members.  His question  is

whether  we  would  legislate for the  members  to  join  SBF

through  the ethnic chambers.  I think this is not  necessary

because, at the moment, our thinking is that SBF will provide

general  services  to  represent Singapore  in  international

forums and also to be a partner to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>

work  out national policies on economic matters.  So it  will

provide general services to its members.  But ethnic chambers

will  play  a  slightly  different role.   For  example,  the

Chinese   Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  can  organise

missions  to various parts of China, whereas SBF may  not  be

interested  in  doing so.  So I would think that  if  various

ethnic chambers can set up their activities and improve their

services,  they  would  be able to retain  and  recruit  more

members to join them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question is whether consideration can be given

for a discount in membership fees to members who want to join

SBF  through the chambers.  We would leave it to the  various

chambers to decide how they would like to work it out because

we  would not disallow dual membership.  They can join  as  a

member of the ethnic chamber and, at the same time, join SBF.

Whether the respective ethnic chambers would like to  give  a

discount, we will leave it to them to decide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I think the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary has missed the point.  The point is that, under the

proposed legislation to be put up by the Ministry, membership

of  the SBF will become compulsory.  So companies whose paid-up  capital  is  more than $1 million do not have  a  choice.

They  must  join as a member.  Naturally, the  question  that

will  arise when these companies join as members  is  why  do

they  join  another organisation like the Chinese Chamber  of

Commerce  or  the  Malay Chamber of Commerce  or  the  Indian

Chamber  of  Commerce.  So by making it compulsory,  I  think

that  is  something which is of concern to members.  That  is

why  the  concern  in  the business  circle  is  whether  the

existing chambers of commerce can be members of SBF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is with regard to membership fees. It

is  something  that SBF, in its legislation, has  to  provide

whether  such  a discount can be given when one  joins  as  a

member  of  the  existing chambers.  If  the  matter  is  not

resolved at the outset, it would be very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>

difficult  for these matters to be decided subsequently  when

SBF is set up with full legislation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> I would like to clarify a point made

by  the  Member.   Our thinking is to require companies  with

paid-up  capital of more than half a million dollars,  not  a

million  dollars,  to join as members  of  SBF.   For  ethnic

chambers,  their catchment is quite big.  Under the  proposed

legislation,   we   do  not  require  sole   proprietary   or

partnership companies to join as members of SBF.  So they are

not  affected.  They can still continue to be members of  the

ethnic  chambers.  For companies with over and above  half  a

million  dollars  paid-up capital, they can decide  on  their

own.  They can still remain as members of the ethnic chambers

and,  at  the same time, become members of SBF under the  new

arrangement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our thinking is that, as I have said just now, if the

chambers  of commerce can provide relevant services to  their

members,  they  would  like  to continue  because  they  have

different needs.  I hope that arrangements can be worked  out

so  that the various ethnic chambers can deal with this  dual

membership  problem, whether by giving discounts  or  through

some  other  measures.   As  I have  said  just  now,  ethnic

chambers can play a very important role and they provide  the

matrix of the apex organisation, which is SBF.

<div align="center"><b>FATAL ACCIDENTS INVOLVING MOTORISTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Preventive measures)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs, in view of the increase in the number of fatal

accidents  involving motorcyclists, whether the Ministry  has

taken any measures to prevent this unnecessary loss of lives,

especially as most of the victims killed are below the age of

30.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Sir, Traffic

Police   is   concerned  that  traffic  accidents   involving

motorcyclists have increased

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>

over  the  past  two years.   The number of  fatal  accidents

involving motorcyclists increased 15% from 93 in 1999 to  108

in  the  year  2000.   Last year, about 46%  of  road  deaths

comprised motorcyclists and pillion riders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics also confirm that younger riders are more

accident-prone.  For the past two years,  about  57%  of  the

motorcyclists  and pillion riders who died in road  accidents

were below 30 years old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Traffic Police has adopted a 3-pronged approach to

reduce  the number of motorcycle accidents.  First,  rigorous

testing.   Traffic Police has a rigorous testing  system  and

maintains a high testing standard for motorcycle or  Class  2

licences.   The  testing  system is  a  graduated  one  where

motorcyclists  cannot  apply for  a  bigger  engine  capacity

motorcycle licence, without having first obtained  a  smaller

engine   capacity  motorcycle  licence.    For   example,   a

motorcyclist cannot apply for a Class 2 (which is  above  400

cc)  motorcycle  licence unless he already  has  a  Class  2A

(which is from 201 cc to 400 cc) and Class 2B (which is up to

200   cc)  licences.   Testing  standards  are  also  closely

monitored and regularly reviewed to ensure that motorcyclists

acquire  a high standard of skills and good habits in  riding

motorcycles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, public education. Traffic Police regularly

conducts  public education programmes to educate road  users,

including  motorcyclists on road safety.  Last year,  Traffic

Police conducted a total of 21 road safety talks and 70  road

safety  exhibitions specifically for motorcyclists.   Traffic

Police   also   organises  other  initiatives   targeted   at

motorcyclists,  such as the Road Safety  Month,  Safe  Riding

Rally and the Road Safety Seminar cum Workshop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, strict enforcement. Sir, in addition to rigorous

testing  and  public  education, Traffic  Police  also  takes

strict     enforcement    action    against     irresponsible

motorcyclists.  In particular, Traffic Police takes  a  tough

stance   against  motorcyclists  for  inconsiderate  driving,

dangerous driving and speeding, which are the primary  causes

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>

motorcycle  accidents  where motorcyclists  have  been  found

negligent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Traffic Police conducted many operations

against  errant  motorcyclists.  Traffic Police  also  issued

more  than  51,000  summonses to  motorcyclists  for  traffic

violations, an increase of 16% over the previous year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, Traffic Police will continue to work

hard  to  improve road safety for all.  But, ultimately,  all

road  users  must  understand that they are  responsible  for

their  own  safety.  Hence, all road users should take  extra

care  on  the  roads,  ride or drive safely  and  follow  the

traffic  rules,  which  are designed for  their  safety.   By

practising  safe driving or riding habits at all times,  they

not only enhance their personal road safety but also make our

roads safer for all other users.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister  of  State  what is the percentage  of  foreign

motorcyclists involved in these accidents because if  foreign

motorcyclists form a high percentage, then perhaps the public

education  programme  would not have reached  such  cyclists?

What would you do about them?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, a sizeable of them are

foreigners,  in  particular, Malaysians.  For  example,  last

year, of the fatalities, 77% were Singaporeans and about  23%

were  Malaysians.  In fact, Traffic Police is also  aware  of

that.   Therefore,  they also target Malaysian  motorcyclists

who  are  coming in.  For example, on several  occasions,  in

1995,  1996  and  1999,  they had deployed  officers  at  the

Woodlands  Immigration Checkpoint to distribute  road  safety

leaflets to these foreign motorists who were coming in.   And

indeed,  only  in  March  this year,  they  also  sought  the

assistance  of  SIR to distribute road safety  leaflets.   So

there  is  an  attempt to reach out to these foreign  riders.

And in particular, the GPC Chairman may recall that, in 1999,

we amended the laws to extend the Driver

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>

Improvement  Points System (DIPS) to include foreign  driving

licence  holders.  So in sum, Traffic Police looks at  things

comprehensively and tries to tackle it all round.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, since

speeding  is the main cause of accidents, would the  Minister

of   State  consider  lowering  the  speed  limit  for  those

motorcyclists  who  have just obtained  their  licences,  not

unlike  those heavy vehicles, ie, impose a lower speed limit,

say,  for  the  first five years after they  have  got  their

licences?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, it is one thing to

maintain  different speed limits for different categories  of

users of the road, eg, heavy lorry vehicles, cars, buses  or,

indeed,  even  for  different stretches  of  roads.   But  to

maintain  different speed limits for different categories  of

the  same  type of transportation, for example,  motorcycles,

will  make  it  very hard for Traffic Police to  monitor  and

enforce  the  rules.   But,  certainly,  in  terms  of   road

behaviour,  those who are on probation will know  that  under

DIPS, for the first year, if they accumulate 12 points, their

licence  will be suspended.  So there is, in fact, already  a

reminder  to  them all the time that in their first  year  of

riding  whilst on probation, they should ride more  carefully

because  it  is 12 points.  After that, it is 24 points  over

two  years.   So  there  is already some  differentiation  in

treatment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  ask the Minister of State what proportion of  those

fatalities involved riders who are below 20 years of age and,

if  a  substantial number of those fatalities really involved

those  who  are  below 20 years of age, whether  or  not  the

Government would consider raising the qualifying  age  for  a

motorcycle licence.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I have given in my

main  answer,  I do not have the numbers for under  20  years

but,  for  the past two years, about 57% of the motorcyclists

and  pillion riders who died in road accidents were below  30

years.  As

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>

to  the point whether we should raise the age limit, in  fact

the  age limit for motorcyclists was raised from 16 to 18  on

1st of May 1996.  It was felt that 18 is a good age, in terms

of  body size, maturity, etc, and we should keep it at  that.

In  fact,  18  is  also the age in most countries.   Sir,  we

should continue to monitor and basically target education  at

these people, which is being done, because the Traffic Police

has  targeted public education programmes in the army  camps,

for  example, when riders do National Service, or in tertiary

institutions.  So let us continue with this approach.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chong Chia (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  would like to ask the Minister of State whether it  is  an

offence  to  ride  not  in-lane, and  whether  this  in  fact

contributes to the accidents.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> First of all, there are no

designated  lanes  for motorcyclists.   It  is  certainly  an

offence  to  weave in and out.  I think that is  one  of  the

prevalent behaviours which must be discouraged, because it is

dangerous.   But  the  general rule  is  that  a  slow-moving

motorcyclist should keep to the inner lane, rather than  ride

on the outer lane.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, in view of his answer

just  now,  may  I ask the Minister of State whether  Traffic

Police  has been able to identify certain areas in Singapore,

eg,  the  BKE, where there is a special risk to motorcyclists

and  whether, in such risky areas, there should not  be  some

provision  made,  eg,  in  terms of  lanes  specifically  for

motorcyclists,  so  that  they do not  present  a  danger  to

themselves and to other users of the roads as well.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, accidents involving

motorcyclists  take place all over, not only  in  expressways

but at junctions and along small HDB roads.  So I think it is

not  wise  to  designate lanes, because it will affect  other

users of the road as well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

of State about the proportion

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>

of  accidents  involving motorcyclists who got their  licence

within one year.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, last year, the

percentage  was 24% which, in fact, is actually an  increase.

From  1996  to 1999, probationary motorcyclists  involved  in

fatal  accidents was about 10%, over a 4-year  period.   Last

year,  it was about 24%.  So it has increased somewhat.   The

Traffic  Police  monitors  this trend.    It  is  looking  at

improving the training regime, for example, working with  the

three  driving schools, to introduce topics such as defensive

riding and more responsible riding into the training syllabus

and strengthening it.

<div align="center"><b>RELEASE OF LAND FOR "WHITE PUMPERS"</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  when  will his Ministry  release  land  for

"white pumpers"; (b) how many sites will be offered for  such

a  purpose;  and  (c) what are the tender qualifications  and

eligibility for tenderers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MND is currently

working  with MTI to study the possibility and the mechanisms

of  allowing  petrol pump facilities in commercial  or  white

is  still at a preliminary stage and details have yet  to  be

worked   out.    MND   and  MTI  will  make   the   necessary

announcements when the details are finalised.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister whether the

Ministry  can  consider allocating land  along  the  side  of

expressways for these "white pumpers" instead of putting  the

petrol kiosks at the housing estates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I indicated, we have still not

reached the stage where we are looking at specific sites  for

such  facilities.  But it obviously depends  upon,  first  of

all,  the  availability and, secondly,  whether  such  "white

pumps" can co-locate with other users, taking into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>

account  factors such as fire safety as well as environmental

requirements.

<div align="center"><b>OLDER PRIVATE HOUSING ESTATES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Upgrading of pavements and drains)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

National Development whether the Government will expedite the

upgrading  of  pavements and drains in older private  housing

estates,  as damaged amenities contribute to the breeding  of

disease-carrying insects like cockroaches and mosquitoes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Land  Transport Authority (LTA) has a regular inspection  and

maintenance  programme for all public  roads  and  pedestrian

walkways.   Similarly, the Ministry of the Environment  (ENV)

carries  out  routine maintenance and improvement  works  for

drains  in  public areas.  These programmes  also  extend  to

those in private housing estates.  LTA will repair roads  and

walkways and ENV will repair drains that are damaged or  pose

a  hazard to public safety.  ENV also ensures a high standard

of  public  health  by  keeping vector populations,  such  as

mosquitoes and cockroaches, at low levels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP) for private

residential estates provides improvement works over and above

the  on-going  maintenance works carried out by  the  various

Government  agencies  such as LTA and ENV.   Where  possible,

improvement  works of Government agencies will be coordinated

with  those  under  the  EUP to lessen inconvenience  to  the

residents.   We  expect about three to  five  estates  to  be

selected each year under the EUP.  The Government will review

the  number of estates to be chosen and the programme budget,

depending  on the experience gained from each batch,  support

for the programme, and whether there are budget surpluses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Sir, could the Ministry

consider  whether  town  councils should  coordinate  and  be

responsible  for  pursuing  such  improvement  projects   for

private  estates  within their boundaries, so  that  priority

could be given to estates in need and in an orderly fashion?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, town councils' mandate

extends  to the maintenance of common areas.  "Common areas",

as  understood under the Housing and Development  Act,  means

the  areas owned by HDB but managed by town councils for  the

benefit  of HDB residents.  So town councils have no  mandate

to manage roads, parks and drains in private estates.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like

to ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether, because of

the EUP that he mentioned, there would be a slow-down or more

stringent  criteria when non-EUP estates ask for improvements

to their public facilities.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, LTA and ENV have a

regular  maintenance programme for all private  estates.   In

fact,  NParks  is also included as one of the  agencies.   So

they  have  a regular maintenance programme but,  of  course,

once  in  a  while, if they have flooding and trees  falling,

they  can  contact  the relevant agency to  solve  an  ad-hoc

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EUP is a programme provided over and above this

routine maintenance programme.  EUP is an enhancement to  the

private estates' ambience, and the EUP is something that  the

Ministry   of   National  Development  hopes   to   implement

progressively for more estates over a period of time.  So the

EUP  and  the routine maintenance programme are two  separate

programmes altogether.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I think the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary  may  have  missed the  point  raised  earlier.   A

suggestion was made as to whether or not the Government would

consider amending legislation to expand the scope of the Town

Councils Act so that the private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>

estates  would  also come under the management  of  the  town

councils.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I am not sure if the

private estate residents would welcome that, because it is  a

different  issue altogether.  Town councils were specifically

created to manage common areas.  In many constituencies  like

Tanglin, for example - Mr Lew Syn Pau is not here - he hardly

has  any  HDB blocks.  I think there are only two HDB blocks,

and  his  town  council may not be welcomed in  Nassim  Park,

Holland or Queen Astrid Park.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the question was raised as to

whether  or not it would be more efficient for town  councils

to  manage  the upgrading of private estates and,  therefore,

for this purpose, whether or not the Town Councils Act should

be  amended at least to the extent of allowing town  councils

to coordinate and manage these improvement programmes.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the EUP is offered to

the  CCCs.   The  Advisers  have  been  invited  recently  to

nominate  precincts for EUP upgrading.   The  CCCs  can  then

nominate  the  town  councils to act  as  their  professional

agency to improve these private estates.  Indeed, in the case

of the Serangoon Gardens EUP Committee, the CCC has nominated

the  town  council to be the professional agency.   So,  yes,

that  arrangement is possible.  But town councils do not have

the   mandate  to  manage  private  estates.   They  act   on

somebody's  behalf,  in  this  case,  Serangoon  Gardens  EUP

Committee.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I think the Senior

Parliamentary Secretary also missed the point in my question.

I was not talking about routine maintenance, because that has

to  be  done before things go bad.  Sir, the EUP is a limited

programme,  and  not all estates are chosen.   But  some  old

estates may have certain areas that need to be improved,  eg,

drains  that are collapsing or things like that.  Would  that

kind of programme be slowed down because the focus is now  on

EUP?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not

the  case.   To  be  fair, LTA and ENV look  at  the  routine

maintenance programme seriously and they will step in  before

these  things  happen.  And EUP is something over  and  above

that.  We should not confuse the two.  If the Member knows of

any dilapidated drains or parks, maybe he could let me or the

relevant Ministries know.

<div align="center"><b>WOODBRIDGE HOSPITAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Shortage of nurses)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  there is a serious shortage of nurses at  Woodbridge

Hospital and what is the ratio of nurses to patients  in  the

wards of the hospital.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Sir, the

short answer to Mr Low Thia Khiang's question is `No'.  There

is no serious shortage of nurses at Woodbridge Hospital.  The

manpower  situation, we admit, is tight, but it  is  adequate

for  the time being.  Let me elaborate a little on this.   At

the  moment,  we have 610 nurses in Woodbridge Hospital,  and

this  is against the establishment of 720 positions.  So,  on

paper,  there is a shortage of 15.3% or about  110.   But  we

have  to  see  this figure in context.  These  vacancies  are

primarily  created because, last year, we added 97 additional

posts  in  Woodbridge  Hospital in order  to  provide  better

coverage of night duties.  So most of the shortfalls are  due

to  new posts created last year to improve coverage of  night

duties.  We would have to take some time to recruit people to

fill  the new posts.  We are confident that, given time,  the

necessary number will be recruited.  15.3% manpower shortfall

sounds   high.   However,  please  remember  that  Woodbridge

Hospital has an occupation rate of about 85%.  So the  number

of  patients is about 15% lower than the maximum planned for.

That  is  why I say that the manpower situation is tight  but

adequate.  I would like to assure the Member that Woodbridge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>

Hospital  is a well-run psychiatric hospital and the patients

receive a high standard of care.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, what is the current

ratio of nurses to patients?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> The current ratio of health care staff

to  patients  is about 1:2.7, ie, one staff to 2.7  patients.

This  is  considered  adequate based on current  professional

guideline.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> With particular reference to

Woodbridge Hospital, given the type of patients who  stay  in

the  hospital, does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that

the ratio is satisfactory?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> 2.7 is an overall ratio. Depending on

the type of patients, the ratio is different.  If it is acute

admission  patients, in other words, the more serious  cases,

the recommended ratio is 1:2.5; for short stay patients it is

1:3;  for longer stay patients and geriatric patients  it  is

1:4;  and for mentally retarded and chronic sick it  is  1:5.

So the overall ratio of 1:2.7 is well within range.

<div align="center"><b>ENLISTMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House seeks to amend the Enlistment

Act as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to refine the reimbursement system for the loss of

salary and wages when a person undergoes Operationally  Ready

National Service, or "ORNS";

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to allow certain offences under the Enlistment Act

and regulations to be made compoundable;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to appoint enlistment inspectors to investigate

offences under the Act and regulations; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to make related amendments to the Singapore Armed

Forces Act.

Sir, I would like to highlight the major aspects of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill allows a person performing

Operationally  Ready National Service to claim  reimbursement

for  pay components that meet certain criteria.  One of these

pay components is bonuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current law, an Operationally Ready National

Serviceman  (or ORNSman) cannot claim reimbursement  for  any

pay component labelled "bonus" when he attends ORNS training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the increasing popularity of the flexi-wage

policy  in  Singapore, there has been a  rising  trend  among

private sector employers to term more and more pay components

of  their employee's monthly salary as "bonus", or some other

term.   Such pay components, though termed as "bonuses",  are

essentially part of the monthly wages of the employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Enlistment Act allows the claim of

bonuses,  and any other types of pay components if they  meet

the following conditions:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it is provided in the ORNSman's employment or

service contract;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it is received on a regular basis over a prescribed

period of time;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) it is subject to CPF contributions under the

Central Provident Fund Act; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) it falls within the definition of "gains or profits

from employment" under the Income Tax Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to make it more convenient

for  ORNSmen to receive their reimbursement claim.  Under the

present  legislation, only the ORNSman is entitled  to  claim

reimbursement  for  the  loss of his  civilian  income.   The

ORNSman submits his claim through his employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has a new scheme called the Payment Through

Employers  Scheme.  This scheme aims to reduce paperwork  and

simplify  procedures  for ORNSmen and  their  employers  when

making  a  claim  for  loss  of income  resulting  from  ORNS

training.   Under this scheme, the employer will continue  to

pay  his  ORNSmen  employees their monthly  salary  when  the

ORNSmen   attend  training.   The  employer  then   makes   a

consolidated  claim  to the designated  authority  to  obtain

reimbursement.   This  seamless system  will  result  in  the

ORNSman not having to suffer any disruption in receiving  his

salary  income.  He will also not have to put in a claim  for

reimbursement  for  the loss of his civilian  income  to  the

designated authority through his employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Act will formally put in place this

streamlined procedure, with employers given the right to  opt

for this scheme of direct payment to their ORNSmen employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill allows for the composition of

certain  offences  under the Enlistment Act and  regulations.

Under  the  present  legislation, those who  commit  offences

under  the  Enlistment Act and regulations are prosecuted  in

the  civil  courts.  The proposed amendments will  allow  the

proper  authority  to  compound certain  offences  under  the

Enlistment Act

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>

and its regulations. This will save the time and resources of

the court and prosecution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of composition for offences under the

Enlistment  Act  will be a maximum of $1,000.   For  offences

under the Enlistment Regulations, the maximum will be $500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill also allows the appointment of

enlistment inspectors and sets out their powers.  The Follow-up and Investigation Unit, or the IU, of the Central Manpower

Base investigates offences committed under the Enlistment Act

and  its  regulations.  The IU needs to be equipped with  the

powers  of arrest and investigations, similar to those  found

in  the  Criminal  Procedure Code and the Evidence  Act.   As

such,  the  IU  was previously formed as an Auxiliary  Police

Force,  or  an APF.  However, an APF can only operate  within

specifically  identified areas.  The IU, on the  other  hand,

has to conduct investigations throughout Singapore.  This  is

beyond the ambit of an APF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment allows the proper authority to appoint

public  officers as investigators to be known  as  enlistment

inspectors.   They will be empowered to investigate  offences

committed  under  the Enlistment Act and  regulations.   They

also  will have powers of search, seizure and arrest.   These

powers may be exercised anywhere in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 makes related amendments to the Singapore Armed

Forces  Act  or  the  SAF Act.  Servicemen,  whether  ORNSmen

during  their  in-camp training or former regular  servicemen

during  their service, who commit military offences,  may  be

required  to report for trial after they have finished  their

in-camp  training or their regular service. Trial here  means

the  court  martial or a summary trial.  Those  who  fail  or

refuse  to  report  for  such  trials  currently  cannot   be

prosecuted  for a military offence under the SAF Act  because

they  are not subject to military law when the order to  them

to report is given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, those persons who fail or refuse to report

for  trial  may only be prosecuted in the civil courts  under

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>

Penal Code (section 174), that is, for the non-attendance  in

obedience to an order from a public servant.  As the  failure

or  refusal  to  report  for trial is  a  disciplinary  issue

related to the SAF, MINDEF believes the SAF should be able to

deal directly with such disobedience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments make it a military offence if an ORNSman

or a former regular serviceman does not report for trial when

ordered to do so by the competent authority.  This will be so

even  though he is not subject to military law when the order

to report for such trial is given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to approve the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the GPC for

Defence and Foreign Affairs supports this Bill.  It is timely

indeed  to  amend the Enlistment Act which was instituted  in

1970.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, generations of national servicemen have been

trained to bear arms.  National service is now very much part

and  parcel  of  the  Singaporean  way  of  life.   With  our

experience  over  the  years and  cycles  of  training,  both

locally  and  overseas, we are now in a  better  position  to

redefine  and  fine-tune the procedures  for  enlistment  and

national service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National servicemen and their employers would definitely

welcome and embrace the streamlined and simplified method for

claiming  make-up pay. Such exemplary cut in red tape  should

be followed and emulated by other Government agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, all national servicemen would welcome the

redefinition of civilian remuneration to include bonuses  and

any relevant pay components.  This ensures

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>

that  Operationally Ready National Servicemen will  not  lose

out when they go for their in-camp training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also welcome the provision for compounding

certain offences under the Enlistment Act. This will simplify

the  procedures, and save time and resources of the court and

the  personnel  involved.  I wish to  ask  the  Minister  for

examples and categories of offences that will be compounded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that a national serviceman called up to

answer charges and attend trial for alleged offences while he

was  subject to military law should not be entitled to  claim

reimbursement   or   compensation  for   loss   of   civilian

remuneration.  But if the national serviceman is subsequently

acquitted, will he be eligible to claim for loss of  civilian

remuneration  for  the  time he spent in  attending  military

court?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, I thank Dr Ong Chit Chung

for  his  comments.  He has raised two questions.  The  first

question  is:   what  are  some examples  and  categories  of

offence  that  will  be compounded?  Sir,  some  examples  of

offences that will be compounded are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the failure of an ORNSman to notify the proper

authority before he leaves Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the failure of an ORNSman to maintain contact with

his unit; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the failure of an exit permit holder to report

to  the  proper authority within seven days of his return  to

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some categories of offences that will be compounded are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) exit permit offences;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) registration offences; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) offences relating to the disclosure of

particulars by an NS registrant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question asked by Dr Ong is: if an ORNSman

is called up to answer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>

charges  and attend trial for alleged offences while  he  was

subject  to  military law, will he be eligible to  claim  for

loss  of  civilian remuneration for the time spent  attending

military  court  if he is acquitted?  Sir,  ORNSmen  who  are

called up to perform national service are entitled to make  a

claim for the loss of civilian remuneration for the period of

their  call-up.   When  an ORNSman is  called  up  to  answer

charges and attend trial, he is called up for the purposes of

disciplinary  proceedings and to answer  the  charge  against

him.   He  is  not  called  up to perform  national  service.

Therefore, whether the ORNSman is convicted or acquitted,  he

should  not  be  entitled  to  claim  for  loss  of  civilian

remuneration  for  the time spent attending the  disciplinary

proceedings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, earlier this year, the Government announced that

four  land  departments of the Ministry of Law,  namely,  the

Land   Office,  the  Singapore  Land  Registry,  the   Survey

Department and the Land Systems Support Unit would be  merged

to  form  a  new statutory board on 1st June 2001 called  the

Singapore  Land  Authority.   This  Bill  before  the   House

provides for the establishment of this new statutory board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of these four land departments, the Land Office leases

and alienates State land and acquires land for the State.  It

also  maintains and manages the State land stock.   The  Land

Registry  registers transactions affecting land,  issues  and

guarantees land titles and their tenure,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>

and  provides  land-ownership and related  information.   The

Survey Department provides cadastral survey plans of land and

buildings,  maintains  and  updates  the  cadastral  maps  of

Singapore  and  provides geo-spatial information.   The  Land

Systems  Support Unit maintains a national land data hub  and

manages  the  infrastructure  for  sharing  and  distributing

digitised land data among public agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of setting up the Singapore Land Authority

is  to  streamline functions and to optimise land  resources.

It  is  better than having four separate departments carrying

out different roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's land resources are limited. As our

population increases, more of our island would be  built  up.

We need to manage the land better and put in place mechanisms

to  intensify the use of land that is already built up, so as

to ensure sufficient land to cater for our future needs.  The

SLA  will  not own the State land stock, as these lands  will

remain  with the State.  But SLA will be the land  management

agent  for  the State.  In this role, it will make  available

land for residential, commercial, educational, institutional,

social and other purposes having regard to the Concept  Plan.

It will manage and optimise land use.  The SLA will work with

the  planning  agencies as well as private sector  bodies  to

identify  new  uses,  develop rights concerning  State  land,

optimise efficiencies of every transaction and allocate  more

land based on sound economic principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the formation of the SLA, we will have a more

flexible   framework  for  implementing   Government's   land

policies  and plans to optimise land use.  The SLA will  also

enable   one   regulatory  body  to  provide   authoritative,

comprehensive and easily accessible land information and land

management  systems.  Better land information and  management

will,  in turn, enhance the State's ability to optimise  land

use,  ensure  appropriate returns on the  land  and  maintain

confidence in the land administration system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SLA is a necessary infrastructure to support the

implementation of the forthcoming 2001 Concept Plan for  land

use.  Master planning of land use will remain a core function

under  the URA.  SLA will, however, complement the  land  use

planning   system   by  implementing  more   efficient   land

administration  functions such as land  alienation,  leasing,

land  acquisition, management of tenancies and vacant  lands.

This  way,  it can support the central planning agencies  and

development  authorities to better  realise  their  land  use

plans.  It will also help to better achieve a balance between

economic  development, flexibility for  physical  renewal  of

properties, social growth and cohesion and the protection  of

our nature reserves and parklands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may now turn to the key aspects of the Bill,

clause  5 of the Bill, read together with the First Schedule,

provides  the constitution of the Board of Directors  of  the

Authority.   The Minister for Law will appoint  the  Chairman

and  directors  of  the Board.  The Chief  Executive  of  the

Authority  will  be  appointed  with  the  approval  of   the

Minister, under clause 11.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out the mission and functions of the

Authority.    The  Authority  shall  be  charged   with   the

responsibility  of  optimising  scarce  land  resources,  and

developing a supporting land information infrastructure.  Its

broad functions will be to advise the Government on all land-related  matters, including acquisition, allocation,  tenures

and disposal of State lands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out the powers of the Authority. Among

other  things,  the  Authority  will  be  empowered  to  form

companies and participate in joint ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 sets out the power of the Authority to request

for land related information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 to 13 pertain to appointments of the Chief

Executive, officers and employees of the Authority.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 14 to 21 are the financial provisions. The main

source  of funding for the Authority will be in the  form  of

fees for services and other functions performed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 22 to 28 provide for the transfer of property,

assets,   liabilities  and  employees   to   the   Authority.

Property, assets and liabilities, as may be determined by the

Minister  for Finance, will be transferred to the  Authority.

About 500 Ministry of Law employees, currently working in the

four  land departments, will be transferred to the SLA.  They

will  be  transferred on terms not less favourable than  what

they are enjoying immediately before the transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 29 to 38 are general provisions. Clause 35

provides for the preservation of secrecy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, let me repeat that land is a scarce

resource  which  has an important role in Singapore's  social

and  economic development.  It is vital therefore that we  be

proactive  and  innovative  in  optimising  land.   The   new

statutory  board, the SLA, will be nimble and  innovative  to

respond to changing needs for land in the overall context  of

Singapore's economic development in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am,

generally, in support of the Bill.  I think it is timely  and

welcome  to  bring  the different functions  under  different

Ministries  under  a  central authority  for  efficiency  and

consistency, as a manager.  And, of course, there must  be  a

close  linkage,  as  the  Minister  has  emphasised,  of  the

planning agencies and Concept Plan under the URA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point though relates mainly to one thing, and

this  is the power to act as an agent of Government for  land

acquisition.   I  believe the power is set out  under  clause

6(1)(e).   I  want  to  ask  the  Minister  whether  the  new

Authority  will be able to consider policies for  acquisition

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>

compensation  to  private owners.   Basically,  my  point  of

contention  is  whether it is now timely that our  policy  of

compulsory  acquisition should now be a policy of  compulsory

purchase.   What  I  mean  by this,  Sir,  is  that  in  some

countries,  private owners have a right  to  say  no  to  the

government.  And this, of course, is different in  Singapore,

because  of  our  national  need  to  develop  public  goods,

highways,  etc.   I think, in this sense, where  there  is  a

national  good  at stake, compulsion should still  be  there.

However,  there is a question of price, and the cost  imposed

on private owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our policy today is that we pay a historically-based price. In the past, this has led to some loss for

private  owners.  Clearly, today, the Government  has  strong

financial   reserves.   And  should  we  not   then   acquire

compulsorily  but at market rates?  This is what  I  mean  by

compulsory purchase, rather than compulsory acquisition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am moved to ask this question because, in recent

times,   Government  has  increasingly  given  out  ex-gratia

payments  where  there  are  certain  special  circumstances.

While  this does justice to some individual cases,  this  may

lead  to  untidiness, because why do some cases get ex-gratia

payments,  and why not others.  Sir, I wonder whether  it  is

now timely to relook at the policy as a whole.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, as I said in my Second Reading

speech, this Bill is really to enable the formation of a  new

statutory board.  Its provisions do not have anything  to  do

with  the substantive law or policy on land acquisition.   It

does  not  increase the powers presently contained under  the

law  on  land acquisition.  And the proposed statutory board,

the  Singapore Land Authority, will not have any  independent

powers of land acquisition.  The SLA will be an agent of  the

Government, but the power to acquire land continues  to  vest

in the Government.  In that sense, there is no real change in

the  passing  of  this new Bill concerning land  acquisition.

That being the case, I am not sure whether this would be  the

right time to have a detailed debate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>

on  land acquisition policy.  But I would be happy to  engage

in  a debate with the Member or other Members if they want to

have a detailed exchange of views on land acquisition policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, let me just make only some

general  comments.  Whatever the position  may  be  in  other

countries,  land in Singapore is a special case,  because  of

the  scarcity  of land.  The Land Acquisition Act  which  has

served  us  well in the past will continue to be  needed.   I

believe  the general approach in land acquisition has  served

us well.  It will still be needed, because, as I have said in

this  House some years ago, it is not a position of us  never

having projects in the future in the public interest where we

may need to acquire land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on the compensation approach. We have

reviewed  the statutory date from time to time, and  now  the

statutory date is 1995.  Although that is the case,  we  have

also provided for ex-gratia payments, and we have revised the

ex-gratia payments from time to time, to make sure  that  any

hardship   which  may  be  encountered  by  the  compensation

quantum, is reduced.  I believe that the compensation package

was   announced  in this House. This is not a static  matter.

We  will  continuously  review the position  under  the  Land

Acquisition  Act.   In particular, we will review  the  total

package under the ex-gratia scheme and see whether there is a

need  to increase the payments to be made under the ex-gratia

scheme.   And  if need be, we will announce whatever  changes

that  are  necessary.   Basically, we do  take  into  account

whatever  hardships that  may be caused.  But at the  end  of

the day, in Singapore, we cannot adopt the approach which may

be  prevalent  in other countries where the authorities  have

abundant areas of land to take into account for developmental

needs.  Ours is a special case, but we are not unaware of the

problems caused and we will see whatever we can do to  reduce

the hardships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Treasury Bills Act to reduce

the nominal denomination of new issues of Treasury Bills ("T-bills") from $10,000 to $1,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having a large and diverse investor base is

important to increase Singapore's attractiveness as a funding

hub,  and  for  the development of an active  secondary  bond

market.  Financial intermediaries have alluded that they  see

much latent potential in the retail sector whose savings  can

be    channelled   towards   securities   investments.    The

liberalisation  of  the  CPF Investment  Scheme  has  further

enlarged  the  pool  of  potential funds  for  investment  in

securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reduction to S$1,000 will align the nominal

denomination  of Treasury Bills with the nominal  amount  for

Government securities.  This should facilitate greater retail

participation in the Treasury Bill market and is in line with

the  Government's effort to promote the Singapore  Government

Securities market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is requested to allow that every new Treasury

Bill  issued by the Government be for the sum of $1,000 or  a

multiple of $1,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BROADCASTING AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on my Ministry's budget on 9th March,

I announced the Government's intention to amend the Singapore

Broadcasting   Authority  (SBA)  Act  for  the   purpose   of

restraining  foreign  broadcasters from any  interference  in

Singapore's domestic politics.  I explained that the  foreign

media operate here as a matter of privilege and not of right.

We  welcome them to come to Singapore to report on local  and

regional  developments, based on the principles of  accuracy,

fairness and balance.  However, they must not engage  in  our

domestic politics, as this is the preserve of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986 Parliament amended the Newspaper and Printing

Presses  Act  (NPPA) to gazette and limit the circulation  of

foreign  newspapers which engage in the domestic politics  of

Singapore.  This Bill extends the same principles to  foreign

television  channels which are rebroadcast  in  Singapore  by

Singapore Cable Vision (SCV).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995 when SCV began operations, the number of

foreign channels available to Singaporeans has increased from

a  few to 40 channels today.  Out of these channels, five are

specialised   news   channels,   namely,   CNBC   Asia,   CNN

International, BBC World, CTN and Bloomberg.  Subscription to

SCV   cable  TV  has  also  grown  to  260,000  today.    The

penetration rate was 26% in January and is expected to exceed

40%  by 2005.  Clearly cable TV can have a significant impact

on our domestic audience.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Rationale for New Rules</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill makes it clear to foreign broadcasters

that  whilst  they  can sell their services to  Singaporeans,

they   should  not  interfere  with  our  domestic  politics.

Foreign  broadcasters are outsiders and not  participants  in

our political scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As outsiders and observers, they can report on

Singapore.   They  should  do  so factually  and  accurately,

without  bias  or distortion.  However, they  should  not  be

involved  in  local  political issues, or  try  to  influence

Singaporeans  on such issues.  In our General Elections,  for

example, they should not take sides either for or against any

political party or politician in their reporting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position on this matter is a reasonable one.

Singaporeans  should  decide the fate of  Singapore  and  not

foreigners.  Foreign broadcasters have no stake in Singapore.

If their reporting creates problems, they will not suffer the

consequences.   For example, if incendiary  reporting  causes

racial  riots  and destabilises Singapore, it is Singaporeans

who suffer as confidence collapses and jobs are lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries like Canada and the UK also have legal

safeguards  to  prevent  outside  interference.   The  Canada

Elections  Act  2000  prohibits the  use  of  a  broadcasting

station  outside  Canada by any person  for  the  purpose  of

influencing  an election in Canada.  The Act also  stipulates

that  no  foreigner should try to influence voters during  an

election in Canada.  The UK Representation of the People  Act

1983 similarly prohibits any person from using a broadcasting

station  outside the UK to influence an election in  the  UK.

Such  programmes  can only be carried by  local  broadcasters

which  are subject to a legal duty and a code of practice  to

be politically impartial.

<br><br><i>Engaging in Domestic Politics</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore the NPPA has set the ground rules for

foreign  newspapers  to  operate here.   Many  of  them  have

sizeable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>

circulation in Singapore.  This policy of non-interference in

domestic  politics  and  our right of reply  are  established

policies  which over the years the foreign publications  have

come around to accept.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notion of what constitutes "engaging in the domestic

politics  of  Singapore" in the NPPA was tested in  court  in

1989.   The  High  Court  ruled  that  reports  or  editorial

comments  which went beyond what was factual could amount  to

"engaging  in domestic politics", if they were  made  with  a

view  to  espouse  political ideas  or  to  influence  public

opinion.  The court also explained that the provision in  the

NPPA made clear that the domestic politics of Singapore is  a

matter reserved for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to the SBA Act follows similar

principles.   As  provided  in the Bill,  the  Minister  will

decide whether a foreign broadcasting service is "engaging in

domestic  politics".  This will be based  on  reasonable  and

proper grounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate with some examples. The first example

is  a foreign broadcaster which denies Singapore the right of

reply to inaccurate, biased, or distorted reporting of issues

concerning Singapore.  A second example is one which conducts

political  broadcasts such as advertising directed towards  a

political end or programmes featuring any politician who pays

the broadcaster or is paid by the broadcaster, or remunerated

in  other ways, to appear in the broadcast.  A third  example

is  a foreign broadcaster which conducts broadcasts made with

a  view  to  espouse political ideas or to  influence  public

opinion  in Singapore.  All these can be deemed as  "engaging

in  domestic politics".  A decision has to be made  based  on

the  particular circumstances of the case and this  may  vary

according to time and context.

<br><br><i>Amendment to SBA Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight some aspects of the Bill. Under

the   new  section  42A,  subsection  (1)  will  empower  the

Minister,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1485</b></font><br><br>

by  order  published in the Gazette, to declare  any  foreign

broadcasting  service  carried  on  any  relevant  licensable

broadcasting service as engaging in the domestic politics  of

Singapore.   Subsection  (2) requires  the  Minister's  prior

approval  for  any  person to rebroadcast  in  Singapore  any

declared   foreign  broadcasting  service.   Subsection   (3)

empowers   the   Minister  to  approve  the  rebroadcast   in

Singapore, subject to such conditions as he thinks fit, or he

may refuse or revoke such approval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under subsection (4), the Minister may restrict the

number of persons who may receive the service and may suspend

the  service  for a specified period.  Under subsection  (5),

the  penalty  for contravening subsection (2) or  failing  to

comply  with a condition imposed under subsection (3a)  is  a

fine not exceeding $100,000 upon conviction.

<br><br><i>Scope of coverage</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will apply to foreign broadcasters carried

on  SCV's  cable  network.  However, with rapid  advances  in

technology,  there will be new ways of delivering  television

services.   Where appropriate we could in future  include  as

licensable broadcasting services other broadcasting platforms

when  they become relevant, but for now the amendments  apply

only to foreign broadcasting services carried on SCV.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, we welcome foreign broadcasters to

broadcast   in  or  from  Singapore.   We  will  extend   all

facilities to help them operate successfully here.   However,

those  who  broadcast to Singapore audiences  should  provide

objective  and  accurate reporting  and  not  engage  in  the

domestic  politics  of Singapore.  If a  foreign  broadcaster

chooses  to  abuse the privilege, it will have to suffer  the

financial penalty of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>

restriction in distribution or advertising in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the Bill.  I understand the rationale for the

proposed  amendments to the Singapore Broadcasting  Authority

Act  requiring  that foreign broadcasters should  not  engage

themselves  in  our domestic politics, as  the  Minister  has

said,  as  this  is the preserve of Singaporeans.   The  Bill

basically  amends the SBA Act to bring it in  line  with  the

Newspaper  and  Printing Presses Act (last amended  in  1986)

regarding the role of foreign media in our domestic politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore anticipate little problems in its

implementation as I believe over the years, the foreign media

have come around to accept our policy on their involvement in

our  domestic  politics, the need for accurate and  objective

reporting and our right of reply.  However, I would  like  to

address  this  Bill by looking at its economic  impact,  both

directly  and  indirectly, on Singapore and  our  efforts  to

promote Singapore as a media hub in Asia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our drive to be a media hub in Asia, we have been

successful in recent years in attracting a number of  foreign

broadcasters to set up shop in Singapore, including Discovery

Channel,  MTV Asia and CNBC Asia.  Singapore is now  able  to

compete   strongly   with  foreign  broadcasters   who   have

previously  located  themselves in Hong Kong,  Australia  and

Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have managed to market ourselves as such,

leveraged  on our strategic location, advanced communications

infrastructure  and  availability  of  skilled  and  creative

manpower,  we have already created the platform  for  a  more

sustainable drive to achieve our aim to be the media  hub  in

Asia.  Indeed, this has led to positive economic activity and

growth in recent years, in both our broadcasting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>

as  well as the media entertainment industries, both of which

have  benefited  greatly  from  the  participation  of  these

foreign broadcasters in our local media scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this time of potential economic downturn, the

direct job creation as a result of our media hub policy,  the

exposure  of  our  local talents who are  working  for  these

foreign broadcasters, and the ability to attract creative and

talented foreigners who are now based in Singapore, have  all

contributed  positively to our economy.  In addition,  direct

competition  from foreign broadcasters based here,  has  also

forced  our  local broadcasters to upgrade their  skills  and

services  and improve standards.  The success of our  Channel

News  Asia  is  a testament to the fruits of this  policy  in

recent years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, Sir, I am concerned whether the introduction of

this  Bill,  though  it has its social  merits,  will  affect

Singapore's ongoing efforts to be the regional media hub  and

broadcasting centre.  I understand that the immediate  impact

may  be  limited  as there are still only a small  number  of

foreign  broadcasters based here.  However, I would  like  to

ask if the Ministry has assessed the potential impact of this

Bill  on  our   efforts  currently underway  to  promote  and

develop  our  media hub strategy.  Has the Ministry  made  an

assessment  of the economic impact if potential entrants  and

investments  to Singapore in this industry are deterred  from

completing projects, starting new ones, or even slowing their

participation here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An observation that has been reflected by critics even

in our local press is that, whilst the impact of the Bill may

appear  insignificant and negligible financially, it  carries

other implications, not least the suggestion that it is a key

piece of the Government's pre-election jigsaw puzzle.  Whilst

I  do  not subscribe to this view, I recognise that the  Bill

may  potentially send a wrong signal to foreign  broadcasters

who  are  considering setting up shop here.  Worse,  existing

ones  may even wish to pull out totally from Singapore.  This

is  anathema  to  what we are trying to do  to  develop  this

industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, I support the Bill and will be grateful

if the Minister would give his comments on these observations

and perhaps reassure the House that the Bill would not affect

Singapore's  hard  won  status  as  an  emerging  media   and

broadcasting hub.  In addition, it would be important to many

interested   parties   who   are   closely   watching   these

developments,  if  the  Minister  would  reaffirm  that   the

Government  remains committed to promoting  the  broadcasting

industry.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

introduction   of   the   Singapore  Broadcasting   Authority

(Amendment) Bill is because we are opening our media  to  the

outside world.  Whenever people talk about opening the  media

in  Singapore, most people will associate it with the  coming

hot battle between MediaCorp and Singapore Press Holdings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the opening up of our media started in the

1980s, that is, the opening of our media to the outside world

when   we  allowed  foreign  publications  to  circulate   in

Singapore.    Since  1995,  we  have  also  allowed   foreign

television stations into the homes of every Singaporean  with

the  introduction  of cable vision.  As  a  matter  of  fact,

seriously  speaking, the opening of our media to the  outside

world  started  even earlier than its opening to our domestic

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we were to tell the foreigners that there

are  some  40 foreign television channels and a few  thousand

foreign publications available in Singapore, many of them may

not  believe  us.  They would ask, "Is it  true?   Isn't  the

Singapore   Government  keeping  a  very  tight  control   on

everything?  Do you not have a ban on chewing  gum  and  even

install  urine detectors in the lifts of your public  housing

estates to catch people urinating there? And, of course,  you

restrict the circulation of foreign publications!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed the gap between reality and image. The

main  reason  for  the existence of such a gap  is  that  the

foreign media often make criticism against some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>

of the Singapore Government's policies.  Our policy all along

has  been   that  we  want to have a rule-by-law  society  in

Singapore, and there are certain social values which we  want

to uphold.  The foreign media can criticise our policies, but

they are not allowed to interfere in our domestic politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the most fundamental principle. Some people may

feel  that  we  are behind time when we apply the  rules  and

regulations  governing  the press in  the  80s  to  the  21st

century  television media.  My view is that while times  have

changed, and technology has changed the mode of operation  of

the  media,  there  are  some basic  principles  that  remain

unchanged.   All the countries in the world agree  that  they

should not interfere in one another's domestic politics.  Why

cannot  we  stop  the foreign media from interfering  in  our

domestic  politics?  Foreign journalists can  be  Singapore's

political  observers, but they should not be participants  in

Singapore's politics.  This fundamental principle will  never

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the western media talk about freedom of the press,

they  always  talk plausibly and at length.    But  from  the

examples  of what had happened in Singapore in the  past,  we

can  tell  that  they  are having double standards  in  their

definition  of  freedom.  The foreign media  would  use  some

unreliable  and inaccurate data to distort the  facts.   When

our  Government  demanded a verification, and even  suggested

purchasing  advertising space to refute all these  fallacious

reports, they refused.   Our Newspapers and Printing  Presses

Act   prohibits   foreign  newspapers  from  interfering   in

Singapore's political affairs.   This Act has been  in  force

for  many  years.  It is clearly understood  by  the  foreign

media.    They  can  report anything in accordance  with  the

facts  of  the  matter.  They can comment,  but  they  cannot

distort  the facts.  They are not allowed to  participate  in

or  influence  our  politics.   Otherwise, their  circulation

would  be  restricted,   and in cases of  serious  violation,

their permit will be revoked.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the extension of this principle to apply to

the  foreign television media.  The foreign television  media

can  report  on  the politics of Singapore,  comment  on  our

politics,  but  they should not participate in  our  domestic

politics and influence our people's decision on our political

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this amendment to the Singapore Broadcasting

Authority Act, they will once again criticise us of having no

press  freedom here.   I would like to ask the  Minister  for

Information  and  the  Arts what plans his  Ministry  has  to

promote   Singapore's image in terms of media  opening.   Our

long-term plan of developing Singapore into a regional  media

hub  should  not  be  hampered by the  introduction  of  this

Amendment Bill.  Our image should not be tarnished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in 1986, when the Newspapers and Printing

Presses  Act  was  introduced, the western media  pointed  an

accusing  finger  on us and claimed that  this  was  a  clear

evidence of the lack of press freedom in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, the then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,

personally went to the United States of America to meet face-to-face with more than 300 international journalists.  I  was

then  one of the journalists in our Singapore delegation.   I

discovered  that  many of these journalists  did  not  really

understand the situation in Singapore.  They could  only  say

that  by  restricting the circulation of  a  certain  foreign

publication we were violating the principle of press freedom.

They asked why was it that in Asia, places like India and the

Philippines  could  have press freedom, but  Singapore  could

not.   Prime  Minister Lee Kuan Yew's  reply  was    that  he

understood   Singapore  better.   The  US   model   was   not

universally  applicable and valid everywhere.  The  media  of

the   various  countries  play  different  roles   in   their

respective  countries,  owing to their  different  historical

experience,  political systems and makings of  their  people.

The  function  represented  by  their  civilisation  and  the

function  manifested  by the media in different  environments

are equally effective.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we are opening up our media to the

outside  world,  the introduction of this Amendment  Bill  is

necessary  and  important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I had not intended to speak on this Bill,  but

after  hearing the Minister throw the terms "non-interference

with domestic politics" and "objective reporting", I was very

tempted  to  ask  him whether he would try  and  define  more

clearly  what interference in domestic politics is  this  all

about, and what does he consider to be "objective reporting".

And  does he think or does the Ministry think that it accords

with natural justice that a Minister of the Government should

be  the one to decide these questions?  Is it not contrary to

commonsense and rationality?  One cannot be the judge and the

prosecutor at the same time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ministry must have this Bill, will it consider

setting  up  what they have in other countries, ie,  a  press

council  -  perhaps, in Singapore, a Press  and  Broadcasting

Council - not just consisting of the Minister alone or anyone

appointed  by  the  Minister, but a council  drawn  from  the

publicity  media  and from other professional  organisations,

which  will then decide whether any report in the papers,  on

TV  or  radio is objective or not objective, and  whether  it

amounts to interference in domestic politics?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, we are a small country. We are a

young  society with different ethnic, language and  religious

groups.  Our society can be torn into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>

pieces  if  race,  language  or religion  is  played  up  and

exploited   by  anyone.   We  have  tried  to   ensure   that

Singapore's  destiny is determined only by Singaporeans.   We

have always been wary of foreigners getting involved in local

politics  as their motives and agenda will be very  different

from Singaporeans'.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the media play a critical role in any modern

society.  They influence opinions, mould minds, and even have

the   ability  to  direct  the  course  of  events.   Foreign

intelligence  agencies  are known to have  infiltrated  media

organisations to influence the editorials and the  colour  of

reporting.   At  times,  western  countries'  foreign  policy

objectives are achieved by cleverly feeding the western media

with  bias  or slanted facts and incomplete data.  These  are

carried   as   factual   reports  by   many   renowned   news

organisations  without verification, in  many  cases  due  to

fierce competition and timely reporting.  Even big businesses

are  known to have penetrated media groups to lobby  business

interests and also sabotage Third World countries.  Even some

global  NGOs, democratic foundations and human rights  groups

cultivate journalists and media owners to project and further

their agenda.  Sir, the western nations know the influence of

the  media  and,  in some countries, have imposed  conditions

that the local media cannot be owned wholly by foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that our Government has already imposed

the requirement that the foreign print media cannot engage in

domestic  politics.  The proposed amendment in the  Singapore

Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Bill seeks to  impose  the

same  requirement on foreign broadcasters who rebroadcast  in

Singapore,  to  prevent them from engaging  in  the  domestic

politics  of  Singapore.  Sir, it is  critical  that  foreign

broadcasters be subject to the same conditions as the foreign

print  media  as, otherwise, this loophole will  be  cleverly

exploited by the foreign broadcasters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with cable television, Singaporeans can now receive

five channels, namely,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>

CNBC Asia, CNN, BBC, CTN and Bloomberg.  Subscriptions to SCV

now  stand  at 260,000.  The penetration rate is expected  to

increase  from 26% to 40% by 2005, as stated by the Minister.

Multiply  the subscription numbers with the household  number

of  four  per  family, and the reach becomes  more  than  one

million  people.  Sir, it is timely that this  amendment  has

been  introduced.  It will ensure that the arena for domestic

politics in Singapore is only for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I stand to express some misgivings

about the Bill.  Let me first consider some of the statements

made  by  the Minister in his explanatory remarks introducing

the  Bill  for Second Reading.  The Minister, if  I  remember

correctly,  gave examples of laws in Canada and  the  UK.   I

would  like to point out though that our laws are,  I  think,

much broader than the two examples he has given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as far as I understand those laws - I do not have

them in front of me - they deal with foreign broadcasts,  ie,

broadcasting   from  outside  the  country  and   that   then

penetrates inside, a bit like what Voice of America does,  or

a  bit  like  what  most of us can receive from  stations  in

Malaysia.  Here, however, the Minister wants to target people

who  are, with our consent, accessing our cable, and who  may

have, in many cases, started up Singapore subsidiaries.   And

the  law actually is crafted so broadly it would cover  these

companies  which are Singapore companies, branch offices  and

other  businesses in Singapore, so long as, according to  new

section  42A(6),  they  would  be  considered  to  be  owned,

controlled or managed by somebody outside Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way in which the laws proposed are broader,

as compared to the two examples he brought up, was that, if I

again  recollect what the Minister said, those laws  targeted

influence  during  the time of election,  whereas  this  Bill

would seem to cover media reports year-long,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>

any  time, anything.  So, if those two examples are the  ones

that  really concerned our Government, we should be targeting

much   more   narrowly  because,  otherwise,   we   do   risk

overshooting  the  mark and having unforeseen  circumstances,

such  as  the  erosion of our ability to be a credible  media

centre, not just for our own media, but for the media we wish

to attract to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say also I remain to be convinced as to this

question:  why SCV?  It seems to me that is only  because  we

can  do it.  It is as simple as turning off a tap.  It  seems

to  me  that,  really,  the penetration through  airwaves  of

Malaysian TV is as pervasive, and we are not doing it because

it  is  harder to do, or politically harder to  do.   But  it

smacks  of  inequality, if we really are concerned about  so-called foreigners.  And that comes back to my point: what  is

the mischief?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his introductory remarks, the Minister has not

mentioned   any  particular  case  or  instance   of   recent

recollection  that  triggers off our concern  in  introducing

these wider powers, and I encourage him to do so, perhaps  in

his closing remarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go on, Sir, to two other levels of the debate. I

think  the first of the levels is, how are we going  to  make

this  consistent  with  the print media?   The  Minister  has

pointed  out  that  we already have laws  that  give  similar

powers  over  print  media.  They do have  similar  problems.

What  is the scope of engaging in domestic politics?  I think

that  has been a troubling issue for both print and broadcast

media.  There are also, however, additional problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the written media, when we proscribe circulation, we

still  allow  limited  copies, say, 1,000  copies,  libraries

only.   So  we can face the world which will ask about  these

laws.   We  can  face the world and say, "We  are  not  about

circumscribing entirely the freedom of information.   We  are

about  trying  to hit you in the pocket place so  you  cannot

make money and lie about us at the same time."  That was what

I  understood to be our policy about the print  media.   And,

therefore, when we see the measure imposed on print media, it

is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>

limited circulation.  Sometimes it is 6,000 copies.  I do not

see  how this is going to work with SCV.  It is like  a  tap.

It  is  going to be either on or off.  We are, in that sense,

doing something quite different from the print media.  We are

going to turn off that tap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second level of the debate is, frankly, I am not

convinced that we should be expanding this law to cover a new

area  of  media.  Nor am I when the Minister says  that  when

there  is a convergence of other media like the Internet,  we

might consider expanding it even further.  I really think  we

should  be thinking about going the other way.  We should  be

reconsidering  whether  we really  need  anymore  to  control

foreign print media against engaging in our domestic politics

because, Sir, I think our policies have stood us well.  A lot

of  the  print media have already understood the  lesson.   I

think  Singapore  today enjoys a much more  favourable  press

than  before.  And my concern is that these laws would  stand

to  damage  that increased enhanced international reputation,

reduce our standing as a hub for media of all types and  with

economic  impact  on  competition with Hong  Kong  and  other

players.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to point out that, over time, there

has  crept in a redundancy in many of the ways our  laws  are

administered.  If I understand correctly, sometimes  when  we

limit circulation on the print media, we still are above what

their subscription rate is anyway, ie, if our limit is 6,000,

their  active subscribers in Singapore may be 5,000.  And  so

we  pay  the penalty for having these laws on the  books  and

having these rubber stamps on the print media, when we really

are not achieving anything by it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do then? I do not think that we should,

of  course, leave foreigners to run Singapore politics.  That

is the prerogative of Singaporeans.  But I think what we need

to do is something quite different.  We have shifted policies

before.   In  the  1970s  and  80s,  we  used  to  throw  out

journalists - revoked their licences and told them to go away

-  and  they  went away yelling to everyone  that  they  were

heroes for having taken on Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>

Now  it  seems  that we want to de-license  them  and,  I  am

afraid, the same thing will happen.  I would encourage us  to

do  internationally  what we do in this House,  which  is  to

debate.   There is increasingly a media that will  cover  our

Government's  side  of  the story.  Our  Government  leaders,

Prime  Minister  Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister  Lee  Kuan

Yew,  are well-known international figures.  If they wish  to

speak,  people  will  listen.  Our own  media,  like  Channel

NewsAsia  and  Radio  Singapore  International,  these   have

regional  ambitions  and can help us  project  our  voice  in

addition to the international media that will listen to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything, Sir, I would encourage the Minister and the

Government to legislate a right of reply.  This can be  equal

in  airtime.  And this is done, as far as I understand it, in

some  federal laws in the USA for radio and other new  media,

although not newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Sir, in the emphasis on debate, it

troubles  me that the proposed section 42A(3)(c)  reads  that

the  Minister  may  revoke a licence "without  assigning  any

reason".  Sir, if we ever want to revoke a licence, it should

be  with reason.  We should go out to defend our position and

not  be thought of being too over-sensitive or protecting our

own narrow self-interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Singaporean, I do resent unfounded ignorant

commentary about our country.  I remember in the early 1990s,

there   was  an  Australian  documentary.   I  cannot  really

remember  its  name, but I remember vividly a visual  of  HDB

flats  with a voice-over that said that these were  slums  in

the  sky.   At  first  I felt very angry,  and  then  I  just

laughed.  I think any Singaporean who saw such a documentary,

who  hears  such wild lies about Singapore, would  not  think

less  of  Singapore, because they know Singapore.  They  will

think less of the documentary.  And I would urge the Minister

to narrow these laws and, more, have faith in Singaporeans to

judge for themselves.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I have just

one  small  point to raise and it relates also  to  something

that Mr Simon

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>

Tay  has  already  spoken on.  With  regard  to  new  section

42A(3)(c) which prescribes for rebroadcast, the Minister  may

revoke his approval at any time without assigning any reason.

This  assigning  to Minister the authority to disapprove  and

revoke  approvals at any time, and without giving any reason,

seems  to  be  a favourite clause, not only of this,  but  of

many, pieces of legislation passed, and I am sure to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that I have no dispute with the prescription

that  the  Minister's decision be final.  But that  is  quite

different  from saying that the Minister does  not  give  any

reasons at all for that decision.   I think that in this  day

and  age  in  Singapore, we would surely  wish  to  have  the

Minister  share his reasons for his decisions.   Firstly,  we

are  looking at increased transparency and, secondly, related

to  transparency  so that in fact all parties  involved  will

have  an understanding of Government's reasoning and position

and therefore be guided in their actions and behaviour in the

future.   Finally,  it  can surely only  be  in  the  greater

interest  of all that Ministers and their officers  assisting

and advising them are subject to the rigour and discipline of

having  the  rationale  for their decisions  open  to  public

scrutiny.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I agree with the

general  intention of the Bill because it is not the interest

of foreign media to interfere or engage in domestic politics.

But  the  proposed amendment, as it stands before the  House,

appears  to  be  very confusing to me.  Under the  Bill,  the

Government  is  simultaneously  the  plaintiff,   judge   and

executioner in disputes with foreign media.  I agree that the

Bill,  as it stands, is very efficient in dealing with  media

who  we  can prove to have interfered with domestic politics.

But  is  it really effective?  Because as it stands,  it  may

create  a very serious credibility problem simply because  of

the  conflict of positions that the Government will be placed

upon.   Quite often, this negative reporting is directed  and

intended possibly at the Government who would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>

be  most affected, and if it is for the Government itself  to

make  such  a  decision, I think that is  going  to  be  very

confusing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, one possible improvement to the Bill is to

get  an  advisory committee, comprising respected members  of

the  society  involved.   MITA has  several  such  committees

advising the Minister in dealing with the various media.   An

existing committee or new committee can be roped in to advise

in  the application of gazetting powers.  The Government  can

submit   the  available  evidence  to  the  committee.    The

committee members can then decide first whether the offending

broadcaster  or  publication amounts to  an  interference  in

politics,  and,  if so, what the appropriate sanctions  would

be.  In reality, it is very difficult to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister would clarify what tantamount

to  interference  with  local politics.   Take  the  case  of

elections.   If  a  foreign broadcaster  were  to  portray  a

particular  candidate or opposition candidate in good  light,

would  that  tantamount to interference with local  politics,

even  if  it is just a factual story?  We have seen  that  by

attending briefings given by opposition parties in some cases

may  tantamount to interference with local politics.  We have

to be very clear about the definition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the other question that earlier Members

raised,  ie, how do you term "broadcasting service" where  it

involves  the  print media and how this is available  on  the

Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have is how the foreign media will

have  an impact on the public opinion of our citizens, and  I

think  the  best  person to decide is the  public  themselves

whether they have been affected by the kind of reporting that

is  brought  about  by  the foreign media.   I  think  it  is

entirely appropriate in this case to have a committee to look

at it.  Of course, the procedure may mean that the Government

does not always win.  The committee may side with the foreign

news organisation and decide that there should be no case for

gazetting.  When I talk about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1499</b></font><br><br>

credibility problem, there is precisely the possibility  that

the  Government  does not always win that  perhaps  may  give

itself the credibility, but otherwise the perception is  that

just  because  the Government is involved with  a  particular

foreign media, the foreign media has got no chance, it  would

always  lose because the final arbiter is the Minister  whose

decision  is final, and he does not have to give any  reasons

for his decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to raise is that for a

journalist,  it is sometimes very difficult, even  for  those

who are not ideologically partisan, to differentiate what  is

fact  and  opinion in times like this, and we  cannot  always

assume,  with  the  new  type of medium,  that  the  existing

practice  and operation of the media that exist in the  print

media in a newspaper like the Straits Times also exist in the

other  types  of  media.   They are  fast,  they  are  easily

accessible, people can write stories now and get published in

the very next minute.  There is a clear possibility of honest

mistake to be made.  This is where a certain sense of balance

got  to  be exercised.  It is good if the Minister is advised

by  a  committee so that such a balance and fair play can  be

seen to be exercised by the Minister and the Government.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BROADCASTING AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I wish to thank Members who have

spoken in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My general impression is that although there are some

misgivings,  by  and  large,  all  those  who  have   spoken,

including

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>

possibly Mr Jeyaretnam, agree that foreigners should  not  be

allowed to interfere in our domestic politics.  It is only  a

question of how we define what is interference, what are  the

instances in which we will act, whether we should have people

to  advise  us,  and  so  forth.  But the  basic  concept  is

accepted, that our politics is for ourselves alone, it is for

Singaporeans to decide, not for foreigners to come in to tell

us what we should do in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will respond to the Members in the order in which they

have  spoken.  Mr Chew Heng Ching supports the Bill,  but  is

concerned  about  the possible negative  impressions  of  our

media scene, whether it will affect our image as a media hub.

I  would  like to assure him that this is very unlikely.   My

own  assessment  is  that this Bill  will  have  very  little

consequence  in practice because so long as the  broadcasters

stay to what they are doing so far, that means, be objective,

report  the  news, by all means report on Singapore,  but  be

objective,  accurate, do not take sides, do  not  try  to  be

"funny"  in terms of our local politics, there should  be  no

problem.   In fact, my Ministry has gone to great lengths  to

brief  the  foreign correspondents and the  broadcasters  who

will  be affected.  Most of them understand the intention  of

our action.  What we are doing here is nothing new.  We have,

for example, studied what has been done in Canada and the UK.

In those two cases, as Mr Simon Tay has pointed out, they are

more narrow in scope. They are confined to the elections.  In

many  other respects, they are the same.  In fact,  the  laws

are extra-territorial because they are trying to impose their

laws on what is outside, ie, broadcasting outside.  Here,  we

are trying to control foreign broadcasters who are carried in

Singapore through our SCV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we are not limiting this just to the

election  period is that you can easily build up  a  negative

image or twist the facts and convey a negative impression and

influence  public opinion, even outside the election  period.

That  is  the reason why both the NPPA and this amendment  on

which it is modelled have the same intention.  Basically,  it

is to lay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>

the  ground  rules very clearly to all these foreigners  that

they  are welcome to do business here.  They are also welcome

to  report on us as observers, but they should not interfere,

they  should  not have an agenda, because it is going  to  be

quite  difficult to judge, depending on the actual reporting,

what it is that they are trying to do.  But I believe if  you

follow the developments leading up to the NPPA, you will  see

that  certain articles have a consistent pattern about  them.

They  even  went  to the extent of refusing  to  publish  the

replies  in  toto.   In one case - I think  it  was  the  Far

Eastern  Economic Review, they only published when we  bought

advertisements.  In other cases, they only printed our  reply

after editing it and cutting out the essential portions.   We

will,  of  course, be very careful on how we  implement  this

law.   The  officers,  the SBA staff  and  our  own  Ministry

officers,  will  monitor  and be  extremely  careful  to  see

whether  this  is fair comment, is it fair reporting,  is  it

balanced,  is  it  accurate or is there  something  that  the

broadcaster is really after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to Mr Chew Heng Ching's point, I think the

impact will be minimal.  The broadcasters whom we have spoken

to generally understand the intent of this Bill.  They do not

like it, but I think they understand it.  So long as they  do

not stray outside what they are doing now, there should be no

difficulty.   The impact on our media hub would  be  minimal.

Because  of what we have been doing, Singapore has  developed

very  well as a media hub, as Mr Chew has pointed out. Today,

we  are  home to 15 satellite broadcasters and 84  production

houses.  The number of foreign publications circulating here,

which include International Herald Tribune (IHT), Asian  Wall

Street  Journal, Economist and so forth, has grown to  5,500.

We  also have 40 foreign channels on SCV, including 5 foreign

news  channels.   I would like to assure Mr  Chew  and  other

Members  that we remain committed to make Singapore  a  media

hub, to welcome foreign media to operate here, both to report

on us as well as on the world and the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, for example, offering generous tax incentives to

encourage  people  to  come here to  package  programmes,  to

uplift  and  to  broadcast  to  the  region.   Many  of   the

broadcasters  who are operating here have told us  that  they

are  extremely happy here.  It is good that we set our ground

rules  clearly  so that there will be a minimum  of  conflict

arising  from  misunderstandings.  I hope the  foreign  media

will take it in this light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam asked a few questions. Basically, the

point  is:   how  do  we  define  "interference  in  domestic

politics"?  As I mentioned in my speech, the High  Court  had

in  fact  ruled  in  one case against the Asian  Wall  Street

Journal,  and  they  have  said  that  reports  or  editorial

comments  which went beyond what was factual could amount  to

"engaging  in domestic politics", if they were  made  with  a

view  to  espouse  political ideas  or  to  influence  public

opinion.   That is what the High Court said.   If  there  are

cases  which  are  in  doubt as a result  of  the  Minister's

ruling,  they  can  be taken to court and challenged.   Asian

Wall  Street Journal did it and there was a ruling.  The same

thing  applies to other cases.  I also mentioned in my speech

and gave three examples of cases which could be construed  as

interfering in our domestic politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned one case where, for example, the broadcaster

refuses  to  give  us the right of reply.  I  think  that  is

basic.   If  they  have done something wrong,  that  is,  the

report  was twisted or inaccurate, and we demand a  right  of

reply,  they should give it to us.  In fact, the  damage  has

already  been  done  because the wrong  impression  has  been

created.  And some time thereafter, on the same programme our

reply  or,  in  the case of the print media, a  small  column

somewhere  they printed a correction or our reply.   This  is

one instance that the right of reply is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example I gave is where, in fact, money

changed  hands.  There was one recent example where  somebody

was  paid to appear in a programme.  I think where there  are

paid programmes or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>

where  somebody tries to buy political advertising,  that  is

very  clear.   It  is  clearly interfering  in  our  domestic

politics.  As explained in my speech, we will have to look at

the  actual circumstances and decide on a case-by-case basis.

It  is not possible to define in black and white and say this

is  it.   We will have to look at the whole series of events,

the situation, how it is presented.  And then we will have to

be very careful before we take any action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Simon Tay and Dr Lee were concerned about

revoking without giving reasons.  This is the way it has been

drafted by the AG's Chambers.  I think the key point is  that

it  gives us the position of strength.  In other words, it is

something that we decide and it is final.  In actual fact, we

always  explain what we do.  Firstly, we are very careful  in

what  we do.  We do not just take arbitrary action.  We  talk

to the press and tell them, "Look, what are you trying to do?

Please desist from this line of reporting, or give us a right

of  reply."  If they refuse and if there is a build-up,  then

we know that they are trying to be difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every case that has happened in the past where a

newspaper  was  gazetted,  there  was  thorough  explanation.

Pages  of  our newspapers were taken up publishing in  detail

why  we demanded a reply, where were the inaccuracies,  where

they  corrected us.  And it is our intention to continue that

practice,  and explain all our actions, because  we  have  to

justify ourselves to Singaporeans as well as to foreigners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay made the point that this is different from

the  NPPA,  because  the SCV is like a tap,  which  could  be

turned  on and off.  This is not quite right, because we  can

actually  limit  the  number of people who  can  receive  the

particular  channel.  So it is like the newspapers.   In  the

case  of  newspapers, it was limited to so  many  copies  per

year.  In the same way, we can punish the foreign broadcaster

by  limiting  the  number  of people  who  can  receive  that

particular channel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NMP may not be aware of this, but Malaysian TV is

actually available on our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>

SCV.   There  is no payment involved.  In fact, all  our  HDB

flats are receiving the Malaysian channels, because it  is  a

carry-on  of past practice when we switched from broadcasting

over  the  air to doing it through cable.  So the same  rules

will apply to Malaysian TV, even though it is not a dedicated

news channel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way we can punish an errant broadcaster is to

move  him  up to a more expensive tier, for example.   In  an

extreme case, we might just blank it out.  That will be quite

extreme.   If we have to do that, we can do it.  In fact,  if

all  we  want to do is to blank it out, we do not  need  this

Bill.   Because under section 41 of the Act, it gives us  the

power to proscribe broadcasters.  But we want to be seen that

we   are  not  preventing  the  flow  of  information.    The

particular section 41 has certain requirements.  It  must  be

because  of moral reasons, public order and so on.   This  is

more  specific.   This is on the basis that broadcasters  are

here  to  do business.  They want to have subscribers.   They

want  to  have advertisements.   And so long as they play  by

our rules and do not interfere in our politics, everybody  is

happy.    But   if  they  consistently  try  to  damage   our

institutions and cast a slur on our courts, for example, then

we have to take action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked whether we should have a committee

to advise us on this matter.  I do not think it is necessary,

because the civil servants who are administering this Act are

extremely  careful.  The people in the Ministry with  whom  I

work  with are most conscious of their mission, which  is  to

promote  Singapore  as a media hub, and  they  will  be  very

reluctant  to  take any action unless it is very  clear  that

something has been transgressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have answered most of the points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister by way of

clarification, if you will permit me, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On this right to reply the Government is

so concerned about,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>

does  the  Government consider that the only right  to  reply

should  be in the paper which published the offending article

or  the  broadcasting  media which  broadcast  the  offending

article or piece?  Has the Government not got the full  array

of  the Singapore press?  Have you not got the full array  of

the  Singapore TV and radio to give your reply?  Is that  not

good enough?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think it is only fair and right

that  if a broadcaster makes a mistake, he should be prepared

to  present  the opposing view and make a correction  in  the

same  media in which the mistake was made.  I think it  is  a

principle of natural justice surely.   Why should we have  to

go  and  buy  advertisements or use our own  media?   We  are

reaching a different audience.  I think even if you  talk  to

the media from the west, they will espouse our principle.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> A clarification, Sir. Can I understand

from  the  Minister that his policy in implementing this  law

would be, first, to seek a right of reply; second, to explain

and  justify;  and,  third,  that  he  would  tend  to  limit

viewership, rather than a full black-out.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Yes. I think the right of reply is

very  important, but sometimes there may not be time.  If  it

is during the election, we may reply but by then the election

is  over.   So we have to take quite fast action.  Otherwise,

the intention is to study carefully, talk to the press or the

offending party, check what they are doing, understand  their

real  reason and have a reply, see whether there is a  trend,

and  do  the  minimum  necessary.  We do  not  want  to  hurt

ourselves in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill.  -  [Mr Lee Yock Suan].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>3.55 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill proposes amendments to the Parliamentary

Elections Act to provide for overseas and electronic  voting.

It also specifies a vote recount margin and restricts the use

of  the  register of electors.  I will deal with each one  of

them in turn.

<br><br><i>Overseas voting</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas Singaporeans are spread out in many countries.

The  number  is  not large, compared to the  total  Singapore

population.   Based on the 1997 General Elections statistics,

the  Elections Department estimates that in a fully contested

election, about 43,000 electors, or slightly more than 2%  of

the  electorate, are likely to be resident abroad.  Our sense

is  that the number of overseas Singaporeans of voting age is

probably higher, as some of them may not have restored  their

names on the register over the years, and some have come home

to  vote.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has estimated that

the current number of Singaporeans overseas is about 100,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that more and more

Singaporeans  will  work  and study  overseas  with  economic

globalisation.  Therefore, the Government has decided to  try

out  overseas  voting in a limited way at  the  next  general

elections  if  all  the preparations and  procedures  can  be

completed  on  time.   This  will  allow  us  to  gain   some

experience,  and we can then consider doing it  on  a  larger

scale later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, overseas voting will be carried out at our

Missions   in  Beijing,  Canberra,  Hong  Kong,  London   and

Washington.   These  Missions  are  chosen  because  of   the

significant   number  of  Singaporeans   living   in   China,

Australia,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>

Hong  Kong, Europe and America, and the Missions have  enough

staff to conduct the elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the eligibility for overseas

voting.   Under the current election laws, only  Singaporeans

who  are  "ordinarily resident" in Singapore can  vote.   The

term  "ordinarily resident" is not explicitly defined in  the

Act.    Strictly  interpreted,  a  Singaporean  who  is   not

"ordinarily  resident in Singapore" will not  be  allowed  to

register  to  vote.  To enable them to vote overseas,  it  is

therefore  necessary to expand the definition of  "ordinarily

resident".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are various ways "residence" is defined

in  our  statutes.  For example, for income tax  purposes,  a

natural person is resident in Singapore if he is in Singapore

for  183  days or more during the year preceding the year  of

assessment.  Under the Women's Charter, the courts would have

jurisdiction over family disputes or to entertain proceedings

for  presumption of death only if one of the parties has been

habitually resident in Singapore for a period of three  years

immediately preceding the institution of the proceedings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 5 of the Parliamentary Elections

Act  to  deem  non-resident  Singaporeans  to  be  ordinarily

resident  in  Singapore and qualified  to  be  registered  as

electors if they have lived in Singapore for an aggregate  of

two  years  within five years of their registration  to  vote

overseas.   The five-year period corresponds to the statutory

maximum  term  of Parliament.  The two years  in  five  years

criterion  will  not, however, apply to  citizens  and  their

families sent by the Government to work or study overseas, as

well as those working in approved international agencies, eg,

the  United  Nations.   Otherwise,  some  of  those  who  are

assigned by the Government on long tours of duty or  sent  by

the  Government  to  study  overseas  will  inadvertently  be

disenfranchised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not uncommon for countries to impose

residential requirements as a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>

condition to register their overseas voters.  New Zealand and

Canada, for example, require their citizens to be out of  the

country for no more than three and five years respectively to

be  eligible  to  vote overseas.  For both  countries,  their

residential requirements also do not apply to the  government

officials  and their dependants.  There are other  countries,

eg,  India  and Israel, which allow only their  diplomats  or

personnel on official assignment overseas to vote overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement of residence is an important one. It

is  a  necessary pre-condition to constituency representation

and  to  prevent plural voting, which is a form of  electoral

fraud.   Our  parliamentary  elections  are  conducted  on  a

constituency  basis.   The poll is conducted  and  the  votes

counted   for  each  constituency.   Therefore,  a  citizen's

residence in Singapore affords the basis for allotting him to

a   particular  constituency  to  vote  during  an  election.

Secondly,  without  allocating  a  constituency  based  on  a

citizen's residence, a citizen can easily vote more than once

at  any  election  and not being detected.   This  is  plural

voting.   Thus, residence is and must be retained as  a  pre-condition to vote.  The amendments effect a relaxation  in  a

manner that will not allow plural voting to take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new law deems certain groups of overseas

citizens  to be ordinarily resident in Singapore.  These  are

citizens  who  are  likely  to  have  intentions  to   resume

residence  in  Singapore.  Hence the amendments provide  them

the facility of voting outside Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voters' constituency is based on the records on the

Electoral  Register,  which  in  turn  is  derived  from  the

register   maintained   by  the  Commissioner   of   National

Registration.   Those  overseas  Singaporeans  who   do   not

maintain  a  local address with the Commissioner of  National

Registration will not have their names entered or retained on

the  Electoral  Register as they cannot be allocated  to  any

particular  electoral division using their  foreign  address.

In order for an overseas citizen to retain a Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>

address  on  the register, the National Registration  Act  is

also  amended so that citizen can either use the  address  of

one  of  his  local  residential  properties,  or  the  local

residential address of any family member or relative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reasonable to expect a Singaporean overseas to

register  a  residential address which he still owns  or  has

some links with, and for this address to be used as the basis

for  determining the constituency he belongs to.  If we allow

him  to  register, say, his last known address,  but  he  has

already  sold  the property, then his elector status  can  be

objected  to or challenged by the current occupants  at  that

address,   when   the  register  is  open   for   inspection.

Therefore,  the  provision for the  person  to  register  the

address  of  a  relative enables him to have  an  address  in

Singapore for voting purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to prevent vote manipulation, we require the

residential  address  to belong to his own  property  or  his

relative's and not, say, his friend's.  Allowing an  overseas

Singaporean  to  register  his  friend's  address  with   the

National  Register will mean that  he can  use  any  person's

address  as his local address, since it is difficult,  if  at

all  impossible,  to  define "friends".   This  can  then  be

exploited as a loophole to manipulate votes.  For example,  a

candidate  can ask all his "friends" overseas to register  an

address  in  the  constituency  he  is  contesting  as  their

Singapore address.  In a very closely contested constituency,

the  overseas votes from these "friends" may just be able  to

change the outcome of that election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the qualifying criterion, clause 4 amends

section 6 to disqualify a non-resident from voting if  he  is

in a foreign jail or has a Singapore warrant of arrest issued

on him for an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term

exceeding 12 months.  Those in foreign jails are excluded for

obvious  reasons.   Fugitives  of  justice  should  also   be

excluded because they are running away from Singapore law.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electors who wish to vote overseas will have to pre-register at the Elections Department or one of our overseas

missions.   This  will  allow  the  Elections  Department  to

determine  and  prepare  the required  resources.   Clause  7

amends  section  10  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of

overseas registration centres in any Singapore embassy,  High

Commission, diplomatic mission or consulate, while  clause  9

inserts  a new section 13A that provides for the registration

of  overseas electors.  The registration for overseas  voting

will be open at our missions at the same time as the register

is  open  for inspection in Singapore.  The registration  for

overseas  voting will be open for 21 days, 7 more  days  than

the 14 days given to the electors in Singapore to inspect the

register.   This  is because the overseas electors  may  need

more  time  to be informed of the registration  and  to  come

forward to register at the missions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 inserts a new section 36A providing for the

establishment  of overseas polling stations in any  Singapore

embassy,  High  Commission, diplomatic mission or  consulate,

while  clause  16 inserts a new section 39A that  deals  with

voting by overseas electors.  Overseas voting will be held as

close as the polling day in Singapore as possible.  This  can

be  held before the poll opens in Singapore but must close no

later than the close of poll in Singapore.  For example,  for

the  voting at our London Mission, it will only be noon there

when  the  poll  closes at 8.00 pm in Singapore.   Hence,  to

provide  the voters there with sufficient time to cast  their

votes,  and yet have the poll closed no later than the  close

of  poll in Singapore, we will likely have to hold the voting

there one day earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 21 inserts a new section 49A which provides

10  days  for the overseas votes to be returned to Singapore.

Overseas  votes  will be counted as soon  as  is  practicable

after  they  arrive in Singapore.  However,  if  the  winning

margin, based on the local votes counted, is higher than  the

total overseas votes for a particular constituency, then  the

winner  will  be declared on polling night.  For example,  if

the difference in votes between the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>

winning  and  losing  candidates in a constituency  is,  say,

1,000, and there is only a total of 500 overseas electors for

that  constituency,  the  winning  candidate  will  still  be

declared  as  the  winner  for the  election  since  the  500

overseas  votes do not affect the poll result  in  Singapore.

However,  overseas votes will still be counted, and added  to

the local votes and subsequently published in the Gazette.

<br><br><i>Electronic Voting</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me move on to electronic voting. Singapore

now  uses  a  paper ballot voting system for the General  and

Presidential  Elections.  The system is  manpower  intensive,

and   the   Elections   Department   anticipates   increasing

difficulty  in getting public officers to serve  as  election

staff,  especially given the trend of public service agencies

being  corporatised.  We should now also  take  advantage  of

technological  advances.  More people are now  familiar  with

electronic  devices,  such  as  computers,  automatic  teller

machines (ATMs), etc.  Many also use the ATMs to top up their

cash  cards  and even subscribe to IPO shares  and  use  Nets

terminals to perform all kinds of transactions such as paying

for goods at supermarkets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided that it is time to

make  provisions  for  electronic voting  in  our  elections.

Elections Department is currently developing the system.   If

it  can  be ready before the next General Elections, we  will

try  it  out on a limited scale.  The trials will allow  both

the  voters  and  the election officials to  learn  from  the

experience before making its use universal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, electronic voting is not new. Countries which have

used electronic devices either for voting or for counting  of

votes  include  the United States, Belgium,  Netherlands  and

Brazil.   The United Kingdom also tried out various forms  of

electronic voting and counting at its local elections in  May

last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, I led a team to look at the electronic

voting systems used in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>

Belgium, Netherlands and the United States.  Both Belgium and

the  Netherlands use  touch screen voting systems running  on

personal  computers, Belgium since 1991 and  the  Netherlands

since  1998.   Essentially,  the voters  make  their  choices

either  by touching the screen with their finger or  with  an

electronic pen.  In the Netherlands and the US, I saw the use

of  dedicated  voting machines, where the voters  make  their

choices  on  a panel.  I also saw the use of punch  card  and

mark  sense  ballot papers for voting, where the ballots  can

then be counted electronically by machines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the different systems, we have selected

the personal computer- based touch screen system for our use.

It  is  fast and convenient to use.  The computers and  touch

screen monitors can also be used for other purposes after the

election,   so  that  there  is  no  problem  with   storage,

maintenance   and  system  obsolescence  between   elections.

Obsolescence is a common problem which the election officials

in the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands highlighted

to  us  during  our  October trip last  year.   This  is  not

surprising, given the speed at which technology is  changing.

For  example, we were told by one of our US hosts  that  they

have  difficulties maintaining the voting machines they  have

used  for  more than 10  years, as the company which supplied

the  machines has closed down.  Such a problem will not occur

if the voting system is only in the form of software, and the

hardware can be used for other purposes after each election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 22 inserts new sections 50A to 50D relating to

the  use of electronic voting systems, which are referred  to

as  direct recording electronic (DRE) voting systems  in  the

Bill.   Before  its  use, the DRE voting  system  has  to  be

scrutinised and approved by the Auditor-General or  a  person

appointed  by the Minister in consultation with the  Auditor-General, before the issue of the writ.  Approval is  also  to

be  given  after  conducting  such  necessary  tests  in  the

presence of the Returning Officer and such representatives of

any political party who wish to be present.  The criteria for

the approval

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>

process  are also stipulated in the new section  50A.   These

include the need for the votes to be cast in secrecy and  for

sufficient  audit  trails  to be available  for  verification

purposes.  The audit trails are necessary to prevent election

fraud,  and  are no different from what we are already  doing

for  the  paper  ballot  system.  The new  section  50B  also

provides  for the auditors to conduct pre-poll inspection  of

the  DRE  voting machines which will be used on polling  day.

This  will  be  done in the view of the candidates  or  their

polling  agents  who are present.  After the inspection,  the

machines  will be sealed and stored at a secure place  before

being taken out on polling day.  At the polling station,  the

presiding  officer  will have to ensure that  the  electronic

voting  equipment are still sealed and secured  against  use.

The  seals will be broken in the view of those in the polling

station, before the machines are put to use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the event of a system failure, there will be

technical  staff  on  standby  to  attend  to  the  machines.

However,  in  the  unlikely event of a total system  failure,

then  voting will be halted.  It can resume at a  later  time

using either ballot papers or the same DRE voting system.  It

can also be adjourned and conducted afresh another day within

a   week.   For  the  trial  at  the  coming  elections,  the

conventional  paper  ballot will be the backup.   To  prevent

potential  disruptions  caused  by  power  failure,   polling

stations  using the electronic voting system will  also  have

backup  power  generators.  Under the new  section  50A,  the

electronic  voting system must be able to  maintain  all  the

voting data stored regardless of power surges or outages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the voters' perspective, I would like to

emphasise that there is no change in the voting process  with

electronic voting.  Only the medium would be different.   For

example,  the  making of a choice on the touch screen  is  no

different from the current marking of the ballot paper.   The

confirming  of  the  choice  on  the  screen  is  similar  to

depositing the marked ballot paper into the ballot  box.   To

provide for greater familiarity, it is stated in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>

new section 50D that the ballot image on the screen will have

to  be the same format as the ballot paper.  The section also

provides  the Minister with the power to make regulations  to

modify  the current election processes into electronic  form.

This is necessary as most of the current processes spelt  out

in  the law are paper-based.  For example, to allow the votes

to  be  counted  electronically, we will  need  to  make  the

appropriate regulations to provide for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard against hacking, there will be no online

link  between  the  voting machines and the counting  centre.

The  DRE  voting machines will only be connected within  each

polling station via a local area network.  For the purpose of

the  trial  at the coming elections, the machines  will  come

with  a   hardcopy receipt feature.  The main purpose  is  to

assure  voters of the accuracy of electronic voting.  If  the

pilot  phase  is successful, the two trial features,  namely,

the  hardcopy  receipts  and  paper  ballot  backup,  may  be

dispensed with in future elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, should the electronic voting system be ready for

use  at  the  next elections, there will be public education,

not   just  for  the  pilot  constituency,  but  the   entire

population   as   well.   Singaporeans  will  have   hands-on

experience  on  demonstration  touch  screens  at   community

premises,  like  community clubs and  neighbourhood  shopping

malls.   There will also be mass publicity through  broadcast

and print media.

<br><br><i>Recount margin</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now, let me turn to the recount margin. Currently,

our  election laws allow one mandatory recount, if  requested

by  the candidate, regardless of vote margin at each counting

place.   The candidate or his election agent can also request

for  a recount at a counting place if he thinks the votes are

too close there, without taking into account the aggregate of

the  votes  for  the whole constituency.   Sir,  this  is  an

anomaly, as the closeness of the votes at the counting  place

level  does not reflect the closeness of the contest for  the

whole

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>

constituency.    For  example,  during   the   1997   General

Elections,  the  votes  at quite a few  of  the  25  counting

centres  in  the Cheng San GRC were recounted as the  margins

were  close.   However, if we look at the aggregated  result,

the  winning  margin was actually 9.6%.  There should  be  no

reason for a recount to be made for such a big margin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address this anomaly, clause 21 inserts a new

section 49B which will allow application only after the votes

in  the  constituency have been counted.  To avoid  frivolous

requests, recounts will only be allowed if the total  winning

margin  is  2%  or  less  of  the total  valid  votes  for  a

constituency.  So using this criterion, Nee Soon  Central  in

1991 and Eunos GRC in 1988 would qualify for recount.  The 2%

margin  will  also  apply  to the  recount  of  the  hardcopy

receipts for the constituencies using the DRE voting system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not unusual to set a margin for the purpose

of  recount.   Malaysian  law, for example,  provides  for  a

mandatory  recount  on application if the difference  between

the  two leading candidates is 2% or less of the total number

of  votes  cast.  In Canada, a recount ordered by a court  on

application  is mandatory only if the margin is 0.1%  of  the

votes  cast  for the federal level elections.  In the  United

States,  the recount margins vary from state to state.   They

range  from 0.1% in Arizona to 5% in Vermont but the majority

of  them  are  1%  or  less,  for  example,  Virginia,  South

Carolina, Montana, Florida and Georgia.  Therefore, Sir,  you

can  see  that the 2% margin proposed in the Bill  is  really

quite generous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States too, Sir, some states also require

the  requesting party to pay a deposit for the recount, which

would  be  returned only if the results are  reversed  or  if

substantial errors are established.  This is something we may

consider doing in future if there is a need.

<br><br><i>Restriction on use of register</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now touch on the restrictions on the use of

the registers of electors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>

Currently, the Parliamentary Elections Act is silent  on  how

the  registers may be used.  Given the information  contained

in  the  registers, there is potential for their  misuse  for

commercial  purposes, or invasion of privacy.  Therefore,  to

protect  the interest of the electors and prevent  abuse,  we

are amending the Act to restrict the use of the registers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 inserts a new section 21A which will allow

political  parties, candidates and their election  agents  to

use  the  records  in  the registers  of  electors  only  for

communicating  with  the  electors.   Use  of   records   for

commercial  purposes will not be allowed.  If the  candidate,

the  election agents or the parties are to disclose any  such

information  to  another person, they can do  so  only  after

obtaining the written acknowledgement of the person  that  he

is bound by the restrictions under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, any other person who obtains information

from  a  register  of  electors cannot  reproduce,  store  or

transmit the information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breach of any of the conditions under the new section is

an  offence  carrying a fine of up to $1,000 or  imprisonment

for a term of up to six months or both.

<br><br><i>Consequential amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 27 and the Schedule make similar

amendments relating to overseas voting and electronic  voting

in  the Presidential Elections Act.  Amendments are also made

to  the  Political  Donations  Act  to  make  it  clear  that

political parties are permissible donors and to effect  other

technical amendments to clarify provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the overseas and electronic voting proposals that I

have  presented  today are significant  steps  taken  by  the

Government to ensure that our electoral processes  move  with

the  times.   The other amendments are practical  changes  to

fine-tune  the current electoral processes and  to  safeguard

voter privacy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in

support  of the Bill.  This Bill seeks to extend the vote  to

Singaporeans  overseas  and  also  to  introduce   into   our

electoral system the electronic vote.  Both measures that the

Minister  has  mentioned may be said to be a  recognition  of

globalisation  (which means that more and  more  Singaporeans

are  going  abroad  to  work and study) and  the  Information

Technology  society (which requires all of us to be  familiar

with the use of computers).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the simple act of voting is central to our system

of  Government.   It  is the foundation on  which  legitimate

government  in  Singapore is based.  While voting  is  not  a

constitutional  right, it is nonetheless a strong  symbol  of

citizenship,  a mark of belonging - a privilege limited  only

to  those  who are citizens of a certain age.  It is  also  a

duty,  as voting is compulsory.  Many vote not because it  is

compulsory, but because they feel they are discharging  their

duty  to  society.  Yet, voting, as an individual act,  is  a

curious thing.  When one votes, one gets the feeling that  it

may  not  count  for much but one also gets the  satisfaction

that all who vote are engaged in a common venture of the most

important  kind - to elect representatives to the legislature

and, in our system, indirectly, to the executive as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this perspective that I would like to comment

on  the new Bill.  We must be careful that the vote, which is

an  affirmation of belonging to Singapore, should be regarded

as  a cherished privilege, to be taken away only if a citizen

forfeits it through his or her own unacceptable conduct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 9 of the Bill, a new section 13A is

proposed.   This  refers  to  the  registration  of  overseas

electors.   Here, I find a curious distinction between  those

who  are  in  the public sector or Government  scholars,  and

those  who  are  not.  If one is not somehow  in  the  public

sector, one has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>

to  show  a  period  of  two years'  residence  out  of  five

immediately  preceding  the prescribed  date.   This  is  not

required  of the public sector group.  Perhaps, the  Minister

can  explain  why  there is a need for this distinction.   He

mentioned  just now that long-term Government  officers  will

otherwise  be  disenfranchised.  But by the  same  token,  so

would  private Singaporeans working for private organisations

overseas.  So the distinction has to be justified, I believe,

in another way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, any elector wishing to be registered has to

submit proof that he is a citizen over 21 and he has to  make

a  declaration  to  this effect as well.  I  wonder  why  the

declaration  is  necessary.  I am actually more  inclined  to

have  a  would-be overseas elector declare that  he  has  not

acquired  permanent  residence in the  country  where  he  is

currently residing, or that he is not in the process of being

a citizen of that country.  In both these situations, I would

say  that an elector would have by such conduct forfeited the

privilege to vote in a Singapore election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of course a problem, when we have overseas voting,

that  a  person making false declarations or guilty of  other

illegal   practices  would  not  be  subject  to  Singapore's

criminal  law,  as he would be outside the  jurisdiction.   I

would like to ask the Minister what are the possible measures

that could be taken against such persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our law states that voting is compulsory, and if an

eligible  elector does not vote, his name  is  liable  to  be

expunged  from the register until he gives a good reason  for

not  voting.  I should like to know whether overseas electors

would be subject to the same provision.  It may be much  more

difficult  to  vote  overseas due to  distance  or  transport

problems.   Certainly, they would not have  as  many  polling

stations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps, we should look again at the qualifying

conditions  for  overseas  voting and  question  whether  the

distinction that was mentioned between the public sector  and

the private sector be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>

maintained, and consider whether we have put in conditions of

eligibility  which  would  ensure that  serious  voters  with

sufficient concern about what happens in Singapore would  get

to vote, whether they are private or public sector employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn to the electronic voting system. The use of

electronic  devices  for  voting  is  a  step  in  the  right

direction.   It is also a step that many view with suspicion,

perhaps due to a concern that the electronic vote may not  be

as  safe  as  the  good old-fashioned ballot  paper.   Recent

glitches  in  electronic  billing,  for  instance,  may  have

reinforced the feeling of mistrust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the DRE system, I should like to ask the

Minister  to  assure us that the system  is  one  that  would

provide  the  same  level of secrecy  and  security  as  that

present  for the current system of voting through the  ballot

box.   Voters  would want to be reassured  that  their  votes

would  remain  secret,  and that  there  would  not  be  some

electronic  tracking device that would match their identities

to their votes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what steps would then be taken to

not  just  educate the public on how to vote in an electronic

system,  but  also to assure them that the security  features

are  in place to ensure that their vote remains as secret  as

in the case of the paper ballot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill is, as

the   Minister  has  pointed  out,  an  important  piece   of

legislation  that  enables more Singaporeans  to  vote,  even

though they are not physically in Singapore.  This is  to  be

strongly  supported.   As more and more Singaporeans  venture

abroad,  it is important to provide them with the opportunity

to  exercise  this most cherished of privileges, namely,  the

vote.   We  must remain vigilant only against those who  have

left  us  and  wish  us ill but, at the same  time,  we  must

endeavour to allow those legitimate voters who have a  belief

in  Singapore  but who have to work overseas, exercise  their

votes without unduly restricting them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to speak on two

aspects  of  the Bill.  I would like to speak on  (1)  direct

recording  electronic (DRE) voting system, and  (2)  overseas

electors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot support the DRE voting system because the

notice  given  to use such a system is too short.   I  cannot

understand  why  the Government wants to rush  to  pass  this

Bill.   In  other countries, where computers or  machines  to

assist in the voting system are to be used, people there  are

given  a  few  years' warning or notice, unlike in  Singapore

where  the Government is only giving the people a few months'

notice or, at most, slightly more than 12 months' notice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear that the DRE voting system at this point of time

is  still not finalised.  Tenders are being called to fix the

system.   The  Government  itself is  not  confident  of  the

system.   That  is  why  the  Government  does  not  want  to

implement  e-voting in every electoral division but  only  in

selected  ones.  So why the need to rush going  into  the  e-voting  system?   What  I am afraid is  that  the  opposition

constituencies at Hougang and Potong Pasir shall be  selected

as  guinea  pigs for the e-voting system.  If  this  happens,

then  I  say  that  the  Government is being  unfair  to  the

Opposition.   There are so many more PAP-held  constituencies

than  the  Opposition.  Therefore, it is  only  fair  if  PAP

constituencies should first be selected to test  out  the  e-voting system and not the Opposition ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any new computer system, Sir, there are bound to be

teething problems.  I think that the new DRE voting system is

not  going to be an exception.  There shall probably be  some

unforeseen  problems cropping up.  I would  like  to  mention

that  even  in the USA during the last presidential election,

there   were  problems  with  their  machine-assisted  voting

system.   Many  voters in the Florida state  complained  that

they  accidentally punched the wrong hole in the voting card.

The  Supreme Court in America could not help them to  redress

the alleged injustice.  In our case, should there be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>

problems  arising from the use of computers  to  vote,  other

than  the  recounting allowed under the law, I am afraid  the

loser,  if due to the use of computer voting, has very little

chance of redress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not right for the Government to have two

voting  systems  at once in a general election.   It  is  too

early  or premature for the Government to introduce  the  DRE

voting  system.  The Government should be fully  ready,  then

introduce  the e-voting system for every electoral  division,

rather than only selecting a few and leaving the balance with

the  old manual voting system.  It would appear that this  is

part  of  the Government's election strategy.  The Government

has tried the bait of upgrading HDB flats in the last GE, but

failed to win back the two Opposition constituencies.  Now it

is  trying something else - the new electronic voting system.

If this were not so, then the Government should leave out the

Opposition  wards in the e-voting system.  If the  Government

is  unwilling  to introduce the e-voting system  to  all  the

constituencies, then I call on the Government  to  hold  back

the  e-voting system and keep it in abeyance for another four

or  five  years, and only use it at the next general election

after the coming one.  If the Government is unwilling to hold

back  the  introduction of the new e-voting  system,  then  I

would  like to suggest that the Government use a dual  voting

system  at the same time, ie, the use of a DRE voting  system

and  the  manual voting system simultaneously.  With  such  a

dual voting system, a voter is given the choice either to use

the  computer screen or use the ballot paper to vote.   I  am

certain  that Singapore has the technology to put up  such  a

dual voting system.  If this is done, it shall be fair to all

the  candidates, as every candidate shall be having the  same

voting system, albeit a mixed one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of system is fair, especially for the older

voters.   Old  voters are fearful of the computer.   This  is

illustrated by the takeover of the Post Office Savings Bank

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>

by  the  DBS Bank.  After POSBank was taken over by DBS,  the

former bank introduced a lot of the banking work through  the

ATM  booths.  However, the older people still travel  to  the

DBS Bank to deposit and withdraw their money.  Sometimes they

have  to wait in long queues to do so.  That was because they

were illiterate and had the fear of operating the computer at

the ATMs.  They did not make any attempts to learn to operate

the  ATMs.   These same old folks may have the fear  also  of

operating the DRE voting machines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other part of the Bill concerns overseas

electors.  It is only right that Singapore citizens  residing

abroad  should be allowed to exercise their right  to  choose

the Member of Parliament of their choice.  The act of casting

his vote for someone to represent him in Parliament is a very

important  right.  It is only when a citizen has  chosen  his

parliamentary representative that he can have a  say  in  the

affairs  of  his  country,  through  his  representative   in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens who are disqualified from voting are

clearly  spelt out in the Act.  For example, people who  have

not  taken their oath of allegiance or are serving a sentence

of  imprisonment or are of unsound mind, etc, are not allowed

to   vote  in  a  parliamentary  election.   Sir,  I  do  not

understand why the need to curb further a citizen's right  to

vote  for a Member of Parliament by requiring him to stay  an

aggregate  of  two  years during the five  years  immediately

preceding  the  date of gazetting his name in  the  electoral

register  of the next general election.  There is  already  a

law  where  a  Singapore  citizen  cannot  reside  away  from

Singapore for a continuous period of 10 years, failing  which

he  has  to  show  cause why he did not return  to  Singapore

during  that  period  of 10 years.  I think,  as  long  as  a

Singapore citizen has complied with all the laws of the land,

he should be allowed to take part in a parliamentary election

to  vote for a representative of his choice.  That should  be

his  right.   I think it is wrong to make a law  to  curb  or

diminish the right of a Singaporean.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to oppose this

Bill,  particularly on the proposal to introduce  the  direct

recording electronic voting system in Singapore.  But  before

I  speak  on the Bill and the clauses of the Bill on which  I

have  my  reservations, may I say that this Bill shows  again

that this Government gets its priorities wrong.  Why do I say

that the Government gets its priorities wrong?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, elections are the only test for

determining  or showing that the Government of  the  day  has

been  elected fairly and freely by the citizens, and not only

the Government of the day, but the Members of Parliament have

been  elected  freely and fairly by all  citizens.   And  the

claim  to  democracy,  which we are  always  making  in  this

country, can only be sustained if the public, the citizens of

Singapore, repose full confidence in the electoral process of

this   country.   Sadly,  this  confidence  is   lacking   in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I amplify that. In the 1980 general elections, when

I  stood at Telok Blangah, I lost by a mere 500 votes to  the

then  PAP  candidate, Mr Rohan Khamis.  After the votes  were

counted,  the following day when I went around, a  number  of

people  expressed their total disbelief that I  had  lost  in

Telok  Blangah.  And this disbelief was fuelled by  the  fact

that  a  ballot box had been left behind in one of the voting

stations' centres for more than 20 minutes before the bus was

sent  back to pick it up and take it to the counting  centre.

So  I  met a number of residents who said, "How can  this  be

that you lost?  We were all so convinced that you should have

won  this seat."  I know it is easy for you, the PAP Members,

to  laugh and shake your heads, but you have to take  account

of the public perception.  You just cannot shut your ears and

eyes  to  it, like an ostrich, burying your head in the  sand

and saying, "Everything is all right.  We cannot see anything

wrong, can we?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say again that in the 1993 presidential elections

there  was  a  widespread perception that the  candidate,  Mr

Chua,  had really won.  Well, you may again shake your  head,

but  I  have met a number of people who said they  could  not

believe

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>

it,  that  he  had  lost.  And this was again  fuelled,  this

perception  was increased, by the fact that the  announcement

came  some three or four hours after all counting had ceased.

An  attempt  was made to explain this delay in Parliament  by

the  Prime  Minister that the facsimile machines  had  broken

down  or something.  But why the four-hour delay just because

the  two  facsimile machines had broken down?  So, there  was

widespread disbelief in the result of the elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very well for the Government to say it is all

nonsense.   Whether  it  is nonsense  or  not,  a  democratic

Government must take account of the perception of the  people

so  that  they  may  repose the fullest confidence  that  the

electoral  process in their country is fair  and  free,  that

elections are conducted fairly, that the citizens vote freely

without  any  fear or compulsion, and that the  final  result

represents  the choice of the people, not the choice  of  the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1997 elections, again going back to my own

constituency  of  Cheng San, there was  widespread  disbelief

that  we  had lost.  This was again fuelled by the fact  that

there  was  this  long  delay between the  counting  and  the

announcement  of  the results, and by the fact  that  in  one

electoral  district in Cheng San GRC, the  number  of  ballot

papers  that were found in the ballot box exceeded the number

on  the register for that area.  This was recorded by us  and

reported.  There were also other irregularities.  We reported

that  in some cases, we had come across more than one  ballot

paper  folded  together.  That could not have been  possible.

So,  a  number  of people were amazed that we  had  lost  and

wondered what was behind our loss.  You have got to meet that

sort  of  perception  and  assure  them  that  elections  are

conducted  fairly  and  freely.   But  this  lack  of  public

confidence, Sir, stems primarily, if I may say so,  from  the

fact  that the election activity in this country is conducted

by the Government who itself is a party to the election.  How

could that be  -  a party who is taking part in the elections

has  the complete control of the elections as to what can  be

done, what should be done,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>

and  how it should be carried out?  It makes nonsense of  the

rule that any activity must be seen and manifestly seen to be

fair.   And anyone can see, seeing a situation where a  party

itself  to that activity, having the whole power to make  the

rules  and  to run it, it is placed in a greater advantageous

position than the other party or parties taking part in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing is that we have got to take the conduct

of  elections  out  of  the hands of  the  Ministers  of  the

Government.  Incidentally, may I know why is this Bill  being

introduced  by  the  Minister for Home  Affairs?   I  thought

elections  come under the Prime Minister.  I thought  perhaps

the  Prime Minister was away, out of the country, but  I  see

him sitting here.  So I do not know why it has been handed to

the  Home Affairs Minister to introduce this Bill.  Is it not

the responsibility of the Prime Minister to explain this Bill

and to answer Members of Parliament on it, unless tomorrow it

is  going  to  be announced that the Elections Department  is

going  to be put under the Ministry of Home Affairs?   May  I

say  that it is a matter to be regretted very much.   Do  not

rise to it, Mr Wong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, this lack of confidence stems from the previous

announcements by the Government that it will know how  voters

have  voted  and  they do it deliberately,  taking  steps  to

ensure that they do know.  So in the 1997 elections, for  the

first  time,  we had precinct voting of five  or  six  blocks

together, so that the Government may know how the voting  had

gone,  whether there was a preponderance of Opposition voters

or  PAP  voters.  If there was a preponderance of  Opposition

voters  in  that precinct, no upgrading, all benefits  to  be

withdrawn  from them.  How could you inspire confidence  when

there  is this fierce determination to win elections  at  any

cost by the Government?  This was again demonstrated in Cheng

San  with the Prime Minister coming to the constituency,  and

in  his  eve of poll rally intimidating the voters.   It  was

nothing  short  of  that.  It was pure  intimidation  of  the

voters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason for this lack of public confidence is

that  the  public  cannot place very  much  reliance  on  the

integrity and impartiality of the election officials.  When I

mentioned this at the briefing two days ago, all the Minister

for  Home  Affairs could say was, "Well, you take it  to  the

court."   That  is  no answer.  Again, this impartiality  and

lack  of  integrity on the part of officials was demonstrated

in Cheng San GRC.  I myself made a complaint to the Assistant

Returning  Officer at a particular voting station  about  the

presence  of the Deputy Prime Minister in that station.   All

he could say was, "All right, you write it out."  We wrote it

out but nothing was done.  Then the Prime Minister turned up,

nothing was done.  The officer did not have the power or  the

strength  to  tell  the Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Prime

Minister, "Please leave."  So how can you place any  reliance

on  the  integrity  and impartiality of  election  officials?

These  are the things that we must look into, not race  along

and  bring  in electronic voting because we want to  keep  up

with the times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not got very much time, so I must move on. May I

say  that this lack of public confidence also stems from  the

fact that, unlike other countries, we do not have any NGOs in

this  country  to monitor and act as election  watch  on  the

conduct of elections in this country.  In the Philippines and

other  countries, there are these groups but,  in  Singapore,

there  is  nothing.   May I move on?  I  see  Mr  Speaker  is

looking at his time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just move on to the DRE voting? As Mr Chiam has

said,  may I ask what is the burning need to introduce direct

recording   electronic  voting?   Just  because  some   other

countries have introduced it, it does not necessarily  follow

that  we should also have it.  After all, how many voters  do

we  have?   Less  than two million. What  is  the  saving  in

introducing  this?   Is it time?  From what  I  saw  at  this

briefing, I think more time would be taken up with the direct

recording  electronic  voting than  in  the  straight  ballot

voting.   I  then mentioned what Mr Chiam said about  elderly

people  having trouble and I was laughed at.  But it involves

officials going

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>

to  advise them, showing them how to use the machine.  Again,

can  one  trust  the impartiality and integrity  of  election

officials?   Could the Minister tell us what is  the  burning

urgency to introduce the DRE voting system in this country?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take a GRC constituency, how many voters do you

have?   100,000  or more.  In Cheng San, it  was  only  about

100,000  and it was supposed to be a big GRC.  How long  will

it  take  to  count 100,000 votes?  It will only  take  three

hours,  as  it did at Cheng San.  What is the big deal  about

this  electronic  counting?  What is most  important  is  not

speed, but to see that everything that is done is done fairly

and  justly.  That is far more important than speed.   May  I

commend that to the Government.  The Government prides itself

on  its  efficacy and efficiency.  Some think it is  far  too

efficient.  It does not take into account human factors.   It

does  not  take into account the feelings of people.   It  is

only  concerned  with  efficiency, like a  ruthless  machine,

regardless of the suffering or inconvenience caused.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, about the fear of being found out, more than one

speaker  has  mentioned about the fear in  people  that  with

electronic voting, it only increases the possibility of their

votes being known, even before they are counted.  How are you

going to assuage this fear?  By simply telling them, "No,  we

won't  do  it.  You can trust us."  That is not good  enough.

You  have  got  to  hand it over to an independent  elections

commission.   Election officials must  be  recruited  by  the

commission from outside.  Then people might say, "All  right,

we  can  see that it is going to be conducted by a completely

independent  commission."  And there will be NGOs  monitoring

the  elections.   Then we can see openly that  our  electoral

process  is  fair  and free.  So my serious  advice  to  this

Government is:  do things that are necessary and important to

restore public confidence in the electoral system, and do not

rush into electronic voting because it is modern or it is  to

keep up with the times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the voter strength must be running into 50-60

million or more.  Here,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>

it  is  less than 2 million.  In India, they are planning  to

introduce  it.  But what is the voter strength  there?   Does

the  Singapore  voter  strength have any  comparison  to  the

Indian voter strength?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I say a few words about the overseas voters?

As  has  been mentioned, it seems to me an exercise to garner

more PAP votes.  Why, as has been asked, this discrimination?

You  exclude people who are living outside Singapore, but who

are just as much concerned about Singapore, just because they

have  not  lived  here for two years during  the  five  years

preceding.  But you open it to all those who are in some  way

obligated  to  the Government.  Of course, these  people  are

obligated  to  the Government.  They feel that  it  is  their

national  duty to vote for the Government.  So,  is  this  an

attempt  to  increase  the PAP vote,  and  to  see  that  the

Opposition suffers as a result of it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I mention a case in point, my own son who is in

London?  Why is he in London?  Because he cannot get a job in

Singapore.   Why can he not get a job in Singapore?   Because

he  has got my name.  He is an economist.  The MAS would  not

give  him  a  job, and the banks are worried about  employing

him.   So  he  cannot  get a job here.  And  he  cannot  vote

because he has not been here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is Mr Ho Juan Thai. He has been living in London.

He  cannot vote, but he is just as much concerned about  what

goes on in Singapore, as any other Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why are you discriminating? Is it, as I said, to

see that only those who will vote for the PAP are allowed  to

vote?    I  would  ask  the  Minister  to  refer  this  Bill,

particularly  because of the introduction of the  DRE  voting

system, to a Select Committee.  As Mr Chiam has said, let the

public  get  more acquainted with this.  Let the  public  air

their  views about the introduction of the DRE voting system,

whether  they have any fears.  And this will be  possible  if

you  refer this Bill to a Select Committee which will  invite

representations.  It is good sometimes to let the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>

public  have  their  say.   We  get,  time  and  time  again,

Government  Ministers saying, "Speak up, speak  up.   Let  us

know  what  you  think."  But you have got to  give  them  an

opportunity.  And you give them an opportunity, on Bills like

this  which  concern a very important activity of  them,   to

come  and say what they think about it, what they think about

how  elections are being conducted in this country.  Do  they

have  full confidence in our electoral process?  So,  please,

do  not  be  in  a  hurry to introduce this Bill.   The  next

elections may be just months ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing. Why is this kept secret?

Please  do  not laugh.  You know, Canon Adams,  who  was  the

principal of St. Andrew's School when I was there, said  that

people  sometimes laugh just because they are nervous.   They

do  not  know  what  to do.  So they burst  into  involuntary

laughter.   So please refer this Bill to a Select  Committee.

But, more importantly, if you want the world to say that  the

elections  in Singapore are conducted fairly and freely,  and

more  than the world, if you want our people to say  that  in

Singapore  the elections are conducted fairly and freely  and

we can repose the full confidence, please proceed immediately

to appoint an independent elections commission, and hand over

the  conduct  of  the  elections to  a  totally  independent,

neutral  body, which will hold the scales firmly between  the

Government party and the Opposition parties.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of this Bill.  But before I proceed to speak  on  one

or  two  points,  I  just  want to  respond  to  one  or  two

particular comments Mr Jeyaretnam has made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly troubled that he has chosen to make

sweeping   statements   that   impugn   the   integrity   and

impartiality  of  the public officials.  I think  it  is  one

thing  to  take offence or have issue with a process  or  the

legitimacy or merits of an argument.  But I think it is quite

another

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>

to  cast  such fundamental doubt on all officials in sweeping

statements.  And I am particularly concerned by this because,

as  an ex-civil servant, I have been involved in the election

process as a Returning Officer.  I know how seriously we took

the  process.   The import of the process was impressed  upon

us,  and  we  discharged it to the best of our  ability.   It

would  appear, by Mr Jeyaretnam's reckoning, the only  way  a

public   official  could  prove  his  impartiality   was   to

facilitate an Opposition victory.  Sir, I would hope that  we

could be somewhat more measured when we make comments on such

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Bill itself, I wish to just focus on two key

points.   The first is on overseas voting.  It is clear  that

the  Bill seeks to strike a balance between, on the one hand,

endowing a very basic privilege of voting on Singaporeans who

reside  overseas  and, on the other hand, the need to  assure

ourselves  that  there  is a certain stake  in  the  country,

emotionally,  perhaps materially, so that they  do  not  take

this  privilege frivolously.  In that sense, I think the Bill

has  made  a  good attempt.  But there are some who  ask  the

question,  "Why  not extend the vote to all Singaporeans  who

reside  overseas,  other than those who,  by  their  conduct,

criminal  and  otherwise, may have excluded themselves?"   In

other  words,  why  not  just let  citizenship  be  the  only

criterion for voting?  And there are sufficient, in a  sense,

administrative   hurdles  that  the  individual   Singaporean

overseas  has  to overcome, in terms of maintaining  a  local

address,   in  terms  of  registering  at  various   overseas

registration centres within 21 days, and also the  fact  that

in  many  places, these centres are in main cities.  So  they

may  have to make a special effort to do so, given that there

is  a  significant effort involved before a person can become

an overseas voter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I think there is merit to argue a case

that  we should assure ourselves that there is something more

than  just the effort to vote, that there is a desire  and  a

stake  in  the  outcome of the election.  In that  regard,  I

think the criteria that have been outlined are generally self-evident.  But like Prof. Chin

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>

who spoke earlier, it appears to introduce dual standards, on

the  one hand, for those who are agents of the public service

who  are  overseas, whether it is for educational reasons  or

for reasons of service or deployment, and, on the other hand,

those  who  are in the private sector who have to demonstrate

this  aggregate two-year residence out of the preceding  five

years before they are eligible to vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since Prof. Chin has made all the points, I just

want  to illustrate one example.  If we take students who  go

overseas  to  do their post graduate programmes,  it  is  not

unusual for those doing a PhD to spend 4-5 years on a PhD and

post-doctoral  work.   And it would  be  difficult  for  such

individuals to come back and satisfy this two-year  aggregate

residence requirement.  Yet, I think we would be hard pressed

to  doubt  their  commitment to Singapore  because,  in  many

instances, they would be funded by their parents and I  think

many  of  them  would want to come back and  discharge  their

financial as well as their familial obligations.  So I  would

hope  that we could consider these cases and, in that regard,

whether  the  two-year  requirement is rather  stringent  and

whether it can actually be lowered or moderated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of electronic voting, the comment I

wish to make is that Singaporeans are used to our paper-based

system.   It is a tried and tested process which Singaporeans

understand  and have confidence in.  We are making  a  change

and we can debate the merits of the change, etc.  But I think

the  key  point here is that it will raise some questions  in

the  minds  of  voters,  in  particular,  pertaining  to  the

security and secrecy of the data, in this case, the vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, electronic systems have shown that they are not

free   of   glitches.    And  also  to   many   Singaporeans,

particularly  the older groups, a computer or any  electronic

device  is  really a black box, a box that they do not  fully

understand  and  they  therefore  have  some  difficulty   in

mustering confidence in.  This is probably analogous  to  why

many people still have problems with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>

not   just   using   Internet   banking   or   Internet-based

transactions,    but   even   registering   for    Giro-based

transactions.   So it would be useful if the  Minister  could

elaborate  how  we are going to be able to  ensure  that  our

voters  are confident, not just familiar with  -   using  the

parlance of manufacturing  -  the front-end system of how  to

do  the  vote,  but also where we can engender confidence  in

them  in  the  back-end system, in terms of its security  and

secrecy, so that they can accept the new system with ease and

with peace of mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, because of the regional economic  development,

there  are now more than 100,000 Singaporeans who are staying

overseas on a long-term basis to work or to do business.   At

the  general  election which is held once every  five  years,

they still have the right to exercise their voting rights and

to  elect  the  Member  of Parliament who  they  think  could

represent them.  I think it is a good suggestion that   these

Singapore citizens be allowed to vote overseas, and I support

this Bill.  However, I have a few suggestions to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Singapore is a small country. The polling

stations are normally set up not too far away from home,  and

transportation is very convenient in Singapore.  However,  if

you stay overseas, it is not so easy.  For example, in China,

there  are 36 provinces.  If we have only one polling station

in  Beijing, those Singapore citizens who are staying in  the

other provinces may have to spend a few days' time to take  a

plane,  a  train or even to drive a long distance  to  go  to

Beijing to cast their votes.  They will have to spend  a  lot

of time and money just to cast their votes.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.17 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this new Bill, overseas voting is not

mandatory.   Because  of  the  inconvenience,  some  overseas

Singapore citizens who are eligible to vote may

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>

simply  give up their rights to do so.  Therefore, I  suggest

that  the  Government consider making it easier for  them  to

vote,  for example, voting through the mail.  The voters  can

then  save  a  lot  of time and money.   In  this  way,  many

Singaporeans who are staying overseas would be able  to  vote

at the general election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some overseas Singapore citizens could have

been staying away from Singapore for many years. They may not

be  familiar with the background and the curriculum vitae  of

the  candidates,  particularly when the  new  candidates  are

normally  introduced only shortly before  the  election.   In

this way, can the Government facilitate these candidates with

some means to communicate with their voters?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Government let the candidates have

access  to  the correspondence addresses of these  voters  so

that  the candidates can introduce themselves and their plans

they  have  for their constituencies, to these voters.   This

would  also  help  the overseas voters make  some  considered

decision  to  elect  the best person  to  represent  them  in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to electronic voting, I would say that this

system  is a product of high technology.  It will save  time,

save manpower and provide accurate calculations.  However, on

its operation, I have two points to ask of the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that we have to be ever ready for any

eventuality.  On election day, in the event of a breakdown or

failure  of  the  electronic voting system in any  particular

constituency, does the Returning Officer have the  discretion

to  switch  back  to the traditional voting  method  so  that

voting  can be completed in the same day?   According to  the

Bill,  under the circumstances, the voting in that particular

constituency  can  be postponed until a few  days  later.   I

think  this  is  not fair because the results  of  the  other

constituencies  may  affect  the original  decisions  of  the

voters in this constituency. Therefore, I suggest that in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>

event  of a failure in the electronic voting system  on  that

day  and  it could not be rectified in time, we should  allow

the voters to use the traditional voting method, so that they

can  complete all the voting within that day.  But I  do  not

agree  with  Mr  Chiam See Tong's proposal to use  electronic

voting and the traditional paper voting simultaneously.  This

will only cause confusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this new concept of electronic voting will be

strongly  supported by the young people and  those  who  have

knowledge of computers.  But to the older people or for those

who  have  absolutely  no knowledge of computer  usage,  they

would  have  some  psychological barrier and  fear  for  this

electronic   voting.   So,  before  we  implement  electronic

voting,   the   Government   should   educate   the   voters,

particularly the senior citizens, so that everyone  would  be

familiar  and know how to use this electronic voting  system.

This  will alleviate or remove their fear for such a  system,

and will reduce the number of blank votes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the electronic voting system can be

implemented smoothly during the general election, I think the

Government  should  make  some early  announcement  on  which

constituencies would adopt this electronic voting system,  so

that  the  voters  there  can  be  psychologically  prepared.

However,  I  hope  that the Government will not  pick  Potong

Pasir  as one of these constituencies so that Mr Chiam  would

not be so unduly worried.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I participated in the simulated

electronic  voting exercise, and I found  that  it  was  very

simple   and  easy  to  use.   We  should  help  the  voters,

especially  the  senior citizens.  Let them have  a  hands-on

experience  before  the actual voting.  This  will  build  up

their  confidence  and  ensure that  this  electronic  voting

system will be more effective and  convenient to our voters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I will limit myself to comments on the Bill

rather than to elections or, more generally, democracy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to say, in my view, that voting is

not  a  privilege for Singaporean citizens.  It is clearly  a

right.  Even if it is not in the Constitution itself, because

we  uphold  the idea of a voting democracy, it  is  a  right.

Secondly, I would also say it is a duty, because in Singapore

if  you  do not vote, you have to explain yourself or  pay  a

fine.  So it is a right and a duty, and not a privilege.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Bill, I would, first, very strongly

welcome the move towards overseas voting.  This is an  effort

really  that  symbolises a transformation in  thinking  about

Singapore  and who are fully Singaporeans.  We have  come  to

recognise  that globalisation and our own attempts to  engage

with  the international economy require Singaporeans to work,

study  and  live abroad.  If 10 or 15 years ago, Singaporeans

who  lived  abroad somehow were less-Singaporeans,  I  think,

today  increasingly, we see that we are linked to  them.   In

some  ways they help us and they are part of those  who  live

here.   And  I think this is a profoundly important  gesture,

given   what  we  have  said  in  Singapore  21  about   also

encouraging  Singaporeans to work abroad, and yet  to  remain

Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question then I have heard in this House is really a

question of "how".  How do we qualify people?  And, then, how

do   we   reach   out  to  them?   In  thinking   about   the

qualifications  of who abroad should be allowed  to  vote,  I

think  an  important premise, first, is  Article  12  of  the

Constitution.  This promises an equality among people.   This

equality  is not absolute but must be rational and linked  to

an  objective.  As others have said, the rationale here is to

make  sure that those abroad who vote are those who have some

connection  and  stake here.  I do not want to  quarrel  then

about this two-out-of-five years criterion, or whatever.  But

I  do share the concern that an exception is made to the rule

for those who are in Government service.  We can see that the

line  between them and other Singaporeans overseas is narrow.

Singapore  Airlines  is  clearly,  in  sentiment,   part   of

Singapore.  If you have to serve as an SIA Station Manager or

whatever for more than three years out of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>

five,  I  will  be  at a loss to explain to  somebody  why  a

Singapore Airlines' Station Manager could not vote when he is

serving  Singapore, in that sense, abroad.  But yet,  because

it  is  a GLC and not a Singapore Government statutory board,

he  would  not  qualify.  So I think we need  to  think  this

through  and perhaps expand it to include all Singapore-based

companies  and  perhaps even multi-nationals here,  which  do

business  in  Singapore and find it invaluable  to  take  our

Singaporeans abroad with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the reverse side, I think we should be very open, in

fact, about disallowing Singaporeans with permanent residency

in  other  countries and dual citizenship.  We  have  already

talked  about  this  in  a previous Bill  about  leaving  the

engagement of Singapore politics to Singaporeans, and I think

we  should  equally  be frank that if you are  a  Singaporean

citizen  but  have  decided  to formally  take  up  permanent

residence abroad or dual citizenship, which our laws  do  not

recognise, we should say this would not do for voting.   With

these two ideas, I agree with the idea that we need some pre-qualification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is the effort of how to reach out. If

I  am  correct  -  I  stand  for correction  here  -  in  the

Minister's preparatory remarks, but not in the Bill, there is

a  sense that we will apply this overseas voting only to some

embassies   abroad   where  there   are   concentrations   of

Singaporeans and our embassy staff are sufficient to  support

this.  At first glance, this makes some sense.  But with this

idea  of equality, one may come back and say, "Well, how come

if I choose to be in Finland, I am unequal to somebody who is

in Australia?"  Secondly, looking at all things practical, we

must  recognise that there are limitations.  Even if you have

an embassy in Canberra, this does not make it easier to reach

out  to  people in Sydney.  We have an embassy in Washington,

but you could be in Seattle, which is half way home already.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in all these processes of how to reach out, I think

we have to come to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>

idea  that  beyond actually turning up at the embassy,  there

has  to  be an idea of some verified form of voting by  mail.

And if this is done for big countries, there is no reason why

it  cannot be done in smaller countries allover the world, so

all those Singaporeans who are dispersed in small communities

abroad  might also be allowed to vote (provided,  of  course,

they pass the other qualification of who can vote).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to bring up about voting

overseas  is - perhaps because I do not understand  the  Bill

fully  -  I do not see how this Bill helps those Singaporeans

who  happen to go abroad during election day.  That is, I  am

normally resident here but because of work commitments and  I

cannot be in Singapore physically on voting day,  I may  have

planned my work commitments, say, three or six months  ahead,

and voting (Election day) in Singapore is more a mystery than

that.  I do not see why we should not in the same spirit have

a  system for pre-voting for those people who live here,  but

just  happen to be abroad on that particular day.  Those  are

my comments about overseas voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electronic voting, there has been a lot of debate

here in this House, and I would only say that when I look  at

other  countries,  I see systems that are either  incompetent

and  some  which are just outrageously corrupt.  I think,  in

general,  in Singapore, we avoided both these problems.   But

still  I  do take the Minister's point that in our commitment

to  e-government, in our crunch on manpower, and in our  wish

to  avoid the kind of embarrassing problems we saw in the  US

Presidential  Election, there is a sense  in  moving  towards

direct recording electronic voting.  And here, I just want to

share  the  views  of  a number of other MPs,  including  the

Member for Sembawang GRC, Prof. Chin, and the Member for West

Coast  GRC,  Mr Iswaran, that a new system can have  glitches

and  that  effort must be made to educate voters,  especially

those who are uncomfortable with the e-world.  In this sense,

I would not ask for a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>

Select  Committee  but rather I would ask the  Government  to

reassure  us  that  our  system  will  actually  somehow   be

improved,  and that we implement the feedback,  not  so  much

from  the  voters  themselves and the computer  experts,  but

rather  from  grassroots organisations and,  yes,  even  some

elected  Opposition  MPs.  I think they should  help  in  the

implementation of this programme so that they can see  it  up

close  and  be  reassured  that we are  substituting  a  more

efficient,  better  system  for one  that  has  been  so  far

fundamentally sound.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. I

have  only one point to make and it has, in fact, been raised

by Members before.  So I would be very brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to join Prof. Chin, Mr Iswaran and Mr Tay

in asking that the Minister consider including in the list of

persons eligible, who may not have the requisite two  out  of

five  preceding years, not only those members of the  SAF  or

Government  employees or scholars, but also the employees  of

private   locally  registered  companies  or   multi-national

companies  who  are  legitimately on  prolonged  overseas  or

international postings, as well as students who are  overseas

for  long periods on their own funding.  Because I think that

all these Singaporeans count, be it that they are overseas on

public  service  or in the employment of the private  sector.

That is all that I have to contribute.
