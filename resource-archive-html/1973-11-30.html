<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>FREEZING OF GROUND AND HOUSE RENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National    Development   if   he   will   consider

introducing   legislation   to   freeze,   for   an

appropriate  period, all ground and  house  rentals

which  are  at present charged at rates below  $250

per  month and which are outside the existing scope

of  the  Control  of Rent Act,  so  as  to  prevent

landlords taking undue advantage of tenants in  the

lower income group.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is considered

inappropriate to introduce legislation to freeze



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



all ground rents and house rents not more than $250

per month for premises which are not subject to the

Control  of Rent Act. The premises subject to  rent

control are those built before 7th September, 1947,

and  it is undesirable at this stage to extend this

Act beyond its present limits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is conscious of the need to

safeguard  the  legitimate  interests  of  tenants,

particularly  those  in the  lower  income  groups.

Towards this end, the Housing and Development Board

has  stepped up its development programme  to  meet

the   housing  requirements  of  the  lower  income

groups, thus keeping rents for them within bounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action on the lines suggested by the Member for

Jalan Kayu will tend to retard the pace of building

both of new residential estates, condominiums,  and

housing in urban renewal areas.

<div align="center"><b>SOUVENIR COINS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Sale at Community Centres)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if he will consider arranging for souvenir

coins, like the 7th SEAP Games $5 silver coins,  to

be  sold in future at the various community centres

as  this  will avoid long queues and waste of  time

and  also  enable  the rural  people  to  have  the

opportunity of obtaining such coins.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang's suggestion

has  been  submitted  to  the  Currency  Board  for

consideration along with other similar  suggestions

which I have also received. However, I ought to say

that  there  are problems of manpower and  security

involved  in  selling coins elsewhere than  at  the

Currency Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty about commemorative and other coins

not   intended   for   large  day-to-day   currency

circulation  is, as with the issue  of  stamps,  to

judge exactly what number would be appropriate  for

each  issue.  The number must not be too  large  if

their value for collectors is not to be debased. On

the other hand, if the number is too limited, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



have  the  problem of long queues and the waste  of

time  referred  to  by  the Member  for  Sembawang.

Perhaps  the  Board  has misjudged  the  constantly

growing  number  of numismatists  and  their  great

enthusiasm for our cleanly struck coins with  their

interesting designs. If so, I will suggest to  them

that  the number of coins can be somewhat increased

without detriment to their interest for collectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang and other coin

enthusiasts can be certain, however, that a  policy

of  limited issue will be maintained to ensure that

any  slight queueing or time spent will still  have

been worthwhile.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO FIRE AT ROBINSON DEPARTMENTAL STORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Social Affairs)</b></div>



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Report

of  the  Commission of Inquiry into the  Robinson's

fire has been tabled in this House earlier for  the

information of Members. This valuable report, which

has   been  accepted  by  the  Government,  is  the

culmination of careful deliberations by  the  3-man

Commission  headed by Mr Justice  F.  A.  Chua  and

assisted by Mr C. A. V. Chew and Mr Jimmy Chen  Wie

Ying,   and   I   wish   to   record   Government's

appreciation of their public service. I  also  wish

to  thank the various individuals and organisations

listed  in  the  Appendices  to  the  Report,   who

submitted  memoranda  or  otherwise  assisted   the

Commission in its work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Commission has found that the

fire  that destroyed Robinson's Departmental  Store

at  Raffles Place on the morning of 21st  November,

1972,  resulting in the death of nine  persons  and

the destruction of property worth approximately $21

million, was caused by a short circuit as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



a result of the overloading of an electrical branch

circuit  on  the  ground floor. The  Commission  is

satisfied that the criticisms levelled at the  Fire

Brigade  of  poor  fire-fighting  performance   are

unjustified, and that the Fire Brigade  fought  the

fire  under trying conditions and had done well  in

containing  the  fire  from  spreading   to   other

buildings  in that area. The Commission is  of  the

view  that  by  the  time  the  Fire  Brigade   was

summoned,  Robinson's Departmental Store could  not

have  been saved. The fire had been allowed  to  be

nursed  in  the loft stores without being detected,

and  the  domestic fire-fighting squad was fighting

the  fire at the wrong locations. It is appropriate

at  this  juncture for me to congratulate the  Fire

Brigade not only on its commendable performance  on

that  occasion, but also on the general  manner  in

which it had performed its role for the benefit  of

the community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendations made by the

Commission, Members many wish to know that many  of

the recommendations have, in fact, been implemented

and some are being actively pursued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent the recurrence of such a

catastrophe,  the  Commission has  recommended  the

introduction  of legislation to enable  appropriate

authorities  to  implement  a  system  of  periodic

inspections of places of public resort to check  on

unauthorised additions and alterations to buildings

which might endanger the safety of the public.  The

Building  Control  Bill,  now  before  this  House,

strengthens the law in respect of building  control

to  enable  the  Building Authority  to  take  more

speedy  and  effective action against  unauthorised

building   works   and  dangerous  buildings,   and

provides  for  enhanced  penalties  in  respect  of

offences.   Provision  to  control,  regulate   and

supervise  places to which the public have  access,

has also been provided for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has recommended that for

electrical  installations of  a  stipulated  higher

current  rating,  consideration  be  given  by  the

Public Utilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



Board   to   grade  the  licensing  of   electrical

contractors  so as to ensure that only  contractors

with  the  requisite  professional  expertise   and

experience are allowed to undertake such  work.  It

was  also suggested that the 1947 Municipal  Wiring

Rules  and Conditions of Supply should be  updated.

In  this connection, I must state that towards this

end,   the  Public  Utilities  Board  has   already

initiated  action to draft appropriate  legislation

and set up the necessary administrative machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further recommendation of the Commission is that

a    public   authority   be   charged   with   the

responsibility for ensuring the proper construction

and  maintenance of lifts to which the  public  may

have  access. The Ministry of National  Development

has decided in this connection to place the control

of  the installation of lifts and escalators  under

its  Building Control Division, and the control  of

their   maintenance  under  the   Commissioner   of

Buildings  appointed under the Building and  Common

Property (Maintenance and Management) Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has also suggested that a Committee

be  formed to look into ways and means of  rescuing

people  trapped  in  lifts in situations  of  power

failure.  Representatives  from  the  Ministry   of

National   Development,   the   Building    Control

Division, the Singapore Fire Brigade, the Singapore

Institute of Standards and Industrial Research  and

the  Commissioner  of Buildings  are  now  actively

looking  into  the  question  of  installation,  in

lifts,  of equipment to facilitate emergency rescue

operations and the operational aspects of  rescuing

people trapped in lifts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recommendation of the Commission is that

all  lift  attendants be given proper  training  to

deal  with  emergencies  and  that  managements  of

establishments  of  public resort  be  required  to

provide  effective  training  for  all  staff   and

domestic  fire-fighting squads in  preparation  for

any  emergency. Here, I wish to point out that  the

Singapore  Fire  Brigade has always  assisted  with

such training on request. The necessity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



of   amending  existing  legislation  to  make   it

mandatory  for  managements  of  establishments  of

public   resort  to  provide  for  the  recommended

training  in  fire-fighting  and  in  dealing  with

emergencies is being looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a few recommendations pertaining

exclusively to the Singapore Fire Brigade have also

been made by the Commission, viz: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that officers of higher rank in the Fire Brigade should supervise the Control Room operations;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that the formal training of firemen should

include lift rescue operations; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that service conditions of serving officers

be improved.



<br><br>Action  on  all  these  matters  has  already  been

initiated and is in hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also suggested that the Fire

Brigade  should  be  responsible  for  the  regular

inspection  of  all fire hydrants in the  Republic,

although   they  are  maintained  by   the   Public

Utilities  Board. This recommendation  has  already

been  implemented and regular inspections  of  fire

hydrants  are  now  being  conducted  by  the  Fire

Brigade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also wish to know that very soon all

fire    regulatory   functions,   including   those

pertaining to dangerous trades, will be transferred

from  the  Fire  Brigade to  the  Building  Control

Division    under   the   Ministry   of    National

Development.   The  Assistant  Director   (Building

Control  Division)  will  be  responsible  for  all

matters  pertaining  to safety in  buildings.  This

will  lessen the administrative burden on the  Fire

Brigade and allow it to concentrate solely on fire-fighting,  devoting more time to the study  of  new

techniques of fighting fires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although an efficient and modern

fire  service  is  essential for saving  lives  and

property,   the   primary   objective   should   be

preventing the outbreak of fires. This requires the

insistence  of  a  high  standard  of  fire  safety

requirements in buildings, and educating the public

on fire safety.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fatalities as a result of fire were five in

1970,  eight in 1971 and twelve in 1972. This year,

to-date,  fires have claimed nine lives and  it  is

essential   that  such  tragic  losses  should   be

prevented. The figures for fire loss have  steadily

increased  over  the  last  three  years  - from  $4

million  in  1970 to $6.2 million in 1971,  with  a

jump  to  $30.6 million in 1972. The fire  loss  in

1973   to-date   amounts  to  $7.6   million.   The

indiscriminate  discarding  of  lighted   cigarette

butts  and  matches and electrical  short  circuits

have  been  the  direct  causes  of  many  a  fire.

Undoubtedly, greater vigilance and care by everyone

would minimise the incidence of fires.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance companies can also play a vital role in

reducing fire losses by giving meaningful discounts

on  fire  premiums where fire protection facilities

are  of  a  high standard. They could also increase

the  premiums or even refuse to underwrite  if  the

fire protection measures are inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tragedy at Robinson's Departmental Store has

highlighted the need to give fire-fighting and fire-prevention greater priority in our society.  As  we

become    increasingly    more    urbanised     and

industrialised, and with the rapid  development  of

high-rise  buildings, fire prevention requirements,

the training of staff in fire-fighting, as well  as

the   education  of  workers  on  fire   preventive

measures and emergency requirements, will  have  to

be  constantly reviewed and regularly stressed.  We

need to overcome the common human tendency to shrug

off  measures  laid  down to cope  with  unpleasant

emergencies   (such  as  fire  drills)   as   being

unnecessary, tedious and a waste of time.  A  small

country, like ours particularly, can ill-afford the

heavy  fire  losses, both in terms of manpower  and

property,  which constitute a heavy  drain  on  our

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to stress that fire safety

is  a community obligation, and every man, woman or

child  has  a social responsibility to ensure  that

vigilance  is exercised at all times to prevent  an

outbreak  of  fire. History is harsh to  those  who

only know how to use fire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



but  fail to exercise caution and vigilance and  to

take the necessary steps for its effective control.

<div align="center"><b>INCREASE IN PRICES OF HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law and National Development)</b></div>



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present

selling  prices  of  Housing and Development  Board

flats  were fixed in 1965 when the "Home  Ownership

for the People" scheme was first introduced. In the

last  eight  years  the cost  of  providing  public

housing  has  risen  considerably,  mainly  due  to

increases  in,  firstly,  the  prices  of  building

materials and wages pushing up construction  costs;

secondly,   land  cost;  thirdly,   clearance   and

resettlement  costs; and lastly,  additional  costs

due  to  improvement  in the design  of  flats  and

better  communal  and recreational facilities.  The

Housing  and  Development Board can, therefore,  no

longer  continue to sell flats at prevailing prices

without incurring heavy losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are over 100,000 applicants on the waiting

list  for  Housing  Board flats; more  than  75,000

wanting  to  buy  and more than 25,000  wanting  to

rent.  The Board can only satisfy this great demand

for  flats without suffering a great financial loss

if  the  selling prices of Housing Board flats  are

raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As from 1st January of next year, the selling

price  of Housing Board flats will he increased  by

$2,000  for  two-room fiats, $4,000 for  three-room

flats,  $6,000 for four-room flats and  $8,000  for

five-room flats. In order to help the lowest income

groups,  there will be no increase in  the  selling

price  of  one-room flats. The new  selling  prices

will  be as follows: one-room flat, no change. Two-room (standard), Urban $9,500, Suburban $8,200, New

Town $6,900.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will proceed to give the prices

of various other categories



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



of flats in the Urban, Suburban and New Town

areas respectively.

<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister has just thrown a bombshell  in

front of us. We were expecting price increases, but

to  hear  that the lowest increase is going  to  be

$2,000 is too hard to take. I wonder if the Housing

Board  is also joining in the inflation racket!  It

would be reasonable to suppose that people who have

registered for purchase of flats have to  wait  for

some  time  before  increases  in  costs  would  be

effected  and  borne by them. But  there  are  also

other   categories  of  people  who  are   awaiting

allocation of flats. By "people", I mean those  who

were affected by urban renewal sometime ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, will the Member get on to his

question?  In a Ministerial Statement a Member  may

ask questions, but not make speeches.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I will conic to the

point.  What about those who arc affected by  urban

renewal?  The  compensation  to  be  paid  by   the

Resettlement  Department has been  agreed  in  some

cases  as  far  back  as six months  ago,  and  the

Housing  Board  was not able to allocate  flats  to

those  to he evicted at the time, when they  should

have  been  allocated, and they are still  waiting.

Will  these  people have to pay the same  increased

cost   for   flats  that  the  Minister  has   just

enumerated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, soon after the last

elections, I received a paper from the Housing  and

Development  Board asking for an  increase  in  the

sale prices of flats. Because of the rising cost of

living, I have resisted the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



increases  for  more  than a year;  but  we  cannot

resist it forever, and I have given reasons why the

costs of these flats have gone up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the various categories of applicants,

whether  they  are  affected by urban  renewal,  or

whether  they  have  applied three  years  ago,  or

whether  their house is affected by some Government

project  and have to move, there must be a dividing

line;  there  must be a cutoff date.  We  therefore

chose  the 1st of January next year. Whatever  date

you  choose, people will grumble; but the best date

one can choose is the beginning of the new year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister  has just pointed out that building  costs

have  gone  up. Is it possible for him to elaborate

on  these increases? He mentioned increases in  the

cost of building materials as well as labour. If he

elaborates on this, I shall follow up with  another

two questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, over the last several years,

prices  have  gone  up,  but  they  have  gone   up

significantly  over  the last  twelve  months.  The

percentage increases in the main building materials

were cement about 33 per cent, steel about 100  per

cent,  timber 100 per cent, and labour 50 per cent.

Roughly, the overall increase in building materials

and labour per unit of 3-room flats works out to be

about 35 per cent over the last twelve months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in order to save the

Minister's time, I shall proceed straightaway  with

the  other two questions. It just came to  my  mind

the question of conservancy charges and rentals. In

this  respect,  will the Minister indicate  to  the

House as to whether conservancy charges and rentals

are  likely to be increased also? My next  question

is:  in view of the oil crisis, there is a move  to

cut down wasteful use of electricity, may the House

be  informed as to what the Housing and Development

Board is going to do about it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in direct reply, charges for

service and conservancy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



must  go up. The cost, I believe, is about $6.50  a

day, but the costs of providing these services have

gone  up,  particularly the amenities  for  Housing

Board  flats which have improved considerably.  The

Housing  Board  is responsible for  maintenance  of

parks, playing fields and other improved amenities.

But there is one peculiarity and, that is, that the

old  Singapore  Improvement Trust flats  have  been

totally  exempted from all service and  conservancy

charges ever since they were built. It is time this

policy was changed. All I can assure the Member  is

that  if these charges go up, they will go up  only

sometime next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for rents, the likelihood is that they will go

up,   but  we  will  give  consideration  to  these

increases only after receipt of the recommendations

of  the National Wages Council, which will probably

be in the middle of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for energy conservation, every alternate

lighting  point  along  the  common  corridors   of

Housing  Board flats, except along the  staircases,

has  been  cut  off. Altogether 23,000  fluorescent

tubes  have  been removed and kept in  the  stores.

Further, the lighting hours have been cut  down  by

two  hours,  the common lights are switched  on  an

hour  later  than before and switched off  an  hour

earlier in the morning.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, one of the reasons

advanced  by the Minister just now for the increase

in  selling prices was the cost of land.  Will  the

Minister  consider selling Housing Board  flats  at

the  old  rate  to those people affected  by  urban

renewal?  The reason is that since the compensation

they are going to receive is based on the old rate,

they should be allowed to purchase flats at the old

rate. The Housing Board should not charge them  the

higher  selling prices now, because the  Board  was

not  able to allocate them any flats earlier.  Does

the  Minister  want  a new cut-off  date  for  this

category?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I do not follow the question. Is the

Member  referring  to  the landowner  or  just  the

tenant?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Both tenants and landowners,

Sir.  You have computed compensation based  on  the

old  rate for the house, land, etc. But the  prices

of  houses  have  gone up or are likely  to  go  up

further from 1st January.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member does not know

that even the Housing Board, when it purchases land

from the Government or from the private sector, has

to  pay  for the land at market prices. One of  the

reasons  I gave for the increase in building  costs

was  the increase in land costs which have gone  up

considerably   in  Singapore.  Hence,  Government's

policy  statement last September barring foreigners

from   purchasing   land   in   Singapore   without

permission;  and  I  shall  be  tabling  the   Land

Acquisition (Amendment) Bill very soon after  this.

This  is Government's effort to prevent speculation

in  land  prices  in  order to  stabilise,  if  not

lessen,  land  prices.  But  we  have  always  been

concerned  with the amount of compensation  payable

either  to farmers in the rural areas or  to  urban

dwellers. It was not long ago that the compensation

rates went up, and if conditions are such that  the

amount of rates should go up, they will go up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

with  the increase in the purchase price of Housing

Board flats, will there be a consequent increase in

the rent for Housing Board flats?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I have said just now that

consideration  will be given to  such  an  increase

sometime  next  year. But we  do  not  want  to  do

everything at one blow. All I can tell is  that  if

the  rents go up, they will not go up for the  next

six months.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on

a  point of clarification. Will the Minister kindly

let  me know if these new prices for Housing  Board

flats apply to all new flats that are balloted with

effect  from  1st  January, or  are  they  for  new

applications?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is, yes, no more flats will

be balloted for the rest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



of  the year. Sir, the next ballot will be sometime

next  year, and prices will go up. We must  have  a

cut-off date. There have been letters to the  press

grumbling  about the flats in Marine  Parade  which

are nearly ready, "Why don't we sell them now?" The

objection is this. If we balloted away one  or  two

blocks  of flats in Marine Parade in December,  and

they  would have to be sold at the old prices, then

if  we  have  a  second ballot next year  with  the

increased  prices,  those who  buy  in  the  second

ballot  will  grumble. They  will  point  to  their

neighbours  next  door and say, "That  person  paid

$2,000  or  $4,000  less." This  policy  is  not  a

pleasant one. But unless we increase the prices  of

flats,  it  will  be uneconomical for  the  Housing

Board  and  the  Minister for Finance  to  increase

considerably  the  subsidies  that  Government   is

already providing for cheap low-cost housing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the   Minister  did  say  that  he  would  consider

increasing  the quantum of compensation for  people

affected by urban renewal, and he also said that he

would  consider it when the time is  ripe.  I  feel

that  the  time  is  ripe now.  Will  the  Minister

consider increasing the compensation especially for

those  people who have just been affected by  urban

renewal  sometime  in  August,  as  they  will   be

obtaining  their flats after January? The increased

compensation  can help them meet  the  extra  costs

that are to be charged for Housing Board flats with

effect from 1st January, 1974.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I will have to work out the details.

All   I  can  say  is  that  it  is  unlikely  that

compensation rates will be increased by the end  of

this year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  hon. Minister mentioned that the Housing Board

has  got  to  acquire land from the  Government  at

market  prices.  Obviously this is pushing  up  the

cost  of these flats. May I suggest, Sir, that  the

Government refrain from making too much  profit  in

selling land to the Housing Board?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is a difficult question for me to

answer,  because I represent the Housing  Board.  I

also  represent the Commissioner of Lands who sells

the  land,  and  the Housing and Development  Board

comes  under  the jurisdiction of the  Ministry  of

National Development. But it is not exactly  taking

from the left hand and giving it to the right hand.

I  cannot do a thing without reference to the  hon.

Minister  for  Finance  who  rightly  looks   after

Government's money.

<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill  intituled

"An Act to provide for the control and rationing of

essential  supplies and to repeal the Food  Control

Act  (Chapter 246 of the Revised Edition)  and  the

Control  of  Petroleum  Fuel  and  Lubricants   Act

(Chapter 242 of the Revised Edition)".

<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency signed by the President in

respect  of  the Bill, laid upon the Table  by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international economic situation is not

encouraging.  In  recent  months,  Singapore,  like

other  countries in this region, has suffered  from

high rice and bread prices because of poor harvests

and  export bans by producing countries, themselves

short of such supplies. The recent Middle East  War

has  led to crude oil shortages. Unless the  supply

situation  improves, crude oil shortages will  lead

to   reduced   supplies  of  petrol,   fertilisers,

plastics  and other petroleum products. There  will

also be a slowdown in the production of high energy

content  manufactured  goods,  such  as  steel  and

cement.  Shortages  of essential  commodities  will

dislocate  all economies, including  our  own  very

badly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current economic uncertainty, all that

Singapore can do is to take steps to reduce adverse

effects  as  far  as  possible. The  Government  is

therefore  raising the rice stockpile  from  25,000

tons  to  90,000 tons, sufficient for at least  six

months' consumption. While there appears to be some

improvement  in the world food grains situation,  a

reasonable  rice stockpile still appears  to  be  a

prudent  precaution. Six months' stocks  will  tide

Singapore  over should harvests fail and  shortages

occur again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Government and the oil industry are

taking  steps  to  safeguard  oil  stocks  to  meet

Singapore's  own direct needs and also  to  supply,

with  bunker  fuel  and  aviation  gas,  ships  and

international   airlines   calling   regularly   at

Singapore.  However,  crude  oil  supplies  to  our

refineries  have  been  reduced  and  it  will   be

necessary for all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



Singapore households, industries and business firms

to  exercise the greatest economy in the use of oil

and  electricity. While Government will do its best

to  ensure  security  of supplies,  Singapore,  not

being  a  producer  of rice nor  of  oil  or  other

primary  products,  will have  to  pay  competitive

prices   in   the   international   market   place.

Otherwise, supplies to Singapore would just dry up.

So  long  as we can pay internationally-competitive

prices,  adequate,  if  perhaps  because  of   more

restricted  production, somewhat  reduced  supplies

will  keep flowing and our economy will be able  to

function,   though   it  may  grow   more   slowly.

International  events  can, however,  take  a  turn

swiftly for the worse, entirely outside Singapore's

control.  Should  there be a  rapid  deterioration,

there   could  be  actual  shortages  of  essential

commodities for Singapore. In such a situation,  it

would be the duty of Government to ensure fair  and

equitable distribution of scarce commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Control of Essential Supplies Bill, 1973,

when   enacted  will  give  Government  powers   to

control,  including  possibly  by  rationing,   the

domestic  sale  of  essential  commodities.  These,

however, are emergency powers to be exercised  only

when the situation demands, and then only with  the

consent of the President. The Minister, on his own,

will not be able to invoke such powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to stress that this Bill will

regulate   the   distribution  only  of   essential

commodities  and  not  of any  other  article.  The

Government  has  no intention and, indeed,  it  can

have no effective means of regulating domestic  and

international trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to repeat that these are

emergency  powers which will enable  Government  to

act firmly and decisively in a crisis. There are no

indications  as  yet that stocks of  any  essential

commodities  will  fall  to  critical  levels.  The

public should therefore not allow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



themselves   to   be   panicked  into   unnecessary

purchases  at excessively high prices.  The  public

should  treat  rumours  of  shortages  with   great

scepticism.   If  they  allow  themselves   to   be

persuaded  by such rumours, they run the danger  of

bringing  about  the situations they  fear  and  of

benefiting  those who, in the first place  and  for

their own purposes, started these rumours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a small

point of clarification. Will this Bill consequently

lead   to   the  control  of  prices  of  essential

foodstuffs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> No, Sir. The Bill is not intended

to  control prices. But there is another Bill which

enables us, if necessary, to do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know,

with  the  present high cost of living - to  use  a

Chinese  expression, Tsai mi chu hsin kui ter  shih

ho - if the Government still does not think that now

is  the  time  to  introduce  some  kind  of  price

control,  I  would like to know what is the  reason

for  it,  and  when  would be the  proper  time  to

introduce such control.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, the answer is very simple.

The   prices   of  essential  food   supplies   are

determined  not  by what is done in  Singapore  but

what happens in the Middle East, or what happens to

the  weather in Thailand, or in other areas, or  in

the  wheat-growing areas in the United States.  The

prices  which  we have to pay are the prices  which

our importers have to pay in other markets to bring

them  to  Singapore, so that the ability to control

prices  is certainly not within the hands of either

the Singapore Government or even the consumers.  Of

course,  consumers can control prices to a  certain

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments contained in this Bill are mainly

designed  to simplify the method and procedure  for

the revision of the registers of electors so as  to

facilitate  the  process  of  revision  and  enable

revised  registers  to be prepared  within  a  much

shorter  time than is at present possible.  It  has

been found that the present method and procedure of

revising   the   registers   of   electors   causes

unnecessary  delay because of the requirement  laid

down  by  section 16 of the Parliamentary Elections

Act  that,  apart from the revised  registers,  two

additional  lists referred to as "List A"  (dealing

with  deletions from the registers)  and  "List  B"

(dealing with additions to the registers) must also

be  prepared. The preparation of both  these  Lists

takes  time but serves very little purpose as  they

are  hardly known to the public, most of  whom  are

merely  interested  in finding  out  whether  their

names  are in the revised registers or not.  Clause

10  of  the  Bill, therefore, dispenses  with  this

requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been found that the existing section

15  of  the  Act is unduly rigid as  it  imposes  a

mandatory  requirement to revise the  registers  of

electors  every year even though there may  not  be

any  real need for such revision. Clause 9  of  the

Bill, therefore, seeks to amend section 15 so as to

introduce greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



flexibility by empowering the Minister  to  require

the  registers of electors to be revised from  time

to  time but in any case not less than three  years

after the last general election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the shorter time that will be

needed  in preparing revised registers of electors,

the  cut-off date for the inclusion of names in the

registers  can  be extended from  1st  February  at

present to 1st July in any year in respect of which

registers are prepared. Clause 2 of the Bill, which

amends section 5 of the Act, seeks to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past it has also been the practice to amend

section  10 of the Act whenever fresh registers  of

electors  (as distinct from revised registers)  are

required  to  be  prepared for a general  election.

This   method   is   somewhat  unsatisfactory   and

cumbersome,  and  clause 3 of the Bill  now  simply

provides  that,  whenever a  notification  is  made

under section 8 of the Act to specify the names and

boundaries of the electoral divisions for  purposes

of  a  general  election, the Registration  Officer

will  prepare fresh registers of electors for  that

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains one other important amendment

which  seeks to increase the amount required to  be

deposited by a candidate for election from $500  to

$1,200. The amendment, which is contained in clause

14,  will  also empower the Minister  to  vary  the

amount of deposit up to a maximum of 10 per cent of

the  total  allowances  payable  to  a  Member   of

Parliament   in  each  year.  This   amendment   is

necessary because the present amount of deposit was

fixed as long ago as 1954 and is therefore somewhat

unrealistic by present day standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to prohibit smoking in public

buses.  I  do  not  need to go into  the  whys  and

wherefores  for  prohibition on smoking  in  public

places.  Members  are  well  aware  of  these.  The

Prohibition on Smoking in Certain Places  Act  came

into  operation on 1st October, 1970,  followed  by

prohibition  on  smoking in cinemas,  theatres  and

similar  public places. More recently,  smoking  in

public  lifts  was also prohibited  in  March  this

year. About 1.75 million bus trips are made by fare-paying  passengers, including school  children,  in

one   day.   It  is  therefore  logical  that   the

prohibition on smoking in public places  should  be

extended to public buses to give these passengers a

better  atmosphere to travel in  and  protect  them

from the harmful effects of smoking by others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enactment of this Bill, the present

division  in public buses between smoking and  non-smoking  sections  will be  done  away  with.  Each

public bus will be wholly non-smoking. The prohibition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



on smoking in buses would apply to  buses

operating on scheduled routes while carrying  fare-paying  passengers.  Excursion  and  private  buses

would not be included in the prohibition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill empowers the conductor or a ticket

inspector  to  warn passengers against  smoking  in

buses. A passenger who disregards such warning  may

be  asked to leave the bus. The conductor or ticket

inspector  may  also  seek the  assistance  of  any

police  officer, public health auxiliary  or  other

public  officer  authorised by the Commissioner  of

Public Health, to deal with a passenger who refuses

to heed the warnings or leave the bus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, smoking in public buses would be

an  offence  subject to arrest without warning.  On

conviction in Court, an offender would be liable to

a fine of up to $500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to introduce certain

amendments  to the Supreme Court of Judicature  Act

(Chapter   15)  in  order  to  enable  the   Public

Prosecutor to appeal against judgments of the  High

Court   made  in  the  exercise  of  its   original

jurisdiction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, the Public Prosecutor is

only  empowered to refer points of law to the Court

of Criminal Appeal for the Appellate Court's review

and,  where a person has been acquitted by the High

Court, only a declaratory judgment of the Court  of

Criminal  Appeal may be sought which will not  have

the  effect  of  reversing the order.  Furthermore,

there can be no appeal by the Public Prosecutor  in

respect of sentence imposed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas there are these restrictions on the Public

Prosecutor, there are no corresponding restrictions

on  the accused person who, upon conviction by  the

High  Court,  is entitled as of right to  take  his

case on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal; and

in  every  case where he is dissatisfied  with  the

sort  of punishment meted out on him by the  Court,

lodge  an  appeal  against sentence.  In  order  to

correct  this  imbalance as it  were,  the  changes

contemplated by the Bill have been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, it is not envisaged that there would

be many such appeals. Nevertheless, there is a need

to allow the Public Prosecutor in any given case, a

freer  hand  than the law now allows,  so  that  he

would  be  in the same position, not less nor  more

advantageous  than  counsel  for  the  defence,  in

regard to exercising a discretion whether to appeal

against an order of the High Court or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two minor amendments in this Bill are

being  introduced in order to allow  the  President

power   to   increase  the  number   of   Assistant

Registrars in the High Court, as and when the  need

to do so arises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>BUILDING CONTROL BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Building Control Division within the Public

Works Department was established in February, 1972,

to  speed  up  the  processing of  building  plans.

However,  the existing building control legislation

is inadequate to meet our present requirements. The

Bill  therefore seeks to amend and consolidate  the

existing  law and to repeal Part III of  the  Local

Government Integration Act (Cap. 210) dealing  with

building activities. The general scheme of the Bill

is  similar  to  Part III of the  Local  Government

Integration Act, but substantive changes have  been

made  to  simplify  the law and to  confer  greater

powers  on  the Building Authority (who is  defined

under  the Bill as the Assistant Director (Building

Control) of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



P.W.D.)  to  deal with unauthorised building  works

and  dangerous or dilapidated buildings.  Penalties

for  offences in relation to unauthorised  building

works  have been increased under the Bill,  as  the

present penalties are considered inadequate.  There

are also other new provisions which will strengthen

the  hands  of  the  Authority. I  will  only  draw

Members'  attention to some of the more significant

clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that no person shall commence

or carry out any building works without the written

permission of the Building Authority. This  is  not

new. But "building works" is defined to include any

kind  of  construction,  site  formation,  repairs,

demolition, alteration, addition and every kind  of

building operations. Provisions will be made in the

Regulations to exempt minor repairs and alterations

from the requirements of this clause. In respect of

any  unauthorised building works, the Authority  is

authorised  under  the  Bill  to  charge  sums  not

exceeding  50  times the prescribed fees,  for  the

approval of plans to cover such unauthorised works.

The  existing  maximum penalty  is  ten  times  the

prescribed fee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 which is substantially similar to the

existing law confers on the Authority power to stop

the construction of unauthorised building works and

to  demolish the structures and to recover the cost

and   expenses  of  demolition  from  the   persons

responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 empowers the Authority to enter a

building  and  seize  all  movable  property  found

therein  if  it is satisfied that the building  has

been  converted for any purpose or use  other  than

the  purpose or use for which the building has been

approved.  Such movable property may be confiscated

or  returned to the owner. This clause is  designed

to  enable speedy and effective action to be  taken

against  any  unauthorised  change  of  use  of   a

building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 of the Bill confers wide powers on the

Authority to deal with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



any building which is dangerous or liable to become

dangerous  by fire, wind, rain, dilapidation,  use,

lack  of  fire  escapes or any other  cause.  Among

other things, the Authority may require the closure

and  the  demolition of the whole or even  part  of

such  building. The provisions of this clause  will

enable the Authority to deal more effectively  with

dangerous buildings than the existing system  under

which  a  mandatory order will have to be  obtained

from  a Magistrate's Court resulting in undue delay

and protracted action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority is also conferred powers by clause

19 of the Bill to confiscate any property seized or

removed  in the exercise of statutory powers.  Such

confiscated property may be returned to  the  owner

within two weeks of the seizure or removal on  such

terms  and conditions as the Authority thinks  fit.

Any  property  or thing which has been  confiscated

may  be  disposed of in such manner as the Minister

may direct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, clause 11 of

the Bill, which is not considered to be significant

by the Minister, empowers the Building Authority to

require  the owner of a building to remove  roofing

made  of  inflammable materials, such as attap,  by

giving  three months' or shorter period of  notice.

In the implementation of this particular section of

the  law,  I do hope that the Department  concerned

will  be  both  flexible and  reasonable  in  their

attitude,  bearing  in mind that  the  majority  of

people  likely  to be affected by  this  particular

section  are  attap  house dwellers  in  the  lower

income  group. In view of the present high cost  of

building  construction materials, these people  may

very  well find three months too short a period  to

raise  sufficient money to replace the  attap  roof

with  other suitable material. In cases of  genuine

financial  hardship, I do hope that the  Department

will  be prepared to grant a longer period for  the

work to be carried out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that has occurred to me is that the

existing procedure to obtain official permission to

change  the  roof from attap to some other  hardier

material is somewhat involved, and in most cases it

takes  more  than  three months to obtain  planning

approval. So, for this clause 11 to be implemented,

I  presume that something will be done to  simplify

the procedure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding, Sir, I do like to mention that I

can fully appreciate the very good intention behind

this particular clause of the Bill, which obviously

aims  at minimising the risk of fire spreading from

house to house.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, first, I would like to thank the

Member for his kind remarks. We will certainly take

his  comments  into consideration. If the  Building

Authority or the Assistant Director of Public Works

Department  is  not  flexible,  there   is   always

recourse for an appeal to the Minister.

<div align="center"><b>IMMIGRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 56 (1) (c) of the Immigration Act,

any person who engages in the business or trade  of

conveying  to  Singapore  in  or  on  any   vessel,

aircraft  or vehicle, any person whom he  knows  or

has   reasonable   grounds  for  believing   is   a

prohibited immigrant, is guilty of an offence. This

is an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, however, extremely difficult to secure

convictions  under this provision  because  of  the

difficulty  in  adducing evidence to  prove  beyond

reasonable  doubt that the defendant is engaged  in

the  business of trafficking illegal immigrants  to

Singapore. Between 1970 and June 1973,  of  the  88

traffickers  arrested only 35  were  prosecuted  in

court. The other 53 were not charged because it was

not  possible  to  adduce the  amount  of  evidence

required for a conviction in court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate proof, clause 2 (c) of the

Bill   therefore   seeks  to  introduce   a   legal

presumption   to  provide  that   where,   in   any

proceeding  for  an offence of trafficking,  it  is

proved   that   the  defendant  has  conveyed   any

prohibited  illegal immigrant in or on any  vessel,

aircraft  or  vehicle, it shall be presumed,  until

the contrary is proved,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



that  the  defendant is engaged in the business  or

trade   of   conveying   to  Singapore   prohibited

immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for trafficking illegal immigrants

under  the existing law is imprisonment for a  term

of  two  years  and  a fine not  exceeding  $4,000.

Further a person who enters Singapore illegally and

any  person  who  abets his entry  or  harbours  or

employs   him   is   liable,  on   conviction,   to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding one  year  or

to  a  fine  not exceeding $4,000 or to  both  such

imprisonment  and fine. These penalties  under  the

present  law  are manifestly inadequate  especially

for   traffickers   who  prey  on   these   illegal

immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the number of illegal immigrants

arrested  since  1969  has  been  increasing.   The

numbers arrested in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972  were

902,  1,128, 1,002 and 1,554 respectively.  In  the

first  half of this year, that is, from January  to

June   1973   alone,  there  were   1,086   illegal

immigrants arrested. These figures, however, do not

reveal the true position as there are most probably

many  more  illegal immigrants who have up  to-date

remained undetected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the Immigration

(Amendment) Bill is to give more teeth to  the  law

so  that  it  will  be  a deterrent  especially  to

traffickers and to those who abet another person to

enter Singapore unlawfully, or to harbour or employ

illegal  immigrants. We must enhance  penalties  to

ensure  that it does not pay especially to  traffic

in illegal immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 (a) (i) of the Bill therefore seeks to

increase   the   penalties   for   traffickers   to

imprisonment for a term of not less than two  years

and  not  more than five years and to  a  fine  not

exceeding  $10,000  and to  caning.  Thus  for  the

offence  of  trafficking, a  minimum  sentence  and

mandatory caning are introduced for the first time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment for any person who enters

unlawfully,  or any person who abets his  entry  or

harbours  or employs him, is raised to imprisonment

for a term not exceeding two years or to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



fine   not   exceeding  $6,000  or  to  both   such

imprisonment  and  fine. This is  provided  for  in

clause 2 (a) (ii) of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Committee stage I shall be moving a

further  amendment to sections  2  and  49  of  the

Immigration  Act. This amendment is to provide  for

the  seizure, detention and forfeiture of  vehicles

used  in  the commission of any offence  under  the

Immigration  Act. This is necessary  because  under

existing  provisions, although there  is  power  to

seize, detain or forfeit vessels below 75 tons used

in  the  commission of any offence under  the  Act,

there  are no similar provisions for vehicles.  And

traffickers  have  been known to  use  vehicles  to

convey  illegal  immigrants at the point  of  entry

into  Singapore  to places of hiding  and  shelter.

This  amendment  will  be an  additional  deterrent

against trafficking of illegal immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last decade there has been a steady

increase  of  crimes in Singapore. In 1972,  20,208

seizable offences were committed in the Republic as

against   15,752  in  1962.  This  represented   an

increase  of  4,456 cases, or 22.1  per  cent.  The

average number of seizable offences committed  over

the last ten years, that is, between 1962 and 1972,

was   19,776.  However,  the  number  of   seizable

offences  for  the years 1970, 197] and  1972  were

19,835,  22,564 and 20,208 respectively. There  are

no  signs that this upward trend has abated for, in

the first six months of this year, the number



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>



of  reported seizable offences was 10,611. If  this

rate   continues,  the  total  number  of  seizable

offences for 1973 should be well over 20,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, robbery is one of the prevalent

offences  in the Republic. The number has increased

sharply  in recent years. In 1968 there were  1,067

cases  of  robbery. But within a  period  of  three

years  this  figure has doubled for in  1971  there

were 2,146 cases and in 1972 there were 1,715 cases

of  robbery.  But what is disturbing is  the  rapid

increase  of  robbery cases in Singapore  in  which

offensive  weapons were used. These  are  known  as

armed  robberies. In 1969 there were 473  cases  of

armed  robbery  out of a total of 1,009  robberies.

This works out to 46.9 per cent. In 1970 the number

increased to 821 Out of a total of 1,379 robberies.

This  works out to 59.5 per cent. There were  1,124

cases  of  armed robbery in 1971 out of a total  of

2,146 robberies and in 1972 there were 939 cases of

armed robbery out of a total of 1,715 robberies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offensive weapons used in these robberies

include firearms, knives, bearing scrapers  or  any

sharp  instruments.  This  clearly  indicates  that

crimes  of  violence  have  become  wide-spread  in

Singapore. What is even more alarming is  that  the

number  of  robberies in which firearms  have  been

used has also increased sharply. In 1971 there were

93  robberies in which firearms were used,  and  in

1972  firearms were used in 79 robberies.  However,

in  the  first  half of 1973 alone there  were  127

robberies  where  firearms were  used.  This  is  a

staggering  increase over last year's figure.  This

works  out  to about an average of 21  robberies  a

month,  involving firearms. It has therefore become

vital  and urgent that something drastic should  be

done  to  curb this widespread use of  firearms  if

peace  and  good  order in our Republic  is  to  be

maintained.  It is well known that  those  who  use

firearms  in  the  commission of criminal  offences

when  resisted do not hesitate to open fire to maim

or to kill their victims. They have even less hesitation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



to  open fire at the police when  they  are

confronted. Some even shoot to kill in cold  blood.

Hon.  Members may recall the incident in the middle

of  this year of the detective police constable who

intervened in a dispute between a bus driver and  a

motorist at Katong. The motorist turned out  to  be

one of the top 10 criminals in the wanted list.  He

pulled out his gun and in cold blood shot twice  at

the  detective constable. He then relieved  him  of

his  service revolver and calmly walked away.  This

year   the  Police  Force  lost  two  of  its  best

officers,  shot  dead  in  two  separate   shooting

incidents.   Early  this  year,  the  police   also

uncovered  a  big-time syndicate for  the  hire  of

firearms  to  thugs  for use in the  commission  of

criminal offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of this grave threat from this

widespread  use  of firearms in the  commission  of

criminal offences, it was clear that the Government

had  to find an effective deterrent to this growing

menace.  It  was also clear that the law pertaining

to  the  use  of  firearms  in  the  commission  of

offences  had  to  be  amended  to  strengthen  its

provisions  and to enhance punishment  so  that  it

could  be  an effective deterrent. Hence  you  have

before you this Arms Offences Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, to give hon. Members a preview of its

deterrent  effect, let me give the figures  of  the

number  of robberies involving the use of  firearms

after  the Bill was introduced in August this  year

as  compared  with  the  figures  previous  to  its

introduction.   For  the  three-month   period   of

September to November 1973, that is, after the Bill

was introduced and its provisions publicised, there

were  only  14 cases of robbery involving firearms.

On  the  other  hand, from January to August  1973,

which  is  a period of eight months, there  were  a

total  of  155  robberies involving firearms.  This

sharp   decline  in  the  incidence  of   robberies

involving  the use of firearms after the  Bill  was

introduced in August was quite dramatic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Arms Offences Bill makes it an

offence punishable with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



death  for any person who uses or attempts  to  use

any  arms  with  intent to maim or  cause  physical

injury  to the victim. "Arm" is defined to  include

firearm,  air-gun, bomb or grenade, etc. Under  the

existing Arms Offences Act, which it is proposed to

repeal,  the  court can either punish the  offender

with death or with imprisonment for life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, which is a new provision, provides the

same  punishment for an accomplice of a person who,

when   committing  or  attempting  to  commit   any

offence,  uses  an arm provided the accomplice  was

present  at  the  scene  of  the  offence  and  may

reasonably  be  presumed to  have  known  that  the

person who had used the arm was carrying it or  had

it  in  his  possession. This clause  provides  for

joint liability on accomplices without the need  to

prove common intention on their part to use the arm

which  would otherwise be necessary if sections  34

and 149 of the Penal Code arc to be invoked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 provides as penalties death or

imprisonment  for life plus caning for  any  person

trafficking  in arms. Any person proved  to  be  in

unlawful  possession of more than two  arms  shall,

until  the  contrary is proved, be presumed  to  be

trafficking  in arms. This is a new  provision.  At

present  persons  trafficking  in  arms  are   only

heavily fined or imprisoned for possession of arms.

Such punishment is manifestly inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 seeks to make a person, who consorts

with  or is found in the company of another  person

who  is  unlawfully  carrying  or  is  in  unlawful

possession  of  any arm, guilty of an  offence  and

liable  to  the same punishment as the person  with

whom  he was consorting or in whose company he  was

found,  if  the  circumstances raise  a  reasonable

presumption that he knew that such other person was

carrying or had in his possession such arm. This is

another  new provision. It is similar in nature  to

clause  5  and  provides  for  joint  liability  on

accomplices.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 proposes penalties for exhibiting any

imitation arm in a manner likely to put any  person

in  fear  of  death  or  hurt  when  committing  or

attempting to commit or abetting the commission  of

any  scheduled  offence.  This  new  provision   is

necessary  as imitation arms are nowadays  so  well

made  that unless they are closely examined, it  is

quite  impossible  to  distinguish  them  from  the

genuine  ones.  The degree of intimidation  on  the

victim is therefore equally grave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 seeks to make the occupier of any

premises  in  which  any arm  is  found  guilty  of

possession of such arm unless he proves  that  some

other person was in possession of it or that he had

no  knowledge  or reasonable means of knowing  that

such  arm was in the premises and that he had taken

all  reasonable precautions against such arm  being

kept in his premises. This is also a new provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, caning is made mandatory in

respect  of all offences except in cases where  the

offence is punishable with death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, as I have stated in a speech

before,  in  our  system of  criminal  justice  the

raison  d'etre of it is that criminal elements  are

detected  and apprehended and through a combination

of  punitive and rehabilitative measures  they  are

returned  to society in a condition whereby  it  is

hoped  they  are  more amenable to abiding  by  the

social  norms  and  restraints  necessary  for  the

existence  of  organised  society.  This  work   of

ensuring  justice  is performed by  three  distinct

agencies. They are the police, the courts  and  the

prisons. Any inadequacy or weakness on the part  of

any one of the agencies must necessarily jeopardise

the  objective of the entire system. As far as  the

courts  are  concerned,  the  sentences  that  they

impose must be adequate so as not only to act as  a

deterrent  to  repeat offenders but also  to  deter

others  as well. This is particularly important  in

cases of serious crimes and crimes of violence.  In

order  to  ensure  this, the  relevant  laws  where

necessary must and will be amended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the Bill. I think the Minister has given us

a  very detailed but extremely shocking account  of

the rising crime rate in this country. I personally

believe  that  gangsters, hooligans and  thugs  who

resort  to  violence and extreme methods  in  their

criminal  activities must be tried and punished  by

sentences no less than that with which they inflict

their   victims.  To  them  I  think  the   extreme

punishment  is  something which they will  probably

understand.  Anything less than that  will  not  be

effective.  I  am  glad of the  revelation  by  the

Minister  that  over  the last  three  months  some

beneficial results have been noticed. I  take  this

opportunity, Mr Speaker, Sir, to express my support

for  the  Bill  and, secondly, to congratulate  the

police  for the excellent work which we read  every

now and then in the recent past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also disturbed by the fact that to really

seek   a  total  eradication  of  such  crimes   in

Singapore,  we must have maximum co-operation  from

the  people. We do know of occasions when policemen

have  been shot dead at point-blank in the presence

of  members  of  the public and  yet  they  do  not

willingly come forward in spite of announcements in

the  press. Sir, I think we must at the  same  time

encourage  people to come forward in a more  public

spirited manner and unless and until they give  the

police this maximum co-operation, whatever Bills we

introduce  in Parliament will not bring  about  the

desired results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Bill.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, firstly, I would like to

thank  the  Member  for Kim  Seng  for  his  ardent

support of the Bill. Secondly, I cannot agree  more

with the Member when he says that whatever Bills we

pass  and even whatever action the police take  and

however



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



efficiently  they do their job, the prevention  and

reduction  of  the  crime rate cannot  be  achieved

until and unless we have maximum co-operation  from

all members of the public. As far as the Police are

concerned,  they  have been holding  "Police  Week"

yearly  to  get co-operation from the public.  Next

year,  as  some  Members  are  aware,  we  will  be

launching  a  nation-wide  campaign  called   "Keep

Singapore  Crime Free", and I hope that Members  of

Parliament,  community leaders and members  of  the

public  will  join  in the campaign  to  rouse  the

conscience of the public to come out in support  of

whatever  action  is  taken to suppress  crime  and

criminal acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Arms Offences Bill, I explained the

need   to   introduce  legislation  to   stop   the

increasing  use  of firearms in the  commission  of

crime. I also spoke of the urgent need to make  use

of  the  element  of deterrence to  help  cut  down

crime, especially crimes of violence in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, besides firearms, other offensive

weapons  are  also being used in the commission  of

crime, particularly robberies. Armed with offensive

weapons  like  knives, bearing  scrapers  or  other

sharp  objects,  the  robbers  would  waylay  their

victims  in some quiet street or backlane, or  hold

them  up  in their premises, rob them and disappear

quickly.  Most  victims invariably  do  not  resist

because  they  fear injury or being killed.  It  is

well  known  that  these thugs who carry  offensive

weapons  will not hesitate when resisted  to  cause

grievous hurt to their victims.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our records show that these crimes of violence

whether  they  be  armed robbery occurring  in  the

streets,  or in taxis, or extortions, intimidations

and gang clashes by secret society thugs are on the

increase. Hon. Members will remember that  not  too

long ago an example of a blatantly inhuman act  was

perpetrated by thugs on a boy of 14 years  when  he

was set fire upon after kerosene was poured on him.

I  understand that this boy is now emasculated  and

his  whole  appearance is quite hideous.  Our  law-abiding  members of the public have to be protected

from  this  growing threat of brutal  assaults  and

grievous hurt being inflicted upon them apart  from

being robbed by these violent thugs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police have the responsibility of ensuring

peace and good order of our Republic as well as the

personal  safety  of  our  citizens.  However,   in

discharging these duties, the Police have often  to

face  dangers  of attack and assault  from  violent

criminals. These thugs have no hesitation in  using

force   and   violence  against  the  Police   when

confronted  or  in  resisting arrest.  Members  may

recall  the brutal assault on two Police constables

by a mob in a firecracker incident in February last

year. The constables were discharging their duty to

enforce  the  firecracker ban. One of them  was  so

brutally  assaulted  and  sustained  such   serious

injuries  that he now exists almost  as  a  "living

vegetable".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1972, a total of 31 Police officers were

assaulted  by thugs in the course of their  duties.

Of  these, eight Police officers (or 25.7 per cent)

were  injured  or  killed by the use  of  offensive

weapons  or  firearms. Thus  apart  from  our  law-abiding  members of the public, our law enforcement

officers  who undertake risks in discharging  their

duties  must also be protected from being  brutally

assaulted  by  thugs. There is an  urgent  need  to

enhance  the  penalties for  the  various  offences

under  the Penal Code so that they will  act  as  a

deterrent  to offenders from maiming or  inflicting

hurt on any person



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



whether he is a member of the public or any  public

officer who is discharging his duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill proposes to increase the

maximum  punishment for rioting with violence  from

two  years  to  five  years,  and  caning  is  made

mandatory.  Clause 3 further provides that  if  any

arms or offensive weapons are used which are likely

to   cause  death,  this  offence  will   be   made

punishable  with  imprisonment of seven  years  and

caning,  instead  of  three  years  and/or  a  fine

presently  provided in section  148  of  the  Penal

Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill any person found guilty of

obstructing  a public servant from discharging  his

duties   with  intimidation  or  assault  will   be

punished  with  imprisonment of up  to  six  years,

instead  of  three years as presently  provided  in

section 152 of the Penal Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, if the offender inflicts hurt to

prevent  a  public  servant from carrying  out  his

duties, he will be punished with imprisonment of up

to  five  years,  instead of three years  presently

provided under section 332 of the Penal Code. He is

also  liable to be caned for this offence.  If  the

public  servant  sustains grievous hurt,  then  the

offender will be punished with imprisonment  of  up

to 10 years in addition to caning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important amendment involves offences

against the person. Under clause 7 of the Bill, any

person  who  voluntarily  causes  hurt  to  another

person  by  the  use of dangerous  weapons  or  any

corrosive substance likely to cause death  will  be

imprisoned  up  to  five years,  instead  of  three

years. If this offence results in grievous hurt  to

the person, under clause 8 of the Bill he is liable

to imprisonment for seven years and caning as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to make caning mandatory for

robbery and robbery with hurt. Under clauses 14  to

16  of the Bill these offences are punishable  with

caning  of not less than four strokes to  not  less

than  six  strokes in addition to the  imprisonment

term already provided in the Penal Code.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



These  offences  will no longer  be  punishable  by

imposition of a fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a robbery, if an offender is armed or uses any

deadly weapon to cause grievous hurt or attempt  to

cause death to any person, the punishment for  this

offence is increased under clause 19 of the Bill by

caning with not less than 10 strokes in addition to

the term of imprisonment already provided under the

relevant section of the Penal Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for gang robbery are also enhanced.

In  the  Bill  any person who commits gang  robbery

will be punished with imprisonment for life or with

imprisonment  for  a term of up  to  10  years.  In

addition  he  is liable to be caned with  not  less

than  six  strokes of the rotan. The  provision  of

fining has also been deleted for this offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where murder is committed in the course of a gang

robbery,  every one of its members will be punished

with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life,  or  with

imprisonment  of  up to 10 years. However,  if  the

punishment is other than death, clause  18  of  the

Bill provides that they be caned with not less than

10  strokes,  instead of imposition of  a  fine  as

provided in section 396 of the Penal Code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 401 and 402 of the Penal Code, which

provide   punishment  for  persons  who  habitually

commit  gang  robbery  or  theft,  are  amended  to

provide   for  mandatory  caning  in  addition   to

imprisonment.  The  provision  of  fining  is  also

removed for these offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment for receiving stolen property is

also  increased. In the Bill, whoever is guilty  of

this  offence is liable to be imprisoned  for  five

years instead of three years as provided in section

411  of the Penal Code. In addition he may be fined

for this offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Chua Sian Chin].

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to amend the Corrosive and

Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons  Act  to

provide  for enhanced penalties for offences  under

this  Act  in view of the increase in gang violence

and  the widespread use of gangland weapons in  the

commission  of  crime.  Further  by  enhancing  the

penalties for arms offences, as set out in the Arms

Offences Bill, more criminals may now turn  to  the

use  of  offensive weapons other than firearms  and

corrosive   and   explosive   substances   in   the

commission of offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill proposes to make caning

mandatory  where  a  person  is  found  guilty   of

possessing  any corrosive substances  or  offensive

weapons  in  circumstances which raise a reasonable

presumption  that  he  intends  to  use  these  for

causing  hurt to another person. The offender  will

be  punished with imprisonment of up to 10 years in

addition to caning of not less than six strokes for

this offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a person is found guilty of using any

corrosive  substance  or offensive  weapon  or  any

explosive  substance to cause hurt against  another

person, clause 3 of this Bill proposes that  he  be

caned with not less than six strokes in addition to

life  imprisonment  which is already  provided  for

this offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to increase the punishment

for any offender who has in his possession or under

his control



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



or  manufactures, sells or hires or lends or  gives

to  any  other  person  any scheduled  weapon.  Any

person  on  conviction  of  this  offence  will  be

punished with imprisonment of up to five years  and

caned  with  not less than six strokes, instead  of

three  years and/or a fine not exceeding $3,000  as

provided under subsection (1) of section 7  of  the

existing  Act. The punishment for a repeat offender

is  also  increased  by  imprisonment  for  a  term

varying  from  two to eight years  in  addition  to

caning of not less than six strokes, instead of  an

imprisonment  term  of  one  to  seven   years   as

presently provided in the existing Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Budget address, I mentioned that

officers   in   my  Ministry  were  exploring   the

possibility of restructuring subheads in the Annual

Estimates   with   the  aim  of  streamlining   and

rationalising  their  presentation.   Since   then,

proposals for a new format for the Annual Estimates

have  been  developed  by my  officials  and  these

proposals  have  been  accepted  by  the  Estimates

Committee  of  Parliament. It is necessary  now  to

amend section 17 of the Financial Procedure Act  to

enable a new format to be adopted for the Estimates

of Expenditure for the next financial year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new format all subheads in the Main

Estimates  will  be  codified  to  enable  data  on

expenditure  to  be  processed  with  the  use   of

computers.   The   traditional   sub-divisions   of

Personal  Emoluments (PE), Other Charges,  Annually

Recurrent   (OCAR)   and  Other  Charges,   Special

Expenditure  (OCSE)  will  be  discarded.  Instead,

there   will   be   two   new  categories,   namely

Expenditure  on Manpower (EOM) and Other  Operating

Expenditure  (OOE).  This arrangement  will  enable

direct  manpower costs to be conveniently  grouped.

Also,  the  timescale  posts  are  presented  in  a

summarised  way  according  to  their  Division  of

service so that the picture would not be blurred by

excessive  details. The details, if  required,  are

available  in  a  separate Establishment  List.  In

accordance  with the new subsection (3) of  section

17  of the Financial Procedure Act, this list  will

be laid before Parliament each year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Now, Sir,I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that this Bill

was committed to a Select Committee by a resolution

of Parliament passed on the 26th of July, 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two written representations were received, from

the  Port  of Singapore Authority and the Singapore

Institute  of  Surveyors, and the Select  Committee

heard oral evidence from four of the representors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee's Report was presented on the 8th

of October, 1973 as Paper Parl. 2 of 1973. Sir, the

Bill  as  now  tabled before the House incorporates

the  recommendations of the Select  Committee.  The

Committee  held three meetings and has recommended,

inter  alia, the following amendments to the Bills:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An amendment to clause 15 of the Bill to

provide  that it shall be one of the functions  and

duties  of  the  Urban Redevelopment  Authority  to

superintend  parking places within the  meaning  of

the  Parking  Places Act (Chapter 90).  It  is  the

intention  that  the Urban Redevelopment  Authority

should  upon its formation take over the  functions

and   duties  of  the  Car  Parks  Division.   This

amendment  will  also  enable the  transfer,  under

clause  12  of  the  Bill, of  the  Superintendent,

officers and staff of the Car Parks Division to the

service of the Urban Redevelopment Authority  which

is necessary in order to effect the takeover.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The amendment of clause 36 of the Bill to

include amendments as proposed by the Registrar  of

Titles. The amendments seek, inter alia, to obviate

the  need for the Urban Redevelopment Authority  to

seek  its  remedy in court in order to  cancel  any

instrument  or assurance which has been erroneously

registered under the provisions of the Land  Titles

Act  or  the Registration of Deeds Act contrary  to

sub-clause  (3)  of clause 36 of  the  Bill  as  it

previously stood.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments also provide that the Authority

may, in any case where an assurance, or a mortgage,

transfer, charge or lease has been executed without

the  written  consent  of the Authority,  lodge  an

instrument  with  the Registrar of  Titles  or  the

Registrar  of  Deeds as the case may  be,  for  the

vesting  in the Authority of the title  to  or  the

estate or interest in the unit in respect of  which

the  assurance, mortgage, transfer, charge or lease

had been executed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The deletion of clauses 41 to 44 of the Bill

and the substitution therefor of the new clauses 41

to  44  as incorporated in the reprinted Bill which

is  annexed  to  the  Report  as  Appendix  I.  The

deletion  of clauses 41 to 44 and the insertion  of

the  four  new  clauses 41 to 44 is  to  take  into

account the model provisions to be incorporated  in

an  Act  of  Parliament when  establishing  a  body

corporate. The new clauses have been drafted on the

advice of the Auditor-General. Briefly, these  four

clauses deal with the keeping of financial records,

appointment of an auditor, powers and duties of the

auditor and the submission of reports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) An amendment to clause 48 of the Bill to

delete  the  word "before" appearing in the  second

line  thereof and to substitute therefor  the  word

"when".  The object of the amendment is to  require

any person who wishes to develop any land to submit

his  plans  and  proposals  simultaneously  to  the

competent  authority appointed under the provisions

of  the  Planning  Act and the Urban  Redevelopment

Authority for processing. The amendment would  also

enable  the  Authority and the competent authority,

appointed under the provisions of the Planning Act,

to  work  in  consultation  with  each  other  when

considering any application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of the House will recall, there were

several  objections  to the  way  this  clause  was

drafted originally, and this amendment meets  these

objections.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Lastly, there is an amendment to insert a new

clause  70  which  will  empower  the  Minister  to

exempt,   by  notification  in  the  Gazette,   any

organisation, person or class of persons  from  any

or  all  of  the provisions of the Bill  if  it  is

deemed fit or necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion* standing in my name as it stands in the Order Paper.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, pursuant to subsection

(1)  of  section  4  of the Nature  Reserves  Act

(Chapter 295), resolves that paragraph 4  of  the

Schedule to the said Act be deleted.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion deals with the Kranji Forest Reserve,

Lot 162-5 Mukim XIII, Sembawang, which has been sub

divided into two Lots: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Lot 162-8 which has an area of 51.313 acres (21 hectares), and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Lot 162-7 which has an area of 2.097 acres (.8 hectare).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Sewerage Department of the Ministry of

the  Environment  requires the first  Lot  for  the

proposed  Woodlands  Sewage Treatment  Works  which

will  serve Woodlands New Town and the Kranji area.

The  site  was chosen, after careful evaluation  of

several  locations, as the most  suitable  for  the

proposed   sewage  treatment  works.   The   Nature

Reserves  Board has agreed to the release  of  this

Lot 162-8.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other subdivided Lot 162-7 was excised on

30th August, 1958, and taken up for the widening of

Wood-lands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



Road.  A resolution approving this  excision

was  passed  by  the Legislative Assembly  on  26th

January, 1959. Unfortunately, the deletion was  not

followed by the requisite Gazette notification.  It

is  now  necessary  to move a fresh  resolution  in

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed to delete the above two

areas  forming the Kranji Reserve from the Schedule

to  the  Nature Reserves Act in the manner provided

under section 4 thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Sir, I beg to move the motion+

standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

+ The motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4  of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270),

approves  the reclamation by Government of  those

portions  of foreshore and sea-bed at Ulu  Pandan

containing a total area of approximately 41 acres

as  shown coloured purple and edged in broken red

and  blue  lines on the plan marked "LAND  OFFICE

RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 7/73" which is deposited  in

the Land Office, Singapore.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that at its sitting on 19th

October,  1971, this House approved the reclamation

of about 371.8 acres of the foreshore and seabed at

Ulu  Pandan shown coloured green and yellow on  the

plan  marked as "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN  NO.

7/73",  a copy of which is displayed in the Library

of  this House for the information of hon. Members.

This  reclamation, which has since  been  completed

except  for  the portion shown coloured yellow  and

hatched  red  on  the plan, was in  line  with  the

development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



layout  plan approved by the Master Plan  Committee

for  the integral development of the foreshores and

adjoining  land  as  an  extension  of  the  Jurong

Industrial Estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approved limit of the reclamation of the

foreshore  line east of Caltex's properties  (shown

coloured  pink),  comprising about  182  acres  and

shown  coloured  yellow and edged  in  blue  broken

lines on the plan, provides for the creation  of  a

sizable   basin  of  water.  However,  on   further

investigation,  it has been found that  this  basin

(shown  coloured purple on the plan) is  liable  to

siltation and is therefore unsuitable for shipping.

On  the advice and with the concurrence of the Port

of Singapore Authority, it is therefore proposed to

realign   the  original  southern  limit   of   the

reclamation by filling up the basin and cutting off

part of the projection as shown coloured yellow and

hatched  red  on  the  plan,  resulting  in  a  new

southern limit of the reclamation as shown edged in

red broken lines.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The realignment of the reclamation limit

necessitates the reclamation of about 41  acres  of

the  foreshore shown coloured purple on  the  plan.

The  approval of the House is now sought  for  this

reclamation which will be undertaken by the  Jurong

Town Corporation, as agent of the Government, at an

estimated  cost  of $2.5 million.  Earth  from  the

nearby  hills  will be utilised as  fill  for  this

reclamation. On completion, the reclaimed land will

be  proclaimed as State land and alienated  to  the

Corporation  on terms and conditions to  be  agreed

with the Commissioner of Lands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4

of  the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves  the

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with

section 4 of the Foreshores Act (Chapter 270),

approves: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the additional reclamation by Government

of a total of 208.5 acres of fore-shore

and seabed at Jurong as shown coloured

green, orange and red on the plan marked

as "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO.

10/73", which is deposited in the Land

Office, Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the construction by Government of the

foreshore structures, namely a dock as

shown edged in dark green, quay walls as

indicated by broken black lines, and a

jetty as shown edged in pink on the said

plan; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the dredging by Government of the seabed

as shown coloured blue on the said plan.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that in October, 1972, this

House  approved the reclamation of a total of about

1,110.2  acres  of the foreshore  at  Jurong  shown

coloured  yellow, purple and hatched in  purple  on

the  plan  marked as "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION  PLAN

NO.  10/73",  a copy of which is displayed  in  the

Library  of this House for the information of  hon.

Members.  The reclamation was to provide additional

land  for industrial development. About 50 per cent

of  this area has already been reclaimed commencing

from the eastern side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messrs. Mitsubishi (Singapore) Heavy Industries

Private Limited, which was allotted the areas shown

coloured  purple and hatched in purple on the  same

plan for ship-building and ship-repairing, has,  in

order to save time and costs, decided to alter  the

original proposed pattern



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



of  the  reclamation by abandoning the  area  shown

hatched  in purple (about 91.3 acres in  area)  and

substituting  in  lieu  thereof  the  areas   shown

coloured  green  and orange (about 114.5  acres  in

area).  It also proposes to construct in the  areas

shown coloured green and purple on the plan a dock,

(shown  edged in dark green), quay walls (shown  in

broken  black  lines) and a jetty (shown  edged  in

pink). All these proposed structures are also shown

in  an  enlarged fashion in the inset drawn on  the

plan.   To   provide  suitable  access   to   these

structures,  it is necessary to dredge  the  nearby

seabed  shown coloured blue on the plan to a  depth

of 35 feet below mean sea level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Town Corporation which supports the

above   proposals  also  proposes  to  reclaim   an

additional  area  of 94 acres of the  foreshore  as

shown  coloured brown on the plan for allotment  to

other shipyards and to create two basins (about 800

feet  wide  and  1,200 feet wide  respectively)  as

shown  hatched  in blue on the plan.  These  basins

will  provide  more water frontage for  marine  and

marine-oriented industries and will further improve

the use of the reclaimed land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporation will bear the cost of additional

reclamation estimated at about $17 million and  the

fill for the reclamation will be obtained from  the

dredging  of  the  areas shown  coloured  blue  and

hatched in blue on the plan and, if necessary, from

the  hills  at Jurong which are being  levelled  to

provide additional industrial sites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, this reclaimed

land  will  again be proclaimed as State  land  and

alienated   to   the  Corporation  on   terms   and

conditions  to  be agreed with the Commissioner  of

Lands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Port of Singapore Authority is presently

conducting  preliminary studies on the  development

of  seaward recreational facilities for the benefit

of  our citizens as well as tourists. Broadly,  the

development consists of the reclamation of land  on

some  of  the  islands  around  Singapore  and  the

provision  of  electricity and water,  washing  and

bathing  facilities and regular and  frequent  fast

ferry   services  between  the  mainland  and   the

islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the Authority proposes to develop

Pulau Hantu (Besar and Kechil) and Pulau Subar Laut

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



Subar Darat (Sisters Islands) and Coney Island. For

this purpose, it is now proposed to reclaim a total

by  the  Authority. A further sum of  $6.2  million

will be expended on infrastructure and recreational

facilities  at  these  islands.  This  reclamation,

together with the reclamation at Coney Island which

Island   far   such   a   resort,   certain   basic

infrastructure  projects  were  undertaken  on  the

provide  a  major  tropical  beach  and  waterfront

recreational area for the use not only of  tourists

but also the residents of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Golf Course Island which was completed in

March  1971 necessitated the reclamation  of  about

1.9  acres of the foreshore and approval  for  this

reclamation was given under the proviso to  section

4 of the Foreshores Act (Cap. 270). The development

of  the  Swimming Lagoon which is  expected  to  be

completed  at  the  end of this year  involves  the

dredging  and reclamation of about 27.7  acres  off

Sentosa  Island and approval of the House for  this

reclamation is now being sought.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to reclaim Kuching Creek

Estuary  shown coloured green on the plan  for  the

purpose of constructing a Ferry Terminal and  Plaza

Building. The Port of Singapore Authority  will  on

behalf of the Corporation undertake the reclamation

works  which  are  expected to be  completed  in  a

year's time at an estimated cost of $900,000.  Fill

for  this reclamation will be obtained from surplus

material  from  the PSA's own dredging  operations.

The  cost  of  constructing the Ferry Terminal  and

Plaza Building including the cost of ferry boats is

estimated at $4.5 million. The building which  will

incorporate   ticketing  offices  and   Information
