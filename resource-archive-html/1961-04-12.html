<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, after careful deliberation

of  the  acute problems of unemployment  caused  by

Singapore's rapid population increase which is  not

accompanied  by corresponding increase in  economic

expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALERTS our people to the paramount need to expand

employment opportunities, and to this end



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APPROVES the State Development Plan 1961-1964,

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALLS on all sections of the people to unite in

their effort to fulfil the plan, and in particular



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXHORTS the workers and trade union movement and

the  businessmen and industrialists to  play  their

part   in  maintaining  a  fair  balance  of  their

respective interests so essential to success.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed to discuss the general

principles and some of the detailed contents of the

Development  Plan, I think I should  say  something

about  the  manner in which the Plan was  conceived

and  worked  out.  Some such  action  is  necessary

because  there are some people who are  foolish  or

misguided  enough to say that this  Plan  has  been

produced  for  the  purpose of  the  Hong  Lim

by-election. This is absolute nonsense. An undertaking

of  this  magnitude requires months of  preparation

and considerable amount of thought and judgment and

many tedious hours of grinding work on minutiae.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was, in fact, in October 1959, just over four

months of the P.A.P.'s assumption to office, that a

decision  was  taken to prepare a Development  Plan

for the term of office of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, many months of labour had been

devoted  to  shaping out the multitude of  projects

which  eventually found their way  into  the  Plan.

Some  of these projects were then already available

in  rough  form  in  the different  Ministries  and

Departments of the Government. But they had  to  be

developed  into a more definite stage  before  they

could  be  considered  fit  for  inclusion.  It  is

necessary  not  only to have ideas about  what  new

projects  are desirable. In order to  have  a  Plan

worthy of the name, it is necessary to work out the

consequences that follow from the implementation of

such projects. There will be important matters such

as  the  effect on future expenditure  and  revenue

that   must   be  fairly  closely  estimated.   The

contribution  to  the  economic  strength  of   the

country  or to its social development must also  be

properly  assessed. The most important of  all,  an

estimate  of  our financial and economic  resources

must be undertaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for eight months, Ministries and Departments

of   the   Government  worked  on  the  Plan.   The

preliminary  draft  was finally completed  in  June

1960.  It was approved in principle by the Cabinet.

Publication  was  deferred,  however,  because   of

certain unknown factors, particularly the extent of

financial aid that we can get from overseas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, it was decided to defer publication

of  the  Plan  until the outcome of  the  financial

talks  with the United Kingdom Government is  known

and the attitude of the World Bank towards any loan

application from Singapore could be assessed with a

greater degree of certainty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, I proceeded to the United Kingdom

last  July  and held discussions with  the  British

Government.  Members already know  the  outcome  of

these  discussions. A certain amount of aid in  the

form  of grants and Exchequer loans was negotiated.

But  they  only  covered the  period  1960-62.  The

reason  was  that  the British system  of  overseas

financial  assistance  was  based  on  a   5-yearly

budget,  and it was not possible for them  to  make

any commitment going beyond 1962. While uncertainty

in  respect of British financial assistance had not

been completely resolved, at least we knew what  we

could get the next two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My visit and discussions with the World Bank had

proved fruitful in that the World Bank despatched a

Mission  last  September to make  a  study  of  the

financial standing of the Government, the soundness

of  its  financial and economic policies,  and  the

extent  to  which it is credit-worthy. The  Mission

despatched  by  the World Bank had completed  their

report.   They  had  forwarded,  as  a  matter   of

courtesy,  copies of their report to the  Singapore

Government. But it is not the practice of the World

Bank  to release the report for publication. I  am,

therefore, unable to divulge the contents  of  this

report, however pleasant such a task would be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can say that the World Bank is prepared to

consider loan operations in Singapore, and to  this

end  they  would  despatch  a  further  Mission  to

consider  which  of the projects  included  in  the

Development  Plan could be financed by  World  Bank

loans.  The  Mission will arrive in Singapore  next

week.  I am sure that Members will be heartened  by

the  willingness  of the World  Bank  to  negotiate

development loans with the Government of Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the details of the United Kingdom financial

assistance were known and after there was  hope  of

getting World Bank loans, it was decided to  revise

the  original 5-Year Development Plan to take  into

account these matters. By that time, the best  part

of 1960 had already passed and therefore it was, in

the  first instance, necessary to reduce  the  Plan

period  from five years to four years. It was  also

necessary to make minor revisions to some projects.

The  technical  work of revision  is  an  extremely

intricate  and  arduous one. And officials  in  the

Ministry of Finance who were responsible for making

the detailed and revised version deserve all credit

for  the  expeditious and thorough manner in  which

they carry out their work. And so it was that early

this  year,  proof  copies of the Development  Plan

were  sent to the Government Printer, who  accepted

this  work  on a priority basis. It was, therefore,

possible  to present the Development Plan  for  the

approval of this Assembly today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to be embroiled in the details

of  the  Plan  itself. They are there in  published

form for everyone to read. But I think I should set

out  the  principal  lines along which  fundamental

thinking on the Plan took.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start with, it was necessary to examine the

economic  structure of our country in some  detail,

and  to  analyse the principal problems facing  us.

Everybody  knows that the supreme challenge  is  to

match our population growth with at least a similar

rate  of  expansion to provide jobs for our growing

population.  In Chapter I of the Plan, the  problem

is  analysed lucidly and in detail, and I recommend

all  those  who are concerned with the  affairs  of

State  to  study  this chapter of  the  Development

Plan.  It  makes  for  sober  reading.  It  is   an

excellent  antidote  to those  given  to  political

euphoria  to be reminded of the stern and objective

facts of our economic life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem then having been passed, it is

necessary to develop a set of solutions. But  there

is  an  intermediate stage. We must find  out  just

what our sinews are; more simply, how much money do

we have in the kitty today. How much



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



money  we can expect to have in the kitty tomorrow.

Where  the  contribution from our own resources  is

inadequate,  how  much can we  get  from  overseas.

Here, I may perhaps be permitted to digress for the

moment to answer some exceedingly foolish criticism

of  the fact that we go overseas for financial aid.

There  is no developing country in the world  which

spurns   overseas  aid,  be  the  country  in   the

Communist world or in the non-communist world. What

we  have to ensure is that the aid which we receive

is  consistent  with our self-respect  as  a

self-governing  people, that is to say, that no  strings

are  attached  to  this aid  that  go  against  the

policies which we ourselves favour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An appraisal of our domestic resources is made in

Chapters  III,  IV  and V of the Plan.  Chapter  II

reviews the past performance of Government finances

and  Chapter IV attempts a forecast of revenue  and

expenditure  for  the Plan period. Those  forecasts

are  as  close as we can make them, but in an  open

economy  such  as  ours,  we  are  exposed  to  the

fluctuations of world trade generated  abroad.  The

forecasts  of  revenue are based on the  assumption

that no significant recession in trade develops  in

the World economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimate of our total resources available for

financing the Plan shows that most of the money  we

need must come from our own pockets. Out of a total

need  of  $871  million, no less than $591  million

must  be provided by our own people. These domestic

sources  of finance fall into three groups.  First,

the projected revenue surpluses of $116 million for

the  next  four years. Then, there are the  Reserve

Funds   in  the  Government  and  Statutory  Boards

amounting  to $149 million. Finally, we shall  have

to float loans in the Singapore market amounting to

$230 million in the next four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External assistance has been set down at $280

million  or  some  32  per cent.  This  is  not  an

excessive amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan itself as summarized in Chapter III

envisages a total capital expenditure by Government

and   Public  Authorities  of  an  amount  of  $871

million. Of this, $508 million contributes towards



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



strengthening our economy in one way or the  other.

That  is  to  say, more than half of  our  proposed

investment  programme  in  the  public  sector   is

intended  to  increase our economic  strength.  The

balance goes principally to social development,  of

which by far the largest item is to house the

over-crowded  citizens of Singapore. Housing Development

is  expected to use $154 million in the  next  four

years.  The  programme now prepared by the  Housing

and  Development Board will run into 1965 when they

expect  to build 51,000 houses at a cost of  nearly

$200  million.  This  is  an  all-time  record  for

Singapore and, indeed, I suspect, in the  whole  of

Asia  there  is no housing project so comprehensive

as the one we are undertaking, if we relate it to a

population basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education takes a tremendous slice of our Social

Development  Programme, and nobody can regret  that

we  have to do so. What is regrettable is that  the

parents of Singapore in the last 16 years had  been

so  prolific in their capacity as parents that they

have  created  for the whole country a  problem  of

almost terrifying dimensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to discuss the other contents of

the  Development  Plan. I have no  doubt  that  the

Ministers  concerned  will have  to  say  something

about their own development proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to take a broader perspective and set out

the methods whereby we can overcome these problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need hardly mention that the problem we have to

solve  is  how to create more jobs for our  growing

population. This has been repeated ad nauseam. I do

not   want  to  say  further  except  to  pose  the

magnitude  of the problem. Reduced to the  simplest

terms, by 1964, we shall have to create 84,000  new

jobs.  How do we get about it? What must we  do  to

give  the  country a fair chance of creating  these

new jobs? What must we refrain from doing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important that everyone understands

the   answers   to   these  three  questions.   The

Government alone is not the sole dispenser of jobs.

By our own



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



efforts,  we cannot solve the problem of increasing

unemployment unless the people themselves and their

leaders in their respective spheres of activity, be

they  the  labour unions, the entrepot  trade,  the

industrial concerns - unless as I said the people and

the  leaders  are  prepared to observe  a  code  of

conduct  that  amounts almost to a code  of  social

discipline.  Unless these things are done,  then  I

say  that the Government, by its own efforts,  will

not  be able to solve the grave problems ahead.  To

this  end,  therefore, we cannot neglect  to  drive

home to the people of Singapore the seriousness  of

the  situation and the self-control that they  must

exercise if we are to see this country through  the

difficult period ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In theory, the solution to our problem is a

simple  one.  You  want to create more  jobs.  Your

trade in which you depend for your livelihood to  a

great  extent will not increase all that fast.  You

therefore industrialise, that is to say, you  build

new  factories, thereby giving jobs to your growing

population. That is the theoretical answer. In  its

practical implementation, however, many snags arise

and  many bugs have to be ironed out. It is in  the

work  of  ironing out the bugs and  overcoming  the

snags that a major concerted effort must be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me discuss some of the major problems of

industrialisation. The first is  that  to  have  to

build  factories we must have the people  who  know

what factories to build and how to build them;  and

having   built   them,  know  how   to   run   them

efficiently.  This  is an incontrovertible,  indeed

self-evident, proposition and yet very  few  people

are aware of the fact that this is one of our major

obstacles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sources of difficulty are many. Our

businessmen are conversant in trade. They have less

experience  in  manufacturing.  Where   there   are

opportunities,  no  doubt eventually  someone  will

take  advantage of it. But what we need  now  is  a

programme  of  accelerated  industrialisation  fast

enough  to  mop  up our pool of unemployed  and  to

absorb  the  young people who will be  looking  for

work  in the years to come. The scale of the effort

that must be mounted is something that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



is  unprecedented  in  the  history  of  Singapore.

Therefore,  special measures have to  be  taken  to

make   possible  industrialisation  at   the   rate

required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain things are necessary for rapid

industrialisation.  We  must  have  factory  sites,

supplies of power, water, roads, communications and

port  facilities. These are being provided  for  in

the  Plan.  But  the industrial estates  you  build

would  be  a sheer waste of money unless  you  know

that industrialists are willing to set up factories

on your estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local industrialists will be encouraged to

the  maximum  extent  to take  advantage  of  these

opportunities. But in the first phase, at any rate,

it  is  certain that we shall require manufacturers

from  abroad to invest in industries in  Singapore,

either by themselves or in participation with local

industrialists. But no manufacturer from abroad has

any  obligation  to Singapore to set  up  factories

here.  They  will consider investment in  Singapore

only if they see that it is profitable to do so not

only immediately, but over a number of years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, vital for our survival that we

made  the  conditions  attractive.  There  are  the

economic  inducements such as the Pioneer  Industry

Legislation  which exempts certain  new  industries

from payment of income tax for up to five years. We

can create favourable conditions for new industries

if  we  are prepared to set up import duties, which

must   have  the  effect  of  raising  prices   and

increasing the cost of living. We may try to extend

our  overseas  markets by various  kinds  of  trade

agreements with our neighbours. These all  help  to

make investment in Singapore attractive both to the

domestic as well as the overseas manufacturer.  But

more  important than these matters is to  create  a

climate  of  economic stability and  confidence  so

that  people  who  make  the decisions  whether  to

invest  in  Singapore or not know for certain  that

the calculations which they now make have a reasonable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



chance  of  fulfilment.  One  of  the   most

important elements in this climate of confidence is

stability in labour-management relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility for maintaining good

labour-management relations rests not merely with  labour,

not  merely  with management; nor is it the  entire

responsibility of the Government. It  is  necessary

to have all three parties working towards an agreed

objective  and  agreeing also on the means  whereby

inevitable differences must be resolved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have already known by now the

general form of agreement which the Government  and

the  T.U.C. have come to. We have  demarcated  the

sphere  of  the  economy consisting  of  industrial

enterprises which have a significant export market.

In  this  sphere  of the economy,  the  T.U.C. has

accepted  that  stability in wages is  a  desirable

objective  to  attain and they will  do  everything

that is possible to contribute to such stability. I

think  this is a significant advance in  our  quest

for industrial peace with justice which is the only

base on which we can build economic stability and a

climate of confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contribution of the Trade Union movement can

be  a valuable one. I think it will be welcomed  by

everyone who has Singapore's interest at heart. But

may  I  say to the employers that it is not without

difficulty  that we have persuaded the Trade  Union

Congress  to  this  working arrangement?  I  expect

employers  to respond to this effort of the  T.U.C.

with   an   equally  understanding   and   generous

attitude.  It would be a disaster if the  employers

were  to  regard this as a signal whereby they  can

mount an offensive against the workers or the Trade

Union  movement.  Any action to take  advantage  of

union restraint by provocative action would be  met

with  stern  disapproval by the P.A.P.  Government.

But if the employers were to respond generously  to

the T.U.C.'s policy, then I think we have the basis

on  which  to  build  up  better  labour-management

relations  so  that the benefits from this  through

improved  productivity can  be  shared  in  a  just

manner between capital and labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not regard the agreement whose outline has

been  published today to be the first and last step

in   our   quest   to   improve   labour-management

relations.  The general proposals will have  to  be

examined  in  further  detail  so  as  to   produce

concrete working rules. But this I wish to  say  of

the   trade   union  leaders  with  whom   I   held

discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are fully aware of the challenge to the

economy  in  general  and  to  the  working   class

movement  in  particular that is posed by  mounting

unemployment.   They  are   also   aware   of   the

limitations as regards the means that we can use in

the   present   phase   of   Singapore's   historic

development to meet these problems. But  they  find

themselves in a dilemma.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Union movement in Singapore has always

been   a   militant  one.  Aggressive  policy   and

aggressive tactics were necessary in the  past  not

merely  because the employers were fully  supported

by   the  instruments  of  State  power  under  the

colonial regime. The Trade Union movement also  had

to lend its strength to the anti-colonial struggle.

Further, a large section of the movement, which  is

based  on  the  Chinese working  class,  draws  its

ideological inspiration from revolutionary Marxism.

A  number  of  union cadres are  being  trained  to

analyse the problems they meet in terms of

Marxist-Leninist concepts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention here to enter into a

philosophic  discourse on the merits  or  even  the

relevance  of  these revolutionary  tenets  in  the

context of our Island State. All I want to  say  is

that, this being the case, the top level leadership

of the Trade Union movement will need to explain to

the  leadership at lower levels and to the rank and

file,  the  nature  of  the  changed  situation  in

Singapore.  For myself, I think their readiness  to

declare themselves in favour of wage stability as a

general  condition of our manufacturing  industries

shows  not  only  a realistic acceptance  of  harsh

reality,  but  it  also shows a welcome  degree  of

political courage. The Government is aware  of  the

many  traps and pitfalls that still lie  ahead  for

both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



the  unions  and  for ourselves. But  there  is  no

reason  why, if all parties concerned are  prepared

sincerely  to work towards the objective  that  has

been agreed upon, success cannot be achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent some time dwelling on the

prerequisites   for  successful  industrialisation.

because  the  principal purpose of the  Development

Plan  is to make possible private investment,  both

from  domestic  and external sources,  on  a  scale

massive enough to provide the additional jobs  that

we need.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from improving labour-management relations,

there  are other matters needing attention.  It  is

necessary  for the Government actively to encourage

the  establishment  of new industries.  I  think  a

review  of  our past efforts and future  intentions

will be appropriate here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have done in this field has been

principally in the way of building up a preparatory

organisation  and doing the basic  researches  that

are  necessary.  We  have been  fortunate  to  have

received a tremendous amount of assistance from the

United  Nations. They have been extremely  generous

and   helpful   in  the  supply  of   experts   and

technicians.  The Industrial Survey Mission  headed

by  Dr Winsemius arrived in Singapore last October

and  a follow-up team to complete their work is now

arriving in Singapore. The team consists of experts

in   various   branches  of  industry-shipbuilding,

chemical  engineering, electrical goods, metal  and

engineering industries. These experts have prepared

or  are  in  the  process of  completing  technical

reports  on  what industries can be established  in

Singapore in their respective fields, having regard

to  both  the  economic and technical  limitations.

There  is also a powerful team of steel experts  in

Singapore    under    the   leadership    of    Mr

Schereschewsky.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These technical reports on investment

possibilities  which  are prepared  by  top-ranking

world experts would be of invaluable assistance  to

us  in  our effort to promote the establishment  of

new industries. Industrialisation has often



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



been  taken as a vague concept. What is needed here

is  less general talk on industrialisation and more

concrete ideas on exactly what type of factories we

can  establish in Singapore and how  it  is  to  he

done.  Such ideas can only be developed  by  people

who   have  experience  in  particular  industries.

Without their concrete proposals, we shall still be

in the stage of vague generalisations, out of which

the  bricks  and  mortar and machines  of  industry

cannot  be  created. The United Nations  Steel  and

Industrial  Missions  study  particular  industries

which  in  their opinion are feasible in Singapore,

and this will give us something to work on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work itself will be carried out by the

Economic Development Board. I have mentioned to the

Assembly  on a previous occasion that  we  have  at

last found suitable top personnel to man the Board.

They will be ready for work in six weeks' time when

the  Director  and important engineering  personnel

will  have  arrived  in  Singapore.  The  work   of

drafting   the   Bill  establishing  the   Economic

Development  Board  is proceeding  and  I  hope  to

introduce  this  Bill at the next  session  of  the

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have achieved some success in

establishing new industries in Singapore, the major

effort  has yet to be mounted. After two  years  of

arduous  work  and with the generous assistance  of

the United Nations technical assistance, we have at

last  reached  a  stage where  we  can  mount  this

effort.  But  let no one be deceived into  thinking

that   once  the  Economic  Development  Board   is

established  and technical reports  digested,  then

factories  will  mushroom  all  over  the  face  of

Singapore  overnight.  This  simply  cannot  happen

because  of  the  large amount of preparatory  work

that must be put in before the factories themselves

appear.  It must take some time to achieve pace  in

development. Given the most favourable  conditions,

it  will  be  some years before we  get  into  full

stride.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the problem of mounting

unemployment can hardly be set aside  to  wait  the

fruition  of our effort on the long-term programme.

The  U.N. Industrial Mission is fully aware of this

and  has  recommend that over the next few years  a

crash    programme   to   create   new   employment

opportunities be carried out. It has  selected  two

areas  where  the  creation of  employment  can  be

accelerated  in  a short space of time.  These  are

employment    on   board   ships    belonging    to

international  lines making use of Singapore  as  a

port  of call, and, secondly, the expansion of  our

ship breaking industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are matters of immediate importance, and I

may  perhaps  be  permitted to dwell  on  them.  As

regards  employment on board ships, the  Government

has  held discussions with the principal shipowners

and   has   proposed,   for  their   consideration,

modifications in the present system of registration

of  seamen  for  employment on ships.  The  present

system  has the disadvantage of being unduly  rigid

and  automatic  in  its application.  There  is  no

choice  allowed  either to the  seamen  or  to  the

shipowner as regards the placing of seamen. It was,

therefore,  proposed  that  Company  Registers   be

introduced  whereby some choice is  made  available

both  to  the shipowner and to the seamen.  At  the

same    time,   training   facilities   have   been

established  to  increase  the  attractiveness   of

Singapore as a port of recruitment for seamen. With

the  co-operation  of  one of the  larger  shipping

lines, training courses for saloon workers on ships

will  commence this month. The Polytechnic has also

introduced  courses  for  marine  engineers,   deck

officers  and  wireless operators. Shipping  lines,

both local and international, have agreed to employ

the  graduates.  By these, and other  measures,  we

hope   to  increase  the  rate  of  employment   of

Singapore  seamen on board local and  international

lines.  Recent  figures have shown  a  welcome  and

substantial  increase. The figure for last  month's

recruitment  saw  a  50 per cent  increase  on  the

monthly average of the previous year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase the attractiveness of the port of

Singapore  to  shipping lines, the  Government  has

decided  to introduce round-the-clock port services

which  the shipping lines had asked for. Staff  for

the Immigration and Health Departments will have to

be  increased  to  provide the additional  services

which  we  hope to introduce by the middle  of  the

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be interested to know that these

measures  have been worked out in consultation  not

only  with the shipowners, but also with the  Trade

Union  Congress.  This  is  an  example  where

co-operation  between  Government,  the  Trade   Union

movement  and  employers  can  produce  substantial

benefits to everyone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards ship-breaking, our experience has been

less  happy.  I  held a meeting  with  local  firms

engaged  in  ship-breaking  and  offered  them  the

maximum  facilities and inducement by way of  land,

supply  of working capital, assistance in  training

if  they  would  work  out  a  programme  of  rapid

expansion.  Unfortunately,  our  shipbreakers   are

limited  in their technical and financial capacity.

They  also  lack  the vision that is  necessary  in

developing an extensive industry which can  compete

in  the  international market. Accordingly, I  have

got  in touch with ship-breaking firms overseas and

am in the process of discussing with them the terms

under  which they could operate in Singapore.

Ship-breaking  is  an  ideal  industry  for  mopping  up

unemployment, because it employs large  numbers  of

people, requires a relatively small amount of fixed

capital, and has a ready market for its product.  I

therefore feel justified to offer to these overseas

shipbreakers  extremely favourable terms.  Briefly,

these  include  the  supply of working  capital  at

rates  well below commercial rates. Good land  will

be  made  available to them and the  Government  is

prepared to bear a substantial part of the cost  of

training  of  workers. They can also be  considered

for pioneer industry status.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to say something about the manner in

which  the  Development Plan is to be  implemented.

First,  of course, we must make sure that  we  have

the  money  to  pay  for  the  cost  of  the  Plan:

estimates   and  forecast  of  revenue   and   loan

possibilities have been made in the  Plan  and,  if

these  are realised, then the financial bottlenecks

to  the implementation of the Plan would have  been

solved. What remains to be done then is to gear  up

our  administrative  machinery  and  our  corps  of

engineers, architects and other technicians to  the

physical effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that no obstacle is created by

way  of administrative delays, a reorganisation  of

the   Finance   Ministry   has   been   undertaken.

Development  proposals will no longer be  processed

by  Treasury officials as they had been done in the

past.  Treasury  officials have been  trained,  and

quite rightly, to regard every application for  new

expenditure  with the gravest suspicion.  Obviously

if  financial approval for development  expenditure

has to be processed in this manner, it is likely to

result  in  interminable  correspondence  and  even

acrimonious   disputes.  Some   new   system   must

therefore be introduced. We have now established an

Economic Development Committee consisting  of  both

Ministers and senior Government officials. I myself

as  Finance Minister am Chairman of this  Committee

and  the  Minister  for National Development  is  a

permanent   ministerial  member.  Ministers   whose

development  proposals are under  examination  will

attend  as  members  of  the  Development  Planning

Committee. The officials will include the  Director

of  Public Works, the Permanent Secretary (Economic

Development),  and  Assistant  Secretaries  of  the

Development   Secretariat  which  has   also   been

recently set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Secretariat will be a new branch

of the Finance Ministry. It will concern itself not

only  with  the  routine processing of  development

proposals but also with the checking up of progress

on  the implementation of development projects.  It

would,  therefore,  serve as  a  central  reporting

system on the progress made in all fields of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



Development Plan. The Development Secretariat  will

therefore  be  able to alert the Government  should

any project lag behind its performance programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Committee will be

concerned with matters of policy and priorities. No

project   will   be  proceeded  with   unless   the

Development Committee has given its clearance. This

clearance,   however,   is  subject   to   detailed

examination  by a Committee of permanent  officials

with  the Director of Public Works as the Chairman.

This Committee is known as the Economic Development

Sub-Committee  and will replace the present  Public

Works Standing Committee. In order to emphasise the

performance aspect of planning implementation,  the

Director   of  Public  Works  has  been   appointed

Chairman  of the Committee in place of the Treasury

official  who  took the chair of the former  Public

Works Standing Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the administrative changes which are

necessary to cut out red tape.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided also to strengthen the staff of

the  Public  Works Department and have  applied  to

five countries for assistance in the recruitment of

engineers, architects, quantity surveyors and other

grades  of professional technicians. The number  of

additional staff at professional level we now  need

is  52.  The countries we have approached  are  the

United  Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan  and

Israel.   The  overseas  staff  will  be  recruited

against  supernumerary posts: that is to say,  they

will    not   be   held   against   the   permanent

establishment  which we reserve as promotion  posts

for  our  junior engineers. The Director of  Public

Works  has  also been asked to draw up  his  future

staff  needs to enable him to cope with the greatly

enhanced volume of work that the Plan calls for. He

is  also starting a departmental training scheme to

train junior technical staff in various branches of

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards current performance, I will leave it

to   the  Ministers  concerned  to  report  to  the

Assembly  the progress now being achieved.  I  only

need refer to a statement made by Mr Ong Eng Guan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



in   a  Hong  Lim  by-election  meeting  that   the

Government had done nothing beyond building some 26

community centres. He is reported to have said that

the  Government  is  building  no  schools  and  no

houses.  This is a calculated and blatant falsehood

so  characteristic of the former  Member  for  Hong

Lim. I await with interest to see whether his  two

companions  still in the Assembly will be  prepared

to repeat this outrageous lie.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approval we are seeking in the Assembly or

the  Development  Plan does not  mean  approval  in

detail  of  each and every item of the  Plan  as  a

fixed  and  permanent project to  be  carried  out

during  the Plan period. As has been emphasised  in

the  text  of the Plan itself, there must  be  some

flexibility in implementation. It may be  necessary

to  re-examine some projects. It will certainly  be

necessary  to  revise the cost  of  those  projects

whose   detailed  planning  had   not   reached   a

conclusive stage. These amendments to the Plan,  as

and  when they are made and decided upon,  will  be

reported  to  the Assembly for its  approval.  The

most convenient occasion for such reports would,  I

think,  be  the Budget session. Where new  projects

are  introduced  and  have  to  be  proceeded  with

without;  further delay, then the approval  of  the

Assembly  will  be  sought  in  the  normal  manner

through Supplementary Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

last  year, on 30th May, 1960, before the  Minister

for  Finance  went  to the United  States  and  the

United  kingdom to seek loans, I read in the  Press

about  a  so-called  Five-Year  Plan.  Very  little

details  were given. Although I was an  Assemblyman

in the Government, it was the first time I heard of

such  a Plan. There had never been any discussions.

That was nearly a year ago. During this long period

of time, the people never heard anything of this

so-called  Plan.  Why  was it never published  before?

Were the authors of this so-called Plan ashamed  of

it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at the height of the Hong Lim

by-election, when the Government is facing the people,

the  Five-Year Plan is reduced to a Four-Year  Plan

and  published. What is the difference between this

Four-Year  Plan  and the Five-Year  Plan  announced

nearly  a  year  ago?  The Finance  Minister  then

announced - Sir, I would like to refer to  a  cutting

from  the Straits Times dated 30th May, 1960, since

I do not have the full paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There are many other things in the Development

Plan to be published in a few months' time.'



<br><br>it  was  never published. Now in the midst  of  the

Hong Lim by-election, we have a new Four-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the course of the last

22  months,  I  have heard of too  many  plans  and

beautiful speeches, but, unfortunately, I have  yet

to see one Plan implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, look at this pamphlet published by the

Ministry  of  Culture.  It is  called  "A  Year  of

Construction" based on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

Speech in June 1960:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`June 1960 to June 1961 will be called a year of

construction,'



<br><br>But,  Sir, construct what? It is now already  April

1961. Only community centres, as far as I can  see!

We  will  support  any plan aimed  at  helping  the

people, but such plans should be elastic and should

be   meant   for   implementation  and   not   just

electioneering stunts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope this Government is sincere and honest by

letting the people know the truth. Show the  people

something, and not just talk. Twenty-two months  is

not too short a period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, 13 City Councillors did more

work  in 15 months than this Government with a  big

majority has done in 22 months.



<br><br>3.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion of the

Minister for Finance. I feel it is necessary for me

to say a few words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the P.A.P. came into power, it has shown

that  it has an energetic programme. It has exerted

its utmost to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



protect  the livelihood of the people of  Singapore

and  to  resolve all the problems facing  them.  We

have a very bright future. We say clearly that  the

People's Action Party is more progressive than  the

previous  Government.  We are  confident  that  the

people  will  fully support the Plan,  because  its

success  concerns the livelihood of the  people.  I

hope the people will be able to understand and  not

to  construe this Development Plan as a panacea for

all  kinds  of  ills.  They  must  not  think  that

everything  can be solved by the Plan  alone.  This

Plan,  if  it  is  to succeed, will  only  help  to

alleviate  our unemployment problem.  I  hope  that

during  the  period  of this Development  Plan  all

signs  of  the colonial era will be wiped  out.  We

must   know  that  difficulties  lie  ahead.   Many

countries   are   facing  many  serious   problems,

especially unemployment. I wish to point  out  that

even   America   is  facing  serious   unemployment

problems.    Therefore,    in    comparison,    the

unemployment  figures in those  countries  are  not

less  than ours, but they find themselves in a more

advantageous   position  because  they   are   more

industrialised  and  they  have  more   scope   for

expanding   their   industries.   Moreover,   their

colonies are able to give them economic support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the people can understand that our

Four-Year  Plan  cannot solve every question  and  every

problem immediately. We must know that the problems

of  unemployment  and instability in  commerce  and

other  fields  are  natural. And  this  colonialist

clique   is   making  things  difficult   for   us.

Therefore, the difficulties which we have  to  face

are  unavoidable. We must not say that we can solve

every problem just by carrying out this Development

Plan.  So  if the people hope to achieve a  happier

future,  they  must unite together in the  struggle

against the colonial economic system in Malaya  and

also  create new conditions favourable to a  merger

between  Singapore  and the Federation  of  Malaya.

This merger will basically solve difficult problems

in our livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will also point out that the

reactionaries  in our country are usually  inimical

to us. They criticise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



our  Government with ill intentions.  Not  only  do

they not encourage efforts towards a good end,  but

they  also  unscrupulously spread rumours attacking

the  P.A.P. They use this tactic in order to divide

the people. They say that the P.A.P., since forming

the Government two years ago, has not done any good

work. These are all lies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now a Member on the opposite Bench said that

our present Plan was introduced because of the Hong

Lim  by-election. This is not correct. Let me  show

him whether our Government has done anything or not

in  these  two years. I must point out a few  facts

here in order to show that these reactionaries  are

only rumour-mongers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements of the people's representative

in  my constituency during the four years under the

present  Government  cannot be compared  with  ours

during  the past 22 months. The previous Government

built  only  four rural roads and one of  them  was

built only when the elections were approaching. But

we  have  in  the short period of 22  months  built

four,  rural roads. Another road has been  approved

and  will  be laid by the Urban and Rural  Services

Committee. As for other public and social  services

such as standpipes and so on, they will be provided

in  the  near future. Our achievements  far  exceed

those of the last Government. All these facts  show

that  they  are part of our programme which  is  of

concrete  benefit. Of course, we are not  satisfied

yet  with all these achievements but will endeavour

still further to serve the people well with all our

hearts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we say that our Four-Year Development

Plan is not brought out just for the purpose of the

Hong  Lim  by-election. Anyone who is irresponsible

enough  to say that the introduction of this

Four-Year  Plan  is for any political purpose is  wrong.

The  introduction of this Plan is for the  good  of

the  people;  to  solve  the  problems  facing  the

people.  We  must  execute the Plan,  and  this  is

important. Therefore, we have brought out this

Four-Year  Development Plan. If some of the  people  are

biased and attack this Four-Year Plan,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



they  are unreasonable and wrong. However, we  must

do things beneficial to the people. Therefore, they

must  support the Government's Four-Year Plan.  And

these rumour-mongers must not further say that  our

Four-Year Plan is brought out just for the  purpose

of  political  expediency  for  the  Hong  Lim

by-election.  This  Plan has been well considered.  It

has not been drafted in just a very short time.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

announced  in this Assembly on the 20th  July  last

year  that the Development Plan had been completed.

The  final  version of the Plan is now before  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan that is before us is the People's Action

Party's  Development Plan. This is the  first  time

that  we  have this sort of Plan in the history  of

Singapore.  It concerns very closely  the  workers,

the  farmers, the hawkers, the businessmen, and the

students. In simple language, it is a Plan  of  the

people of Singapore. It is not merely a Plan of the

People's Action Party. Its success or failure  will

decisively  affect  the  future  prospects  of  the

people.   It   will  also  pronounce  judgment   on

parliamentary democracy - whether it will succeed  or

fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before the P.A.P. came into

power, it announced to the people of Singapore  its

Five-Year  Plan. Let me quote from  this  Five-Year

Plan, The Tasks Ahead [Part I, page 6]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The plans we have laid down are not

over-ambitious ones. They are realistic and are based on

actual existing political and social conditions and

economic  circumstances. In drafting our  plans  we

recognise   that   an   internally   self-governing

Singapore  is not an independent Singapore  because

control of our foreign affairs remains in the hands

of  the colonial office and so in this sense we are

a  semi-colony; we recognise the severe restriction

of  land  space, a mere 210 square miles,  and  the

pressure  of a population now numbering 1½  million

and still growing at the rate of 65,000 a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise that our little island has no

natural resources and our economy has for the  past

100  years  been dependent solely on  the  entrepot

trade,  and  has remained static. We recognise  the

complexities  of our multi-racial society  and  the

special problems which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



they pose. It is within this framework that we must

work.  It is within these limitations that we  must

construct  and lay the basis for a future socialist

society. The next five years will be critical years

of testing not only for the party but for all those

who believe that socialism can be achieved step  by

step through peaceful parliamentary democracy.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy statement has

clearly  pointed out and given us  a  very  correct

analysis  of  the  political, economic  and  social

situation and the resources. On the other hand,  it

also  points out our immediate task and our  future

prospects.  If  there are people who  neglect  this

vivid  reality and who place too high hopes on  the

future,  they will be disappointed. Our Development

Plan  is mainly based on the nine policy statements

announced to the people before the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara, in his speech in the

Second  Session  of this Assembly,  said  that  the

People's Action Party has no intention of deceiving

the  people  into voting for it by  promises  which

cannot be fulfilled. It exhorts the people to  vote

for this realistic but not over-ambitious Plan. The

overwhelming vote won by the People's Action  Party

proves  that  the people have accepted its  correct

analysis  and its policy. If before the  elections,

the  P.A.P. was not prepared to deceive the  people

with  promises of getting the stars, the  moon  and

the sun, it has even less reason now to offer false

hopes   to  the  people.  In  some  of  the   Asian

countries,  parliamentary democracy has  collapsed.

The   reason  is  that  the  Government  in   those

countries, anxious to retain their political power,

have  adopted demagogic politics at the expense  of

integrity  and courage. The Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

also  said that the Government has no intention  of

giving  up  its  policies and its objectives  which

were  evolved  over  a long period  with  care  and

caution. A responsible government cannot recklessly

alter its policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Action Party is a

Party  which honours its promises. Its record  over

the  past six years testifies to this. However, the

ex-Member for Hong Lim, the Member for Punggol  and

the  Member  for  Aljunied said that  the  People's

Action  Party had not done anything to  better  the

lot of the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



and  that the Four-Year Development Plan is only  a

paper  tiger. It is not worth even a cent. Everyone

is  aware  that only people who are afflicted  with

insanity will indulge in this sort of criticism. No

doubt-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I heard the hon.

Member  for  Choa  Chu Kang alleging  that  certain

Members   of  this  Assembly  are  afflicted   with

insanity. That is an unparliamentary expression  to

use of any Member of this Assembly. Will the Member

please withdraw the expression?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. I

withdraw  the phrase people who are afflicted  with

insanity   and   substitute  the  words   `mentally

deficient'.  No  doubt there are still  people  who

have  no  work.  But they have forgotten  that  the

P.A.P. has  not promised that when it  comes  into

power  it  will  solve their problems  immediately.

They  have  supported this Five-Year  Plan  of  the

P.A.P. May I now ask them to restudy this Five-Year

Plan to see if we have gone back on our words,  and

see  if they can find a single sentence which, says

that when the P.A.P. comes into power it will solve

the problem of unemployment overnight? Mr Speaker,

Sir,  ours is a Party with principles and political

faith.  Our  main task is not only centred  on  the

present immediate problems, but it also centres  on

our  long-term  problems. We must not  neglect  the

people  just for the sake of our personal fame  and

interest. We will never desert the people with whom

we  have worked so hard. Our people's faith is  our

faith, and our faith is our people's faith.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all of us are aware that the

only  way to alleviate the unemployment problem  is

through industrialisation, although this cannot  be

done  overnight.  But  if we merely  shout  slogans

without   creating   the   necessary   prerequisite

conditions  for industrialisation, we will  achieve

nothing.  What we must remember is this.  There  is

nothing   which  cannot  be  achieved.   Everything

depends  on us. Given the co-operation between  the

workers,  the  capitalists and  the  Government,  I

believe we will march towards industrialisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, out of a total expenditure of

$871  million, agriculture takes up  about  58  per

cent; and out of this, $53 million will be utilised

for  land and agricultural development. The farmers

and  the rural people are entitled to the care  and

attention  of the Government under this  Plan.  For

example,  they  should get a supply of  electricity

and  water; good roads and the opening up of drains

and  other  drainage  work. At present,  there  are

about  20,000 farmers who are engaged in  producing

foodstuffs   to  meet  the  needs  of   the   local

population.  For example, they produce  pork,  meat

birds,  eggs,  vegetables, fruits  and  fresh-water

fish  and  prawns.  According to  estimates,  their

annual  production is as follows: 750,000 pigs,  16

million  meat birds, 200 million eggs, 34,000  tons

of  vegetables,  1,700 tons of fruits;  and  11,000

tons  of  fish  and prawns. As far as  the  present

population  is  concerned,  our  State   is

self-sufficient  in pig and poultry production.  But  we

still  have  to  import a great quantity  of  eggs,

fish,  prawns, vegetables and fruits  from  outside

countries to meet the needs of the people. In  1959

we  imported  136  million  eggs,  20,000  tons  of

vegetables  from  the Federation,  96,000  tons  of

vegetables from countries other than the Federation

of  Malaya, and 29,000 tons of fish and prawns from

both  the Federation and other countries. The total

value  of  these  foodstuffs  imported  into   this

country is $73,860,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, because of the terrific rate of

increase  of  the  population, we  have  a  greater

demand  for agricultural production. If we  do  not

increase  our  production, we will have  to  import

foodstuffs  from  other  countries,  and  from  the

economic  point of view, this is not beneficial  to

us.  Therefore, our immediate task is  to  increase

our  agricultural production so as  to  reduce  the

foodstuffs imported from other countries. In  order

to  increase  production, we have to see  that  our

agricultural production is mechanised and that  the

area  for  cultivation  should  be  enlarged.   The

Primary Production Department of the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



National Development has carried out a programme to

help  farmers  plough their land; to  provide  them

with  fertilisers and veterinary services,  and  to

organise  seminars on agriculture. All  these  will

help them to increase their knowledge of the method

of cultivation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increase of population, the limited

land  has  now  been  used  up  to  build  houses,

schools,    hospitals   and   community    centres.

Therefore, we have to acquire more land from  other

sources.  According to estimates, there  are  about

10,000  acres of swampy land surrounding the island

of  Singapore. We must convert the 10,000 acres  of

swampy  land into good agricultural land so  as  to

increase  the area for farming. And during  the

4-year  period,  the Government proposes  to  use  $4

million to open up 1,000 acres of agricultural land

and  1,000  acres  of land for prawn  ponds.  These

swampy  lands, which have just been reclaimed,  are

situated   at  Sungei  Serangoon,  Sungei  Seletar,

Sungei Kranji, Sungei Tengah, Sungei Poyan and  Ama

Keng. The Government, after a careful survey,  will

open up these lands for the farmers. It is expected

that  when this survey is completed, there will  be

an  increase of 1,100 farmers and fishermen.  Other

than  these,  there will be 500  workers  who  will

benefit  from this. This 4,000 acres of land,  when

fully   utilised,  will  produce  10,000  tons   of

vegetables  and 1,200 tons of prawns  to  meet  the

demands of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the people of Singapore

will  support this Four-Year Development Plan  with

actual  deeds, so as to enable this Plan to succeed

in  the time envisaged. We must point out that this

Plan  is  not  intended for the coming by-election,

but for the future benefit of the people.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

on  this  side  have  been waiting  for  the  other

Ministers  to  make some detailed comments  on  the

Development  Plan,  but since they  have  not  said

anything  yet,  I have decided that we  should  say

something at this point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few months we have noticed a

change of attitude on the Government side in  their

approach  to various problem's and in their  public

utterances. Now, whether this change of attitude is

also  a change of heart, only the future can  tell.

Whether this is a calculated move based on a

short-term  policy with a specified objective, or whether

it  is  really a change of policy based on a

long-term programme, we do not know. But five months ago

in  this House, the Finance Minister in his  Budget

speech   said  that  economically  the  people   of

Singapore  had done well. The propaganda  was  that

the  people of Singapore under the People's  Action

Party had never had it so good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we on this side maintain, from the facts we

know  and  from  what we have heard from  the  very

people who put them into power, that Singapore  has

done   badly.  Anybody  who  goes  to  the  popular

amusement  parks will have noticed  the  number  of

stalls that are kept closed. On one occasion,  when

I  asked  the ticket collectors why it was that  so

many  stalls were kept closed, the reply was,  "Not

many people have got money to spend nowadays." Sir,

today  the  truth is out, and in the motion  before

the House, the Finance Minister draws attention  to

the  acute  problems  of  unemployment  caused   by

Singapore's rapid population increase which is  not

accompanied  by corresponding increase in  economic

expansion.  We  have all the time maintained,  Sir,

that  the shadow of unemployment is the one spectre

that  bedevils the life of the people of Singapore.

The admission here practically declares that in the

race against unemployment, Singapore's economy  has

slipped backward; that the number of unemployed has

been  on the increase. Sir, I believe that even  at

this moment the problem has been underestimated.  I

beg  to  refer, Sir, to the Development Plan,  page

55,  paragraph  634.  The estimate  of  the  total

unemployed  in 1959 was given as 46,000.  Then,  by

some complicated process of calculation, the annual

estimate  of  the number of unemployed was  somehow

reduced  so that the total of unemployed  requiring

jobs  at  the end of 1964 is estimated at 84,000.

Sir, in the Straits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



Times of Friday, 31st March, the Prime Minister  at

a  rally  in  Fullerton  Square  gave  a  different

figure.  Now, we wonder whose estimate is  correct.

It is said here, Sir, that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Some 40,000 to 50,000 children were born in 1945

and  they  would reach the age of 17 next  year - and

the majority would be looking for jobs.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the headline gives the words-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`1962 - JOBS MUST BE FOUND FOR 50,000 MORE: LEE'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister, in the opinion of the

Finance    Minister,   might    have    given    an

overstatement, but he used his common sense; and we

who  use  our  common sense think  that  if  50,000

people are of age to go into the labour market each

year,  then naturally even if we exclude those  who

do  not want to find jobs, and even if we say  that

there are people who retire, we must remember  that

there  is the continuous influx of people from  the

Federation  into  Singapore  looking  for  jobs.  A

reasonable  estimate would be that at least  25,000

per  year would be looking for jobs. In four years,

one  would reasonably expect something like 100,000

would  be looking for jobs. With a backlog of  some

46,000,  the number must be a great deal more  than

what  is given in the Development Plan; perhaps  50

per  cent more, or even 100 per cent more. So  the

picture is even more serious than has been painted.

Another  aspect we must remember is  that  most  of

those  who are unemployed would be the young people

who,   after   leaving  school,  naturally   expect

employment  of  some  kind. If  after  having  been

trained they find that the years ahead of them show

nothing  but  prospects  of  unemployment,  we  can

imagine their frustration and bitterness. For  that

reason,  we  are  glad that the Government  is  now

embarking  on  this Development Plan and  seriously

tackling  the  problem, even though  belatedly.  We

hope  that  it is not too late for them because  of

the mistakes made in the last two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, paragraph 2 of the motion says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ALERTS our people to the paramount need to

expand employment opportunities,...'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, Sir, the Government is alerting the

people.  We alerted the people during the  election

campaign.  Well,  the People's  Action  Party  held

wonderful  promises that the people were  going  to

have a Utopia.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Nonsense! You gave everything away free.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, the full facts are

begining  to appear so that five months  after  the

Budget    speech,   perhaps   compelled   by    the

circumstances  of  the  Hong Lim  by-election,  the

truth has now to be told.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like the word "expand". We said that the

drastic  cut  in the pay of civil servants  to  the

tune  of millions of dollars was not calculated  to

expand   opportunities  for  employment,  but   was

calculated  to  reduce such opportunities.  Perhaps

the  Government might inquire from their  employees

how   many   people   had  been   thrown   out   of

unemployment,  because  many  of  these  Government

employees  had  to dispense with  the  services  of

domestic  helpers, and indirectly many  shops  have

had  to  curtail purchases of goods because of  the

lack  of  demand from those whose buying power  had

been reduced so drastically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good to note that the Government is

now  going  to  plan  for an  expenditure  of  $871

million in the next four years. We are called  upon

to  approve the State Development Plan. Sir, we are

unable  at  this juncture to go into the detail  of

the Development Plan. We have to go on the basis of

the  objectives, and the objectives are  desirable.

Some of us on this side of the House were concerned

over  the  draft of some of these plans;  over  the

earlier  establishment of some of the phases,  such

as   the  establishment  of  the  Polytechnic,  the

introduction  of low-cost housing  and  such  other

schemes.  But there are certain paragraphs  in  the

Plan which call for comment and questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your leave, I would like to draw on

some of the very important ones. Page 18, paragraph

1.72. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



constructive.  It  is  in language  which  we  find

strange  coming  from  the People's  Action  Party.

However, Sir, we always appreciate a change for the

better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`1.72. However because of Singapore's entrepot

trade,  it is necessary that nothing is done  which

may   seriously  disturb  the  confidence  of   the

business community.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing must be done to disturb the confidence of

the  business community. Sir, this high regard  for

members of the business community is something new.

When  we consulted a business friend, he liked this

sentence  but he said, "But perhaps the  confidence

of  the business community in Singapore has already

been  disturbed. And so disturbed that it may  take

time to recover that confidence." Sir, the next two

sentences  practically contradict their  own  Party

policy  as  enunciated in their booklets.  The  two

sentences run as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Consequently draconic measures successfully used

in some other countries to give mobility to capital

is  not  available to the Government of  Singapore.

Capital  mobilization  for  industrial  development

would  have to be a slow process of persuasion  and

inducement.'



<br><br>Sir, I for one wish that that had been their policy

from the very start. But I would like to read their

statement  of policy in Time Tasks Ahead regarding

loans.   That  is  another  big  change  in   their

attitude.  Now  the Minister for Finance  tells  us

that  there is nothing wrong in getting loans  from

foreign    countries.    We    agree    with    him

wholeheartedly.  We  have  always  said  so,   that

Singapore's prosperity must depend on the  goodwill

of  our neighbours and of all countries which trade

with  us.  But in paragraph 2 on page  25  of  Time

Tasks  Ahead - the P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan 1959-1964

(Part 1) under the heading "Capital", this is  what

we read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The P.A.P. profoundly disagree that the survival

of Singapore depends on foreign capital and foreign

capitalists.  We  say  that  there  are  more  than

adequate   capital  resources  initially  available

locally.'



<br><br>And skipping five lines, it goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is absolute nonsense to say that our survival

depends  on  foreigners when so  much  of  our  own

capital is invested in foreign countries.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>And skipping another seven lines:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our salvation lies in our own hands. There are

no benevolent foreigners knocking around the world,

anxious    to    discharge   these    duties    and

responsibilities which are rightly our own. Let  us

not  face  the  economic problems  in  the  era  of

freedom  with  the mental attitudes appropriate  to

colonial servitude.'



<br><br>Sir,  those  are very strong words. It  practically

means  that  those  who  seek  loans  from  foreign

countries have "the mental attitudes appropriate to

colonial servitude".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Goh: Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I echo the word

"rubbish"!  We on this side are glad that  at  last

common sense is coming to Members on the Government

side and we hope this common sense will remain with

them  for  long and that it is not just a  tactical

move to attain a temporary objective.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> What temporary objective?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, paragraph 5.23 of the

Development Plan (page 48) - the third line reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is, therefore, necessary to look abroad for

financial assistance.'



<br><br>Then the last line of the next paragraph reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Further loans would be sought from the United

Kingdom in late 1962 or early 1963.'



<br><br>Loans have to be sought. It is right that they must

be  sought  for  the  sake of the  welfare  of  the

people.  Sir,  unfortunately during  the  last  two

years, the atmosphere in the different countries of

South-East  Asia has undergone quite some  changes,

and  Singapore  has now to compete for  loans  with

countries which offer a better economic climate. We

read  in  the Straits Times of Monday, 10th  April,

that  the  British  Board of  Trade  is  sending  a

delegation  to  survey conditions in the  different

countries  in  South-East Asia. The Federation  has

also a Five-Year Development Plan and they want  to

spend  the fabulous sum of £589 million - more  than

five  times what Singapore plans to spend.  British

Borneo  has  also its own plans. So have  Thailand,

Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines. What do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



we  offer  to induce foreign countries to  give  us

loans?  I  hope  we  can  offer  greater  security,

greater  stability. I do not know. That is for  the

Government to offer. But we do hope that the offers

made  will  be such that a great deal of  the  loan

money  will  come this way. In the last two  years,

however,  a great deal of capital has gone  out  of

this  country - elsewhere. Anybody who goes to  Kuala

Lumpur  and  visits Petaling Jaya  will  have  this

conviction:  that half of the capital  invested  in

Petaling   Jaya  should  have  been   invested   in

Singapore. It was very unfortunate that because  of

the  lack  of  confidence in  Singapore's  economic

future,  people with capital decided to  invest  in

the  Federation rather than in Singapore.  Sir,  we

have  to face the stern reality of the problem.  We

cannot  blind  ourselves. We have to  recover  this

confidence  and  we hope that the  Government  will

take appropriate measures to ensure that recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, private enterprise was regarded as the key

to  Singapore's economy before, but ever since  the

publication of the People's Action Party  booklets,

people  involved  in private enterprise  have  felt

that  they  must take a back seat, that  the  State

would  extend its control more and more until there

is  less and less scope for private enterprise  and

that,  therefore,  they  would  have  to  look  for

opportunities elsewhere. But I am glad that in  the

Development  Plan  presented  today,  there  is   a

remarkable change in attitude. The last nine  lines

of paragraph 6.45 on page 58 read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But it should be stressed that this solution

consists in inducing a sufficient volume of private

investment in new industries which could absorb the

larger labour force.'



<br><br>Then skipping two lines, it goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide for 30,000 new jobs in industry

requires  a  capital investment of something  like

$600 million, if we take a ratio of $20,000 a job.

Private  investment  of this magnitude  has  never

been achieved in the history of Singapore and this

is  what  we  must do to bring about  a  state  of

nearly full employment at the end of 1964.'



<br><br>Sir, we wish the Government the best of luck. It is

indeed   a   stupendous  task  to  induce   private

investors to invest $600



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



million.   Unfortunately,  Sir,   in   its   policy

statement,   the   Government  gave   a   different

impression,  and I hope the Finance  Minister  will

make  an outright declaration of policy here,  that

the  policy enunciated in the Development  Plan  is

its permanent policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part I of the P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan, page 8,

the last paragraph reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The planned industrial enterprises will be run

either by the Board or in co-operation with private

capital.'



<br><br>Those were the main categories: either by the Board

or  by  the  Board  in  co-operation  with  private

capital.  Then the marginal opportunities  will  be

given to private enterprise. It goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Purely private capital enterprises will also

receive the co-operation of the Board. Although  we

disagree that the survival of Singapore depends  on

foreign    capital    and   foreign    capitalists,

nevertheless foreign capital business concerns that

wish  to  establish factories in Singapore will  be

given encouragement and assistance.'



<br><br>Sir, the Government realises now that the State  of

Singapore alone cannot provide full employment  for

its   people.   It  must  welcome   the   help   of

everybody - local  and foreign - to provide  employment

for our people. After all, Sir, what is merdeka  if

the  workers are to be without employment. If their

rice-bowl is to be broken, it is an empty  merdeka.

Merdeka  must benefit everybody and not the workers

in   particular.  It  must  provide  jobs  for  the

unemployed.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr G. Kandasamy) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion before the House is indeed

significant  in that paragraph 4 strikes  something

new.  It  "calls on all sections of the  people  to

unite  in their effort to fulfil the plan". On  all

sections! Sir, we were told recently in this  House

that the Government side did not care for the views

of  the  Opposition. We thought that the Government

did not care for the views of something like 46 per

cent of the voters who did not vote



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



them  in.  Sir, that is an attitude of intolerance.

It  is  wrong. If you want to build a  nation,  you

have to have the support of even those who disagree

with  you.  But  now the Government  calls  on  all

sections  of  the  people  to  unite.  But  in  the

speeches  in  the Hong Lim by-election,  we  notice

another  note - speakers on the Government side  call

for  unity  and solidarity of the Left-wing  forces

against  the  rest. By implication, Sir,  it  means

that  unless  people are members of  the  Left-wing

forces,  they  have no equality of  status  in  the

future of Singapore. Therefore, the businessmen are

regarded as enemies of the Left-wing forces. Surely

a  better  appeal would have been a  unity  of  all

those who wish to serve the country - the people  and

the   workers - of   all  who   are   sensible   and

constructive; the unity of all these forces against

those  who wish to disrupt and destroy the  economy

of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I put it to the Government that if there is

real  co-operation  to ensure the  success  of  the

Development  Plan, it cannot be  on  the  basis  of

regarding  labour and management as hostile  forces

that must clash, but rather as forces that must

co-operate  in order that the unemployed of  Singapore

will  be  provided with jobs. Sir, we welcome  this

portion of the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last portion of the motion indicates

that the Government realises its difficulties. It



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`EXHORTS the workers and trade union movement and

the  businessmen and industrialists to  play  their

part   in  maintaining  a  fair  balance  of  their

respective interests so essential to success.'



<br><br>In  other words, Sir, if either one of these two is

unable or refuses to maintain a fair balance,  then

no  progress  can  be  made.  But  why  regard  the

relationship   between  these   two   as   one   of

maintaining a fair balance? Sir, we know that  when

two  people who are restive try to maintain a  fair

balance, the boat is bound to rock. You cannot have

the boat going fast when all the time it is rocking

now on one side and now on the other side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My suggestion is this: that the essence should

not  be  on  maintaining a fair balance first.  The

priority should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



maintaining      the     maximum      speed - maximum

productivity - and  that the balancing  of  interests

could  be  left, if necessary,, and  if  there  are

disputes, to a fair and Just Arbitration Court.  If

there  are only certain cases or certain categories

(if there are disputes) that cannot be solved, then

those  cases  can  be referred to  the  Arbitration

Court.  Why  not  all? - so long as  we  can  ensure

maximum  productivity, maximum  speed,  toward  our

objective?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to restore the confidence which we

have lost to a great extent, the Government has  to

answer  many  of  these questions.  Naturally  when

businessmen read in the papers a statement  from  a

responsible   T.U.C. official - "To    hell    with

industrial  peace" - well, balancing of interests  is

going  to be difficult. And I suggest that we  must

get  away  from  this  question  of  balancing   of

interests  to another force. Let there  be  maximum

speed  and  maximum  productivity,  and  leave  the

balancing  of interests not in the hands  of  those

who  want to fight but in the hands of an impartial

and just tribunal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many questions we would like to

ask  about  the various plans, but no doubt  it  is

difficult  to discuss details here. We can  foresee

difficulties because we know of the acute  shortage

of  technical personnel so that even now we find we

do   not  have  enough  Science  teachers  for  our

schools, and Science graduates are in demand in all

the  States around us. We hope the Government  will

be  able  to  get over these obstacles  and  really

succeed.  We  do hope that this Plan is  not  being

brought before the House just to be in time for the

Hong  Lim  by-election, but  that  it  is  to   be

proceeded with with great speed after this.



<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  today self-governing  Singapore  is

putting  forward for the first time, in the history

of  Singapore, a just Development Plan. Our Finance

Minister  has already outlined the main  points  of

this  Plan.  It is not necessary for me to  discuss

the whole Plan in detail, but I personally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



feel  that  there are several points  in  the  Plan

which should be brought out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that when we drafted this Plan

we   fully  understood  the  present  situation  in

Singapore.  In  Singapore  today  there  is   still

incomplete separation from colonial rule. Singapore

has  not  yet  discarded the yoke  of  colonialism.

Because of this, the Plan drafted by us can be said

to  be  one  which  is in accordance  with  certain

measures. It is a concrete Plan and not a dream. It

is  a resolute Plan. It will achieve our goals. Why

do  I  say  so? First, the most important point  is

what  I have just said: we have not entirely shaken

off the yoke of colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singapore is a tiny island and had been

under British control for over a hundred years. The

British  colonial policy had produced  a  very  low

standard of education. Because of the long  period

of  oppression  by  the  British  and  exploitation

generally,  the people are poor, and  also  because

the  United Kingdom wants to take advantage of  the

central position of Singapore to convey its  spoils

derived  here to England. Therefore, Singapore  has

become  a  centre of entrepôt trade, and  does  not

have   a  foundation  for  industrialisation.   The

problems  of  unemployment,  education  and   other

social  and  welfare problems left by  the  British

need a solution and we have to resolve them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, everybody knows that Singapore does not

have  natural  resources. It does not have  fertile

farmlands or rich mountains or mines or fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we know that the population increase is

very  high - 4.3 per cent. It is the highest  in  the

world.  The  population of Singapore  today  totals

1,600,000.  Those under 21 years of age  number  50

per  cent  of the whole population. Over two-thirds

of  our population depend on less than one-third of

the    population's    labour    and    livelihood.

Approximately  one  quarter of our  population  are

school-going children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the four facts mentioned above, we

have  formulated this Development Plan. Also  under

difficult  circumstances we have  courageously  put

forward this Development Plan. But why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



do  I  say that this Development Plan is one  which

would  only solve the problems but does not  tackle

the roots of the problems?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the P.A.P., believe in socialism. Our

objectives  are to achieve a unified party  between

the  Federation of Malaya and Singapore. It is only

under  a  socialist society in which  there  is  no

exploitation  of man by man that we  can  basically

solve  the problems of the people's livelihood.  Of

course,   our  problem  includes  the  problem   of

unemployment. Therefore, this Plan is based on  the

present  political, social and economic  situation.

But  we can only solve part of the problems. It  is

not  a Plan which can fully solve all our problems.

This point has to be understood by all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another significant point is that this Plan

intends  to alter the economy of Singapore  from  a

non-productive commercial economy to  a  productive

economy.  58 per cent of the total investment  will

be  used  for  economic development.  This  clearly

shows  that  our Plan is to fulfil the promises  we

made  before the election. We have to lay well  the

foundation for industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now many Opposition Members have said that

our  Plan has contradicted the promises made during

the  last  election campaign. They have  also  said

that  this Plan has been introduced because of  the

Hong  Lim by-election. Therefore, I must now  quote

from  The  Five-Year Plan issued  before  the  last

general  election. What I have said  just  now  was

quoted from the fourth book of our Five-Year  Plan,

at page 15:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`How we want to change our non-productive economy

into  a productive economy. This means that we must

carefully  investigate  all the  possibilities  for

industrialisation in Singapore. The existence of  a

nation depends on whether it can produce goods, and

whether it has the potentialities and possibilities

for producing goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore does not have the raw materials for

production.   Also  it  does  not  have   a   large

agricultural   area  for  large-scale  agriculture.

Therefore, our production has to depend on  how  to

mobilise our people for productive labour.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Development Plan is realistic, it shows that

we  are resolute and courageous. During our term of

office, we want



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



to  lay  the  foundation for industrialisation.  Of

course, in this Four-Year Development Plan, to pave

the way for industrialisation is not very easy. For

instance, if we start work at the Jurong industrial

site  today,  we  may  not  entirely  see  all  the

factories  manufacturing at the end of four  years.

But  we  are a responsible Government. We  are  not

utilising  our  term  of office  to  meet  the

by-election or any election. We are doing all this for

the  good  of  the  future of  all  the  people  of

Singapore. We are a responsible Government, and our

Plan is to take into account the long-term good for

the benefit of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that last year I said that in dealing

with  economic problems and financial affairs,  our

stand   was  to  save  expenditure  and  accumulate

wealth.  We  have  to  carry  out  our  task  in  a

calculated  and  planned way. We will  always  take

into consideration that Government will not waste a

single  cent.  Any cent spent will get  its  value.

Otherwise, it will be wasting the sweat  and  blood

of  the  people. Therefore, the basic task  of  the

P.A.P. is  to  improve by stages the  standard  of

living of the people. Of course, what we have  done

up  till now is still not enough. We must endeavour

further to strengthen our work along this path.



<br><br>4.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, before I speak,  I  wish  to

answer  the  criticism raised  by  the  Member  for

Tanglin.  Just  now he criticised  our  Development

Plan.  Some of his criticisms contradict the facts.

Actually he was driving at something else with some

ulterior  motive. Just like in the fable, when  the

fox  cannot get the grapes, he says the grapes  are

sour.  That  is  my  answer to  the  criticism  put

forward by the Member for Tanglin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gladly support the Four-Year Development Plan

put  forward  by  my colleague,  the  Minister  for

Finance.  Ever  since  the  publication   of   this

historic   Development  Plan,  it  has  been   well

received by the public. In this House, my colleague

has  further analysed the Plan, but there are  some

points  which I wish to stress. Why must  I  stress

these points?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



May I mention the reasons why I should stress these

points? In this blue book, there are many proposals

which  deserve our close attention. But  I  do  not

wish  to  touch on all the aspects of the  Plan.  I

wish only to talk on two points. The first point is

the increase of employment opportunities. The other

point is the expansion of the public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me say

something on the first point. In the present  state

of  affairs  in Singapore, it is very necessary  to

formulate  a Development Plan. This is because  the

state of affairs in Singapore is like that of a big

family. In matters of economics, it is just like  a

family which has a piece of cloth to dispense with.

If  the parent does not calculate and make a proper

allocation beforehand, it is impossible  for  every

member of the family to get a suit of clothing.  If

he  can  make  an estimate and a proper  allocation

beforehand, even if not every member of the  family

will  get  a suit of clothing, at least he  can  be

assured  that he will avoid waste. Looking  from  a

realistic angle, whenever we pass by a secondary or

a primary school, before the school starts or after

school, whichever school you pass by, you will  see

a  surging  crowd  of students  emerging  from  the

school  premises.  It is not difficult  to  imagine

that after a few years these pupils will enter  the

labour market to seek their livelihood. Sir, may  I

quote  from an editorial of the Nanyang Siang  Pat,

dated the 3rd of April? I believe this paragraph in

the  editorial is unbiased. Now, let me quote  from

this editorial.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr G. Kandasamy):</b> Is  it  an

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, let me now continue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



my speech. Let me quote from the Nanyang Siang Pau

editorial of 3rd April:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Another characteristic feature of the Four-Year

Development  Plan  is  the increase  of  employment

opportunities. When this Plan is achieved, it  will

provide  about 40,000 jobs for the people. That  is

to say, about 8,000 jobs in the public service will

be  available, and other economic institutions will

absorb  about  12,000 people.  If  in  the  process

private  investors invest their money in  industry,

there  will be another 30,000 jobs, and  the  total

number  of  jobs  available  then  will  solve  the

unemployment problem of thousands of people. But in

1964, the number of people who are looking for jobs

will  be  83,600.  Other than  the  31,000  jobless

people  at  present, there will  be  an  additional

52,600  people  looking  for  new  jobs.  Even   if

everything  is going on smoothly and  according  to

our  Plan, by the end of 1964, there will still  be

13,600  people  who will be looking  for  jobs.  In

other  words, if the Plan fails, we will  be  faced

with a more serious and grave situation and crisis.

Because   of   the  above-mentioned  factors,   two

concepts can be arrived at. On the one hand, we are

glad  and  cheered by our prospects. On  the  other

hand,  it cannot help to be worried. Why should  we

say  so?  Because we are hamstrung by our objective

situation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote again from the

last paragraph of the editorial which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is one fundamental weakness in Singapore's

economy. That is the lack of natural resources. But

the  most  important  problem is  the  increase  of

population.  Every year, there is  an  increase  of

65,000  people.  After a few years, the  population

will  stand at about 2,000,000 people. On the other

hand, not only are most of the population under the

age  of  18, but there is one-fourth of the  people

who  are  under  the age of 5 or 6.  If  one  looks

further, one will see the problems and difficulties

faced  by  Singapore and the situation will  become

serious  year  by year. For example, if  there  are

86,000  people  who cannot get jobs in  1964,  then

after two or three years, the figure for unemployed

people   will  increase.  Although  the   Four-Year

Development Plan cannot solve all our problems,  it

will  lay  the  foundation for further development.

Given  the co-operation of the people of Singapore,

it  is  expected that we will be able to  turn  the

tide and go on to the path of prosperity. The

Four-Year Development Plan is a Plan which concerns  all

of us, because.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member seems to be

still  reading  from the editorial of  the  Nanyang

Siang Pau. I might remind him of Standing Order  44

which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... a Member shall not read his speech, but he

may  read  short extracts from books or  papers  in

support of his argument,'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



So  the extracts should only be read in support  of

the  hon. Member's argument. He seems to be reading

the  editorial word for word, which seems to be  an

argument of the editor of that paper, and  not  the

Member's own argument. Would he hear that  in  mind

when he continues?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir, I have one more sentence to go. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It will also decisively affect our future

generation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now talk on another

problem. According to the reactions to the Plan,  I

believe all partriotic citizens will do their  best

to support this Plan without any hesitation to make

it a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me touch on another

problem, i.e., the expansion of the public service.

Everyone is aware that Singapore has been built  up

slowly  in  the past decades. We have come  to  the

stage  where  many  of the facilities  are  not  in

keeping  with  our present needs. To rectify  this,

the  Development Plan has many proposals to improve

the facilities. Now, let me quote an example. If we

do  not  do something to improve our situation,  we

will  not  only  be confronted with  a  very  acute

shortage  of  housing, but we  may  also  have  the

problem of a shortage of roads. For the sake of the

future of this country, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support

wholeheartedly this Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on the

motion  by the Minister for Finance, we have  heard

speeches  from  the Government side  welcoming  the

State of Singapore's Four-Year Development Plan. On

behalf of the Opposition, I would like to speak  in

connection with the points raised by the Government

regarding  the  difficulties in  implementing  this

Plan.  I  think my colleague the Member for Tanglin

has   touched  upon  the  mistakes  made   by   the

Government  since  the  time they  assumed  office,

which  difficulties  they are faced  with  now.  We

cannot blame anybody in this respect. If I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



am  asked, I would say that the blame lies  on  the

manner  in  which  the  Government  implements  its

policies,  which has resulted in an  atmosphere  of

insecurity in the community of Singapore. I do  not

wish to dwell further on that matter except to urge

the  Government  in  future  to  learn  from  their

mistakes  for  the  betterment of  the  people  who

comprise the multi-racial society in Singapore  and

who   owe  their  allegiance  to  this  State.  The

difficulties which we are confronted with  are  not

merely  those which Government is faced  with,  but

they  affect each and every single citizen, whether

he  is  rich, or whether he is a worker, even  more

the  unemployed,  the number of  which  is  on  the

increase  as  a  result of our  depressed  economic

state  of affairs; and no security is given to  the

family  to  plan its future livelihood. We  realise

that Singapore is a small island not more than  224

square  miles, and its population has grown  to  1½

million as mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister for Finance. The  population  now

numbers 1,600,000, and the number of unemployed has

increased  day  by day. Similarly the  increase  in

childbirth  has posed another big problem,  and  we

should  consider their future livelihood.  I  think

this problem should not only be the concern of this

Assembly  alone. We should find ways and  means  of

guaranteeing  a livelihood for the future  citizens

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Development Plan, which is a step forward,

should  get  the  support of every section  of  the

population,  although it is only on paper  at  this

stage. But we have no other alternative and we have

to work and work from now on to ensure a livelihood

for  the  people.  Differing  political  ideologies

should  be  set  aside  as this  Plan  affects  the

livelihood of all the people of Singapore. However,

on the question of launching this Development Plan,

we  are  aware that we are short of money  and,  as

pointed out by my colleague the Member for Tanglin.

I  hope  the stand taken by the Government to  gain

the   confidence   of  the  capitalists   will   be

maintained. Bombastic and high-sounding  words  are

of  no  use. What is needed is the facing  of  hard

facts   so  that  we  will  be  able  to  guarantee

Singapore's prosperity in the future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first, may I just reply to a couple of remarks made

by  the  Member  for Aljunied and  the  Member  for

Tanglin?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied made a speech just like

the  speeches  he  made  on  the  platform  of  the

Independent  candidate, Mr Ong Eng  Guan,  in  the

Hong  Lim by-election. He made a lot of allegations

and  half-truths merely to belittle the Government.

All  of  them  have  been repeatedly  and  suitably

answered at our street corner meetings in Hong Lim,

and  I  do  not  think  there is  any  material  in

whatever he has said that needs further rebutting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Tanglin, he said that

half  the investment that should have been made  in

Singapore went to Petaling Jaya instead,  and  that

this  was  due  to  non-confidence  in  the  P.A.P.

Government.  Let  me ask him one  simple  question.

When  was  the  Petaling Jaya  scheme  started?  It

started  long,  long before the  P.A.P. came  into

power. It started during General Templer's time; in

fact,  at a time when the Progressives, the

Labour-Fronters  and  the S.P.A.s were  all  in  power  in

Singapore.  So  taking  his argument  on  its  face

value,  it  would  only  mean  that  the  lack   of

confidence  and lack of trust would be entirely  on

the   previous  Government.  I  would  advise   the

schoolmaster not to spit into the wind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of these allegations and unprincipled

disparaging remarks, I still rise to add my littlie

voice to the shower of approval and praise that the

Government  Four-Year Plan has  received  from  all

alike  in Singapore - bankers, industrialists, trade

unionists,  workers  and the ordinary  men  in  the

street.  Foreign  investors are keenly  interested,

and  favourable  comments have  come  in  from  all

sides.  This, Sir, is no surprise to us. For  after

140 years of colonial domination, this is the first

time  that  any  local government has  attempted  a

planned  expenditure based on socialist principles,

however limited



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



in  scope, in Singapore. You will recall, Sir, that

one  of the faults of the capitalist system  is  in

its  unplanned economy, depending on the whims  and

fancies of capitalists and on how much profit  they

can  squeeze  out  of  consumers  by  high-pressure

advertisement   in   inducing  consumers   to   buy

something  which they do not need  or  want.  Ideas

have  since travelled very fast, and we  in  Malaya

and  especially in Singapore are not slow in trying

our level best to do away with, or at least improve

on,  the  evils  and the haphazard economy  of  the

capitalist   system.  Historical  development   has

placed  Singapore in a situation where the entrepot

trade  has become the lifeblood of the people.  Our

entrepot trade is almost entirely dependent on  the

goodwill and help of the Western world, which means

that,  unless we trade and do business in  a  setup

that  harmonises with the Western world  capitalist

system,  we  shall  find  it  difficult  indeed  to

maintain, to say nothing of improving, our  present

level   of   prosperity  and  living  standard   in

Singapore. Truly has the Minister for Finance said,

"The  world does not owe Singapore anything  for  a

living."  I may even add, if anything, that  it  is

the  other  way  round.  We almost  owe  the  world

outside  for  our  living  in  Singapore.  With   a

government based on a Socialist philosophy,  it  is

not  unexpected  that we believe in  planning  and,

wherever  possible,  a  controlled  economy.  Since

Singapore  is  a  small  island  with  no   natural

resources to speak of, and since our prosperity  so

far  has  been  entirely dependent on our  entrepot

economy, as I have already indicated, there is very

little  likelihood  of our being  able  to  have  a

controlled  economy; but so far as we  can,  within

the limits of our capability, we are trying to make

it a planned expenditure. Long before we formed the

Government, we had already made it quite clear that

we had our Five-Year Plan. Now it has been expanded

and   elaborated  into  the  Government   Four-Year

Development Plan. This only shows our determination

in  pursuing  our  plans  to  help  the  people  of

Singapore to a better life and to a more equal  and

just society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall also, Sir, that the Opposition

had  occasion  to  call themselves Socialists  when

they wanted to court the goodwill of the people and

to gain votes. During the general election in 1959,

they  had  this  as their slogan, which  translated

into  Chinese  would read "Work for  everyone,  and

rice for everyone." Of course, the people were  not

deceived,  but it might be pertinent at this  point

to  ask the S.P.A. this. If they were to honour the

"Work  for everyone and rice for everyone"  slogan,

how  was  it that they had no Development Plan?  If

they  call  themselves Socialists, how is  it  that

even now, after so many years of name-changing  and

precarious  existence, they still do not  know  the

meaning  of  a  planned socialist  economy?  It  is

important,  therefore, that we distinguish  clearly

where   we  stand  in  this  Assembly  as   regards

planning. The proof of the pudding, they say, is in

the  eating, and we on this side of the House  can,

with   confidence,  say  that  we  are  a   genuine

Socialist   Party.   The   Government's   Four-Year

Development  Plan is irrefutable proof of  planning

based  on a Socialist philosophy. A by-election  is

being held in Hong Lim, and it might be interesting

to  note  also that even speakers on the Opposition

platform  have  praised  our Four-Year  Development

Plan  and have wished the Plan success, which  only

goes  to  prove  that in Singapore even  Opposition

Members  cannot  deny that this Government's

Four-Year  Development Plan is really  a  Plan  to  help

Singapore survive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been made abundantly clear all

through  the Blue Book, the Plan is not  a  panacea

for  all ills. It is only an attempt to solve  some

of  the problems that face Singapore. The nature of

our   problems  has  been  fully  investigated  and

brought home to the people. Anyone reading the Plan

cannot  help  but  feel the pressing  urgency  for

employment  opportunities that have to  be  created

for  our  fast-growing population. Even if everyone

should  practise  family  planning,  the  immediate

problem  would  still be there.  Large  numbers  of

schools,  houses  and other health facilities  will

have to be provided for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>



rapidly  increasing population, and  the  thousands

that  leave  school every year will  have  to  find

gainful employment. But how do we go about  it?  As

the  Plan  points  out, the only solution  lies  in

industrialisation. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Plan does not envisage the Government

becoming the fountain of all industrial development

or even the main industrial entrepreneur...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's task in this Plan is mainly to

create    the   conditions   which   would   induce

substantial private capital into industries.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this purpose, Government has undertaken "to

provide  adequate supply of cheap power and  water,

to  lay  out  industrial estates, which would  have

these  facilities in addition to good communication

with   the   port,   and  to  provide   good   port

facilities." And wherever necessary, Government may

even  invest in enterprises to inject stimulus into

industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequences of the Plan have already been

touched   upon  by  various  speakers.   The   most

important and most immediate impact would  fall  on

the   building   and  construction  industry.   The

building  of  houses,  factories,  roads,  wharves,

sewers,   clinics,   schools,  bridges   would   be

initiated and stimulated and 40,000 new jobs  would

be   created  as  a  result.  This  would  not   be

sufficient to solve the problem, however, and there

would still be considerable unemployment. And  this

is where private industries come in. If the Plan is

to  succeed,  it must find response in the  private

sector. The Plan is meant only, I quote, "to  spark

off an increase in the rate of private investment".

And  if the spark goes to a damp squib, then  there

will  be no responsive fire. On the other hand,  if

the spark goes to a responsive combustible mixture,

then  we  can  be assured of a chain reaction  that

will    start    the   engine   that    leads    to

industrialisation.  Let us hope our  industrialists

and entrepreneurs will be responsive. They have all

the  things  in their favour - the Plan, the  initial

public   outlay, and   Government   policy    and

encouragement.  And  now we  know  the  T.U.C. and

Government  have come to an agreement on industrial

peace. Indeed, the industrialists and entrepreneurs

have never had it so good.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from all that has been said, you will see

that  the success or failure of the Plan will  have

an  intimate bearing on each and every one of us in

Singapore. For those now unemployed and  for  those

fresh   from  school,  success  will  mean  gainful

employment.  For those now employed,  success  will

mean  better  opportunities, better  conditions  of

service, and better security. For taxi drivers  and

hawkers, success will mean thinning of their  ranks

and  less competition, as more will find better and

more  highly  paid  employment in  industries.  For

businessmen,    success    will    mean     greater

opportunities and more trade. For the  man  in  the

street, success will mean more homes, more clinics,

more   schools,  more  transport  and  recreational

facilities.  And for Singapore as a whole,  success

will   mean  an  expanding  economy  with   greater

prosperity  for  all.  Let  us  hope  that  all  in

Singapore   will  support  the  Development   Plan.

Otherwise,  the unemployment problem  in  Singapore

will never be solved.



<br><br>6.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Leong Keng Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I fully agree with the Four-Year Plan

of our Finance Minister. We all know that education

is  very  important to nation building. It is  like

industrialisation,  which is also  very  important.

Let us look at the Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 110, we see that we have 658 Government

and  Government-aided schools. In 1960  there  were

about 340,000-odd students, and in the coming years

the  figure will be bigger than this. We  all  know

that  under the old Government, whatever  they  did

they  had no plan at all. They never had any

long-term  plan. They had no plan for education at  all.

In the past, under the old Government, we could see

many corrupt incidents and events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us deal with the year 1959. There were 4,000

students for Primary I. After registration they had

no  places and therefore could not join any school.

In   the   Secondary  School  Entrance  Examination

conducted by Government, those who could  not  pass

the examination did not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>



have  any chance to join school again, and so  they

roamed  about  the streets. We could see  that  the

secondary  school-leavers  who  passed  could  only

become  white-collar  workers.  All  this  was  the

result  of  the  old  Government's  rule.  And  the

leakage  of  examination questions  under  the  old

Government  had left a very bad impression  on  the

students.  They had no confidence at  all  in  that

examination.  From all this, we can judge  and  see

clearly for ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since we took over control, we have improved

all  this.  We  have not allowed  these  things  to

happen.  Let  us  consider a  few  more  facts.  In

1960-61  all students of registrable age can  enter

school.  This shows that our educational policy  is

in keeping with the increase of population. We want

to  give  them a good education. Since our  coming

into power, we have carried out our new educational

policy  to allow children to attend school  in  all

the four languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us again look at the Four-Year Plan. In

regard  to  education, we have decided  that  every

year  we  will  build 19 schools, of  which  7  are

primary schools. 7 post-primary schools, 3 ordinary

secondary  schools,  and 2 technical  schools.  All

this  shows that we have a plan to build 19 schools

every  year. In these four years we will  be  doing

the same thing - building the same number of schools.

All  this  shows  that the new Government  is  very

concerned with the education of the people in order

to  let  all the people and their children  receive

education.  You will also note that  these  schools

are  not  like those under the old Government.  The

new  schools  must not be English  schools  or  any

other schools according to a rigid formula. We have

to  take into consideration all the factors  before

deciding  whether the schools should be English  or

Chinese  or any other kind of schools, and we  have

to  see whether there is a need for them. If  there

is  such  a  need, then we will build  schools  for

mixed races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, since we became the Government, we have

taken  into  consideration the problem of  over-age

students.  In  the past, the old Government  kicked

them out from schools. But since we took



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>



over,  we  have  built  two  schools  for  over-age

students.  One  is  the  Jurong  Special  Secondary

School  and the other is the River Valley Secondary

Chinese  School. This shows that we  are  not  only

concerned with the over-age students but also  with

their education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our adult education classes are meant to

eradicate  illiteracy.  We  have  an  enrolment  of

several  thousands of youths in these  classes,  so

that  in  their spare time, after their work,  they

can  have  a  chance to be educated and  gain  more

knowledge in all respects. From the Plan we can see

that  not only do we want to establish these  adult

education  classes,  but we  also  intend  to  have

evening secondary classes. At the moment, there are

6,000  students. In future, we intend  to  have  an

evening  college. So all these classes will provide

primary education or middle school education  right

up  to  University standard. Why do so many  people

join these evening classes? It is because they have

confidence in the new Government. In the past,  the

students  who  took  part in the  joint  Government

public examination had no confidence. But under our

new  Government they all show their  confidence  in

and  respect  for  the common examination  for  all

schools. And those youths who have left school  are

now  joining these evening classes in order to  sit

for the Government-sponsored public examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our teachers want to study further. We can

see  that  in the Teachers Training College,  there

are  1,500  teachers who have  passed  the  Std.  I

examination in the national language.  A  few  days

ago there were about 1,000 teachers who set for the

Std.  II examination in the national language.  All

this  shows that since the new Government took over

power, everyone is very keen and has confidence  in

taking   the   examinations   conducted   by    the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do we want most of the children to

receive an education, but we also want to give them

a  good  education. That is why  we  want  to  have

technical schools. We provide post-primary  classes

for those students who have not already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



passed  the primary examination. This is  something

which is well planned. According to our policy,  we

hope  the four streams of education can come  to  a

confluence and can mix together. According  to  our

policy,  we have two integrated schools. There  are

also  a few integrated primary schools in the  four

streams.  This will help to break down the barriers

among them and enable them to have more chances  of

co-operation  and  to  instil  into  them   a   new

consciousness  in  order  to  build  a  new  united

nation,  so  that people of all races  can  have  a

common school to attend, can be in one common

classroom, and be able to live together. This is what we

hope  for. In all the schools of all races, we have

conducted sports meetings to enable the students of

all  races to mix together. In another respect,  we

have  adopted Malay as our national language.  This

is  correct because, through the national language,

students in every stream of the educational  system

will   be  able  to  express  their  thoughts   and

communicate with students of other races,  so  that

the differences among them will be lessened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Government comes from the people. Therefore,

we  have to heed the opinion of the people.  During

the 22 months of our taking office, we have had the

Educational  Advisory Council and other  Committees

relating to educational work. The members of  these

Committees  are  representatives  from   the   four

language  streams, and the Advisory Council  is  an

adviser  to  the Minister for Education.  In  these

Committees,  the  members can use any  language  to

express  their opinion. They have ample opportunity

to   express  their  opinion  in  their  respective

languages.  All  this  shows  that  we  take   into

consideration   the  views  of   all   the   people

representing every race.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is that the Committees concerned

are  formulating a common syllabus for all  schools

and  other related work for all schools so that  we

will teach all the students according to the common

syllabuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also look at our children. We are not

doing those things that have been done in the past.

We are not merely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



producing  clerical staff or white-collar  workers.

That is why we have tried to have technical schools

and vocational schools. We have built technical and

vocational schools and we have built two-year

post-primary  schools. This shows that we emphasise  the

importance of manual work and science.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the duties of teachers. We know

it  is  not an easy task to build a united  country

because  all along in the past the four streams  of

schools  carried on in their respective ways.  They

were  isolated from one another. They pursued their

respective system of education. We want to create a

constructive  path  and channel all  the  different

streams  into  one common confluence.  We  must  go

according to our educational policy. This is a very

difficult task. But we have confidence and we  have

the  courage  to  fulfil our Four-Year  Development

Plan. The fulfilment of this Plan depends on the

co-operation  of  the  workers,  the  people  and  the

Government. In the same way, our educational policy

depends   on  the  co-operation  of  the  teachers,

students   and   parents,   either   directly    or

indirectly.  They must all exert their  energy  and

effort to achieve the aims and objectives envisaged

in the educational policy as contained in the

Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br>6.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in matters relating to

development which we are facing and which  we  will

face  in  the State of Singapore, as the Government

elected   by  the  people  and  with  a  sense   of

responsibility,  I  would  like  to  say  that  the

measures  as contained in the Four-Year Development

Plan  are bold and positive. Before I touch on  the

contents  of the Four-Year Development Plan,  first

let me emphasise that the Plan has been drawn up on

the   election  pledges  made  by  the  P.A.P. as

contained  in  the booklet The Tasks  Ahead,  which

also embodied the P.A.P.'s Five-Year Plan if it was

returned   to  power.  Based  on  that  plan,   the

Government of the day submits its Four-Year



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



Development  Plan  which is being  debated  in  the

House today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it cannot be repudiated that governments, prior to this Government, for obvious

reasons,  fought shy of openly facing the  problems

and  dangers  which the people of  Singapore  as  a

whole  would face. It is possible that if each  and

every  problem  and  danger, which  the  people  of

Singapore  will  face in the  years  to  come,  was

faced, then the result would be that there would be

a  sense  of  fear among the people,  because  such

governments did not have definite or positive plans

to  meet  these problems. However, as a responsible

Government, it is our duty to study and analyse the

hard  facts based on a broad understanding  of  the

facts and conditions as exist at present, and  tell

the  people those facts. Mr Speaker, we should not

make   sweet   promises  to  the   people   without

considering  matters affecting  their  welfare.  We

should  put the true picture to them, although  the

people  may take it with a sense of fear. I believe

that only by such methods could we instil into  the

people   of  Singapore  a  sense  of  consciousness

whereby they will be able to meet the challenge  of

the  time. So the sense of responsibility which  we

expect from the people has prompted us to tell them

the  truth  of  the  problems which  the  State  of

Singapore  must  face if we are not  equipped  with

well-planned  proposals. Mr Speaker,  we  will  be

guilty  if  we  hide  from the  people  the  facts,

because we do not wish to spout hot air whilst  the

people  are hungry and their pockets are empty.  By

hiding  the  true facts from them, we are  inviting

danger  to  the State. Based on these  facts,  this

Four-Year Development Plan was drawn up in order to

overcome, within our capabilities, the difficulties

which  we  face. It cannot be denied also that,  in

view  of the size of Singapore in relation  to  its

population, which is on the increase, and since the

rate of childbirth is also growing at a rapid pace,

every human being must live, and everyone needs the

basic  requirements, such as a house, a  job,  etc.

Therefore, if we are without a proper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



Development Plan, I believe Singapore in the  years

to come will face a crucial time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in debating the Four-Year Development Plan immediately after the Hon. the

Minister for Finance had delivered his speech,  the

Member   for  Aljunied  explained  that  the   Plan

announced  by  the  Minister was presented  in  the

midst  of  the coming by-election in Hong Lim.  The

Member for Aljunied directly accused that the

Four-Year  Development  Plan provided  capital  for  the

P.A.P. to  win  the by-election in Hong  Lim.  Mr

Speaker, we hope there will be no other people  who

are  suffering from nightmares during the  daytime,

because  to  draw up such a gigantic plan  as  this

Development  Plan is not an easy task. It  requires

careful  analysis and study within the  context  of

the  present conditions in Singapore. It is not  as

easy  as  had  been  clone by the  ex-Minister  for

National  Development  who drew  up  his  Five-Year

housing plan, which incurred an expenditure  of  $5

million, merely on tine sheet of paper. We  need  a

plan  which  has been thoroughly studied,  and  not

what  I have said earlier on. However, Mr Speaker,

it  would appear that the Member for Aljunied,  who

has  had occasion during this period leading up  to

the by-election in Hong Lim to proclaim himself  as

a  champion of the people on matters such as these,

has not touched on the contents of this Development

Plan which has been tabled today, as though this is

a  small matter. The big issue is Hong Lim. This is

only in the mind of the Member for Aljunied. It may

be  that, because he is engaged in the coming  Hong

Lim  by-election in order to ensure victory, he has

had  no  time  to  go through the blue  book.  This

clearly  indicates that he himself has no  interest

in  the  welfare of the people, because this

Four-Year  Development Plan affects all  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, then I heard the Member for Tanglin saying that industrial peace is non-existent and he

puts  the blame on the Government. Mr Speaker,  if

there are people who think like this, then I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



say to them that I deny such an accusation, because

everyone knows that the non-existence of industrial

peace  in Singapore should be put squarely  at  the

door  of  several  political leaders,  particularly

those who were in power before the P.A.P. came into

power  and  who are today sitting on the Opposition

bench.  We  know  chat the policy of  the  previous

Government   was  a  biased  one.  The   Government

pampered  the capitalists but exploited the  labour

movement  who  struggled for better  conditions  of

service.  For that reason, the P.A.P. is constantly

fighting  for the betterment of the working  class.

The   Opposition   exploited   the   situation   by

disseminating  false  propaganda  during  the  past

election to frighten the capitalists from investing

their  capital  in Singapore. The effect  could  be

seen clearly because, as I have said just now, this

particular   group  is  closely  related   to   the

employers.  Actually  the  P.A.P.,  which  won  the

elections,  constantly fight for the betterment  of

the  State  of Singapore, because it realises  that

Singapore is merely an entrepot port and a  trading

centre.  Other  means  to  improve  the  State   of

Singapore  are  non-existent. For that  reason,  we

constantly welcome the investment of capital, be it

local  or  from abroad. But in this connection,  we

only hope this: let them invest as much capital  as

they  like,  but they must treat the working  class

properly.   It  is  hoped  that  on   this   mutual

understanding,  the  expansion  of  industry   will

continue  to make progress. We restate  our  policy

which we proclaimed when we assumed office - that  we

will  not  pamper  one  lot whilst  exploiting  the

other;  whilst fighting colonialism, which  is  our

enemy  No. 1, we will always continue to be  guided

by  the principle of justice to all sections of the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, it has been mentioned

by the Member for Tanglin just now in this Assembly

that this Government is moving a motion calling  on

all  sections of the people to unite to  make  this

Plan  a  success.  But in the Hong Lim  by-election

speeches, the call is - let all the Left-wing  forces

unite.  The issue is simple. I am sure even  school

children   can   understand  and   appreciate   the

situation. He will be able to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



understand  a  Left-wing  Party  because  Left-wing

people  are  asked to unite at all  times,  because

this   group   is   firm  in  its   fight   against

colonialism. The P.A.P. is a political Party  which

opposes colonialism. For that purpose, we urge  all

Left-wing political Parties to unite in the  common

struggle   against  colonialism.  Besides  fighting

colonialism,  we are also striving  to  uphold  and

maintain law and order and economic stability. Some

groups  are biased, and they are inclined to  flirt

with  colonial  interests. However,  we  constantly

remind  them  and all those people  who  are

anti-colonial  to  be  careful in  their  fight  against

colonialism  so as not to be deceived by  the

pro-colonial groups by using political opportunists  as

their tools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have talked at length on matters which have been raised by the Opposition Members.

Let  me  touch upon matters concerning my Ministry.

Mr Speaker, my Ministry is responsible for solving

the  problems of the daily livelihood of the people

of    Singapore.   According   to   the   Four-Year

Development Plan, land development and agricultural

policy come under economic development, whether  it

relates   to   the   housing   problem   or   rural

development.  Concerning the  housing  problem,  we

should not overlook the fact that the rapid changes

that  have been taking place in Singapore over  the

last  100  years have resulted in the concentration

of  the  population  in the  city  area,  with  the

resultant   acute  overcrowding  of   people.   The

expansion was unplanned, with the result that  most

of   the   existing   buildings   are   shop-houses

constructed  to  meet  the  requirements   of   the

immigrant  commercial community. Mr  Speaker,  the

majority   of  these  shop-houses  are  very   old.

Although land values are high, there has been  very

little redevelopment in the central area because of

the  operation of rent control which pegs rents  at

their  pre-September 1947 levels. A survey  of  the

housing needs of Singapore indicates that over  the

next  10 years, at least 147,000 housing units will

be   necessary   to  provide  for  the   increasing

population in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the former S.I.T. was responsible for much of the public housing since the years 1947

to 1959. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



only  managed  to  build,  on  the  average,  1,700

housing   units  a  year,  although  in  its   peak

year - that  was  1958 - the S.I.T. completed  roughly

3,841   housing  units.  In  order  to  grasp   the

situation, I will classify the development  o, the

various  phases.  I will quote figures  of  housing

units built by the S.I.T. from 1955 to 1959. In the

first phase in 1955, about 2,795 housing units were

built;  in  1956, 1,275; in 1957, 1,300;  in  1958,

3,841; and in 1959, 1,517. The total for this

five-year  period was only nearly 10,000 housing  units.

This  includes work that was completed by  Mr  Ong

Eng Guan when he was the Manager of the S.I.T. from

June 1959 to January 1960, during which period  794

housing units were built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the second stage, that is,

from  February l960 to April 1961, a total of 2,112

housing units were completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third stage, that is, the current

development  stage, a total of 7,832 housing  units

are being built: in Queenstown, 4,056 housing units

are  being constructed; in Tiong Bahru at the  fire

site,  about 280 housing units; in MacPherson Road,

about  1,320  housing units:  in  the  Tiong  Bahru

cemetery  site,  1,360 housing units;  and  in  St.

Michael's  Estate, 816 housing units.  This  brings

the  total  to  7,832  housing units.  About  7,200

houses  will be completed by December  this  year.

This  means that from 1955 to 1959, the S.I.T. was

capable  of  building  only 10,728  housing  units,

whilst  from  1960 to 1961, the Housing Development

Board completed 9,312 housing units. The comparison

is  10,000  housing units in five years as  against

9,000  housing units in two years. This is  clearly

shown by facts and figures, and we leave it to  the

Opposition to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first stage, according

to  our  Four-Year Development Plan, in the current

year  it is estimated that $194.1 million has  been

allocated  for  the construction of housing  units.

This includes expenditure now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



being  incurred of approximately $34.1 million  for

the  year 1961. As I said earlier, by December this

year, about 7,200 housing units will be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth phase will begin from 1962. In 1962,

about  $40.7  million has been set  aside  for  the

building  of housing units. We propose to build  in

Queenstown, 7.395 units; in Kallang, 1,420; and in

Farrer  Park, 920; making a total of 9,735  housing

units.  In 1963, expenditure to the tune of roughly

$33.8  million  will be spent on  the  building  of

9,690 housing units in Toa Payoh. In 1964, the cost

of  the  building  programme will amount  to  $44.5

million for the erection of 3,570 housing units  at

MacPherson Road: 6,120 at Toa Payoh; and  3,060  at

Thomson; making a total of 12,750 housing units. An

amount  of $44.5 million will be spent. After  this

four-year  period, we shall have to  continue  with

the  housing programme in order to meet the housing

demand. We will have to spend $41 million for  1965

to  erect 11,760 housing units: at MacPherson Road,

1,930; at Toa Payoh, 9,690; at Covent Garden,  544;

making a total of about 11,760 housing units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not hastily carry out our

building  programme. The plans have been formulated

with  care and according to our design. In  future,

we  hope to build one-room units at a capital  cost

of  $2,000  per unit; two-room units at $3,700  per

unit; and three-room units at $4,700 per unit.



These   costs,  however,  make  no  provision   for

expensive piling or land cost. The new units to  be

built  in 1962 and thereafter will comprise 30  per

cent  of  one-room units, 40 per cent  of  two-room

units,  and  30 per cent of three-room  units.  The

question will arise why so many two-room units  are

being  built. The reason is that an average  family

has  at  least  five persons, and  with  the  rapid

growth  of  population, it is  possible  that  each

family  will  have  about  ten  persons.  For  that

reason, we are building more of two-room units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main item in the Development Plan for housing

over   the  period  of  the  Plan  will   be   the

construction of about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



51,031 public housing units on land which has  been

acquired  and  held  for  the  purpose  of  housing

development  by  the Government.  There  are  1,300

acres of this land spread over the west, north  and

central  sections  of  the City.  They  are  mainly

concentrated  around the Kampong  Bahru,  Alexandra

and  Queenstown areas in the west; around  the  St.

Michael  and  Toa  Payoh areas in  the  north;  and

around  the  MacPherson Road, Kallang,  Mountbatten

and  Tanjong  Rhu  areas in the centre.  The  major

building   activities  will  be   concentrated   in

Queenstown  where  two  neighbourhoods  have  been

built; and in the Toa Payoh area, some 500 acres of

land  have  yet  to  be  cleared  of  settlers  for

housing.  A few contracts for building multi-storey

blocks  of  flats have already been given  out  for

Queenstown. It is proposed to develop the Toa Payoh

area over a period of four years in eight phases.

May  we be spared his literal translation of  that

part of the Plan?

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What the Chair would like to know is

like an answer to that.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I accept that explanation. Will the

Parliamentary Secretary continue?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in

view  of the fact that the people of Singapore  are

in  need of houses, we believe earnestly that  when

our  Four-Year Development Plan is implemented with

particular  reference  to the  industrial  site  at

Jurong, we will be in a position to rehouse them in

industrial  sites.  This will  go  a  long  way  to

ameliorate the slum areas in the City.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt at length on the

subject  of  housing. Now, I will move  on  to  the

subject   of  rural  development.  What  were   the

proposals  that had been implemented by the  P.A.P.

Government,  or  whether these proposals  could  be

carried  out? In this blue book, the proposals  for

the  use  of land concerning rural development  and

for  the  rearing of poultry will amount to  $26.15

million. Mr Speaker, before we go on to the future

proposals,  let us see what has been  done  in  the

past   which  has  prompted  us  to  present   this

Development Plan for the rural areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, the expansion of existing services and

the  implementation  of new  schemes  and  services

carried  out  by  the  P.A.P. Government  since  it

assumed  office  in  June 1959 have  benefited  and

assisted the farmers and fishermen in the following

ways.  Farmers  can  get  their  land  ploughed  at

cheaper  rates. Their young chickens below the  age

of  six weeks can now be protected against ranikhet

by  nasal  inoculation. Some  1,300  pigs  of  good

strain  have  been  sold to them to  improve  their

stock.  Mr Speaker, more young fishermen  can  now

get  training in fishing techniques. We  have  been

able   to  give  advice  and  instruction  on  farm

sanitation. Good husbandry practice, including  the

control  and treatment of diseases of farm animals,

has  been  made  available to  them  at  their  own

villages.  A  more  efficient  chicken  inoculation

service   as  well  as  a  more  efficient  disease

treatment service have been made available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Four-Year Development Plan, the above

services   will  be  continued  and  much   further

improved.  In  addition, the farmers  will  benefit

further  in  the  following ways. They  can  get  a

limited number of day-old chicks of good strain  at

reasonable prices. A lot of effort has been put  in

in  order to produce a good strain of chicks.  More

good farmland, more fish ponds and more prawn ponds

will   be   made   available  for  increasing   the

production of farmers and fishermen as a result  of

swamp  reclamation work. Fishermen in the  Southern

Islands  can  start rearing goats  with  Government

assistance to increase their income. Films will  be

shown  at  villages  and fishing  villages  in  the

farming areas, to show them the improved and latest

techniques. Farmers also can get advice on  how  to

control pests and diseases of vegetables and  fruit

trees and on haw to control their soil. Details  of

these schemes and services are as explained in  the

following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New schemes and services started since June 1959

which   will   be  continued  in  the   course   of

implementing the Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Cheap ploughing service: This service was

started  towards the end of 1959 with  one  tractor

(35  h.p.)  to assist farmers to plough their  land

with  mechanised equipment in order  to  cut  their

cost of production and to increase their productive

capacity.  This service has proved so popular  that

in  August  1950 two additional tractors (52  h.p.)

were  added.  The Primary Production Department  is

charging from $25 to $35 per acre depending on  the

nature  of the land ploughed, as against  the  high

rate charged by commercial tractor services of  $55

to  $60 per acre. This is very much more than  that

charged  by  the Primary Production Department.  In

1959  a  total of 10 acres were ploughed, while  in

1960 about 160 acres were ploughed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Nasal chick inoculation service: In the past

the  inoculation against ranikhet disease in  fowls

was  carried out by using hypodermic needles  only,

so that only chickens of more than six weeks of age

could be inoculated. As a result, chickens of under

six  weeks  of age were not protected against  this

disease.  A  new  scheme has been  implemented  for

inoculating day-old chicks with vaccine through the

nasal  cavity, and this service was started towards

the  end  of 1960. This will protect them from  the

day-old  stage. This service has been  welcomed  by

the farmers, and it helps them to cut their cost of

production.  So  far, 205,000  chickens  have  been

inoculated during the first three months since  the

implementation of this service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Distribution of pigs of improved strain:

Experimental work is being carried out continuously

to produce improved strains of pigs and poultry for

distribution  to  farmers. Since  June  1959,  over

1,300  pigs  of improved strain have been  sold  to

farmers to assist them to improve their stocks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Fisheries training courses: In order to cope

with  the need to provide employment for youths  in

the  rural areas and to prepare young fishermen for

the expansion of off-shore and deep-sea fishing,  a

pilot fisheries training course was started at  the

Malay  school  at  6¾ m.s. Pasir Panjang  to  teach

youths, among other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



subjects,  the  maintenance and repair  of  fishing

boat  engines,  the  construction  and  repair   of

fishing  gears and fishing boats and the  `rule  of

the road at sea'. This is only a preliminary course

and  more advanced courses will be conducted  later

under this Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in addition to the problems of the farmers, in order to assist them to improve their

techniques in animal husbandry, a series  of  talks

has  been  started early this year, 1961, by  rural

organisers  of  the Primary Production  Department,

with  a  veterinary  officer in  attendance.  These

talks deal with the most important aspects of  farm

sanitation    and   animal   husbandry   practices,

including the control and treatment of diseases  of

farm  animals. These talks have been well  attended

by  farmers  and attended also by their  wives  and

children.  These  talks have  been  useful  to  the

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, besides introducing new schemes since June 1959, the Government has also expanded

many existing services to benefit more farmers  and

to  give  them  improved  services.  The  following

services have been expanded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chick inoculation service by hypodermic

injection:  This  service, Mr  Speaker,  has  been

streamlined   and   expanded  by   employing   more

inoculators  so  that the farmers will  get  prompt

service.  A system of registration for the  service

has been formulated and is implemented strictly  so

as to ensure that there is no favouritism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farm animal disease treatment service: Mr

Speaker,  prior  to  June 1959,  the  treatment  of

diseases of pigs and poultry in the rural areas was

carried  out  in  the field by only one  veterinary

officer.  Since then this service has been improved

and  expanded  by utilising the services  of  three

veterinary  officers for the purpose. This  ensures

that  the  service  for the farmers  is  much  more

prompt than during the period prior to June 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free stud boar service: This service provides for

the  farmers the service of high quality stud boars

in  order to improve the strain of the pigs.  Since

June 1959, a new veterinary extension centre



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



has  been  established at Jurong where  seven  stud

bears  are kept for the free use of the farmers  in

the  Jurong  areas.  Mr Speaker,  those  were  the

services and schemes which were implemented  during

the past year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new schemes and services under the Four-Year

Development Plan are as under. Since the Government

assumed  office in June 1959, careful and  detailed

plans have been drawn up to cater for the needs  of

the   farmers  and  fishermen  in  Singapore.   The

following plans have already been finalised, or are

already  being implemented, or will be  implemented

under our Four-Year Development Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Improved stud boar service: Increased

production  of stud boars has already been  put  in

hand at the Government Animal Husbandry Stations so

that in a year or two, many more stud boars will be

available for the free use of farmers all over  the

State,  and  some of these boars will  be  sold  to

farmers at very reasonable rates. This is in  order

to improve the strains of pigs in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Improved strains of poultry: Improved strains

of  poultry  are also being produced at  Government

stations, and it is expected that towards  the  end

of  1961  the  sale  of better strains  of  day-old

chicks  to  farmers could be started on  a  limited

scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans are being drawn up to reclaim 4,000 acres

of  swamp  land so that about 1,000 acres  of  good

farming land, 2,000 acres of fish ponds, and  1,000

acres  of  prawn  ponds will be made  available  to

farmers  and fishermen to increase their production

to meet the needs of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Four-Year Development Plan, we have concentrated on Government Animal Husbandry

Stations  and also on the distribution of goats  to

the  Southern Islanders, about which plans are  in

progress, and the islanders have now been asked  to

grow  grass  in  order to provide  food  for  their

goats.  The  Film  Unit will also  be  improved  to

enable the farmers to learn more.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soil testing and spraying service will also be

provided. Mr Speaker, despite the fact that we are

short of land, yet we can be proud of the fact that

our  farmers and fishermen have shown their ability

to produce and rear poultry with good results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is no exaggeration to say that this Four-Year Development Plan is not merely a

film  show  to entertain the audience - in this  case

the  voters  or the people of Singapore - or  with  a

view  to winning the election. But as a responsible

Government,  it is our duty to bring  home  to  the

people of Singapore the problems which we are faced

with;  and  we  hope that the people of  Singapore,

with  a  sense  of  responsibility,  in  order   to

maintain economic stability, will give their

whole-hearted  support  in  implementing  this  Four-Year

Development Plan. Mr Speaker, I fully support this

Development Plan.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak?



<br><br>7.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been

sitting still listening to the election speeches of

the  Back-benchers from the Government side. It  is

indeed  a  pity  that the motion on  a  very  sober

Development  Plan presented by  the  Minister

for Finance  in  this blue book, and in a speech  which

was  just  as sober, should have been used  by  the

Back-benchers of the Government as an occasion  for

making  election speeches. Sir, I cannot understand

why,  after such a very able and sober presentation

by  the Minister for Finance, who has called on all

people to put their shoulders to the wheel and work

for  the  good  of  the people of Singapore,  there

should be Backbenchers of the Government who do not

heed  his call, why they should indulge in election

speeches   and  yet  in  their  enthusiasm   forget

themselves and try to say, as they are always  wont

to do, how bad the past Government was and how good

the present Government is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is true!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> But surely, Sir, even in this

blue   book,   it  has  been  said   that   certain

legislation  was introduced; and may I  remind  the

Back-benchers  on the Government benches  that  the

legislation referred to by the Minister for Finance

is   legislation   introduced   by   the   previous

Government,  and that if we had been  returned,  we

would  have  put into practice what we had  already

prepared.  We are not here, Sir, to make  political

speeches, because we are not interested in the Hong

Lim by-election at all. But when the seriousness of

the situation presented by the Minister for Finance is  being twisted by Government Back-benchers  into

political  speeches, saying how good they  are  and

how  bad  other people are, I must, as a Member  of

the  Opposition, stand up and correct them and  say

that  this is not the time. If they really mean  to

call   on   the  co-operation  of  all  people   in

Singapore,   this   is  not  the   time   to   cast

recriminations,  although  such  recriminations  in

this  particular case are unjustified. Perhaps  the

Minister for Culture still maintains the stand that

the  views of the Opposition are of no value to the

Government,  and he still could not care  less  how

the  Opposition votes. If so, one could excuse  the

Back-benchers. But one finds it difficult when  two

Parliamentary Secretaries, one in the  Ministry  of

Education and the other in the Ministry of National

Development, indulged in the same kind of  election

speeches.  How  bad  we  were  in  our  educational

policy!  How  crooked we were and how  honest  they

are!  May  I  tell them this: their honesty,  their

good work, all that they say that they have done in

the  past two years will be judged in Hong Lim?  We

are  not judging them. The people of Hong Lim  will

judge  what  they have done in the past two  years.

They  do not have to try and say. "We are so  good.

The others are so had. They are so dirty. We are so

clean."  If  it  makes them any happier,  they  can

claim they are as clean as they want to. But I  say

that  what they think of themselves does not count.

It  is what the people think of them that counts in

parliamentary    democracy.    The    Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for National Development

has overlooked



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



the  fact that, for the first time, we are  working

under  a  self-governing  Constitution,  where  the

Government of the day has full powers in so far  as

domestic   problems  are  concerned.  The  previous

Governments  were  nothing  but  partial   colonial

administrations.  During my time the  Minister  for

Finance, known as the Financial Secretary,  was  an

expatriate   officer   and  a   colonial   servant.

[Laughter] The Prime Minister may well laugh,  Sir,

but  the Prime Minister must have been aware of the

restrictions   of  the  Rendel  Constitution,   and

because  we  were so aware of the restrictions,  we

got  an All-Party delegation to go to London to get

a  new  Constitution, and this is the  Constitution

under  which they are now working. During our time,

the  City  Council was a separate authority.  There

was  their great ex-comrade, the great ex-Mayor  of

the  City  Council against whom they  are  fighting

today  in  a  by-election. The City Council  was  a

separate authority. We had no control over it in so

far  as  its development was concerned. The  S.I.T.

was  an  autonomous body. It was  not  the  Housing

Board  as  it  now is. It had its own  autonomy  in

planning   housing.  The  Harbour  Board,  another

authority,  had  its  own plans,  and  so  had  the

Telephone  Board.  But, Sir, the  reason  why  this

Development  Plan was not introduced at  that  time

was  that  there was then no necessity to introduce

it.  There was no such unemployment problem  as  we

have today. But we were aware that such a situation

would arise in the years to come. That was why  the

previous Government introduced legislation to  pave

the way for the industrialisation of Singapore. The

present   Government   is  now   benefiting   under

legislation  introduced by the previous Government.

Yet the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National  Development  said that  we  were

afraid - "afraid" was the word he used. We were not  afraid.

We  were restricted. Yet we were wise. If we had in

any  way  helped the P.A.P. towards  drawing  up  a

Development Programme, we ask for no credit. We say

we  serve the people. Let the people judge.  We  do

not  have to make election speeches 17 days before

Polling Day in Hong Lim.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary said that during our time we were a pro-capitalist Government. Yet today

they   are   working   under   labour   legislation

introduced by the previous Government. Yet, if they

remember  rightly, during our time when  they  were

leading  the trade unions in a militant  form,  did

they  not  get what they wanted? Did they  not  get

justice  done when strikes took place and they  had

conciliations taking place in my Ministry  at  that

time?  Did  we not give justice to the  workers  of

Singapore? Do not call us pro-capitalists. We would

not  like  to  describe the P.A.P. as something  or

other,  although they cannot deny  that  they  have

Left-wing   adventurers  and  so-called   Communist

sympathisers in their Party. We would not call them

that.   We   say  they  are  a  genuine  democratic

political Party. Before you ask the people to  work

together,  do not slap them. Today, the P.A.P. ask

for  capital - more and more investment. But what did

they  say, Sir, during the general elections? "Down

with capital! I will throw you into the sea if  you

do  not  co-operate with us. But if you  co-operate

with  us, you can at least still carry on for  five

years." And yet the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for  National Development said  we  drove

away capital. We drove away capital? Yet he said we

were  pro-capital. That we drove away our  friends!

Sir,  a lot of mistakes and blunders have been made

by  the  Party in power. They themselves admit  it.

They   say  that  rectification  is  taking  place.

Because  there was a rectification in the dismissal

of the Minister for National Development, there was

a heave of relief that a genuine rectification took

place;  that  perhaps the P.A.P., now  knowing  the

error of their ways, are learning that in this game

of  running a government one must play fair to  all

parties.  But  no. When it suits  them,  they  say,

"Down with capital! Out with the British! Kick them

into  the sea!" When it no longer suits them,  they

say,  "Please  help  us  to help  ourselves."  They

believe  in  the doctrine of slapping a man  first,

then  going down on their bended knees to  ask  for

assistance. That is not the way to run a government

to serve the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  Serving the people of  Singapore  is  a

sacred  task.  The  livelihood  of  the  people  of

Singapore is in the hands of the Government. It  is

a  sacred  duty  and they should not play  politics

with that sacred duty. We were prepared to stand up

and  say  today that the Plan is a good plan;  that

any  decent government, any government that  claims

to  be  Socialist, has to introduce such a plan  in

order to meet the growing unemployment problem. But

we  did not stand up to speak immediately after the

speech of the Minister for Finance, because he said

that  his  Ministerial colleagues  will  be  making

known  in  this House what they have done and  what

they propose to do. Surely, Sir, being a handful of

Opposition  Members, we must before we  speak  give

respect  to  Ministerial speeches, so that  we  can

stand  up and tell them, "Well done!" or tell them,

"Look  here,  that  is not the way  to  carry  on."

Therefore, I did not speak. I waited and I  thought

there  would have been gems of wisdom. There  would

have  been sober speeches saying, "We are dedicated

to  the  service of the country." Instead of  which

they  say,  "We,  the  P.A.P., - the  lightning - will

strike and strike capital away!" And we are blamed.

Today, the Government call on us to work with them.

Kick  a man down and then say. "You are my friend."

I tell the Government that they still have a lot to

learn,  that  in this sacred duty of looking  after

the  welfare  of the people of Singapore,  politics

must  not  be played, and the Minister for  Finance

knows  it very well. The motion is worded  in  such

language  as to appeal even to those who are

anti-P.A.P. We were quite touched by such an appeal.  We

were  prepared to say, "Aha, here is  a  Government

that  has  learnt  the error of  its  ways  and  is

calling on all people to work together for the good

of  the country." Instead of which they slap right,

left, centre, jeer, and ask us to vote and say, "We

support."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this motion there is exhortation to the

workers   and   trade   unions,   businessmen   and

industrialists.  May I hope,  Sir,  to  exhort  the

Government   to   a   better   sense    of    their

responsibility: that if they want co-operation from

the people, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



should first of all deserve that co-operation? They

should  not  go  out insulting the people,  kicking

them  about  and  saying. "We  require  your  help.

Without you we cannot work this Plan." That is  not

the  way.  This blue print fortunately is  in  very

sober  language,  and  fortunately  those  who  are

interested  in helping in the industrialisation  of

Singapore  will be guided by this blue  book.  They

will not be guided by the speeches made by the

Back-benchers  of the Government, because they will  not

have  the time nor the desire to find out  what  is

being  said  by  the  Back-benchers.  I  hope  not.

Because if they do, the Government can be sure they

are not coming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, the Minister for Finance has to

say  a  little bit about what has been said by  the

opposing  candidate  in  Hong  Lim.  That  we   can

understand. That we will overlook. But  when  other

Members from the Government side speak with an  eye

on  the  coming Hong Lim by-election, it  makes  me

feel that perhaps there might be some truth in  it.

The  Minister for Finance in his speech  said  that

early  this  year  proof copies of the  Development

Plan  were sent to the Government Printer. This  is

April.  Early  this year could be, at  the  latest,

February. Why hold this up until April, Sir, if  it

was  really  sent to the Government  Printer  early

this  year?  I will not say that they are  holding

this  up for a purpose. But I do say that they  are

not  giving the Opposition a fair chance. They sent

this  book  out and we received it on the  31st  of

March.  At the last sitting of this Assembly,  when

the  Leader  of the House moved that  the  Assembly

stood adjourn till today, we were not aware of  any

business for today's sitting. We received notice of

this  very important motion for the welfare,

well-being and livelihood of the people of Singapore and

the  poor  unemployed only at 3.30 p.m. on  Monday.

That  is  about  two  days  ago.  Of  course,   the

Government sent in the notice within the stipulated

time,  that is to say, by Saturday. And because  we

received  it late on Monday afternoon, it could  be

that  they sent it almost at the very last  minute.

Why  must  it  be  so, Sir? Perhaps the  Ministers,

particularly the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



Minister  for Finance, were so involved  in  seeing

that they do not lose Hong Lim to Mr Ong Eng Guan.

But  even so, the Minister for Finance must realise

that  on  an  important issue  of  this  kind,  the

Opposition  must be given a fair chance,  at  least

longer notice, to study this Development Plan so as

to  be  able  to  contribute intelligently  to  the

debate. Fortunately for us and fortunately for  me,

I  at  least  know  what this Plan  is  all  about,

because  part of this Plan was our Plan. I  had  no

difficulty.  But  I must tell the  Government  that

when they require the co-operation and help of even

the  Opposition,  that  co-operation  is  willingly

given if it is in the interest of the country.  But

when  they  ask for that co-operation, they  should

remember that they must give the Opposition a  fair

chance of contributing to this debate. The Minister

for Finance in his speech has said that some of the

projects  which  he  inherited  from  the  previous

administrations  were already in rough  form.  Even

the  blue  book says so. And yet we have the

Back-benchers on the other side saying that when we were

in  the government, we were a rotten government and

they for the first time in the history of Singapore

have  introduced a Development Plan. I am  prepared

to pay them credit. Because of the scrapping of the

City  Council,  because  of  the  creation  of  the

Housing  Board,  because of the  Singapore  Harbour

Board  and  the Telephone Board being brought  more

under their control, they are at least able,  as  a

Government,  to present an overall picture.  During

our  time we could only do what was good with  what

power  we  had  under  the Constitution.  The  City

Council had a great Mayor who did what he wanted to

do and was greatly acclaimed by the P.A.P. He is no

longer acclaimed. He is being spat at and called  a

liar  openly.  We  had  no control  over  the  City

Council.  We  had  no  control over  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust.  Moreover,  we  had  a  Finance

Minister who was a colonial official. So even if we

had wanted to draw up a Development Plan, how could

we?  But  as I have said earlier, and I  seek  your

indulgence,  Mr Speaker, Sir, if  I  repeat  again

this,  because we knew that such a thing must  come

and  has  to come, we laid the foundation.  So  the

Pioneer Industry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance is now on the statute book. The Extension

of  Industries Ordinance was introduced by us. Also

the  Control of Manufacture Ordinance and even  the

amendment to the Customs Ordinance whereby power is

given  to the Minister to introduce straightaway  a

protective tariff to see that any industry that  is

given  pioneer status in the country is  not  being

jeopardized  by  the import of  goods  coming  from

foreign countries. All these were laid down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, a government which is to be

worthy  of  its  name - and the P.A.P. Government  is

worthy  of  its  name - has to present a  Development

Plan  at this particular juncture. It has to. There

is   no  other  way  of  solving  the  unemployment

problem. But it knows its limitations, it has to go

and  borrow about $501 million. So even  if  we  as

individuals are to go and borrow money, there  must

be  some  goodwill.  May I ask  what  goodwill  the

P.A.P.  Government has as a result of  its  present

utterances?  I must admit the Minister for  Finance

is doing a very, very tough job indeed, but all his

efforts  are being, if I may say so in this  House,

damaged by some of his Ministerial colleagues. Here

is  the  Minister for Finance saying, "Let us  work

and  stand  together. Let us see  that  everybody's

interest is properly and fairly represented."  Then

we have the Minister for Labour and Law saying, "If

you  do  not do this, I shall detain you under  the

P.P.S.O."  What is this? You want the  goodwill  of

employers,  and yet you threaten to use a  security

Ordinance   meant   for  subversives   against   an

employer.  There are instances where  the  Minister

for Labour and Law has ticked trade unions off; but

where they have been ticked off, I can assure  this

House  that they are not P.A.P. trade unions. Where

then  is the justification? If it is a P.A.P. led

trade  union, "Ah, good, the P.P.S.O. against  the

employer."  If it is not a P.A.P. led trade  union,

"Oh, no, you are wrong; go back to work." Sir, that

is  not  the  way  to get the co-operation  of  all

people.  In  this  game of life  and  death,  there

should be no party politics. The Government will be

judged  even without its saying, "We are the P.A.P.

We  gave you this." If after four years, this  Plan

succeeds, there is no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



need  for  them to run down any previous government

by  saying  that  they are a good  Government.  The

people  will know, how to vote. If they  have  done

well,  they  do not have to start playing  politics

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even this blue book says that the

Development  Plan is just a little scratch  on  the

unemployment problem - just a little help.  But  what

is  more  important  is  the  industrialisation  of

Singapore, and we agree with them. Everybody agrees

with  them. Industrialisation is the only solution,

and  this  Development Plan is aimed at  increasing

the   facilities  for  industrialisation.  To  that

extent,  it  is  a good Plan. It must  receive  the

support  of  all  right-thinking  people.  But  the

industrialisation  of Singapore is  another  thing,

Sir. When the P.A.P. came into power, what did  the

Minister   for  Finance  say?  "Oh,  the   previous

Government  did not even think of some bright  idea

like  the Common Commodity Market", although during

my  time  we  had  discussions with the  Federation

Government  on  how  we should  not  step  on  each

other's  toes.  Insofar  as  industrialisation   is

concerned, there should be a Pan-Malayan  Committee

advising  on the opening up of factories.  If  this

Committee  is to advise that soap factories  should

be  in the Federation, then there should be no soap

factories  in  Singapore; and if  a  steel  factory

should  be  in Singapore, then there should  be  no

steel factory in the Federation. And that helps.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What helps?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> And still they say we had no

idea.  But  the  Common  Commodity  Market  is  the

answer.  Today one would have expected the Minister

for  Finance  to  say something  about  the  Common

Commodity Market. But not a word. The Minister  for

Finance  has  said that without a Common  Commodity

Market, industrialisation will fail. Has he told us

what  has  happened to the Common Commodity  Market

talks   with  the  Federation?  If  they  are   not

successful  or if they are still proceeding,  could

he  give us some idea? "Oh, no, it is a bad  thing.

We must cover up because it is no good. There is  a

by-election  in  Hong Lim. 29th  April  is  Polling

Day." That is not the way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



to   handle  a  very,  very  serious  problem.  The

Minister for Finance himself has admitted  in  this

House that unless we have an understanding with the

Federation  of  Malaya  on  the  Common   Commodity

Market,  industrialisation will fail in  Singapore.

Perhaps  he  has changed his views. But  I  do  not

think   he  can  say  this,  Sir.  He  is  a   very

responsible  Minister and he knows the  urgency  of

having  an agreement with the Federation of Malaya.

Industrialisation  cannot  succeed   in   Singapore

unless   there   is  an  understanding   with   the

Federation of Malaya. There are certain reasons why

he  cannot  succeed. Of course,  the  Minister  for

Finance  can  say that although Singapore  has  1.6

million  people and the Federation has 6.5  million

people,  yet  the  purchasing power  is  the  same.

Therefore,  if factories were to open in  Singapore

it   would  be  quite  all  right.  But  does   the

Government   not   realise  that   the   Federation

Government   has   already   started    plans    to

industrialise   Johore  Bahru   just   across   the

Causeway? Does the Government not realise that  the

factories  in  Bukit Timah today  could  simply  go

across to Johore Bahru where they have at least the

knowledge that they do not have a Government  which

sets  upon  them at times and then calls upon  them

for their co-operation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Employers.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister for Finance

suddenly  walks in and chips in "employers".  I  am

sorry  I have to bring the subject up again because

he  has  chipped  in.  He  has  not  given  us  any

indication  how the Common Commodity  Market  talks

are  going, and yet he has said I am repeating this

for  his  benefit  since he has just  come  in-that

without  art  understanding with the Federation  of

Malaya, industrialisation will fail in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Since the Minister has been

away.  I would like to inform him of what has  been

going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps my

interruption  of the hon. Member's speech  may  not

have  been quite appropriate, but the first thought

that  struck me, when he was holding forth  on  the

iniquities   of  the  Government,   was   that   he

represents the interests of businessmen.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister gets up on a

point  of  elucidation. He must indicate  what  the

point is. If he wishes for elucidation on what  the

Member  for  Cairnhill  has  just  said,  he   must

indicate what that point is.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The point I was making is that

he  cannot, on the one hand, say that we have  done

nothing  at all to give encouragement to industrial

expansion  here,  and,  on the  other  hand,  claim

superior  merits  for industrialists  to  carry  on

activities  in Johore Bahru. That was the  point  I

was making and if I-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is a point

which the Minster for Finance will perhaps raise in

his reply. What is the point of elucidation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So be it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in spite of what I have

been  saying  in all seriousness in this  House,  a

Front-bencher  says,  "Hm",  and  a  Minister  says

that - I repeat it again - it will be dangerous to  the

Development   Plan   of  the  Government   if   the

Government is to behave in this kind of fashion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> What fashion - treating them

with contempt?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It would appear, Sir, that

although  this  Plan is written in sober  language,

because of what has been said just now, that  sober

language does not come from the heart. If it  is  a

bait,  do  not think that that is the way to  serve

the   people  of  Singapore.  We  should  not  play

politics with the livelihood of unemployed  people.

There are 80,000 of them today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> How many? You have not read

the Plan. It is not-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Some Members on the

Government  side  have not been present  throughout

the  speech of the Member for Cairnhill. So perhaps

they  have  lost track of what he has said.  But  I

must, in any event, prevent any repetition of  what

has been said in the past. Even though Ministers on

the  Government side have not chosen to be  present

during  the  speech  of the Member  for  Cairnhill,

there must not be any tedious repetition.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I was saying that

industrialisation cannot succeed  if  there  is  no

understanding with the Government of the Federation

of  Malaya.  As  it  is today,  the  Government  of

Singapore  and the Government of the Federation  of

Malaya  are  competing  in their  industrialisation

plans and each of them is trying to get as much  as

they  can on the same market. Unless there  can  be

that understanding, and if the Minister for Finance

can  say  that the Common Commodity Market idea  is

now  a  reality,  then I think there  is  hope  for

industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before an industrialist starts a factory in

Singapore,   he   wants  to   know   his   consumer

potentiality. The consumer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



potentiality  for  Singapore is  just  1.6  million

people,  whereas  if he opens his  factory  in  the

Federation,   just  in  Johore  Bahru   - which   is

separated  by one mile of the Causeway - he  has  6.5

million  plus  1  .6  million  (the  whole  Malayan

market)  at  his  disposal. So which  industrialist

will  want  to open a factory in Singapore  if,  by

doing  so in the Federation, he also has the market

in Singapore? Therefore, some understanding or some

arrangement is desirable and vitally necessary with

the  Federation Government. Again, if one says that

there  is  the export market potentiality,  surely,

Sir,  there  is such a thing as consumer prejudice.

It  is  hard to introduce a new brand of goods  and

expect to sell them overnight. You cannot do  that.

Unless  it is a well-established brand, it  is  not

possible to have an export market for it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

Resumption of debate, what day?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Tomorrow.
