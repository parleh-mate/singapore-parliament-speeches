<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> At the Moment of interruption last night we were on

<br>Section: BUDGET Order read for resumed consideration in Committee of Supply (2nd Allotted Day]. Resumption of debate on Question (19th March, 1970), reduced by $10 in respect of subhead l0O1."-[Madam Chan Choy Siong]. Head 0501 (contd.) - the first amendment to Head 0501, Ministry of Foreign Affairs.



 "That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br>The Question is, reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001." The Member for Punggol had the Floor when the debate was interrupted. Mr Ng Kah Ting, you have three minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was touching on the question of the

<br>staffing of our overseas missions when the Moment of interruption came. I think I dealt with that issue at some length. My last question is whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs will consider creating a post of Information Officer in each of these missions so that, among other things, he can also help boost the tourist trade.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since

<br>the general remarks made by Members have been gratifying, I will not take up the time of this House by dealing with them. However, I would like to elucidate on or reply to some of the points raised by Members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



<br>The Member for Sembawang wanted to know what benefit Singapore would gain by joining A.S.E.A.N.

<br>and what projects, if any, it has initiated. He wanted to seek further details about the $3 million that we have contributed towards A.S.E.A.N. The third ministerial meeting of A.S.E.A.N, was held at Cameron Highlands last year. The meeting approved 98 recommendations covering projects for co-operation among A.S.E.A.N, countries. They include, among other things, the fields of commerce and industry, tourism, shipping, civil aviation, air traffic services, meteorology, transportation and communications, food supply, fisheries and so on.

<br>The A.S.E.A.N. Standing Committee and the A.S.E.A.N. Secretaries-General at their meeting last month in Manila decided to meet more often in order to keep in touch with the progress of the work of the various committees and to get a move on with the work of A.S.E.A.N.



<br>As I have repeatedly stated, A.S.E.A.N, is rather a new venture by relatively under-developed countries which have agreed to work towards regional co-operation. I just want to remind Members of the House that the European Economic Community, consisting largely of well-established and highly industrialised nations, has after a period of some 20 years, just about got going with regional co-operation. So I do not think we should expect too much of A.S.E.A.N, during a period of only three years. However, though nothing spectacular will be achieved for a long time, there is, nevertheless, some small but hopeful progress being made.



<br>For example, take three of the more important achievements, if you would like to call them that.

<br>First, there is the project for a "Visit A.S.E.A.N. Year" in 1971 to promote tourism in the region. Secondly, there is the acceptance of a Memorandum of Understanding on Assistance to A,S.E.A.N, on Economic Co-operation by E.C.A.F.E. Thirdly, there is the creation of an A.S.E.A.N. Fund.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



<br>I will take this opportunity to reply to the Member for Punggol about the purposes of the A.S.E.A.N. Fund. We agreed at the meeting at Cameron Highlands to contribute U.S. $1 million, which works out roughly to $3,080,000 in our currency. The contribution is to be paid into the national fund of each member country and held in custody by that country. The national fund will be replenished by each member country to the required level as decided by the Foreign Ministers, taking into account any outstanding claims for reimbursements by member countries. The fund is to be used only for the purposes of implementing projects which have been approved by the Foreign Ministers of A.S.E.A.N, countries. The projects so approved will be categorised as approved projects.

<br>Under the agreement, the host government will be responsible for the administrative and capital costs of the approved projects, the operational cost being shared equally by member countries. The agreement also provides for the ownership of any property, movable or immovable, acquired by the host government, under an approved project to be vested in the host government. However, the host government may not exercise the right to dispose of any such property until after completion of the approved projects unless otherwise agreed to by the Foreign Ministers. Sir, this roughly is the principle on which the A.S.E.A.N. Fund will operate.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



<br>Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson raised the question of housing allowances for officers serving in our missions abroad. It is true that Government officers serving in our missions abroad are not paid a separate housing allowance for the simple reason that they are provided free accommodation in their respective stations. The accommodation is commensurate with their status. In each case a rent ceiling is fixed, again commensurate with the status of the particular officer and having regard to the prevailing conditions. It is true that officers are expected to obtain suitable accommodation of their choice in locations approved by the heads of missions but within an approved ceiling. In the opinion of the head of the mission, if the accommodation is sometimes considered inadequate or inappropriate, such representations are carefully considered. Rent ceilings have by and large been raised to the recommended levels.



<br>The other point which the Member for Anson raised was whether, on their return, serving officers are provided with accommodation until they are reposted. There has been no provision in the past for quarters or accommodation for officers returning from abroad. But they are allowed three days' stay in a hotel in Singapore at Government expense on their return from abroad. However, it has now been agreed with the Ministry of Finance that suitable accommodation be provided for such officers on payment of a reasonable rent. At present, negotiations are under way for the leasing of suitable flats, probably from the Housing and Development Board. These flats will be used to accommodate officers returning from abroad until their next posting, or to enable them to secure suitable accommodation for themselves or their families if they are not being posted.



<br>I think the Member for Telok Blangah and a few other Members made some comments on the lack of equipment in some of the overseas offices, about rent being paid for houses which are not occupied, and that they should be larger and so on. I think the Member had one particular mission in mind, where admittedly things were a little bit rough for the head of the mission.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br>In fact, he has written to me a number of times.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



<br>The reason is that we had to send an advance team from the Ministry of Finance to this particular country to recommend purchases in regard to office equipment, furniture and so on. But it was found that things like typewriters, duplicating machines and a few other pieces of office equipment were extremely expensive in that particular country. So we had to purchase and ship them from Singapore and communications are not all that speedy in that part of the world. So the head of the mission and his staff had to rough it out for a while. But I am happy to say that since then I have had no letters of complaint from the head of the mission. He is extremely satisfied. In fact, he has gone on a visit to other parts of this particular country. I think this matter has been rectified.



<br>On the question of rent which was paid for a house which was not occupied for some four months, this was due to the delay in selecting a suitable officer for this particular mission. At the same time, we did not want to let go this particular house because we might have to send another advance team from Singapore to look for another house. So we asked them to hold on to the house.

<br>Unfortunately, the selection took about four months. The officer is there now and he is occupying the house and everything is going along smoothly.



<br>The Member for Punggol wanted to know about the annual contributions that Singapore makes to international organisations. My Ministry is responsible for contributing to some 17 international organisations such as the World Meteorological Organisation, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the International Customs Tariff Bureau and other international agencies like the United Nations, E.C.A.F.E., the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation and so on. The amounts of contributions vary from year to year as they are generally based on the annual budget submitted by these bodies. The annual budget is apportioned on a particular formula. In addition to these, we also make donations to such organisations as the Peace Keeping Force in Cyprus, the Refugee Fund in the Middle East and so on, on an ad hoc basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome the idea of sending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>





<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is part of my strategy

<br>an advance team before setting up a foreign mission. But the idea of sending two members from the Treasury is not practical. Is it not possible to include in this advance team a member from the Foreign Ministry who would be in a better position to set up missions abroad than an officer from the Treasury who only thinks of dollars and cents? always to appear to be cooperating with the Treasury. I always like to have one member and, if possible, more members from the Treasury in the advance team, because whatever recommendations they eventually make on the spot are generally far more acceptable than recommendations made from the home office. But I would agree that in future somebody from Foreign Office should also accompany an official from the Treasury so that he would be able to bring home to the Treasury official the requirements of a mission abroad.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang) (In Mandarin):</b> Sir, as the Minister has given

<br>satisfactory answers, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br>That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1062. Sir, some time ago I raised the question of Students' Counsellor and inquired of the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether or not there would be other Students' Counsellors to be posted to other missions. Here again, I would like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to consider posting more Students' Advisers to our missions abroad and to places where we have a concentration of our students. With the help of these Advisers, our students abroad will be able to keep themselves informed of events in Singapore. At the same time, they will be able to explain to their friends what and where Singapore is. This is important because, in the course of my meetings with some of our students overseas, they complain that they do not know What is happening at home. In order to get information, they have to go to our missions and some of them are far away from their places of study. In this respect, if more Students' Advisers are attached to our missions, they will be a great help to our students.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not disagree in principle

<br>that it is good to have as many Students' Advisers as possible wherever there are students. But, by and large, our students are concentrated in the United Kingdom, Australia, and an increasing number in the United States. It is impractical to have a Students' Adviser attached to all places or universities where students forgather. In the United Kingdom, we have about 1,500 students, and therefore it is both practical and worth our while to have a Students' Adviser attached to our High Commission in London. His duties include assisting in placement work, the welfare of students and so on. In Australia, where there is another heavy concentration of Singapore students, there is no Students' Adviser. But there are Students' Liaison Officers in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth who work direct with our High Commissioner in regard to student affairs, including welfare in their respective areas. If at some future time we feel that there is a sufficient number of students in any particular locality or country to justify either a Students' Adviser or a Students' Liaison Officer, we shall give it consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am happy with the Minister's reply, and I

<br>beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br>That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1071. Sir, I would like to take issue on the term think the term "Cypher Officer" should not be included in the Estimates. It should be changed to another name. My contention is this. We have some 15 missions overseas and I believe more will be set up in the future. In most of these missions, we will inevitably be having such officers. Therefore, if we have the figure "6" against the term "Cypher Officer", are we not letting the cat out of the bag, so to speak? I urge the Minister to consider redesignating this post.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the point of the Member is that by

<br>redesignating a Cypher Officer as a Stenographer or some other name, the country concerned will not get on to the fact that the gentleman is a Cypher Officer. I do not think much purpose would be served by changing the name unless there are far more pressing reasons. Last year, the Member suggested changing the designation of one particular officer. There was some justification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, if that is the case, I beg leave to withdraw

<br>But in the case of "Cypher Officers", I do not think we are going to achieve very much. Most likely I will get into difficulties with the Treasury because they can say, "You are supposed to have Cypher Officers. How is it that you have somebody else?" I understand the intentions of the Member. We are not going to solve the problem or allay his fears by redesignating the term "Cypher Officer" by some other name. my amendment.



<br>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,





<br>That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1095. Sir, I believe the question of what is a make-up allowance was raised by my colleague, the Member for Anson, last evening. This is a new provision. I do not know whether it is "make-up" in the sense that we generally take it to be, or make-up in another sense. I shall be grateful if the Minister will care to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this subhead 1095 means what it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



(lie  sum  total  of the salary and allowances,  if

<br>means. It is a make-up allowance and it does not make up anything else. The special make-up allowance has been designed to compensate overseas officers with working wives for the loss of their wives' income. In the world of diplomacy, as Members know, it is not only desirable, but very wise, that married officer diplomats should have their wives with them in foreign countries. Working wives who have to give up their employment in Singapore to accompany their husbands overseas, we feel, should be compensated for by adjustments to their husbands' salary. At the moment, the overseas allowance to officers does not take into account loss of wives' earnings. It is only paid to enable overseas officers to meet additional expenses that they would have to incur to maintain a standard of living that would be a credit to Singapore, and to meet the high cost of living in the countries of their postings. Therefore, it is only reasonable, we feel, that an allowance should be paid to compensate the husband and wife for their loss. The quantum of allowance is arrived at by subtracting any, of a husband and wife drawn on the date immediately before the date of the husband's posting overseas from the sum of the salary, overseas allowance, children's allowance, acting allowance and so on, payable to him as a result of his posting to a mission.

<br>and I beg leave to have my amendment withdrawn.

<br>That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1162. Sir, according to the explanatory note under this head, it is a post different from that of subhead 1163, that is a clerk/typist. In other words, it seems to me that this officer has been promoted as an Executive Assistant, drawing a salary which I believe is equivalent to our administrative officer. Sir, in this respect, I would like to seek elucidation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he would consider replacing such an officer with one of our equivalent rank, that is, an administrative officer, whose post will be probably that of a Second Secretary. Although I do not know the nature of the work of this Executive Assistant and whether we should recruit such local staff at such a high salary, I think we can supply such an officer from Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this subhead 1162 refers to the

<br>appointment of an Executive Assistant. Past experience has led our mission in New York to conclude that they need a local person capable of preparing factual draft briefs on agenda items for the United Nations General Assembly sessions, research on any given subject, translating correspondence in French and Spanish into English, putting up background material on matters which come before the United Nations as directed by our permanent representative to the United Nations, and preparing factual minutes of the United Nations resolutions adopted during the General Assembly sessions. This was therefore supported by my Ministry, and as obviously the duties call for special talent and experience far greater than those expected of a clerk or typist, it was proposed and agreed to by the Ministry of Finance that the post of Executive Assistant should be created against the deletion of the post of Clerk/ Typist, and that it should be filled by a local person.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I fully agree with the Minister on the

<br>second part of the question, but I do not quite see his point on the first part, because with regard to extracting minutes or proceedings in the United Nations, whether they be committee meetings or plenary sessions, such work can be done and the officer can be trained and taught how to do it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



<br>Probably the other difficulty may be the question of interpreting or translating foreign languages like Spanish. French and Russian. In this respect, Sir, we could try to find out whether or not one of our local citizens of that calibre can be found, and if he or she is found, whether he or she can be sent over to the mission and, in course of time, learn the nature of the job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Of course, Mr Speaker, Sir,I do agree that if

<br>we can find a local person with those capabilities, naturally he would be sent, but unfortunately we have not been able to find that talent. Even if there is such talent, I do not think we will be able to entice him to come to my Ministry. That being the case, we have to make good with whatever is available. But just for the information of Members, despite what appears to be a fairly attractive pay, the lady in question has decided to tender her resignation because she is getting married and hopes to get a better job.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I must thank the Minister for his patience,

<br>and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br>That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1521. This is to seek information only. I note that the provision for the Embassy at Rangoon is only for locally recruited staff and appears to be for part of the year only. Is it the intention of the Government to ask another Ambassador to cover the duties in our Rangoon Embassy, and begin operations only at the end of the year? If so, will the Minister state which Ambassador will cover the duties in our Rangoon Embassy and when will it begin work? notice until it appeared in print in the Budget Estimates. This was in the early days soon after independence when we were deciding where to put up our missions. Since then, events have moved very fast and with our limited resources we have had a different system of priorities. So even should we announce that "Tomorrow we are going to establish a mission in such and such a place," events would have so overtaken our initial planning that we might have to change the venue from one country to another. Therefore, I am afraid that this particular item is one which has been overtaken by events. Not that we have no intention of establishing a mission in Rangoon, but with our limited resources and priorities, there is no immediate intention of establishing a mission in Rangoon.

Sir, from the rather forcibly expressed letters from our Ambassador in Manila, I understand that it is the practice in Manila for offices as well as residential areas to have security guards for a variety of reasons. Indeed, all diplomatic missions in Manila have their own security guards to look after their own chanceries. The security guard shown under the subhead 1646 is for our chancery in Manila. Our Ambassador's residence is located in Forbes Park Village, and there is an association which affords protection to residents in the village. A sum of about 520 pesos is paid daily by each resident to meet the salaries of the security guards and other expenses. Therefore, this sum is only to pay for a security guard for our chancery. I must congratulate our Ambassador there, because he has not yet pressed for a security guard for his residence.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member is quite right in

<br>The following amendments stood on the Order Paper Supplement (8) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2016. (9) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2020. That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3104. Sir, in moving this amendment, may I seek your permission to range over the subject covered in the next amendlnent* standing in my name? (11) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3105. Expenses for Singapore Missions Overseas". But I notice that provision is already made for these missions under subheads 2081 to 2096, under the section "Overseas Missions". I would be grateful if the Minister could enlighten this House on the necessity of having to provide staff and expenses amounting to $1,483,760 for Singapore Missions Overseas. I take it that there might be new overseas missions to be set up, and, if so, will he kindly indicate where and when they will be set up? Subhead 3105, "Expenses on Representations Overseas", is a new subhead, and it has three little letters "sts" against it, meaning "Subject to Treasury sanction". I would like to seek further information on the provision of $36,000. What are the overseas representations that we are likely to attend, and who will be attending them? his guess--that subhead 3104 is in respect of expenses which will be incurred in connection with the opening of new missions. We have the agreement of Treasury to open four new missions. Apparently it will be indiscreet of me to mention the names and places of representations that we may or may not open, because it will cause a loss of face all round. We propose to open about four new missions, two of which are fairly certain to be established -one in Moscow and the other in one of the countries in Western Europe. Certainly it will be administratively convenient to have the funds first before we make decisions to open new missions during the coming year.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



<br>Subhead 3105 refers to provision for heads of missions who are concurrently accredited to more than one country. The sum entered under this subhead is to meet travelling expenses, subsistence allowances, communications expenses, and so on. In the performance of their duties, heads of missions have to incur such expenses when they visit countries to which they are concurrently accredited. For example, our Ambassador in Washington is also accredited to Brazil. Our permanent representative in the United Nations in New York is also accredited to Canada. Our High Commissioner in New Delhi is also accredited to the Kingdom of Nepal and our Ambassador in Cairo is also accredited to four countries - the Lebanon, Yugoslavia, Pakistan and Ethiopia.

<br>That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $100*. (* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Low Yong Nguan.) Sir, can the Foreign Minister inform this House whether there is a practice to ensure periodical examination of the position of our missions abroad, with a view to assessing their needs and requirements? is there any way to relax Treasury control of certain expenditure by our missions abroad? Perhaps these problems may be efficiently resolved by investing our Ambassadors or High Commissioners with the discretion and authority to interpret their own problems.



<br>At this moment the Ministry of Foreign Affairs finds it rather difficult to attract highly qualified people to join the foreign service because, as I say, there is no scheme to ensure promotion, if this scheme is absent, surely no one is interested as he will suffer in the long run.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



<br>Again, Sir, can the Minister inform this House what measures are being taken to ensure that the recruitment of personnel into the diplomatic service abroad is sound and effective? Also, in view of the high cost of living abroad, may I know what entertainment allowances are given to our officers in overseas missions? working of the missions abroad, in the light of experience over the past few years, I think we have, through a series of trial and error procedures, finally arrived at a position where we are able to for-mulate a more coherent foreign service scheme. The first step is to attract and retain officers as well as to smooth out the inevitable difficulties that the man-on-the-spot, i.e., our Ambassadors, encounters when he conies up against the machinery of the government at home. It is a fairly comprehensive scheme, but one of the aims is that there will be a greater delegation of responsibility to the Ambassador concerned, in regard to details of finance or otherwise. This is so partly because a routine has been established.

<br>In the early days everybody in the foreign service was a bit cautious because the Ambassador was new, everybody else was new to the game. If there were no strict controls, we might find ourselves involved in unnecessary difficulties.



<br>With regard to a foreign service scheme, I think we are now moving to a position where we feel that we can attract more suitable people who are prepared to serve abroad. One of the difficulties is that if a young local officer is given the choice, he would rather enter the local administrative service, where the prospects of promotion are greater, than join the foreign service where the scope for advancement is limited because the Foreign Ministry itself is a small outfit. So these officers naturally tend to be diffident about serving abroad because they feel that they will miss chances for promotion and advancement in the civil service. This is one of the reasons why we are reluctant to have a separate foreign service because then the officer feels that he will fall into a trap. Therefore, we are devising a scheme whereby an officer entering the foreign service will not lose or be deprived of a chance, depending on his ability and so on, of rapid advance in the home service.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



<br>As regards entertainment allowances, I think there is no problem. Everybody likes to have a bit more entertainment allowance, and as far as I know, there has been no serious representation made by some of our missions abroad as to the inadequacy of these allowances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1001*.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Madam Chan Choy Siong, Mr P.Govindaswamy, Mr Hwang Soo un, Mr Seah Mui Kok, and Mr Cheong Yuen Chee.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to raise three questions under this

amendment, i.e., citizenship, work permits and

industrial accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will speak on citizenship. Backbenchers

have  often  raised  the question  of  citizenship.

However, we do this not because we like to  grumble

at  the Minister. As spokesmen of the people, it is

our  duty to give our views reflecting the  current

opinion  of our people. The question of citizenship

is  a  pressing problem to many of our people. Many

of  the applications for citizenship have come from

old  people, young wives and children.  If  people

have  no  citizenship,  how  can  they  provide   a

livelihood  for their family? I hope  the  Minister

will  adopt  a  sympathetic attitude towards  these

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember on the 9th of this

month the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Labour told the House that the Government would

review the policy on citizenship. He said that each

case would be carefully considered on its merits.

This is a very wise attitude to take. It shows that

the Parliamentary Secretary is not a stubborn man.

However, as far as I know, the Government has not

in fact changed its policy on citizenship for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



past  two  or  three years. There are  applications

which  have been outstanding for a few years. After

waiting  for  some years, the applicants  have  now

received  a notice that they have not been  granted

citizenship. I think the Government has not made  a

frequent  enough  review  of  its  policy  on  this

matter.  This  goes to show that the  Parliamentary

Secretary  says  one thing and means  another.  His

words and actions do not tally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I realise, of course, that the

reason  why  we have to be strict with applications

for  citizenship is that our country is now  facing

serious economic problems. However, our economy  is

now   showing  an  upward  trend.  The  number   of

unemployed  has  fallen  sharply.  The   time   has

therefore  come  for  us to review  the  conditions

which  qualify a person for citizenship. Of course,

we  cannot completely relax the conditions. I would

like  to ask the Minister to relax at least 50  per

cent  of  the conditions. If he can do this,  I  am

sure  we can relieve the hardships of many  of  the

applicants. If we adopt a policy of gradual change,

then  in a few years' time we will be able to solve

the question of citizenship completely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the question of work permits.

In  his  Budget speech recently, the  Minister  for

Finance told the House that the Government intended

to  relax  the conditions for the issuing  of  work

permits.  This  is very good news to  the  would-be

applicants.  I  am  sure  that  when  the  Minister

referred to the relaxation of immigration rules, he

was   referring  to  applicants  with   specialised

skills. This is an important factor in our economy.

I  would also like to point out that in addition to

workers with specialised skills, we are also  short

of  unskilled  labourers. As far as  I  know,  some

barber shops, coffee shops and restaurants are very

short  of  workers. There are two reasons for  this

shortage.  First,  a  large, number  of  our  young

people  have  been called up for national  service.

Secondly,  our  rapidly expanding  industries  have

been absorbing many of our young workers. There  is

thus  a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



case  for  relaxing  the  conditions   for

granting work permits to ordinary workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to touch upon is industrial

accidents.  As a result of the rapid  expansion  of

our   industries,  there  is  a  corresponding  and

shocking  increase  in  the  number  of  industrial

accidents.  According  to the  report,  there  were

8,147  cases of industrial accidents in  1968,  109

being  fatal.  In 1969 there were  8,714  cases  of

industrial accidents, 130 being fatal. We can  thus

see  that  the  number of industrial  accidents  is

increasing  from year to year. As  a  result,  many

widows  and  orphans are left  to  suffer.  In  his

replies   to   questions   in   this   House,   the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Labour

said  that these industrial accidents had  occurred

as a result of the shortage of staff in the section

for the prevention of industrial accidents. I think

more  people  should be employed to strengthen  the

staff in this section of the Ministry of Labour.  I

hope  the staff in this section are familiar,  with

the  different types of machinery so that they  can

prevent  the  increase of industrial  accidents.  I

would  like to know what steps have been  taken  to

overcome  this  problem. I hope  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  will  take  a  more  positive   attitude

towards  this matter. I hope he will take immediate

steps  to prevent industrial accidents. It is  only

through  effective measures that we can reduce  its

number.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we all remember

when   the  Minister  for  Labour  introduced   the

Employment Bill. The reason he gave was  that  this

Bill   would   improve  the  relationship   between

employers  and  employees to their mutual  benefit.

This   would   in   turn  help   to   promote   our

industrialisation   efforts.    As    Members    of

Parliament, we were pleased to hear this. In fact,

all  the  people of Singapore were pleased to  hear

this. The Minister also said at that time that,  as

Members of Parliament reflect the opinions  of  the

people, they would have some reservations







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



about   the  Bill.  The  Bill  would  have  certain

unfavourable  effects on labour. The Minister  then

gave  a  guarantee  that after a certain  time  the

Employment Act would be subject to review. However,

a considerable length of time has elapsed since the

Employment  Bill  was  passed.  We  know  that  the

Employment  Act  has been more favourable  to  the

employers than to the employees. It is not  to  the

advantage  of  the  workers. Employers  have  often

abused  the  powers given to them under  this  Act.

They have forced the workers to work hard for them.

There  have  been  some cases  of  exploitation  by

employers. I can quote some examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Employment Act was passed, every shop

assistant was entitled to 21 days' full-pay  leave.

However,  I  know  that  in  many  firms  the  shop

assistants  have  now lost the  right  of  full-pay

leave.  This right has been taken away  from  them.

Furthermore,  during  Christmas  or   the   Chinese

festival, business is better and, of course,  those

who  are  in business would like to make  money  on

these  occasions. They like their shops  to  remain

open even on Sunday although it is supposed to be a

day  of  rest  for  the  employees.  There  is   no

provision in the Act to say that Sunday should be a

day of rest. In other words, they can have a day of

rest  any  day of the week but not specifically  on

Sunday. The workers have accepted this as a  matter

of  fact.  The employers can have more business  on

Sunday  and the employees can make more  money  and

thus  they  can look after one another's  interest.

But  the question is this. During the months before

the  festival, many shops are open for business the

whole  week  without  a  day  of  rest.  The   shop

assistants have lost the compulsory day of rest  to

which  they  are  entitled. If the  employers  and

employees are in sympathy with each other, business

will  thrive.  The employees are  willing  to  help

because  it  is only during these few  months  that

business improves a great deal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, they are willing to help their

employers  to make more profits. But the  employers

think that the workers are fools and that they  can

get them to work seven days a week without a  day

off. The employers just gloss over this matter and

their employees are not given a rest day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is about bonus. During the Second

Reading  of the Employment Bill, the Minister  said

that  on the question of bonus, there would  be  no

specific  provisions in the Bill.  The  reason  he

gave  was  that  workers must compete  against  one

another, thereby increasing productivity.  After  a

lengthy debate, it was agreed that nothing specific

about  bonus should be provided in the Bill.  Since

there  is  no specific provision in the  Employment

Act as, regards bonus, employers take advantage  of

it and pay their employees a smaller bonus. I would

like  the Minister to clarify this point. In  order

to  encourage  workers to be more productive,  they

should be given incentives and the lazy ones should

not  get  bonuses. Can the Minister  say  how  many

employers  have  on their own accord  given  bigger

bonuses to their employees since the passage of the

Employment Act? I feel that the Employment Act has

adverse effects on the workers. Therefore,  I  hope

the  Minister will review it. Of course,  we  would

like to see our country progress. We also hope that

there  is  industrial peace so that  Singapore  can

continue  to  enjoy  economic  prosperity.  But  we

should not allow our workers to carry on with empty

stomachs.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noted that some of our

people dislike to work as scavengers. The reason is

that  scavengers are daily-rated  and  are  paid  a

small sum of $4.55 per day, whereas others who have

the  same  qualifications and who are fortunate  to

become attendants and are employed in allied grades

are  paid a starting salary of $140 per month  with

yearly  increments. The majority  of  these  people

have completed their primary education and may have

gone







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



up  to  Secondary I or II before they left  school.

$4.55 per day may be sufficient for a bachelor, but

what if he gets married and has children?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do not marry then!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, with industrialisation and shipbuilding

programmes, job opportunities in these fields  have

increased  and  naturally you will find  scavengers

leaving  the service to take up cleaner and better-paid  jobs  in  the factories and  shipyards.  This

cannot  be  prevented unless something is  done  to

increase the wages of scavengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in many socialist countries, wage rates are

standardised.   One  is  paid  according   to   his

qualifications and he may choose the type  of  work

he  likes. A person with a secondary education may

prefer  to  work as a scavenger if he is  paid  the

same wage as is paid to an attendant. This will not

only  keep the workers in the job of their  choice,

but  will  also encourage those who  are  still  in

school   to   study   harder  and   attain   higher

qualifications so that when they go  to  work  they

can  get  higher wages. Can the Minister give  this

matter due consideration?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, my opinion is that there should be a

minimum  wage  for the lower income group  so  that

these  people  can maintain their families  without

having  any  difficulties.  Singapore  has  a  high

standard of living and we must try to increase  the

wages of the lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The cost of living is going up!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes, the cost of living is also going up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on at least two occasions last

year the Minister for Labour was urged in the House

to revise the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance with

a  view  to  providing  better  benefits.  On  both

occasions,  the  Minister,  answering  through  his

Parliamentary Secretary, rejected the suggestion on

the ground that the existing benefits



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



were adequate. Sir, as you may be aware, under  the

Ordinance, when a workman meets with an accident in

the course of his employment, all he gets if he  is

permanently  disabled  is  $9,600  or  48   months'

earnings,  whichever is lesser. If he  should  die,

all that his dependants will receive is limited  to

$7,200  or 36 months earnings, whichever is lesser.

In  terms of present-day standards and the cost  of

living, I cannot really see how these benefits  can

be described as adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a person who dies, leaving behind a family

of  young  children. How do we expect  these  young

children  to be brought up decently and  graciously

on   $7,200  until  they  are  able  to  fend   for

themselves?  Sir,  I am sure you  have  read  press

reports of cases of road accident victims who  were

awarded  very  much more substantial benefits  than

those  I  have  just mentioned.  If  the  workmen's

compensation benefits at their present level can be

considered adequate, then it can only mean that the

rates of compensation currently awarded by our High

Court are inflated out of all proportion. Whilst we

boast  of  having  one of the  highest  per  capita

incomes  in  this  region, the benefits  under  our

Workmen's   Compensation  Ordinance  compare   most

unfavourably  with  those  of  a  number   of   our

neighbours. Some of them have gone on to  something

resembling a social security scheme. In the case of

Hong   Kong   which   is  still   a   colony,   the

corresponding    benefits   have   recently    been

substantially revised upwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our endeavour to industrialise, we have

called  upon our workers to make sacrifices and  to

improve their rate of productivity. They have  done

this, and splendidly too. On our part, I feel  that

the  least we can do is to put their minds at  ease

by  assuring them that if in their endeavours  they

should be unfortunate enough to be maimed for  life

or to die, their family will be well looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I would like to make concerns

the rehabilitation of workmen who sustain permanent

disablement as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



a  result  of  accidents at work. In  view  of  the

increasing  number of such cases, I wonder  whether

the  Minister  will  consider  setting  up  special

rehabilitation centres to provide training for such

unfortunate  people  so  that  with  some  kind  of

retraining  they  can continue  to  lead  a  useful

economic life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore and Malaysia, we

have several companies operating their business  in

both  countries.  A good number of their  employees

have   been  transferred  either  to  Malaysia   or

Singapore.  This  kind  of  transfer  disrupts  the

employees' families; the houses already  bought  by

them  have to be sold away; their children have  to

change  schools; and extra money has to be incurred

to start new homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the workers who have been transferred

through the request of their employers have  worked

for  several  years,  some even  more  than  twenty

years.   Failing  to  accept  transfer   to,   say,

Malaysia, their services will be terminated by  the

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After years of faithful and loyal service, and

through no fault of theirs, their work permits have

been withdrawn by the Malaysian Government and  the

employers  served them with letters of termination.

I believe this is an act of exploitation and abuse.

Therefore, it is necessary to review the Employment

Act  and the Industrial Relations Ordinance as soon

as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to quote one case in a company

called  "X"  in Singapore. It has its  business  in

Malaysia as well. The employee was given the option

to  accept transfer to its office in Malaya in 1952

or  he  had  to leave the company. He accepted  the

transfer  to  Malaya (now Malaysia).  He  had  been

working  in its Kuala Lumpur office for  17  years,

and  his  total  service with the  company  was  23

years. Recently, he received a termination  letter

from his company and the reason given was that  his

work  permit had been withdrawn by the Malaysian

Government. For his 23 years of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



faithful service to the company, this is what he is

going to get:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A monthly pension of $115;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A lump sum retirement allowance of $3,200;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A special ex gratia payment of $3,300.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this employee were to be treated as a

redundant  case  and according  to  the  collective

agreement,  he  would  get about  $17,000.  A  good

employer  would certainly either transfer him  back

to the Singapore office or pay him according to the

collective agreement redundancy benefit of  $17,000

rather  than $6,500, especially at his present  age

which  is nearing 50 years. There is no possibility

of  his  getting a clerical job with a $600 salary;

neither can he be trained for a technical job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is he going to live with $6,500? How is he

going to start life in Singapore? How is he to  get

his  children to school in Singapore? How is he  to

furnish a new home? Where can he get a new  job  in

Singapore?  Will  the monthly pension  of  $115  be

sufficient  for  his  family,  for  food,   rental,

transport,   children's   schooling    and    other

miscellaneous expenses?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is unemployed for one year, that $6,500

will  be  exhausted and he has to  ask  the  Social

Welfare  Department  for  assistance.  I  am   just

quoting  one  case, but there are many  more  cases

which are worse than this one.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not criticising the right of Government to

withdraw   work   permits  from   non-citizens.   A

government  is responsible to its own citizens  and

to see that non-citizens are not an economic burden

to   the   country.  But  I  cannot  tolerate   the

irresponsible  way  employers  are   treating   the

citizens of Singapore by terminating their services

because  their work permits have been withdrawn  by

the  Malaysian Government. The least the  employers

should  do is to give them whatever jobs  that  are

available  in their Singapore office. If there  are

no   vacancies,   then   a   substantial   sum   of

compensation should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



be  given  to  them  so  that  they  may  have  the

opportunity to start life anew with some  hope  for

the  future,  particularly  having  regard  to  the

number of years of service rendered to the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since both the Singapore Government and the

Malaysian  Government have introduced work  permits

for workers who are non-citizens in the territories

concerned,  perhaps it would  be  a  good  idea  if

consideration can be given to the setting up of  an

arrangement  whereby the Singapore  Government  can

request  all  Singapore citizens  now  employed  in

Malaysia  to  register with the  High  Commissioner

there,  furnishing  him with full  particulars  and

details of employment, so that the total number  of

people  who  are  working  in  Malaysia  with  work

permits can be ascertained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that their work permits are

withdrawn   by   the  Malaysian   Government,   the

employers  that  have  their offices  in  Singapore

should  consider  giving them employment,  provided

their     skill,    experience,    training     and

qualifications  are suitable for  the  jobs  to  be

filled in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the employers are given the power and right

to  transfer their employees; therefore, they  must

also  accept  the responsibility to  transfer  back

their  employees to their Singapore  office  should

their  work  permits be withdrawn by the  Malaysian

Government  and  not to terminate the  services  of

their  employees. If employers are not  willing  to

accept this responsibility to transfer them back to

Singapore,  then  they have no  right  to  transfer

their employees outside Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I sincerely hope

the  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister  for

Labour  will request the employers not to terminate

the  services of their employees whose work permits

have  been  withdrawn by the Malaysian  Government,

but  to  give them jobs in their Singapore offices.

If  that  is not possible, then the employers  must

give  substantial  monetary compensation  to  their

employees,  and  not to exploit or  abuse  them  by

terminating their services.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the implementation of the

Industrial Relations (Amendment) Ordinance, several

well-established commercial undertakings have taken

advantage  of  the  provisions in  section  17  (2)

concerning   retrenchment   where   unions   cannot

challenge  the  bona  fides of retrenchments,  even

though  they are effected on the flimsy grounds  of

reorganisation within the undertakings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, 29 established firms, whose employees

are  represented  by one union, have  retrenched  a

total of 282 workers. Many of these employees  had

spent  the  best  part of their working  lives  for

their  respective  employers. There  may  be  other

employees  represented by other unions  facing  the

same  plight.  For  reasons of age,  education  and

other  factors, many of those retrenched could  not

find  alternative  employment, nor  could  they  be

retrained for other trades in the industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not my intention to turn

this  august  Chamber into a  labour  court.  I  am

merely bringing to the notice of the Government the

inherent  danger  that may occur if  employers  are

given  free  rein  to retrench  employees  just  to

increase their profits, which are not and  may  not

be reinvested in Singapore. It is beginning to be a

practice  amongst some employers to  do  away  with

staff  who are drawing high salaries, and later  on

recruit  new  employees  at  less  than  half   the

salaries paid to those who were retrenched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to the Industrial Relations

Ordinance  has taken the teeth out of  the  unions,

and   certain  provisions  in  the  Employment  Act

further  weaken the unions by appearing to cut  out

their tongues as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few employers have even gone to the extent of

hiring   labour  contractors, commonly  known   as

kepalas, to perform the work normally done by their

permanent  staff. This is effected  by  retrenching

all or some of the permanent staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the intentions of the Employment Act and

the amendment to the Industrial Relations Ordinance

is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



restrain irresponsible labour, but nothing has been

done  so far to check employers from making use  of

the provisions of our labour laws for their selfish

ends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that the Minister for Labour will take

the necessary steps to rectify such a situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of citizenship,

I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister

the  hardships  faced  by both  parents  and  young

persons  who  have  registered  as  citizens  under

Article 58 of the Constitution. I have come  across

several  cases  where  persons  so  registered   as

citizens  have had their citizenship  withdrawn  by

reason  of  their  failure  to  take  an  oath   of

renunciation and allegiance, as provided for  under

the Constitution, on reaching the age of 21. It  is

true that there is no provision in the Constitution

to  empower the Registrar of Citizens to extend the

deadline for taking the oath. It is also true  that

the  recent  amendment  to the  Constitution  which

requires  the  holder of a certificate,  who  is  a

minor,   to  take  an  oath  of  renunciation   and

allegiance on reaching the age of 21, is printed in

English  on  the certificate itself. But  owing  to

ignorance  either  on the part of  the  holders  or

their  parents of this requirement as a  result  of

the constitutional amendment, the persons concerned

lose their citizenship, necessitating the surrender

of  their certificates and also their pink identity

cards. Some of these young ex-citizens who had been

granted   citizenship  during  their  early   teens

subsequently obtained employment. As a result, they

have  to  ask  their employers to  apply  for  work

permits  in  order to continue in employment.  Such

applications  may  or may not be  approved  by  the

Commissioner  of  Employment. These  are  the  more

fortunate  ones  whose employers  are  prepared  to

apply for work permits on their behalf. There  are,

however,  a  few employers who take the opportunity

to  terminate  the employment of these  unfortunate

persons,  regardless of the hardship  that  may  be

caused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether it would be possible for the

Government to give advance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



notice through the media of T.V. and Radio, just as

it is now being done in the case of eligibility for

national service, so that the persons concerned can

take  the  necessary steps to take  their  oath  of

renunciation and allegiance.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say how much I share the

views  of  the Member for Toa Payoh on the question

of  eligibility of citizenship and the way by which

citizenship  is granted to applicants? Speaking  on

the   basis  of  my  own  experience  in   my   own

constituency, I feel that, perhaps, there should be

some  relaxation  and  more compassionate  ways  in

which applications for citizenship are considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly bring out two instances of how

people   are   affected  by  the   way   in   which

applications  for  citizenship were  considered.  I

have  a very difficult case of a hawker who is  the

main  breadwinner in the family. He came from China

a  long time ago, as a result of which he could not

have  any tangible evidence to indicate his  length

of  residence  in Singapore. All his children  were

born   in   Singapore,  and  they  are   considered

Singapore  citizens by birth.  As  there  are  some

difficulties in the nature of his evidence to prove

his  residence,  he  has  never  been  granted  his

citizenship. The only way in which he  can  earn  a

living is to hawk illegally, and, periodically,  he

is  fined by so many agencies which exist  to  fine

hawkers  who  hawk  illegally.  This  is  just  one

specific  instance, and I can in  fact  quote  many

more cases if I have my files here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another instance where a person was

almost  deprived of his citizenship by a  procedure

which  I  believe  is wrong. It happened  that  two

persons   were   in   possession   of   two   birth

certificates bearing identical numbers, dating back

to the days before the outbreak of the Second World

War.  On  the basis of some administrative enquiry,

one  person  was asked to surrender  his  Singapore

identity  card,  which  in  this  case  was  a  red

identity  card, and which indicates that  he  is  a

Singapore citizen. He had the common sense to  come

and







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



see  me  about it. It seems to me that  if  he  had

surrendered  his  identity  card,  he  would   have

automatically  lost  his  citizenship,  whereas   I

believe  there  is a proper procedure  by  which  a

person  can be deprived of his citizenship,  if  he

has  acquired  his birth certificate by  fraudulent

means. As a result of my protests, I was told  that

the  case  had been reconsidered. I  am  not  in  a

position to judge the merits of the case of the two

claimants   to   the   ownership   of   the   birth

certificates,   but  I  hope  that   such   serious

administrative measures which have  the  result  of

depriving  persons of their citizenship  should  be

taken in a proper procedural manner.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I thank you for allowing me

to  speak  on  this head? I wanted  to  raise  this

matter  under  a  different  head,  but  since  the

question  of  citizenship has cropped up,  I  would

like  to  say  a few words on it also.  This  is  a

thorny  and hoary problem which has come up  before

the  House  several times, but I  think  we  should

patiently  urge  a reconsideration of  Government's

policy on the granting of citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may recall the repeated assertions by

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Labour who, in this House very recently, said  that

the  policy on citizenship is always under constant

review, if that is so, does it mean that the policy

on  citizenship is always changing? Somehow, I feel

there  seems very little feedback to M.P.s, or  to

the   people  in  general, regarding  the  current

position of the citizenship policy. This policy  of

constant review may result in some bewilderment and

even  despondency, especially when you  have  cases

during meet-the-people sessions. May I suggest that

we  settle down to a policy that, while it  is  not

rigid, may be sufficiently stable to give people  a

reliable  basis for their expectations? I  do  not

want  to  make  any suggestion that may  result  in

Parkinson's law operating, but if we could  have  a

committee perhaps to look into the matter and  come

to some definite decisions, then I think it may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



prove  fruitful.  In implementing  the  citizenship

policy,  whatever  it may be, perhaps  preponderant

weight  is placed on the legalistic aspect  of  the

application. For example, a colleague of mine,  who

was  on leave in England, found that he was saddled

with  a son born in England. He found that he could

not  get  citizenship for the son because  of  some

legalistic aspect of the situation. The father  was

a  citizen by registration, and the High Commission

in  England  refused  to  register  the  son  as  a

Singapore citizen. So we find that while the father

is a Singapore citizen, the son is a citizen of the

United  Kingdom,  travelling on  a  United  Kingdom

passport.  I  think that, on humane  consideration,

perhaps  cases  like this could  be  given  special

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to support what the Member for Toa

Payoh has suggested regarding notice given to minor

citizens  so  that they can observe  the  necessary

procedures  to  have  their  citizenship   position

rectified.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since this question of

citizenship  has arisen I might as  well  take  the

opportunity  to  speak  on  it.  The  granting   of

citizenship to permanent residents in Singapore was

raised  in the House only just now. The reply  that

the  Government  gave was not very enlightening  or

acceptable   to   the   Backbenchers.   Citizenship

admittedly is still a very thorny problem, so  much

so  that  we  have  many cases of people  who  have

nowhere  else  to  go  but to remain  in  Singapore

whether or not they are given citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, criticisms of the citizenship policy have

been  made  a number of times. If these  criticisms

seem  harsh, the Government should bear  with  them

because  we  have been elected by the  people,  and

since we are all from one party, we should give  no

opportunity, for people to exploit  any  situation

and  say  that since we are a one-party Government,

we  can  do what we like. Since the last  time  the

Minister sought







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



to   enlighten   us  on  Government's   policy   on

citizenship, many changes have taken  place  and  I

feel that the time has come to review it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that there is an acute shortage

of  skilled  workers.  We  are  trying  to  recruit

skilled  workers from abroad by offering all  kinds

of  incentives,  even  the incentive  of  Singapore

citizenship. In the meantime, we know of  cases  of

locally  domiciled people, some of whom are skilled

workers, who after two years are still waiting  for

a  note of approval from the Registrar of Citizens.

Citizenship   applications   have   been   rejected

offhand.  I think the criterion which the Registrar

of  Citizens uses when considering applications  is

whether or not the applicant can be replaced  by  a

Singapore citizen if he is working in Singapore.  I

believe  the  Registrar also  thinks  in  terms  of

whether  or  not the applicant will be of  economic

value to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship applications from persons who have

been employed in statutory boards for more than  10

years now have been rejected. Their background  has

not  been  looked  into  at all  whether  they  are

skilled  or unskilled workers, or whether they  are

clerks, or telephone operators. It appears that the

only  question that the Registrar asks  himself  is

whether  the  applicant  can  be  replaced   by   a

Singapore citizen. If he can be replaced, then  his

citizenship  application is rejected,  irrespective

of  the fact that the applicant may be a very hard-working man or that his services may be much needed

by  his employer. No consideration is given whether

he  has worked for one year, five years or 10 years

in  the  same place, or whether he has a  wife  and

children who are Singapore citizens, or whether  he

can leave the country or not, or whether he has any

other means of supporting his family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me cite a few examples where citizenship

applications from locally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



domiciled  people  were  rejected.  There  was  one

instance  in which a locally domiciled resident  of

Singapore,  who  had  been registered  as  a  minor

citizen,  failed to take his oath  because  of  his

ignorance.   As  a  result,  his  citizenship   was

withdrawn.   This   particular  individual,   whose

parents are Singapore citizens, has a wife who is a

Singapore  citizen and two children who  were  both

born  in Singapore. He had been working in  one  of

the  statutory  boards for more  than  five  years.

Since  his  citizenship was withdrawn,  he  had  to

apply   for  a  work  permit.  Unfortunately, the

Commissioner for Employment also asked himself  the

same  question: could this man be replaced  in  his

job  by  a  Singapore citizen? He  thought  it  was

possible and, therefore, his application for a work

permit was rejected. What do you expect him to  do?

He has nowhere else to go. He claims he was born in

Singapore during the Japanese occupation,  and  his

birth  was not registered. He has a wife who  is  a

Singapore  citizen, and two children who  are  also

Singapore  citizens. I believe  the  wife  has  now

applied  for  public  assistance  from  the  Social

Welfare  Department.  But since  we  have  cut  the

Social  Welfare budget for this year, perhaps  she

might not receive it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another case of a girl who was a minor

citizen.  She  works as a telephone operator.  She

was  unaware  that  she had to  take  the  oath  of

allegiance at the age of 21. It was only after  she

was  past  21 years of age that she heard from  her

colleagues  that  minor citizens had  to  take  the

oath.  She  voluntarily went  to  the  Registry  of

Citizens   and  offered  to  take  the  oath.   Her

citizenship  papers  were  recalled,  and  she  was

issued  with  a blue identity card,  and  asked  to

reapply  for  citizenship. She  reapplied  and  her

application was rejected. Her parents, brothers and

sisters are all Singapore citizens. She has nowhere

else to go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another case which is much more

interesting - the case of a clerk whose application

for citizenship







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



was  rejected. He has been working in  a  statutory

board  for  many  years and has  been  awarded  the

Public  Administration Medal. In  this  case,  Sir,

just  as  in  the  other cases,  the  Registrar  of

Citizens,  when  considering  his  application  for

citizenship,  asked himself, "What  does  this  man

do?  As  he  is a clerk, can we get a  citizen  to

replace him? Yes, hundreds of them are available."

And  his  citizenship was rejected. His service  to

the  statutory board, which in turn is  service  to

the  Government,  was considered sufficiently  good

enough   for   him   to  be  awarded   the   Public

Administration Medal, but not good enough  for  him

to be granted Singapore citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I feel that the time has come for us to look

at  this  policy on citizenship more  realistically

and to review

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the subject of

citizenship has come up, I do not like  to  let  it

pass without saying a few words. I support what the

Member for Toa Payoh, the Member for Telok Blangah,

and  also  the  Member  for Katong,  have  said  on

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out the case of a family who are

all  Singapore citizens except for just one of  the

children  who  happened to be born  overseas.  This

child  has  been staying with his parents  and  has

been  studying here for many years, but he has  not

been  given citizenship. I would like to know  from

the Minister if it is possible to grant citizenship

to  this  boy, otherwise he has no one to turn  to,

and most probably he might have to commit suicide!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have an amendment in respect

of  subhead  1251, which is also on citizenship.  I

wonder  if  I  can  speak  on  it  now,  with  your

permission?



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So far, I have been very indulgent to Members.

But if they all ask for my indulgence, I may have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



to  cancel  the amendment to subhead 1251,  on  the

Singapore  Citizenship Registry.  However,  if  you

like, you may carry on, Mr Lim.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the subject of citizenship has been a burning

issue  for  some  two  years now,  ever  since  the

announcement  of  the British withdrawal  and  the

tightening   up   of   the  policy   on   Singapore

citizenship.  On 21st May, 1968, the  Minister  for

Labour said this in regard to the new policy on the

issue  of citizenship, and again in the last Budget

debate on 16th December, 1968, he was quoted by the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour.

It says here [Hansard, Vol. 28, col. 339]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A person who is granted citizenship must be

able  to  make  a  positive  contribution  to   the

economic well-being of Singapore.'



<br><br>Accepting the fact that it is necessary to  protect

the majority of the people of Singapore by granting

citizenship  only  to persons  who  can  positively

contribute to the well-being of Singapore, I  think

there  is no clear-cut definition of what "positive

contribution" means. All this started off with  the

Government  offer to a person who has  $250,000  to

invest   in   Singapore.   That   was   the   first

announcement.   Some  months  ago  the   Government

reviewed  the  policy, and it was priced  at  half,

$125,000, to Malaysian citizens coming in to invest

in  Singapore and so contribute to our  well-being.

Recently  there was another review, and the  policy

says  that,  because  of the  shortage  of  skilled

labour,  persons who have technical skill can  come

into  Singapore, work here, and after a  period  of

five years they can be considered for citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that we want to ask is: what about

those stateless citizens here who are now making an

economic contribution to Singapore'? What is  their

worth?  If the Minister can give a clearly  defined

statement of what is "positive contribution",  then

I   think  we  can  possibly  clear  up  a  lot  of

misunderstanding on this issue of citizenship.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last Budget session the Member for Delta

suggested that we should have an advisory committee

to  review  all  applications for  citizenship.  In

today's  debate there is also a similar suggestion.

I think this is a very good idea. We should review

all  the outstanding applications once and for all,

and see to what extent we can grant citizenship to

deserving cases. Over the last few years  we  have

gone  through  various political changes.  We  went

into  Malaysia and came out of Malaysia. There  has

been  a lot of confusion. There are people residing

here  who  have  been  caught in  this  unfortunate

situation  through no fault of their own  and  they

now  find themselves in the difficult situation  of

not  being  able  to  obtain citizenship.  I  would

suggest that the Minister review this matter  again

and deal with all the outstanding applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since we are touching on

various  aspects of citizenship, may  I  bring  the

attention  of  the  Minister to  the  fairly  large

number  of people who have been deprived  of  their

citizenship?  Sir,  I refer to  those  people  who,

after  having  spent a large part  of  their  lives

here,  are  told that they are no longer  citizens.

These are the people whose parents had made use  of

other  people's birth certificates in order to  get

them into school some 30 to 40 years ago. This,  of

course, was a dishonest act. But parents are  known

to  have  done  more  dishonest  things  for  their

children. The question now is whether these  people

should be penalised and made stateless persons as a

result of the dishonest acts of their parents which

were  committed decades ago. Sir, I feel that these

people   deserve   our   utmost   sympathetic   consideration.  I  hope the Minister  will  take  into

consideration such applications for citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have touched on the question of

citizenship. I spoke on this subject  in  1968.  Up

till   today  there  has  been  a  great  deal   of

controversy over it. This shows that citizenship is

a very important and crucial question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the meet-the-people sessions, we are

confronted  with  all sorts of  problems  from  the

people.  I  want to bring up one matter  which  has

also  been  raised  by the Member  for  Toa  Payoh.

According  to the regulations, those who apply  for

citizenship through their parents must first go  to

the  Registry of Citizenship to take an oath before

they can be granted citizenship. Of course, this is

the correct procedure. The Member for Alexandra has

also touched on this question just now. However, we

must not put the blame entirely on the residents. I

have  come  across residents at the meet-the-people

sessions who are mostly Chinese-educated. They have

complained  to  me that most of the  documents  are

printed  in English. The officials have not pointed

out  to  them that when they reach the age  of  21,

they  should  go to the Registry of Citizenship  to

take an oath before they can become citizens. These

applicants  say that they are Chinese-educated  and

are  not  conversant with the legal terminology  in

the  documents. I therefore support the  view  that

the  fault to take the oath in time should  not  be

placed on the residents. When they reach the age of

21, they should be reminded that they should go  to

the  Registry to take the oath, otherwise they will

be  disqualified. If they fail to do so, then it is

their  fault. However, we have not given  them  any

reminder.  Many  people cannot  remember  the  date

when,  at the end of three years, after their child

has  attained the age of 18, they have to  take  an

oath  at  the  Registry. We should  not  cause  any

inconvenience to the residents merely on  a  matter

of  procedure.  They  may have  possessed  the  red

identity cards and may have been employed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there was a hawker in Tiong Bahru

who  failed to take the oath at the Registry,  and,

as  a  result, his citizenship was taken  away.  He

asked whether I could help him. I went with him  to

the  Registry  and  appealed to  the  officials  to

consider  his  case.  However,  according  to   the

officials,   his  citizenship  was   withdrawn   in

accordance  with  the law. He  was  then  asked  to

reapply. He reapplied and was given a blue identity

card. He went to the Ministry of Health to pay  his

licence  fee.  When asked to produce  his  identity

card,  he  presented his blue identity card.  As  a

result,  his  licence was cancelled by the  Hawkers

Department.  Thus  his rice  bowl  was  broken.  He

depends on hawking for his livelihood. His wife  is

not  a citizen. His children are citizens, but they

are  very  young.  Therefore, the whole  family  is

placed  in  difficulty because his citizenship  has

been withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taking the oath is a question of procedure.

If  we  can  avoid  causing any  inconvenience  and

hardship to the people, we should do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Foreign Affairs is also the

Minister for Labour. He has many duties to perform.

However,  he  should  consider  my  suggestion  for

setting  up  a consultative committee to  help  him

review   all   the  outstanding  applications   for

citizenship.  The committee's recommendations  will

then be submitted to the Minister for his approval.

This will prevent the unpleasant consequences which

I have mentioned.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I propose to take the suspension now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0601 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you very much for

giving me this opportunity to make a speech. I

have to voice my own feelings. We are now

touching on the question of citizenship. I feel

pained at heart when speaking on this question. I

am very much irked by this problem. There is a

Chinese saying that when soldiers are killed, the

blame must be placed on the general. Now there

have been many complaints about the mistakes made

by officers. Permanent Secretaries and others.

However, all the blame should be put on the

Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries. For

instance, the Minister for Labour goes to the

Ministry of Labour only a few times a month

- maybe only once a month. He is also dealing with

foreign affairs but, nevertheless, he should take

the entire blame. The Minister has not come into

contact with the lower rungs of our society. He

should go to various parts of the country to keep

in touch with the general public. Once I went to

Mr Lim Joo Hock's office and I saw a big number

of files on his desk. I can personally deal with

500 files in one day. I am not boasting. I am not

blowing my own trumpet. I can deal with many

cases in one day. Yet I saw so many stacks of

files piled up on his desk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of citizenship has no political

considerations.  If  Ministers  do   not   have   a

political  ideology, how can they become Ministers?

Even  if  some  people have a political  bias,  you

should not regard that as a barrier when they apply

for  citizenship, especially in the case  of  those

who come from the Federation. Many of the Ministers

came  from  Malaysia. I myself came from Indonesia.

Yet I am a Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



of  Parliament.  So you must not  take  a  person's

politics  into consideration. If a robber qualifies

for   citizenship,   his  application   should   be

approved. A gangster's application should  also  be

approved. Even many of the C.I.D. staff are  former

gangsters. There are many precedents of people with

many  wives.  How  can  you deny  them  citizenship

because  they  have  many wives?  You  should  also

approve their applications. If I were to deal  with

applications for citizenship, I can clear about 500

applications per day. It is something that  can  be

done.   It  is  a  simple  matter.  If  a  person's

application  cannot be approved, you tell  him  so,

unless  he can produce certain evidence to  support

his application. You cannot just say that there  is

no  proof  or  that there are certain other  causes

which  bar  him  from  getting  citizenship.  There

should be a clear-cut method.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also want to say that I agree with the

suggestion  put forward by some Members that  there

should  be a committee, instead of the Minister  or

the  Permanent Secretary, to consider  applications

for  citizenship. This is a very simple  matter  to

deal with.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I think the

Member  for  Delta has probably summed up  why  the

discussion  has centred largely on the question  of

citizenship. She says that she has been harassed at

meet-the-people sessions, and that  life  has  been

made  intolerable  for every Member  of  Parliament

because  of  representations  on  the  question  of

citizenship.  Let me say that if I were  to  follow

the  suggestion of the Member for Ulu  Pandan,  who

obviously  is a "super Permanent Secretary"  as  he

says he can go through 500 files in one day



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> I can go through a thousand files if I do it his

way!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> If he were there and it is simply done by saying

"All right"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



to  all applications, then your next problem  would

be  that every non-citizen who becomes a citizen is

entitled  to  all  the privileges  of  citizenship,

including jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, are you prepared to give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> resumed his seal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Then instead of being harassed

about  citizenship, you are going  to  be  harassed

about jobs, but with this difference. This time the

man  who  harasses you can vote you out  of  office

because he has citizenship. Whereas now he cannot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main reason is that it is our duty to protect

the  interests first of our citizens. I am a Member

of Parliament, too, and I have the same difficulty.

As a Member of Parliament, I disapprove of what the

Minister  for Labour is doing. But as the  Minister

for  Labour, I must follow a policy which I  think

is  in  the  long-term  interest  of  the  country.

Popularity  is  not  always  the  surest   way   to

success.   I   note  that  time  after   time,   my

Parliamentary   Secretary   especially   has   been

harassed  for  the best part of the  year  on  this

question. And as Members of Parliament, it is  your

duty  to  do  all  you can to relieve  pressure  on

yourself  by  bringing  pressure  to  bear  on  the

Government to change the laws on citizenship or any

other law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I deal with some of the specific points

made  by  Members, let me outline  once  again  the

general  approach of the Government  in  regard  to

citizenship. First, you should be clear in your own

minds  that the grant of citizenship is a privilege

given not because somebody is in trouble or because

there  are sad stories about individuals.  That  is

not  the criterion. Even the United Kingdom is very

strict  about citizenship. Once you are  a  British

subject,  you  are a British subject forever.  That

has  been  the  tradition of English  jurisprudence

from time immemorial. But now in the light of harsh

realities, they have







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



had  to  modify  that principle. As  you  know,  it

happened in the case of certain British subjects in

the  former  colonies who wanted  to  get  back  to

Britain  on  the  grounds  that  they  are  British

subjects.  But  the  British  Government  has  very

firmly rejected this. They modified a principle of

English  jurisprudence because they  have  to  face

harsh  realities. Therefore, listening to  some  of

the  points of Members, I have the impression  they

believe that the grant of citizenship on the  basis

of  humanitarian grounds is a matter of right or an

obligation.  It is not. I did say so  in  1968  and

harsh  things  were  said  about  my  Parliamentary

Secretary  that he was stubborn and so on.  He  was

not being stubborn. He was carrying out a policy. I

said  that the grant of citizenship is a matter  of

privilege  and not of right. Why do  we  insist  on

standing  firm  on  this policy of  going  slow  in

granting  citizenship to non-citizens,  largely  to

blue  identity card holders? It is not  because  we

are not unmoved by some of the stories that we have

heard.  There  are hardship cases here.  There  are

hardship  cases  outside  of  Singapore.  Once  you

change  laws, you have to stand firm.  We  have  to

judge the interest of our citizens against that  of

non-citizens.  If  conditions  were  different,  we

would  like  to  satisfy both. If  conditions  were

different,  we  would be quite  prepared  to  grant

citizenship not only to blue identity card  holders

but  to  any  other people whose position  deserves

sympathetic consideration, like refugees from other

countries.  That is, if conditions  were  different

and  if  we  could absorb them. But so long  as  we

cannot,  our  primary  responsibility  is  to   our

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me give a few statistics. Most of

the  Members  have talked as if we are hard-hearted

and  we  never make any concessions. We have  said,

and  the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that  we

will review the situation from time to time. It  is

quite  true that we do it from time to time. It  is

not  in  the policy but in the application  of  the

policy   that   we   give  ourselves   considerable

flexibility.  Where a year ago we would  have  said

"No", hereafter we may say "Yes"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



in the same circumstances. Let me give Members some

statistics. For example, in 1967, we approved 8,948

applications before we were told of the bad news of

the  accelerated British withdrawal. Once that news

was  announced, we decided to be very strict  about

citizenship.  So  in 1968, only 3,768  applications

were approved. However, since then the economy  has

been   picking   up,  and  in  1969   we   approved

applications equal to what had been granted in  the

previous  two  years. In 1969, 11,325  applications

were  approved. So you cannot judge your policy  on

the  basis of those who come and complain  to  you,

those  who did not get their applications approved.

Those  who have got it do not come and congratulate

you.  So  if you judge Government's policy  by  two

persons  who, rightly or wrongly, complain  to  you

and  you  are  not  aware of  the  others  who  are

satisfied,  then you may go wrong in assessing  our

policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state the principles on which we give

citizenship  to  non-citizens,  largely   to   blue

identity   card   holders.  First,   depending   on

circumstances, the principle is this -  that  every

non-citizen who becomes a citizen must be an  asset

and  not a liability. Anybody who advocates  making

non-citizens  citizens is being  very  foolish,  if

those  people  become  a  burden  to  you  and  to

society. And he is not being a good citizen either.

So  the  first principle is that every citizen  who

joins  your  ranks must have high regard  for  your

citizenship. Do not cheapen it. Some of us  may  be

lucky. Maybe we do not deserve citizenship. But  at

least   pay  some  regard  and  respect  for   your

citizenship. If it is worth $100, do not  treat  it

as  if it is worth only 50 cents. Therefore, we say

that  anybody who becomes a Singapore citizen  must

be  an  asset to our society. And we say  that  we

will  give  citizenship as of today to anybody  who

can  contribute  to  the economic  well-being,  the

cultural  progress,  the  social  progress  of  our

society  because we need them. They  all  will  get

citizenship. That is why the number has  increased.

I  know of a few cases - I am not saying it applies

to all those who do not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



citizenship  - who want to get citizenship  because

they  can get cheap Housing Board flats and because

they  can  get  free education for their  children.

Some  of  them  openly say so. Some  of  them  say,

"Look,  I  want  citizenship  because  otherwise  I

cannot  educate my children, because I have to  pay

for their education."



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people of this type want to become our

citizens,  then  I  say in the long  run  Singapore

society  will go to pieces. These people should  go

somewhere  else. I am not saying that some  of  the

cases  that  some  Members have mentioned  are  not

worthy  of sympathetic consideration, but  we  must

balance  them against this major principle.  First,

we  want  citizens,  in  the present  circumstances

prevailing  here,  who  will  become  an  asset  to

Singapore, especially as Singapore is going  to  be

subjected to so many pressures in the years  ahead.

If  the community cannot stand the strain, then  it

will  break up, like many other societies  in  this

part  of the world. People will pack up their  bags

and  move  off  somewhere  else.  However,  we  are

prepared  to  consider applications. There  may  be

instances  where  the  bureaucratic  machinery   is

sometimes  over-cautious in dealing with  cases  of

individuals  who  satisfy the  requirements,  i.e.,

they  have  the skills. By "skills" I do  not  mean

people  who  are  able to sweep roads  and  so  on,

because we have plenty of our citizens who are able

to  sweep roads. By "skills" I mean people who  are

able   to  contribute,  directly  and  immediately,

talents  to  Singapore in certain fields  in  which

there is a considerable shortage. So, if you have a

skilled  carpenter, a furniture maker - skills  for

which there is a demand - I can assure you that  in

those  cases the applications for citizenship would

be  considered favourably. On the other  hand,  you

may  have  an  applicant  who  is  going  to  be  a

liability to Singapore. For example, one who  comes

and  asks,  "I  want social welfare  aid.  I  am  a

citizen. I have six children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



Please  give  me aid." I know of one  or  two  such

cases.  It  is  not  that I am indifferent  to  the

hardships  of  a  non-citizen,  but  as  a   member

responsible  for the administration and  government

of  Singapore,  I  cannot allow  my  sentiments  to

jeopardise our bigger responsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another way, apart from skills and so

on,  in  which  younger people who are non-citizens

can  acquire citizenship. I think the Minister  for

Defence  will back me up in this: that if any  non-citizen  who  is a permanent resident in  Singapore

volunteers for, national service, he will be  given

citizenship  at  the end of his  national  service.

That is a test of citizenship: you are prepared  to

die  for your country. What I am saying is: do  not

lower  the  standard of your citizenship.  All  the

stories I have heard are, "Yes, he cannot hawk  and

so  on." I am not unsympathetic to it, but that  is

not   the   standard   required  for   citizenship.

Therefore, if you do not base your citizenship on a

high standard, then I do not think you are going to

get very far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, would you like to give way to Mr

Low Yong Nguan?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Was the Minister trying to imply that through

their  trial  and  error methods - this  Government

seems  to  be  very interested in trial  and  error

methods - we are going to put our security  in  the

hands  of non-citizens first? Let them prove  their

worth  first  and  then grant them citizenship.  To

allow  non-citizens to defend our  country,  people

whom we cannot trust in the first instance, please,

do not try that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, no. These are people, as I said, who are

permanent residents, people who have no other place

to  go.  If  they  are prepared  to  volunteer  for

national  service,  then once they  have  completed

their   national  service,  they  will  be  allowed

citizenship.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



If  a  man who is a non-citizen is prepared to  die

for  the country, then he is worthy of citizenship,

because he is more reliable than some who are  born

into  citizenship. Of course, let  us  not  be  too

patriotic  about  this.  Most  of  us   were   not

originally  Singaporeans.  Our  great  grandfathers

came   here  and  settled  down.  They  built  this

society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> I was born here!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Some of us were not born here. My father was not

born here. What I want is a citizen who is prepared

to  contribute  something  to  the  betterment  of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Then how about the females?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I gallantly say this: there

is  an  English saying that when we  refer  to  the

male, the term also embraces the female!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, would you like to give way to

Professor Wong Lin Ken?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> I want to seek clarification. The Minister for

Labour  has  said  that we should be  careful  that

those people who apply for citizenship do not do so

just  because they think they can get  Housing  and

Development  Board  flats and  free  education  for

their  children.  I must ask him, how  about  those

children who are born Singapore citizens, but their

parents cannot get Singapore citizenship, and  for

that  reason they are in difficulty? I want to seek

clarification on that point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am coming to that, Mr Speaker. I will go on to

some of the specific points that have been raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point was made about minor citizenship

certificates having been withdrawn. The  number  of

such cases from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



the  beginning of 1968 to the end of 1969 was  291.

We  have since then given sympathetic consideration

to  cases where there has been genuine error  - they

failed  to  take  the  oath of  allegiance  through

ignorance  and through bona fide mistakes.  We  are

prepared  to consider such cases where  there  have

been genuine mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case raised by the Member for

Alexandra.  I think it is about two persons  having

two  birth  certificates. Let me  state  here  that

obviously  when people have two birth certificates,

one  of  them is a spurious certificate. We cannot

take a rather lackadaisical attitude towards people

who  use forged documents, because it is an offence

in  any  case. However, where it can be shown  that

there was genuine grievance as far as the child  is

concerned,   the  innocent  party,  through   false

representation, then I think we would  be  prepared

to  reconsider the case. If there is collusion,  we

cannot afford to allow it to pass.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> Just a matter of clarification about this

question  of  two  birth certificates.  I  was  not

interested  in who had the false birth certificate.

What  I was concerned about was that an officer  in

the  Singapore Citizenship Registry had  asked  the

person  to surrender his red identity card  and  in

its  place  he  was to be given a non-citizen  blue

identity  card. I think by that action  the  person

would have been deprived of his citizenship, and he

would  have  had no means of defending  himself.  I

think  there is a proper procedure by which he  can

be  deprived  of his citizenship, and also  by  the

same procedure he can defend his case. This is  the

case that I was very concerned about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not know the particulars of the case. If

this did happen, the person concerned has the right

of   appeal   in   regard  to  any  withdrawal   of

citizenship. Whether he has done so or  not,  I  do

not know.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Wong Lin Ken:</b> But not in the way by which he was asked to

surrender his red identity card. He has no means of

redress. As far as I understand, there is







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



a  procedure  by  which a person  can  appeal  with

regard to the deprivation of his citizenship.  This

person  was  asked to surrender his  Singapore  red

identity  card.  He was not asked to  give  up  his

citizenship. That is a different matter, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not know of the particular case, but if the

officer  in the Citizenship Registry had reason  to

believe that there was something improper, that the

birth certificate was obtained improperly, then  he

would naturally take back the red identity card and

give  him a blue identity card. He had the  perfect

right to do that. If the aggrieved person felt that

something  had been improperly done, he could  have

appealed   to  the  Ministry  or  to  the  Minister

himself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the fact that Government has announced

that we are prepared to invite skilled workers from

Hong Kong and elsewhere to come and work here,  and

after  a  period  they  would  be  considered   for

citizenship, I was asked why that privilege  should

not  be extended to our blue identity card holders.

I would like to say that the same privilege will be

extended  to  non-citizens, that is, blue  identity

card  holders, if they are skilled; or if they show

that they have the necessary capacity, we will give

them citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think another Member asked why Singapore blue

identity  card  holders who go  abroad  temporarily

have to surrender their identity cards.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that a blue identity card

holder  who  goes  away temporarily  need  not  and

should  not surrender his identity card on  leaving

Singapore.  He only needs to surrender it  when  he

leaves  the  country permanently to  go  elsewhere.

That is when he withdraws his provident fund and so

on,  and  decides  to  cut his roots  in  Singapore

permanently. It is only then that his blue identity

card will be withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



I think those are the main points in regard

to citizenship, as far as my notes go.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other matter - whether we would

relax  conditions in regard to the  issue  of  work

permits. As I have said, we do relax and have  been

relaxing  in so far as we feel that we can  permit

non-citizens  to  work here without  affecting  the

interests of our citizens. This is especially so at

this time when there is a labour shortage. We grant

more  and more work permits to people who are  non-citizens, especially if they are skilled  or  semi-skilled. They should have no difficulty in  getting

work  permits.  One Member also  asked  whether  we

would  be  prepared to allow skilled  workers  like

hairdressers to work in Singapore, if they are non-citizens. I do not know whether there is a shortage

of  hairdressers, but if there is, I am quite  sure

we  are  prepared  to consider the  issue  of  work

permits to such people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta made the point that with the

introduction  of the new labour laws  allegedly  to

the  advantage  of the employer,  the  standard  of

living of the worker has been seriously affected. I

think  this  kind of generalisation does  not  take

into   consideration  the  main  purpose   of   the

modification of our labour laws. When we introduced

these  new laws, we made it quite clear that  these

limitations  on  the freedom of  trade  unions  of

workers  were  made for a wider purpose,  i.e.,  to

increase  as  quickly  as  possible  the  base   of

industrialisation,    and    therefore     economic

expansion. In those terms, it again depends on  how

you see it. For example, before the introduction of

the  new labour laws in June 1968, there were 1,586

manufacturing   establishments   employing   74,800

workers.  One  year  after  that,  the  number   of

factories  increased from 1,586 to 1,716, providing

jobs  for  89,804 people instead of 74,800  people.

That  means  an increase of something  like  15,000

jobs  for  people who otherwise would not have  got

any work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of opinion whether it would be

better that a few workers could not get a bit  more

bonus and have







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



to  work  without any magical rise in their incomes

(does this mean that the labour laws have adversely

affected them?), or whether it would be better that

15,000  more people now can have work. We say  that

the  maximum  good for the maximum number  is  the

better objective for Government to pursue, than the

maximum benefits for a small number.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also see that, in terms of investment,

again before the labour laws were passed, the total

flow of investments was about $184 million in 1968.

But  the  year after the implementation of the  new

labour legislation, it shot up to $550 million. You

can    say,   "Well,   this   only   benefits   the

capitalists", and so on. But supposing we have  not

passed these new laws, then not even $10 would have

been  invested. So this extra investment means more

jobs  for more people. Let us not work on the basis

that  capitalists  are philanthropists.  They  will

invest money where they can get profits, e.g., when

a   foreign  capitalist  or  a  local  entrepreneur

invests $100 million here in Singapore, he may make

20 per cent profit. But this is the difference - if

he  had  not come in there would have been no  jobs

for  anybody.  There would be no factories  and  no

expertise. That is the price we have to pay. But if

you  want foreigners to invest here, they will have

to  make  money, and they come here  only  to  make

money.  So  they put up factories here. It  may  be

that  they  will set up an oil refinery,  something

which  we  cannot do. If we had not  promised  them

profits,  then  there  would be  no  oil  refinery,

meaning no work and probably also no profit for the

entrepreneur.  Profit  for the  entrepreneur  means

more  work and enhanced income. This is one of  the

hard  facts  of life. So it is no use  saying  that

because  it  benefits the employer,  therefore,  it

must  be bad for the workers. It is not necessarily

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is about all I have to say on this

particular subhead.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, do you wish to withdraw your

amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I would like to know if the Minister is

going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



reply  to my questions, particularly on the minimum

wage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Under Standing Orders, the Minister is only

allowed  15  minutes to reply  to  all  the  points

raised. So the more questions Members ask the  more

time the Minister will need to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, my question on revising the workmen's compensation benefits has also not been answered.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, would you like to reply to the

points raised?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir, In regard to the point raised by the

Member for Anson, I think I have already given  the

facts.  My Parliamentary Secretary has a  head  for

details, and he has drawn my attention to the  fact

that it is not $4.55, but $4.75 per day. So that is

not quite correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards a minimum wage, I think many of the

Left-wing trade unions and the more radical ones do

not  want  a minimum wage. Once you have a  minimum

wage , that becomes the wage. The Finance Minister

has  indicated  that perhaps we can get  over  this

major  fear or inhibition we have about  what  will

happen  in 1971. As you know, from the end  of  this

year  or  the  beginning of next year, the  British

withdrawal  will be so fast that about  30,000  or

40,000  people will be without jobs. If  we  cannot

find jobs for them, all this economic progress that

we  have made will be set back, and providing  jobs

for  as  many people as are going to be  unemployed

will be a big problem. Until we have stabilised the

situation.  I think the policy should be  to  allow

wages  to  find  their  own  levels  in  a  dynamic

situation  where unions will not be  interested  in

minimum  wages but they will say, "We will  get  as

much  as  the  economic  system  can  bear  without

disrupting it." That is the reason why I  think  we

will not consider implementing a minimum wage, nor

will  it  be wise for trade unions at this juncture

to press for minimum wages.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, I think, was in regard to

workmen's  compensation.  This  question  has  been

raised on several occasions. It is the view of  the

Government  that  the current  scale  of  workmen's

compensation   provided  under  the  Ordinance   is

adequate.  This  is  because the  maximum  benefits

payable on death or permanent disability are  based

on  an employee's earnings of $200 per month.  This

figure as of today is below the average earnings of

workers  in Singapore. In 1968 the average earnings

of  workers  in Singapore, according  to  a  sample

survey,  were about $180 per month, whilst in  1969

they  were  about $183 per month.  If  the  average

monthly  earnings  of the worker  exceed  $200  per

month,  then  legislation  may  be  introduced   to

increase the maximum benefits payable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, earlier on the Member for

Sembawang was talking about citizenship and he said

that  there  should  be  constant  reviews  in  the

granting  of citizenship. He said I was a  stubborn

old  man  and  that I was a liar. The Minister  has

indicated  just  now  the  number  of  applications

approved over the last three years. This definitely

shows that there have been constant reviews in  the

policy  of  granting citizenship.  The  Member  for

Sembawang called me "Kou sze sin fei". Mr Speaker,

you  did  not  get  the translation,  but  that  is

equivalent to calling me a liar. I think that is an

unparliamentary  remark and he should  withdraw  it

and apologise.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, have you heard what the Parliamentary

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to clarify certain

points.  I  did  not  say that he  was  a  stubborn

person. I said he was not such a person.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> He said I was stubborn and he followed it up by

says  one thing but practises, another," - Kou  sze

sin  fei - will not have any adverse effect on him.

If  he can assure us that he will review the policy

on citizenship now and then, then I withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> My Minister has already indicated that that is

so.   In   1967,  about  8,000  applications   were

approved, and in 1968 about 3,000. Last year about

11,000 applications were approved.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sia, Mr Teong has withdrawn the expression

but you object to --



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> No, Sir. His withdrawal is on the condition that

I  give  him  the  assurance that the  granting  of

citizenship will be under constant review.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, why did the Parliamentary

Secretary not raise the objection straightaway when

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, I take it you have withdrawn the words

you used?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, since you have directed me, I withdraw the

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I withdraw my amendment, there is one

question  which  has  not  been  answered  by   the

Minister.  Perhaps  he  was confused  by  the  many

speeches  made, and he has forgotten  about  it.  I

asked  him  what measures he proposes  to  take  in

order  to prevent industrial accidents. He has  not

given a reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok:</b> I would also like the Minister to answer my

question. He has forgotten to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for your indulgence

because  I have already exceeded considerably  the

time allotted to me.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am afraid that is so under Standing Order 43,

paragraph (8). But I will be indulgent!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> First, I will deal with the point about the

proposed swop between Malaysian citizens  who  are

working  in  Singapore and Singapore citizens  who

are  working in Malaysia and have lost their  jobs

as  a result of the withdrawal of work permits.  I

think  a swop is not a feasible proposition for  a

government to enforce legally. First, it is a very

immoral  policy. It is immoral to deprive one  man

of  a  job  because somebody else has lost  a  job

elsewhere.  But  what  I would  suggest  is  this.

Perhaps somebody from my Ministry could make  some

mutual  arrangement and persuade the firm here  to

transfer a Malaysian citizen who is willing to go.

Regardless  of whether the person is  a  Malaysian

citizen or not, once he has worked in Singapore, I

think   he   has  contributed  something   towards

Singapore  and  I would not like to  say  to  him,

"Now, buzz off, I want to bring in a citizen  from

Singapore who has lost his job." But if some  kind

of  arrangement  could be  made  and  if  all  the

parties  concerned are agreeable,  then  maybe  my

Ministry could act as an intermediary, but we will

not  enforce such a policy on either the  employer

or the worker concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to industrial accidents, as the Member

has  rightly  pointed out, this is  a  problem  of

increasing  concern and importance  to  Singapore,

especially  as  the pace of industrialisation  has

accelerated. The following steps have  been  taken

by  the  Factory Inspectorate to cut down  on  the

increasing number of industrial accidents  and  to

induce  a  greater  awareness  of  the  need   for

industrial  safety. More stringent  inspection  of

factories is being carried out. Factory owners are

warned to take the necessary safety precautions to

ensure industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



safety  in  their premises. The factory inspectors

have also established closer links with the Public

Utilities Board electrical inspectorate to  ensure

proper  inspection of electrical installations  in

factories. The co-operation of the fire prevention

officer  is  also sought to ensure the  taking  of

adequate  measures  for  extinguishing  fires.  In

fact,  we have organised a national safety seminar

to  spread  the  idea  of  industrial  safety.   A

newsletter   was   published   by   the    Factory

Inspectorate to disseminate knowledge  of  how  to

prevent industrial accidents. Two executives  from

the  International  Executive Service  Corps  were

invited  to  advise  the  inspectorate  on  modern

methods  of accident prevention. An inspector  was

sent to the United Kingdom for further training on

the problem of industrial safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the building construction industry contributed

the  largest number of industrial accidents in the

past year, we had meetings with representatives of

the  Contractors'  Association to  discuss  safety

problems in building construction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in his reply to the question of

citizenship, the Minister assured us that  skilled

and    semi-skilled   workers   would   be   given

sympathetic  consideration  when  they  apply  for

citizenship. He also said that if holders of  blue

identity  cards who were permanent residents  were

willing  to join the People's Defence Force,  they

would  be granted citizenship. I hope the question

of  citizenship can be solved once and for all.  I

thank  the Minister for his reply. I beg leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1005*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Lim Cheng Lock.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our country is now in the midst

of   nation   building.  We  are   expanding   our

activities in all fields of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



human endeavour. Our burden has now become heavier.

To  be successful in nation building, there must be

efficiency  in all the departments of  Government.

In  order to attain a high rate of efficiency, the

work  in  the  departments should be so distributed

that  the  staff will be able to spend their  time,

effort and energy in the best possible manner.  Our

country will then make further progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Permanent Secretary plays a

very  important role in his Ministry. He holds  the

highest rank in the administrative service  and  he

has the duty of implementing Government policy. His

work is very important and his burden is heavy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, the Permanent Secretary to the

Minister for Labour is also the Permanent Secretary

to  the  Minister  for  Culture.  He  is  also  the

Director of Broadcasting. Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

a  person's  stock  of energy is  limited.  When  a

person is responsible for so many jobs, he will  be

overworked.  He  will  be worn  out.  In  order  to

maintain  a  high rate of efficiency and  in  order

that  senior officers can concentrate on their  own

work,  I  hope  the Government will  try  to  avoid

giving  them too many jobs. The same person  should

not be given too many appointments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a few days ago the Minister

for   Science  and  Technology,  who  is  also  the

Chairman  of  the P.A.P., made a statement  in  the

Straits  Times on the need to ensure that competent

political  leadership for the Republic is available

to carry on the work of government when the present

leaders   retire,  and  also  that  the   political

stability  of Singapore is maintained.  Sir,  these

are  very commendable objectives of the P.A.P.  But

whether in time to come they will be acceptable by

the people is another matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, are you talking about the Political

Secretary or the Permanent Secretary?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, I am coming to the point. What I would like

to  stress is that these objectives should not only

rest   with  political  leadership.  It   is   also

important  to  pursue  this  policy  in  the  civil

service.  This is where I come to the availability

of  suitable and good material for the positions of

Permanent Secretaries who are considered the  right

arm  of  the Ministers. In the last few  years,  we

have  seen a handful of persons asking concurrently

in  two or three important positions. For instance,

the previous Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of

Labour   was  also  the  Chairman  of  the  Central

Provident Fund. I believe he is still the  Chairman

of  the  C.P.F.  He  is also the  Chairman  of  the

Housing  and  Development Board.  He  is  also  the

Permanent Secretary for Home Affairs. I believe  he

is  also a director of certain companies. I am only

illustrating  one  such  Permanent  Secretary.   My

colleague, the Member for Tiong Bahru, has just now

indicated that the present holder of this  post  is

holding  more than one important position. In  this

respect,  I feel that the Government has  neglected

to  take stock of the suitable people required  now

and  in the future. I think it is not too late  for

the  Government to do so. Trying to make one person

hold  two  or  more  positions, I  feel,  is  quite

unjustified  in  that  not  only  does  it   create

injustice to the person concerned, as he  can  only

perform  well  under certain conditions  and  with

limitations,  but  it is also  unjustified  to  the

departments  or to the people who come  under  his

control. In fact, during the last few years, two or

three jobs have been centred on one person, so much

so that these people have become swollen-headed and

arrogant  because  they feel  that  they  can  hide

underneath the skirts of the Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, did you say skirts?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Or trousers, Sir. They are not directly

responsible to the people of Singapore.  Some  even

have  the audacity to ignore Members of Parliament.

Sir, I want to make it very







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



clear  that  my  remarks are not  directed  at  the

Permanent Secretary under subhead 1005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I would like to touch on

another important subject. This is in regard to the

Central Provident Fund. The Minister for Labour  is

in  charge  of  the C.P.F. and, according  to  past

practice,  the Permanent Secretary in the  Ministry

of  Labour is made Chairman of the C.P.F. Sir, I am

raising this point because the C.P.F. is one of the

very important institutions in Singapore today.  It

started in 1955 when the total balance of the  Fund

was over $9 million.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, does the Central Provident Fund come under subhead 1005?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, according to past practice, the Permanent

Secretary  to the Ministry of Labour  is  also  the

Chairman of the Central Provident Fund.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are now discussing the Estimates for 1970-71.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, if you will allow me, I am talking about the

Permanent   Secretary  because  he  is   also   the

Chairman of the Central Provident Fund.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> He is also the Chairman of the Housing and

Development Board and also the Permanent  Secretary

for  Home  Affairs. I feel that  he  cannot  devote

sufficient time to the Central Provident Fund. Just

before  I was interrupted, I was trying to make  it

known  that in 1968 the total balance of the C.P.F.

amounted  to over $500 million. This goes  to  show

that  the C.P.F. is an important institution  which

looks  after  the interest of over half  a  million

workers  in Singapore, and it is not desirable  for

one  person  to  be made responsible  for  so  many

important institutions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Minister who also happens

to hold more posts than he normally should, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



begin  to see the point of the argument put forward

by  the Member for Kampong Kapor. It is simply that

a  man  should not be made to do more than one  job

and, if he is a Permanent Secretary, he should  not

be over-worked. This is a problem which we face not

only  with Permanent Secretaries but at many  other

levels  of  government.  It  is  no  use  promoting

somebody whom we generally feel is not yet ready to

take  over  the  responsibilities  of  a  Permanent

Secretary. Therefore, for the time being,  we  have

to  make  Permanent Secretaries do more  than  they

normally  should.  This  is  a  problem  which  the

Minister for Finance has already indicated  -  that

the  private sector today can offer far  more  than

just   a  Mercedes  Benz  to  people  with  ability

comparable   to  our  Permanent  Secretaries.   And

objection  has  been taken to offering  a  Mercedes

Benz  to  them. Therefore, it is very difficult  to

retain  men  in  the  civil service  of  sufficient

maturity  and  who  are leaving  to  take  up  jobs

elsewhere.  This is a problem of which we  are  not

unaware. We do not want Permanent Secretaries to do

more  than they should, or to be a kind of  general

factotum,  doing far too many jobs. We  agree  with

the  principle  that  a man  should  not  be  over-burdened with too many responsibilities. But it  is

a matter of finding the digits to take over some of

the  responsibilities. That is not as  easy  as  it

sounds, but when such people are available,  I  can

assure  the House that every encouragement will  be

given to them to take over these responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

1014.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during my weekly meet-the-people sessions, I

have  come  across many cases of persons  who  have

registered  at the Labour Exchange. But after  many

months, they have not been







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



given  any  recommendations for jobs. On the  other

hand,  I  have  heard of cases who have,  within  a

short time of registration, been given jobs.  I  do

not  know  what  accounts for this  situation.  For

those unfortunate people, registering at the Labour

Exchange is like betting on Toto. If you are lucky,

your  number  comes up and you get a job.  If  not,

then  you  have to wait for months and  months  and

nothing happens. I suspect that there might be some

string-pulling  or favouritism being  practised  in

the  Labour  Exchange. Sir, this  is  one  area  of

administration in which we can best prove  that  we

not  only  preach but practise equal  opportunities

for  all.  I  would like an assurance  from  the

Minister that stricter supervision is kept on  this

particular  section of the Ministry  of  Labour  to

ensure  that  the distribution of job vacancies  is

done  strictly  on  the basis of first  come  first

served.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, the

criterion  of  first come first served  constitutes

the  basis for selection of persons registered with

the  Employment  Exchange.  Where  there  might  be

deviation  from this principle is  when  employers

notify   the   Exchange  that  they  need   certain

vacancies to be filled on an urgent basis.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of registrants is done from among those

who happen to be at the Employment Exchange at that

time.   However,  such  instances  of   on-the-spot

selection,  I understand, are few and far  between.

Very often when employers ring up and say that they

want a man immediately, the employers are generally

told that it would be better if they could give the

exchange  advance notice so that they can select  a

more suitable one from their register. I would also

like  to assure the Member that the Manager of  the

Employment  Exchange supervises the  Exchange,  and

carries out checks from time to time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



to  ensure  that the principle of first come  first

served  is  being followed. I do not  know  whether

there is any deviation from this principle, but  if

Members do, come across instances where there is  a

deliberate deviation from this principle,  I  shall

be glad to look into such cases.

clarification in regard to the matter,  I  wish  to

put  on  record  and stress again  what  my  labour

colleagues have said on the issue of job safety.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may recall, Sir, that the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister for Labour  told  this

House  during Question Time on 23rd December  1969,

that  consideration would be given by the  Ministry

of Labour to reorganise the Factory Inspectorate in

order  to  increase its effectiveness in  enforcing

the  law  and  in promoting industrial  health  and

safety.  I  believe that the effectiveness  of  the

Factory   Inspectorate  would   be   increased   by

legislative and administrative measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if decisions are made to upgrade

their  jobs, to increase their morale,  to  retrain

them, to reallocate their duties, to increase their

numbers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



and to improve liaison among the various Government

departments  and public institutions interested  in

the  field of industrial safety and health  believe

all these measures could enable the Chief Inspector

of  Factories and the other inspectors to carry out

their  duties  efficiently but,  however,  none  of

these   measures  are  to  be  introduced  by   the

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we have been informed by the

Parliamentary Secretary that two of the  Inspectors

of  Factories  have  been called  up  for  national

service, leaving only four Inspectors of Factories,

including a temporary inspector, as one of them who

has  been  called up for national service  will  be

returning  to his job in April 1970, we were  told,

and  the other one will be returning to his job  in

September 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find, to my surprise, that reorganisation of

the   Factory  Inspectorate  has  resulted  in  the

reduction  of the number of Inspectors of Factories

by   one,  and  he  has  been  transferred  to  the

Industrial Health Unit which the Ministry of Health

is  forming  with  a small group  composed  of  one

Senior  Health Officer, one Inspector of  Factories

with either a degree or a diploma, two qualified or

trainee Public Health Inspectors, and two staff  or

student nurses, to promote industrial health in the

Republic. At this vital and crucial juncture in the

industrialisation of our Republic, I  do  not  know

how  two  trainee Health Inspectors and two student

nurses  could do anything for the industrial Health

Unit.   Anyway,  that  is  not  the  subject  under

discussion. What do the Ministry of Labour and  the

Ministry of Health hope to achieve by this set-up?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that for the Factory Inspectorate to

function more effectively, many more things need to

be  done.  The Factories Ordinance must be  revised

and  modernised  to  suit the  present  and  future

situations in industries. It is inadequate in  many

ways, and the Chief Inspector of Factories can best

testify  to its inadequacies. The Annual Report  of

the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



Labour  dealing  with safety,  health  and  welfare

plaintively  described the pitiful situation  under

which  the  Chief  Inspector of Factories  and  the

other inspectors have to tackle their tasks. In the 1968  Annual  Report  of the  Ministry  of  Labour,

(Paper Cmd. 27 of 1969), the Ministry admitted that

the  scope of the Factories Ordinance is not  broad

enough, and the Factory inspectorate has to  resort

to  the  safety  regulations of  the  International

Labour  Organisation for guidance. I suppose  these

safety  regulations  have discreetly  been  imposed

upon  the owners and occupiers of unsafe factories.

Therefore,   why  not  revise  and  modernise   the

Factories Ordinance? That is my point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, I would like to say that if the

Inspector  of  Factories is to  do  his  work  with

propriety,  he  must honestly be equipped  with  an

adequate  piece  of legislation and philosophy.  On

the  one hand, he must be honestly charged with the

care of work safety and, on the other hand, he must

honestly  care  to  promote  work  safety  to   the

maximum. But under the present circumstances it  is

not  quite  possible, so much so that  the  Factory

Inspectorate admitted in the 1968 Annual Report  of

the Ministry of Labour, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The main function of the Factory Inspectorate is

to  ensure  that the minimum standards  of  safety,

health and welfare of persons employed in factories

are upheld in accordance with the provisions of the

Factories Ordinance.'



<br><br>Sir,  may  I ask why it is minimum and not  maximum

standards?  I  have  said  that  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Labour  admitted

during  Question Time on 23rd December, 1969,  that

the  Factories Ordinance is inadequate, so much  so

that   the  I.L.O. safety  regulations  have  been

referred  to  and, wherever possible,  applied  and

imposed.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my  opinion  the

Factories Ordinance is inadequate to look after all

situations  in  matters  of industrial  safety  and

health,   although  there  is  provision  in   this

particular   piece  of  legislation   whereby   the

Minister  can  make special regulations  to  uphold

higher standards of







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



safety  and  the  health of workers  in  industries

where the risk of bodily injuries is abnormal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that if the Minister is fully aware of

the  importance of the problem of industrial safety

and  health to productivity and the economy of  the

country,   he   will  not  hesitate  to   introduce

legislative  and administrative measures  to  bring

about higher standards of industrial work safety in

factories.  I would strongly urge the  Ministry  to

pay  greater  attention to  the  question  of  work

safety. I think more could be done in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the low budgetary provision for the staffing

of  the  Factory  Inspectorate and  the  Industrial

Health   Unit,   the   lack  of   legislative   and

administrative  measures, and the sketchy  official

report,  one could not but get the impression  that

scant  attention is being paid to  the  safety  and

health of workers. I would think that with the high

occurrences  of infringement of the law,  the  high

occurrences of industrial accidents and payments of

workmen's compensation, some positive steps  should

immediately  be  taken to check  the  loss  to  the

economy  and  personal losses to  the  workmen  and

their families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968, there were 3,854 factories. The owners

or  occupiers  of  1,770  factories  had  committed

infringements   of   the  law  ranging   from   the

installation   of  electrical  equipment   not   in

accordance with the generally accepted principle of

sound   and  safety  practice,  and  using   unsafe

machinery,  equipment and tools,  to  infringements

where  no  fire-fighting equipment  and  Safety-Aid

boxes  were  provided  in the  factories.  In  1968

itself, $1,104,193.22 was paid out by employers  in

8,147  workmen's  compensation cases.  Among  those

8,147  accident cases, there were 109 fatal  cases,

five total permanent disablement cases, 690 partial

permanent  disablement cases, and  7,343  temporary

disablement  cases. The Ministry of Labour  piously

reported that there was no case of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



occupational  disease, but the Ministry  of  Health

Report, (Paper Cmd. 1 of 1970) estimated that  some

30 per cent to 40 per cent of the workers in the 26

quarries  in 1967 in Singapore were suffering  from

some  form  of pneumono-coniosis, which means  that

about  500  to 600 of these workers are victims  of

this  dreadful and deadly disease. Asbestosis among

workers  dealing  with  asbestos  work,  and   lead

poisoning  among workers in battery  factories  and

lead  smelting  plants,  are  quite  prevalent  and

should not be disregarded. I reckon, however,  that

there  will be realistic changes in legislation  by

the  Government  after  it has  heard  and  studied

representations  by responsible representatives  of

labour  in  this Chamber, and through the  National

Trades  Union Congress. I do recognise  and  accept

that   the   proposed  changes  to  the   Factories

Ordinance   should   be   studied   carefully   and

thoroughly by the Government and industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will do everything possible

under  the  present  circumstances  by  introducing

measures  to give maximum protection to the  health

and safety of workers. It should be remembered that

a worker is not a digit of production. The Ministry

said that a worker is a digit of production, but  I

say  that a worker is, in every sense of the  word,

not  a  digit of production. He has life; he has  a

mind; he has feelings; he has sense and feels pain.

I  hope  the Minister will give every consideration

to   revising   and   modernising   the   Factories

Ordinance, after hearing the representation from my

labour colleagues and me.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask your permission to speak on

this  subhead, because I have already spoken on  my

amendment to subhead 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support my colleague, the Member for

Kallang,  in  what  he  said.  In  respect  of  the

question  raised by my colleague,  the  Member  for

Jalan Kayu, I am not very happy with the reply







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



given  by the Minister. Although he is a democratic

socialist, he does not seem very socialistic in his

reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to elaborate on the statement made by the

Member for Jalan Kayu. With rapid industrialisation

and  increasing activity in off-shore  exploration,

many   new   industries,  such  as  off-shore   rig

manufacturing,  ship-repairing  and  ship-building,

iron  and  steel manufacturing, and other ancillary

engineering industries, have been set up, and  more

will  be  established in future.  These  industries

employ  many  skilled  and semi-skilled  tradesmen.

These  workers comprise the most important  natural

resources   of  the  state  as  they   make   very

significant contributions to the economic growth of

our Republic. We cannot afford to lose them through

death   or  permanent  disability.  More  stringent

legislation should therefore be provided to improve

the  standard  of  safety in  industries,  so  that

sufficient safeguards are made for the lives of the

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of death and permanent disability

of  these  workers due to accidents  are  now  very

high.  Most  of them are young and have  many  more

years   of  useful  economic  productive  work   to

contribute to their employers, and in turn  to  the

state.  More  often  than  not,  they  have   large

families,   and   are   the   main   bread-winners.

Statistics obtained from the Annual Report  of  the

Ministry  of Labour, 1968 (Paper Cmd. 27  of  1969)

show  that  that  number  of  fatal  and  permanent

disablement cases for the years beginning from 1964

is as follows:



<pre>

                       Permanent

               Death  Disablement    Total



          1964   85        448        533

          1965   98        539        637

          1966  108        552        660

          1967   68        598        666

          1968  109        695        804

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the years 1964-68, when the tempo of

industrialisation was stepped up, one can see  from

these figures that the percentage increase in death

and permanent disability was almost 50.8



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



per   cent.  Therefore,  it  is  obvious  that  the

dependants of these victims have to go to the state

for  social  welfare assistance and to make  claims

under the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out by the Member for Jalan Kayu

that the present rate of compensation is $7,200  or

36   months'   earnings;  for   death   and   total

disablement $9,600 or 48 months' earnings.  I  wish

to  point  out  to the Minister that the  Workmen's

Compensation  Ordinance,  1955,  is   actually   an

amended    version   of   the   British   Workmen's

Compensation  Ordinance, which  was  introduced  in

1933.  The present Ordinance, therefore, is already

15  years behind time. Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish  to

emphasise  to  this  House  that  our  party  is  a

democratic socialist party. As an employer, I  have

always the workers' welfare at heart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn:</b> Our Government, after more than 10 years in

power,  should  have seen fit at an early  date  to

revise the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance,  1955,

to meet the conditions and circumstances prevailing

in Singapore in the l960s and l970s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform the Minister that the Hong Kong

Government,  which  is a colonial  government,  has

passed   a   law   which  makes  the   quantum   of

compensation HK$45,000 for death and HK$60,000  for

total  disablement. But here,  although  we  are  a

Government  elected  by  the  people,  we  are  not

sympathetic  enough  to our  workers  who  are  the

mainstay of our economic survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that, with the influx of

overseas  personnel, the cost of living  will  rise

rapidly.  In  fact, this is already  taking  place.

Rentals  have gone up by 100 to 200 per  cent.  The

water   rate   has  also  gone  up.   Other   daily

necessities, also cost more. Lux soap which used to

be 30 cents per cake, has gone up to about 40 cents

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing these factors in mind, Members on this

side  of  the  House will agree with  me  that  the

purchasing value



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



of  our dollar has been reduced by about 30  or  40

per  cent  since  1955. Therefore,  if  a  worker's

family  get  $7,200 or $9,600 benefit on  death  or

total  disablement respectively, they will find  it

extremely  difficult  to buy even  the  bare  daily

necessities of life. Therefore, they will become  a

burden  to  the state, and this will create  social

problems for the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to suggest to the Government

to  review  the  Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance,

1955,  and  to  bring the quantum  of  compensation

payable  on death and total disablement to  workers

to  a more realistic figure, commensurate with  the

cost  of living obtaining in the l970s. At the same

time.   I   would  suggest  that  the  quantum   of

compensation under the Ordinance be reviewed  every

five  or  ten  years  so as to  arrive  at  a  more

realistic figure in relation to the current cost of

living. In this way the decreasing purchasing power

of  our  dollar as the years go by will be in  line

with  the  cost of living then ruling, so that  the

families  of these unfortunate victims  working  in

heavy  industrial establishments can have hope  and

succour   without  losing  the  human  dignity   as

unwanted  members of our society, through no  fault

of their own.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, on the one hand, it is so heartening to hear

one  of  our large employers from Jurong advocating

an  upward  revision of the quantum of compensation

laid  down in the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance,

and   another  employer-representative  here   also

advocating the same thing. But on the other hand. I

am  sorry  to say that I have to join my colleagues

here  in  saying  that  we  were  taken  aback  and

dissatisfied  with the reply given by the  Minister

on workmen's compensation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You are an employer.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Perhaps. Sir, in respect of the Factory

Inspectorate, the Ordinance also  needs  revision.

The employers' organisation agrees to a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



revision. The employees' representatives also agree

to  a  revision. But I am sorry to  hear  that  the

Government,   however, feels  that   the   present

Ordinance  is  adequate for  our  present  improved

industrial conditions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in regard to the question of

prevention of industrial accidents, first  of  all,

let  me say that the Ministry endorses much of  all

that has been said. Since the last few years -  and

there  has been no doubt about it - the number  of

industrial  accidents  has been  increasing  at  an

alarming  rate.  According to my Ministry's  figure

for  last year, the number of accidents rose by  48

per cent over the previous year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only a question of having sufficient

inspectorate  staff  and  qualified  personnel   to

enforce  legislation  to  bring  about  safety   in

manufacturing and other industries, but it is  also

a  question of educating workers. I am told that in

a  large  number  of  factories there  are  certain

rather elementary and primitive rules on industrial

safety, such as wearing helmets or goggles  and  so

on, which  are constantly disregarded by  workers.

Sir,  this  is  also  a  matter  of  educating  the

workers. Therefore, as I said earlier, the Ministry

has  sought the assistance of two experts from  the

International  Executive Service  Corps,  and  they

have made recommendations to reorganise the Factory

Inspectorate. These recommendations are  now  being

studied  and  consideration is being given  to  the

question  of creating a post of Chief Inspector  of

Factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that the problem

of  industrial safety is occupying the minds of the

officers   of  the  Labour  Ministry.  Within   the

limitations  of  an extremely small and  inadequate

staff,   the  Factory  Inspectors  have  tried   to

maintain  at  least the minimum safety  and  health

standards  required  in the factories.  The  safety

programme recently launched by the Ministry has  to

be  widened  so as to ensure that safety  education

reaches  all levels of both management and workers.

This matter is tied up with industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



diseases  and so on, a point raised by  the  Member

for Kallang. This is also tied up with the Ministry

of  Health, because this is the medical  aspect  of

industrial  health.  With  the  assistance  of  the

Ministry of Health, the Industrial Health Unit  was

set  up.  I  think, in 1967. However. I  understand

that the work of the Unit has been confined to very

narrow   limits,   largely  owing   to   inadequate

resources.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inadequacy of resources to man the Public

Health    Unit   is   reflected   in   the   recent

recommendations  made  by Dr  Cressol,  an  I.L.O.

expert on occupational health. He has advised  that

the  Unit  should  consist of  one  senior  medical

officer  one  industrial hygienist,  two  industrial

health inspectors and two staff nurses. It is hoped

that in time these personnel will be made available

so  that systematic efforts can be made in ensuring

the health and well-being of our workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other aspects of industrial

safety,  I  have  only one point  to  add.  In  the

estimates for 1969 the Factory inspectorate had six

posts  of Inspectors of Factories. As Members  have

mentioned,  two  of  these  inspectors  are   still

undergoing national service. Of the six inspectors,

one  holds  a  degree in Chemical Engineering.  His

duties are to enforce the provisions pertaining  to

industrial  hygiene. However, it  should  be  noted

that  in the estimates for 1970 the Government  has

approved the establishment of an Industrial Health

Unit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as my Ministry is concerned, it is true

that,  with  other preoccupations and not  allowing

for  the rapid development of our industries,  this

particular aspect of the problem has not been given

much  attention  in the past. I  hope  it  will  be

possible   for  us  to  do  so  and  convince   the

authorities,  who  are  in a position  to  dispense

these things, of the urgency of this problem.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Minister has admitted that

his   Ministry  has  not  been  paying  very   much

attention to the problem of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



industrial health and safety in the past.  However,

I  feel he has already realised that work safety is

important for the workers and for the economic well-being  of  the country. I am going to  withdraw  my

amendment,  but before I do so, I will say  to  the

Minister  that if his Ministry does not do anything

by the next budget, it will get more hammering from

labour.  I  am sure good employers like the  Member

for River Valley and the Member for Jalan Kayu will

be on my side. I beg to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Can I just draw the Minister's attention to the

fact  that earlier on I have mentioned the question

of  setting  up  a rehabilitation  centre  for  the

thousands of people who have lost either an arm  or

a leg in accidents and so on? I do not think I have

heard an answer to that question.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Has the Minister replied to that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I understand the Ministry has in operation a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr Hwang Soo Jin, Mr J. F. Conceicao and Mr Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister to

inform the House whether he could give sympathetic

consideration to the following cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case is a Malaysian who married a

Singapore woman. A child was born to them  in  the

Federation. After a month the child was brought to

Singapore and he lived with his mother. His school

is  in Singapore. He is now about 12 years old. He

wanted to apply for an identity card. He could not

get  it  because  the department concerned  wanted

documents   relating  to  his  father's  permanent

residence here. His father could not produce  them

because  he worked on board a ship. He would  come

to  Singapore for a few days' stay and he would go

off  to  sea  again. Under the circumstances,  the

child  could not obtain a Singapore identity card,

not even a blue identity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



card. He could not also get an identity card  from

the   Federation.  This  situation   has   created

hardship   for   the  child.  I   wonder   whether

sympathetic  consideration can be  given  to  this

case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case concerns a child who was born to a

Malay  family some 20 years ago. He was registered

at  birth as Ahmad bin Abdullah. Some years later,

because of the superstitious belief of the parents

that  the  child's  name was  not  suitable,  they

changed  it to Hashim bin Abdullah. From the  time

the  child went to school up to now - a period  of

20  years  - he has been using the name of  Hashim

bin  Abdullah. When a laminated identity card  was

introduced,  this  young  man  went  to   register

himself.  However, he was given  a  blue  identity

card because the name on his birth certificate was

different  from  that in his  identity  card.  The

officer in charge said, "Sorry. I have to give you

a   blue   identity  card.  You  must  apply   for

citizenship."  I wonder whether the  Minister  can

give favourable consideration to his case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a case of an adopted child. He was

adopted  many years ago. Through the stupidity  of

the  parent -thinking that my surname is  Sim  and

the  adopted  son's name is Ng,  and  I  was  then

stupid  -  I  withdraw that unparliamentary  word,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that a confession, Mr Sim?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I got hold of somebody's --



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Three minutes to go, Mr Sim. Do you want a

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Got hold of somebody's birth certificate which

bore  the surname "Sim" and gave it to the adopted

child.  It  was  then found that it  was  not  the

actual  birth  certificate.  A  Singapore  citizen

identity card was not given to him. He was given a

blue identity card. Sir, I would like the Minister

to give me a reply to this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Minister has exactly two minutes to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am always reluctant to make a

pronouncement on cases brought before me when I  do

not  know all the facts. Only one side of the  case

is  presented.  So  I would not like  to  make  any

judgment on the cases instanced by the Member.  But

I  shall  state the broad principles  on  which  we

issue  identity cards. First, they are issued  only

to  lawful  permanent residents  within  Singapore.

Therefore, a child who has attained the age  of  12

years  must  prove beyond doubt to the Commissioner

of  National  Registration  that  he  has  lawfully

resided  in  Singapore before a Singapore  identity

card can be issued to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> He has been in school for 12 years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> If he can prove that he has attended a school

here  for 12 years, an identity card will be issued

to  him.  Mr Speaker, Sir, that is why I  am  very

chary  of listening to one advocate's case. I  must

also listen to the other side. When you investigate

a  case,  you will find that it is not as clear-cut

as  it  is  sometimes made out to be.  But  if  the

Member can send me the facts, I will have the  case

examined  and  apply the broad principles  which  I

have   enunciated   to  it.  Under   the   National

Registration   Act,   persons   holding   Malaysian

identity cards are exempted from registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, briefly, can this House get an explanation

why  the  provision for Allowance for Panel Members

and Referees has been slashed from $12,500 for a 15-month period from

1st January, 1969, to 3lst March, 1970, in the 1969-70  budget, to $3,500 for 12 months from 1st April,

1970, to 31st March, 1971? I reckon that $3,500  is

just enough for 35 full days court sittings. Is  it

anticipated  that there will be fewer cases,  fewer

hearings  and quicker rulings? Is it because  fewer

panel members are going to be appointed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the statistics provided in the Annual Report

of  the  President  of  the Industrial  Arbitration

Court  for 1968 (S. 6 of 1969), the number of cases

has dwindled from 100 cases in 1966 to 78 cases  in

1967 and 46 cases in 1968. Awards delivered by  the

two  Courts were 72 in 1966, 47 in 1967 and  31  in

1968. The number of referee decisions were eight in

1966, two in 1967 and none in 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am wondering if the First

Court will suffer the fate of the Second Court. All

that   we   have  is  a  registrar  of   collective

agreements, no presidents, no panel members and  no

referees.  I  foresaw  the closure  of  the  Second

Court.  Can  the  Minister let us  know  his  inner

thoughts in this respect?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no wise Minister ever reveals

his  inner  thoughts! But I must  congratulate  the

Member for Kallang, for I think he has stumbled  on

the  real reason for the precipitous decline in the

allocation  of  funds  to  the  panel  members  and

referees  appointed to hear Industrial  Arbitration

Court  cases.  The first reason is that  there  has

been  a  decline in the number of cases that  panel

members  and referees are appointed to hear.  Since

January  1968,  there has been  a  decline  in  the

number  of  disputes and other matters referred  to

the  Court.  This  can be attributed  to  sustained

industrial  peace prevailing in the  Republic,  the

enactment  of  the Employment Act,  and  amendments

made   to   the  Industrial  Relations   Ordinance,

including  the  wider  powers  conferred   on   the

President  to  constitute the Court  alone  without

panel members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may also mention that six of the panel members

are   public  servants  who  are,  therefore,   not

eligible  for  the allowance under  the  Industrial

Relations Regulations, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that in the Court's budget

proposal   relating  to  this  matter   which   was

submitted in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



October 1969, account was taken of the distinct

possibility of the closure of the Second Court,

which, in fact, took place in January of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the speculation by the Member as to the

fate of the First Court. I will allow him to

speculate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr N. Govindasamy and Mr Ho Kah Leong)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise a point regarding the

mushrooming  of kindergartens in the  Republic.  In

the past, these kindergartens were not popular. But

since  1967, they have been conducted  by  various

community  centres  under  the  auspices   of   the

People's Association. And ever since, many  private

kindergartens have sprung up. For example, missions

and   churches   have  also  started   kindergarten

classes.  This  is  a good sign.  In  other  words,

kindergarten  education is popular  and  widespread

and our young children are being looked after. This

is a sign of progress for our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after a lapse of three or four years, a

problem  has arisen. The fact is that the  teachers

of kindergarten classes have not been given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



training.  They  have  not been  trained  in  child

psychology or in the method of teaching.  They  are

not qualified teachers. They are only graduates  of

Secondary IV and some of them do not even have this

qualification. Yet they are employed as teachers to

teach  children in the kindergartens. We have found

that  children who have completed a two-year course

in  the  kindergartens  have  been  taught  certain

lessons which, strictly speaking, should be  taught

in  Primary I. As a result, when these children are

admitted  to  Primary I, they have  already  formed

certain conceptions and they are not interested  in

whatever  the teacher teaches them. They even  tell

their  teacher,  "I  can teach  you  to  read  this

character  or word." So the children are  disgusted

and  they lose interest in whatever is being taught

to  them. This will have an adverse effect on their

primary education. The Ministry of Education should

take measures to train teachers of kindergartens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also kindergartens run by some

political parties, but I do not intend to  ask  the

Ministry  to  close  them  down.  In  addition   to

imparting certain elementary knowledge to children,

these  political  parties also try to  indoctrinate

them  with  political ideas. I do not think  it  is

necessary    to    take   action   against    these

kindergartens.  But  we should take  responsibility

not  to mislead our young children. I feel that the

Ministry  should carry out investigations into  the

qualifications   of   the   teachers    in    these

kindergartens, and   also  to   supervise   their

teaching. The Ministry should find out where  these

kindergartens  are housed. It should  also  conduct

training  courses  for the teachers.  Just  as  the

Teachers'  Training  College  trains  teachers   of

primary and secondary schools, so should it conduct

courses for kindergarten teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the sites of kindergartens, we cannot

expect an ideal environment because they are housed

in  old buildings. But as regards the teachers,  we

should see that they are given training so that the

pupils  are  properly taught. I have been  informed

that the teachers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



of  kindergartens  run by the People's  Association

are  given training. The training is in two stages.

Firstly,  the  teachers  must  attend  classes  run

jointly  by  the  Adult  Education  Board  and  the

Ministry  of  Education. After that, they  have  to

undergo   a   training  course  in   the   People's

Association  conducted by a specialist  trained  in

Australia.  As a result, the kindergartens  run  by

the People's Association are well organised.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not so much concerned with teaching the

children  during  the three hours  as  with  laying

emphasis  on proper training in living,  discipline

and group co-operation. The Ministry can also, with

the  co-operation  of  the Adult  Education  Board,

conduct  certain courses for teachers. All teachers

must  undergo  training and  certificates  will  be

awarded to them if they are qualified to teach.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, during the last Budget debate

in  1968, a number of Members in this House  spoke

lengthily on the Government's education policy, and

the  Minister for Education promised to  look  into

the  possibilities of rectifying the many anomalies

prevailing   in  the  Ministry  and  the   staffing

position in our schools. I am sorry to say that the

anomalies that I made reference to during the  last

debate  have  not been rectified or  resolved.  The

establishment in the Ministry of Education urgently

needs  a  thorough overhauling. May I again  remind

the Minister that his Ministry is the only Ministry

where  promotion  posts do  not  carry  any  salary

scales?  The Ministry has already agreed  with  the

Singapore  Teachers  Union that  this  is  a  wrong

practice.   The  Harvey  Commission   Report   also

recommended in paragraph 198 of its report that the

structure  and  reorganisation of the  Ministry  of

Education must be looked into. These matters.  Sir,

I  have  raised  before,  and  I  do  not  want  to

elaborate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now consider the reply that the Minister

gave  on  the  issues that I made during  the  last

debate. If I may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>





quote the Minister, he said [Vol. 28 No. 6 dated 17-12-68, cols. 445-6]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think he [referring to me] is aware that the

whole   question   of  teachers'   salaries,   post

allowances  for  principals and so  on  is  a  very

complicated  one  .  .  .  .  The  problem  is   so

complicated that the Harvey Salaries Commission was

afraid  to delve into the whole question.  It  has,

therefore,  suggested a separate Commission  to  go

into the matter in detail.'



<br><br>He then continued and I quote him:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Until I have sought the views of the Finance

Minister  on  whether there should  be  a  separate

commission  to  go into the whole question  of  the

salaries of teachers and principals, I am not in  a

position to give a satisfactory answer.'



<br><br>The Minister agreed with me that there should be  a

separate  salary  scale  for  promotion  posts.  He

advocated that there should be assistant principals

instead  of at present senior assistants.  I  would

like  to know, in the last 15 months since the last

debate,  if the Minister has gone into consultation

with  the  Ministry  of Finance  to  rectify  these

serious anomalies which have been in existence,  to

quote  the  Minister, "for almost  20  years".  He

agrees  that  these anomalies have been  there  for

almost  20  years. He agrees that they have  to  be

rectified, but they are still with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the estimates last

year,  I  spoke on the present undesirable practice

of  having one principal for both sessions  in  the

same  school, the need for remuneration and to give

a status to the senior assistants of the schools. I

would  not  want to repeat my contention  that  the

work   performed  by  the  senior   assistants   is

equivalent  to that of the principals,  since  this

issue  has  been  taken  up with  the  Ministry  of

Education  many,  many  times.  Let  me  quote  the

Minister's reply during the debate on the estimates

on  17th  December, 1968, in regard to this  matter

[col. 450]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'While we cannot afford to have one principal for

one  session, I think it is possible to consider  a

principal   for  one  session  and   an   assistant

principal for the other session in the same school,

it  is  a  compromise proposal which I thought  was

feasible and that is why the suggestion was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



made to the Harvey Salaries Commission. I am not in

a position, at the moment, to give a positive reply

on  this matter. But if the time is appropriate,  I

will take up this matter again.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the last debate, matters have become

worse.  Now  we  have  what is known  as  bilateral

schools  which are, in fact, two secondary  schools

under one principal. As a result of the two schools

being grouped together, provision is made only  for

one  principal  and  one vice-principal.  In  other

words,  where there were two principals and  senior

assistants, we have now one principal and one vice-principal.  Sir,  may I suggest  that  now  is  the

appropriate time to rectify once and for  all  this

exploitation of the senior assistants? I think this

is  the  appropriate time because we are all  aware

that   the  Minister  for  Finance  in  the  Budget

proposals  did  not paint a gloomy picture  of  our

future,  but,  on the contrary, in my  opinion,  he

made   a  forecast  of  greater  expectations   and

improvement in the economy of Singapore. It is  for

the Ministry of Education, which has time and again

agreed  that  the  present conditions  are  not  as

satisfactory  as  they  should  be,  to  make   the

necessary representation to the Ministry of Finance

to rectify this outstanding grievance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all other departments in Singapore with

promotion posts, a man is paid for the job he  does

and  not for the qualification he has. The salaries

of a Permanent Secretary, a Deputy Secretary and an

Assistant  Secretary in the various Ministries  are

the same irrespective of whether the holders of the

posts  are Honours degree graduates or Pass  degree

graduates.  Whereas in the Ministry  of  Education,

although  the  principals of all secondary  schools

and  primary schools are performing the  same  job,

yet their salaries are differentiated according  to

the  certificates they possess. Sir, a teacher  who

is  appointed principal of a school, whether he  be

an Honours graduate, a General Degree graduate or a

Normal   Trained  teacher,  in  principle  and   in

practice,  performs the same functions.  I  see  no

reason  why there should be any differentiation  of

salary  if they are principals of the same type  of

schools. All these anomalies







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



arise  because of the post allowances  attached  to

their substantive salaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to the Inspectorate in the

Ministry  of  Education. We learn from  the  Budget

speech of the increase in the number of schools and

school-going children in the past ten years.  This,

of  course,  has  resulted in an increase  in  the

number  of  teachers,  but there  has  not  been  a

proportional increase in the Inspectorate staff  to

assist and advise teachers on professional matters.

The   inspectors  are  largely  occupied  with  the

supervision   and  investigation  of  teachers   to

ascertain  whether they should be  recommended  for

crossing  the bar, confirmation, annual increments,

and with other administrative functions which leave

them  with  very  little time or none  at  all  for

giving  professional  assistance  and  guidance  to

teachers. As a result, teachers have begun to  view

the  visits of inspectors of schools as purely  for

the  purpose of inspecting them, that is,  to  find

fault  with  them,  and  not  for  the  purpose  of

assisting  and  advising them. We are  fully  aware

that  an inspector's role is not only to find fault

with  the  teachers, but also to assist  and  guide

them in professional matters. This can only be done

if  the  Inspectorate  has a sufficient  number  of

officials  who  can  devote  their  time  for  this

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry seems to interest itself only

with statistics. The Member for Bras Basah spoke on

18th March, 1970, on the attempt of the Ministry to

make the teachers quack doctors. Sir, I am told  at

the  moment  that  there is a health  course  being

conducted  in  a  number of  primary  schools.  The

lecturers in this course are teachers who have been

lectured  by other teachers who attended a  similar

course conducted by qualified people. The lecturers

of  the  health course in primary schools  attended

six  lectures given by six other teachers, and they

are  in  turn  expected to lecture to their  fellow

teachers.  Sir,  not everybody who has  attended  a

course  can  lecture to others who, in many  cases,

are  very  much senior in service to the lecturers.

If  the  teachers have to go through  a  course  on

health,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



by  all  means  let  them go through  a  course  on

health,  but  let  these courses  be  conducted  by

qualified people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, schools were required to form School

Advisory  Committees. These committees are  working

well  in  some  schools, but in many they  are  not

functioning properly. The Ministry should look into

the  functioning of the School Advisory  Committees

and  to  rectify  the situation if  it  has  to  be

rectified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, questions were raised in Parliament by the

Member for Serangoon Gardens who has now gone  over

to  the  other side on the practice of the Ministry

of  issuing  instructions to schools by  telephone.

The  assurance  given to the House  was  that  this

would  be  kept to the minimum and only  on  urgent

matters.  Sir,  may  I suggest that  even  now  the

telephone  relay system is utilised  for  frivolous

matters  and  also  for important instructions  for

which  circulars should have been prepared well  in

advance.  During the months of January and February

this  year  alone, the telephone relay  system  has

been  used  nine  times. I  do  not  know  why  the

Ministry  officials  do  not  like  to  put   their

instructions in writing.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another sore point I have with the Ministry

is  that  of  acting appointments in the  education

service.  I  know  of a number of "actors"  in  the

headquarters of the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> The Ministry of Culture.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> In Culture too, I believe. I am told that in

certain  schools there are even teachers  who  have

been  acting  as  principals for as  long  as  four

years.  The  last promotion exercise for principals

of  primary  schools was conducted  more  than  two

years  ago.  Can the Ministry not make arrangements

for   promotion  exercises  to  be  conducted  over

shorter  periods, so as to minimise the  number  of

acting appointments?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, from Table 19* appended to the

Budget  statement of the Minister for  Finance, we

see  that the total school enrolment of primary and

secondary schools and higher institutions for  1969

is  525,695, which is about a quarter of the  total

population. This large number shows that  education

is  widespread, and is something of which we can be

proud.  Of  course, the quality of  these  students

will  depend on the type of education they  receive

today.   From   this  point  we  can  realise   the

importance   of  education  and  the   difficulties

involved  in  it.  Teaching is an  illustrious  and

honourable task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* See Cols. 533-4)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the educational programme should meet the

requirements  of  our society. There  is  no  doubt

about  that.  The  present  society  is  undergoing

changes,  so  the education of our  society  should

also   change   with  time.  There  should   be   a

reformation  in our education policy  in  order  to

meet  present  requirements. For instance,  in  the

past  year  we  began  to  change  the  trend   and

direction of our education by putting full emphasis

on  technical education in order to meet the  trend

towards an industrialised society. This is  a  very

correct move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education policy should change with time to

meet  the requirements of society. In this  process

of  change,  there will inevitably arise  questions

involving   amendments  and  reformation   of   our

education  policy. All this will result in  placing

our  education policy on a better footing  so  that

our people and country may progress further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I depend on teaching as a means of

livelihood, and I personally have gone through  the

mill. That being so, I know intimately many matters

concerning  education, and I will avail  myself  of

this  opportunity to inform the Minister of certain

problems in education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the Teachers' Training College.

This  College  is responsible for the  training  of

school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



teachers  in  the  various  language  streams.  The

merits  or  demerits  of the T.T.C. have  a  great

effect  on  the  quality of the teachers  produced.

Sir, we all know that when someone aspires to be  a

teacher,  he will have to be trained in the  T.T.C.

for  some  years. Upon his graduation, he  will  be

recognised as a qualified teacher. But if  we  were

to  ask -- what usefulness has a trainee teacher  got

after  undergoing  all  this  training? -- the  reply

possibly  would be, what has been learnt is  merely

to  meet  the  requirements of the lecturers.  When

training ends, everything ends also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been very little use made of what the

trainee  teacher has learnt. Why? Because  what  he

has  learnt  is not practical. Many lecturers  only

teach  the trainees how to teach, and also  inspect

them  to see how they teach. They never demonstrate

the  practical way of teaching. Some lecturers even

blow their bassoons in the classroom. And when  the

time  for examinations comes along, they will  just

prepare  lecture notes in a haphazard way. So  with

this  sort of training, what results can you expect

from the teachers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many trained teachers will unanimously say

that their training was a period of tribulation and

hardship.  After  this  training,  they   will   be

relieved  of  all  this  suffering.  In  fact,  the

Teachers'  Training College is a  place  where  the

"soul-engineers" are trained. But we doubt  if  the

result   will  meet  our  objective.  I  personally

experienced  this  suffering  and  tribulation   in

1965-66.  What I have learnt has no practical  use.

Many  a  time I have heard of suggestions to reform

the  College, but when I asked the present  trainee

teachers,  I  knew that things in the College  have

not changed very much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the sake of our national development,

why  cannot we teach our trainee teachers something

practical  to  make  them understand  our  national

policy  and to inculcate in them a strong sense  of

national consciousness, so that they can understand

the tasks required



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



of them for the future good of our country? In this

way,  what  they teach will be more beneficial  and

more practical. Is this not better?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of our education is to give equal

treatment  to  all  the four  language  streams  of

education.  But we all know of complaints  that  if

teachers or principals who do not speak English  go

to the Education Ministry, they will be looked down

upon  and  given the cold shoulder.  We  have  also

heard  of complaints from principals that sometimes

they are required to go to the Ministry immediately

they receive a telephone call. Sometimes orders  or

directives  are  given through the telephone;  this

has  been  pointed  out  by the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah. It  is very well to give directives  over

the  telephone,  but very often  another  telephone

call  is  made to change the previous instructions.

So  I  cannot  agree with this means  of  conveying

administrative instructions over the telephone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays it is not easy to be a teacher. The

teachers  are confidentially reported on  by  their

principals.   They  also  have   to   face   school

inspectors whom they fear. The inspectors  come  to

inspect their method of teaching, not with  a  view

to  improving  it or to benefit them in  some  way.

Their  purpose is to find fault with  the  teachers

and,  as  a  result,  there  will  be  unfavourable

remarks  in the teachers' record. This is what  the

teachers are worried about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our society is a just and equal society

where  all races are equal, and therefore the  work

of public officers is also on an equal footing with

equal   opportunities.  But   today   teachers   in

Government-aided schools are not as well treated as

teachers in Government schools. How do you  explain

this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether the Minister has given

attention to the grouse that nowadays teachers have

a  heavy load, and this load is increasing. Besides

teaching,  many other duties are also entrusted  to

them. Let me enumerate here the various duties they

are expected to do outside normal teaching hours.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) There is the writing up of teaching records,

the  number of classes, subjects, periods. All this

has to be written up clearly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There is the correction of homework,

including   exercises,  weekly   reports,   reading

reports, newspaper cuttings, calligraphy, fair copy

tests,   practical   reports,   mapping, contour,

drawing, and composition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The making of teaching aids, looking for

materials, note-taking, and lesson preparation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Filling in the particulars of attendance

registers, collection of school fees, miscellaneous

fees,  attending to requests by students for leave,

entering  results in report cards,  filling  up  of

various   forms,  and  the  registration   of   new

students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) There are duties in relation to extra-curricular activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Taking the students out for meetings or

visits to social homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Taking part in various campaigns to support

some social work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Research work, including attendances at the

T.T.C. and  second-language training,  specialised

subject  training,  cadet  officers'  training  and

various  other  forms of training,  say,  technical

training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) Teaching the students how to brush their

teeth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) Duties at athletic meets, and teaching

children to queue up for buses, and so on and so

forth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken up much of the valuable time of the

House. My purpose is not to make complaints, but to

point  out that the teachers have to bear all these

hardships.  If they are well commented upon,  I  am

sure they do not mind working even harder. Instead,

Sir,  aided  school  teachers do  not  even  enjoy.

medical benefits. Every year Teachers' Day has been

neglected. There is no fixed day for Teachers' Day.

Last year Teachers' Day passed just like any normal

school day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two or three years, the various

language  streams  have  been  engaged  in  extra-curricular   activities,  and,  as  students   are

expected to take part, they have responded keenly.

Because of their over-participation in these extra-curricular  activities, their school studies  have

suffered greatly.
