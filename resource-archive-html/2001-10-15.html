<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I learn from a press report that programmes

supported  by NTUC Education and Training Fund have benefited

about  80,000  workers  since 1998.   I  have  the  following

questions  to  ask:   (1)  What are the  training  programmes

supported

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Fund?  (2) What are the objective and focus  of  the

fund  in  training  workers?  (3)  In  view  of  the  current

unemployment  situation, will the  Fund  focus  more  on  the

training  of retrenched workers, ie, older and lower-educated

workers?   (4)  Would NTUC publish a profile of  workers  who

have  benefited from the fund so far, in terms of their  age,

education level, job position and income?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member has asked questions on what the NTUC

Education and Training Fund is used for, how is it being used

to help workers and what kind of training programmes.  Let me

explain that the NTUC Education and Training Fund, which  was

first set up in October 1998, is used to support workers  who

are not getting training support from their employers.  So it

is  an  individually motivated skills upgrading and  training

programme.   When  a  person  is  already  employed  and  his

employer  wants to send him for training, they  can  use  the

Skills  Redevelopment  Programme  directly.   We  have   very

generous  grants for employer-supported skills upgrading  and

retraining.   But  there  are of course  some  workers  whose

employers are not so far-sighted and who do not want to  send

their workers for training.  In which case, there is a danger

that these workers may be left out of all these opportunities

for  skills upgrading.  This is where the NTUC Education  and

Training  Fund  comes  in to fill up  this  gap  and  provide

another  safety  net for workers, especially  those  who  are

lower-skilled and, in fact, older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Education and Training Fund is especially for

these workers who want to go for training or skills upgrading

on their own.  Generally, the types of courses that NTUC will

support  are similar to the courses that are available  under

the  Skills  Redevelopment Programme.  These are  courses  or

training  that would help workers to acquire skills that  are

needed  for either the manufacturing sector or service sector

and is quite broad based, and it covers many industries.   It

is a fairly long list.  I think there are about 100-odd

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>



such  courses  available  and  we  are  in  the  process   of

continuing  to increase the type of courses, or  enlarge  the

list  of  training courses, that can be supported  under  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme and, therefore, also supported

by NTUC under the Education and Training Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the NTUC Education and Training Fund is an

endowment  fund,  the money that is being collected  and  the

Government's subvention to NTUC are not spent directly.  They

form part of the endowment fund and its interest returns  are

being  used to support the workers who want to go for  skills

upgrading.  In this way, we can continue to ensure that  NTUC

will  have a flow of interest returns from the endowment fund

to continue its support for workers who need this assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already touched on the objectives. It is to help

prepare  workers so that they can acquire the skill  that  is

needed for them to seek re-employment.  The labour market has

turned bad.  We are now facing a serious crisis.  As DPM  Lee

has mentioned on Friday in great detail, I would not have  to

go  over  it  again.   We are facing a major  downturn.   The

employment  market will continue to be very, very  difficult.

More workers are going to be retrenched and for those who are

retrenched,  they  are  going to have greater  difficulty  in

finding  new jobs.  In this environment, the worker  who  has

got  higher skills and is willing to acquire new skills  will

stand a better chance in getting re-employed, compared to one

who  is lower skilled and not willing to make an effort.   Of

course, retraining or skills upgrading does not mean that  he

will automatically get a new job because the whole job market

has  shrunk.  So it is going to be very competitive.   It  is

going  to be very difficult as many people are chasing  after

so few jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all things being equal, if a worker is not prepared

to  make  this effort to upgrade his skills, or  acquire  new

skills,  that means, go for retraining, then his  chances  of

getting  a  new job are going to be worse off than the  other

guy who is making every effort to upgrade his skills

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>



and  is  very  ready to pick up new skills,  learn  something

different, or do a different job.  Hence, all our programmes,

including those under NTUC Education and Training Fund, focus

on  this aspect of preparing and helping our workers so  that

they can cope with this changed environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question about whether the fund will support

retrenched  and lower-educated older workers, the  answer  is

"yes".   That  is  the  focus.  Similar to  the  Government's

training  programmes,  the focus of the  NTUC  Education  and

Training  Fund  is on the group of workers most  in  need  of

help.  So they turn out to be that these are the older, lower-skilled workers.  And this is what we will continue to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the profile, I would convey his request to NTUC. At

the appropriate time, I am sure NTUC will be willing to share

its  experience and the profile of the union members who have

benefited from this programme with Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to know whether those

who  are  not  union  members, and their  employers  are  not

supportive  of  their training requests, could  benefit  from

this  fund.  If not, where can they get help from?  The other

question is perhaps not so related to this cut, and I do  not

know  whether the Minister is prepared to answer, is  whether

the new increased grants for workers who undergo for training

programme announced would be subject to some abuse.   Workers

may  take the grant of $1,000 or $2,000 during this situation

to go for training but they may not get the job at the end of

the day.  Could the Minister clarify the point?  Although the

DPM  announced  that  the grant for those  workers  who  need

training during the downturn would be increased, the question

is  whether or not you will find employers for these  workers

when  they  are retrenched, and link them up and provide  the

training,  or  you  actually allow them to  go  for  training

without any employers.  And will there be workers who keep on

going for training but they can never get a job at the end of

the day?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member asked

whether those who are non-union members can also benefit from

this  training assistance.  The answer is yes.  If  they  are

union  members, of course, and if they are union members  who

are   employed,  they  can  take  advantage  of  the   Skills

Redevelopment Programme as an employer-supported training.  I

had  mentioned that earlier.  If they are union  members  and

they  are  unemployed, they can go to NTUC and  seek  support

from the Education and Training Fund.  For those who are non-union members, whether they are unemployed or their employers

are  not  prepared to support them for skills  upgrading,  we

have  a  third  avenue to assist them.  This is  through  the

community  self-help  groups, ie, SINDA,  MENDAKI  and  CDAC.

These  community self-help groups will play the part  of  the

"surrogate"  employers.   They  will  become  the  sponsoring

agency  for  the unemployed worker, or for the  worker  whose

employer  is  not  prepared to send him for  training.   They

would then put up a proposal to send this worker for training

and  the  Government  will  give him  support  and  financial

assistance  through the community self-help group.   We  have

already quite a number of people who were trained under  this

community  self-help group route.  As of  October  2001,  the

number  of  workers who were supported under the  "surrogate"

employer group, ie, the community self-help groups, is  about

7,800  workers.   They  also  receive  financial  subsidy  or

training fee subsidy to achieve skills upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his second point is whether we will help those who

are  undergoing  training  to  find  new  jobs,  instead   of

remaining just on a permanent long-term training.  Yes,  that

is the focus of our programmes.  We will certainly make every

effort  to  try to job-match those who have undergone  skills

upgrading or taken up retraining and place them in  new  jobs

that  are  still  available.  We will make  every  effort  to

ensure that those who sign up for skills upgrading will  have

a chance to be re-employed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, a further clarification. If,

let  us  say, a worker is retrenched, he has yet to  find  an

employer  and he has approached the Ministry for  help,  what

would be the process and arrangement for that worker?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> If an unemployed Singaporean or a

retrenched  worker comes to my Ministry and  says,  "Look,  I

need help", my officers at Career Link@MOM, which is our main

service centre for helping unemployed Singaporeans, will  try

to find out more about his working background, experience and

skills level.  Then we will try to identify which would be  a

suitable sector that he should direct his job search  efforts

at.   And  where  we find that he has inadequate  skills  for

particular  job  vacancies, we will then try to  structure  a

suitable training programme for him.  If he does not have the

right  kind of skills, we will try to arrange for him to  get

this  training.  If he is unemployed, of course he  does  not

have  an employer to sponsor him, then we will recommend that

he  either goes to NTUC to seek help under the Education  and

Training  Fund  or  goes to one of the appropriate  community

self-help groups to seek assistance, with the self-help group

acting as a surrogate employer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will try to do everything possible to help this

person, including providing him with a training package  that

would  be  suitable  for his particular  background,  because

different people may come with different kinds of background.

Some  have  more skills, some have less, including even  some

executives and middle management people, for whom maybe it is

not just a question of training but opening up the job search

to look at more different kinds of industry or business where

he could perhaps look for alternative work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will do everything possible. In some cases, we

even  do  counselling on a one-to-one basis,  to  help  these

unemployed Singaporeans to acquire a more pro-active  mindset

in looking for jobs.  There are things like job-search skills

which  some  people may not have - how do  you  prepare  your

curriculum vitae

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2428</b></font><br><br>



when  you  are  sending  out a resume,  how  do  you  present

yourself at interviews.  Some of these things, eg, if you  do

not  present  yourself properly during  this  downturn,  when

employers  really have such a wide range to choose from,  you

would not get picked.  So some of these job-search skills, we

also  try  to  impart.  We run little workshop  sessions  for

people  who  register with us in our employment register,  we

bring  them  in and conduct little seminars to help  them  to

improve job-search skills.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, would you like to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> One more question, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to know what is

the  response time of the Ministry from the time an  approach

is  made  by a worker to the time of referral.  Is there  any

timeframe  set  for the Ministry to conduct that?   Does  the

Ministry follow up after the worker has been referred for job

matching, because I understand that some workers, after being

referred, go to the employers and the employers say they have

enough people.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, during this downturn, the number

of  people  coming to my Ministry has gone up  by  leaps  and

bounds.   On the other hand, the number of jobs available  in

the  job  bank  has  also declined, as part  of  the  overall

economic  downturn.  So job matching will  obviously  take  a

longer  time than what we used to be able to do.  We  do  not

have a specific timeframe to find a match, but we will try as

soon  as a person registers with us, maybe within a few days,

to  give  him some recommendations of job openings  that  are

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to closing the feedback loop, it works both ways. We

also need the job seekers to come back to us and tell us  the

outcome.  Quite often, people go for interviews, if they  get

the  job or even if they do not get the job, they just do not

come  back  to  us.  Or, sometimes, after having  recommended

several job opportunities

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>



to  a job seeker, he may or may not go for an interview.   He

may  have found another job on his own, because people do not

just look for jobs through our Career Link@MOM service.  They

are  also actively looking for jobs through their own network

of friends, making enquiries, what is available, what are the

jobs  they have, etc.  So MOM offers only one of the  contact

points for them in terms of job search.  Sometimes, when they

find jobs through other avenues, they do not come back to us.

So  we  cannot completely close the feedback loop  for  every

case  that  comes  to our attention.  We cannot  give  him  a

definitive   answer  in  that  sense,  partly   because   the

registrants themselves do not help us to close that loop.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Z be reduced by

$10 in respect of Code 4000 of the Main Estimates.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I take my two cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, before I go into the query on

the  subject  matter,  I  wish to state  that  I  regret  the

Government's  style in pushing these Supplementary  Estimates

of Expenditure in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was notified of the Supplementary Estimates and to

submit  a  cut, if I wished to raise any query.  The deadline

for  the submission of a cut was 9th October, before the  New

Singapore  Shares  were  announced  in  Parliament  on   12th

October.   How does the PAP Government expect Opposition  MPs

to be able to query the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2430</b></font><br><br>



matter in detail before any announcement is made?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, even today, when we are supposed to pass

this  Estimate  for  the New Singapore Shares,  I  know  very

little about the New Singapore Shares scheme.  I think it  is

only  fair that the detailed scheme should be made  known  in

this  House before the Estimate is passed.  I would  like  to

know the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. How many shares will each individual be allocated,

and what is the basis of the allocation of the shares?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Are the shares allocated linked to political support

for the PAP?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. How much would the cash benefit of the shares be per

individual when they are first redeemed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. What is the Government's projection of the cash

value of the shares at their maturity in 2007?  Assuming that

a  person  keeps his share till then, how much  cash  benefit

will he get?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move to my second cut on assistance to needy

families.  Sir, I understand that $200 million is needed  for

the  Government's  contribution to the  Community  Assistance

Fund, and I suppose these are contributions to CDCs and other

organisations.  I would like to know:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. How this $200 million will be allocated. If it is

to CDCs, how much will each CDC get, and how much Hougang CDC

will be allocated and what is the basis of the allocation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Since the fund was intended to assist needy

families, what mechanism is there in place to make sure  that

CDCs use the fund for its intended purpose?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. What are the specific programmes mandated by the

Government for the CDCs to carry out to achieve the objective

of the allocation under the Budget?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir,

on the first question asked, on the adequacy of the notice, I

think the Standing Order requirements have been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>



met.   If  the hon. Member needs any further elaboration,  he

should address this to the Leader of the House.  This is  not

my responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on the New Singapore Shares - how

many shares will be allocated - and Mr Low also wants to know

why  Parliament is asked to approve the sum of money  without

details  being  known.  I can only suggest  that  this  is  a

giveaway scheme.  Where money is being given, unless you  are

objecting to the principle of giving New Singapore Shares  to

citizens, I do not see how this question is relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how many shares will be given, this will be

announced  by  me at the Ministry of Finance  tomorrow  at  a

press conference at 9.00 am, in which all the details will be

released.   The principle is to allocate qualifying  citizens

with New Singapore Shares amounting to between 200 shares per

individual, up to 1,700 shares per individual.  Those who are

in  the  lower  income groups and elderly  persons  will  get

somewhat more shares; those who have served National  Service

will get more shares.   Of course, the lower sum of $200 will

apply to those who are in the higher income groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give Mr Low a categorical assurance that there is

no  political link.  All residents who qualify within Hougang

constituency will receive their fair share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the value of these shares in the year 2007, I

cannot  give  him a fixed figure because it  depends  on  the

basic interest rate, which is fixed at 3% per year, plus  the

real  GDP  growth rate of the preceding year.  So, I  do  not

know  what  the  GDP growth rates will be in the  year  2002,

2003,  etc.  But it will certainly be more than the principal

sum, plus 3% per annum.  At the end of the 5-year period, any

person  who has not cashed in any of the shares will get  the

full principal plus the interest accumulated.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question of the $200 million, it is the

money  given to the Community Assistance Fund (CAF).  Let  me

explain what the Community Assistance Fund is.  The Community

Assistance  Fund was formed by the pooling of two  charitable

funds, ie, the 25th Anniversary Endowment Fund and the Silver

Jubilee  Fund in the year 2000.  The CAF funds the  following

financial  schemes:   special  grants;  rents  and  utilities

assistance  scheme,  interim  financial  assistance  schemes,

centre-based  financial assistance schemes  for  back-to-work

childcare  schemes,  and other approved voluntary  programmes

for  low  income individuals.  These schemes are administered

by  the  Community Development Councils which act as one-stop

agencies  to  administer  social  assistance.   A  Board   of

Trustees  appointed by the Ministry of Community  Development

and  Sports decides on the allocation policies and budget for

the  financial  assistance  expenditures.   A  committee   of

management   headed   by  the  People's   Association,   with

representatives from all CDCs and National Council of  Social

Services,  allocates  the budget to each  CDC  and  voluntary

welfare organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CAF's principal currently stands at $43 million,

plus  the $200 million grant, which is the subject of today's

approval.  The principal sum will be invested by professional

fund  managers  to generate an annual income of approximately

$5   million  to  fund  all  these  financial  schemes.   The

requirement for the CAF will be reviewed in 2005.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. While I do

support  the allocation and issuing of New Singapore  Shares,

it  is  only fair that Members should know the details before

we  can go into it to better debate and decide on the subject

of the New Singapore Shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do know that under the Standing Orders, it is totally

perfect  and  legal  to actually give  the  notice  for  this

Supplementary  Estimates.   Does  the  Minister  agree   that

although  the  timeframe  given is  in  accordance  with  the

Standing Orders,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2433</b></font><br><br>



how  would  he expect Opposition MPs - I suppose PAP  Members

all  know  beforehand - to debate when we do  not  know  what

actually are the New Singapore Shares about.  What we know is

the  announcement  by  the Prime Minister  of  New  Singapore

Shares at his National Day Rally Speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that kind of situation, how does he expect

Opposition  MPs to ask relevant questions when  they  do  not

know  anything  at  all?  Is that fair?   Would  he  like  to

comment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I think it is eminently

fair,  because  the proposal really is for the Government  to

spend money to give shares to Singapore citizens.  Either you

agree  or  you do not agree.  Or, if you agree,  perhaps  you

consider  the  amounts insufficient or too much.   All  other

matters  relating  to the details of the allocation  are  the

privilege of the Government, in much the same way you may  or

may  not object to a tax cut.  But you are in no position  to

query what the form of the tax cut should take.  That is  the

prerogative of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister aware that, given

the   PAP  Government's  policy  and  stand  of  dishing  out

benefits,  with  a  track  record  of  linking  to  political

support,  it is only prudent for the Opposition to know  what

is  the detail and how is the allocation, before I come  here

to say whether I support or object?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think the Prime Minister and

DPM  Lee  have already explained it will be based  on  income

levels, with people living in flats as a proxy.  So there  is

no  political content in it.  It depends on the income level,

whether  you have served national service or whether you  are

an  elderly person.  I do not see the political connection in

such a distribution scheme.  Do you?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, if my recollection is correct,

an  announcement on 12th October in Parliament  has  made  it

clearer.   But  I  was supposed to send in this  cut  by  9th

October.   So what does the Minister expect me to  know  more

than that?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2434</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, as I have said earlier, it

is  not  a  question of whether you support giving away  $2.7

billion  in this form.  If you support, then you support  the

Bill.   If  you do not, then you object and we  will  have  a

vote.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have stated that I do

support  the  scheme but before I come to that support,  does

the  Minister  agree  that I have got to  know  what  is  the

allocation  principle?  And for me to  ask  the  question  in

detail,   I   need  to  know  more  information  about   that

beforehand,  before I submit the cut on 9th October.   But  I

only  know  of the announcement on 12th October.  So,  is  it

fair to a Member like me?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I really do not understand. I

know  you are arguing on technicality for which I agree  that

you  may  have a point.  But, nevertheless, because it  is  a

proposal  to share Singapore's surpluses with the population,

the  distribution  is  not  something  which  you  can  argue

against.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, do you want to withdraw your

amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Since the Minister for Finance

now, I support the scheme.   I withdraw my amendment.

<div align="center"><b>UNITED NATIONS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.05 pm

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law and Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a member of the United Nations. Like all

other members of the United Nations, we are legally bound  by

the  UN Charter to implement mandatory resolutions of the  UN

Security  Council.  A failure to give effect to the  measures

mandated  by  the Security Council would be a breach  of  our

international obligations for which Singapore may be  subject

to censure and sanctions by the Security Council.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good illustration is the recent United Nations

Security  Council Resolution 1373 adopted on  28th  September

2001  which  was after the terrorist attacks  in  the  United

States  on  September 11th.  It calls upon member  States  to

implement  a  series of measures against  terrorism  and  the

financing  of  terrorism.   This  resolution,  passed   under

Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, is binding on  all

member  States.   It calls for international  cooperation  to

combat threats to international peace and security caused  by

terrorist  attacks and provides for the imposition of  strict

new  measures  to  criminalise and prevent the  financing  of

terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the approach we have hitherto taken has been to

implement mandatory UN Security Council resolutions through a

variety  of existing legislative and administrative measures.

Where  we  have  not  been able to give  effect  to  Security

Council resolutions through existing laws, we have sought  to

amend   specific  legislation.   For  example,   last   year,

Parliament  amended the Monetary Authority of Singapore  Act,

the  Air Navigation Act and the Mutual Assistance in Criminal

Matters  Act  to enable Singapore to be better able  to  give

effect to our various treaty obligations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2437</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can implement most of the requirements of the recent

Security  Council  Resolution 1373 under our  existing  laws.

However,   given  its  unique  scope  and  breadth   of   the

resolution,  there  are some aspects of the  resolution  that

cannot be met under our existing laws.  For example, there is

a requirement that member states shall:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Criminalise the wilful provision or collection, by any

means, directly or indirectly, of funds by their nationals or

in their territories with the intention that the funds should

be  used,  or in the knowledge that they are to be  used,  in

order to carry out terrorist acts;"



However,  our existing laws do not criminalise the  provision

or   collection  of  funds  by  Singapore  citizens   outside

Singapore  for  criminal or terrorist acts committed  outside

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have to consider the possibility that there may

be  future  UN  Security  Council resolutions  to  deal  with

terrorism or other pressing international crimes.   We  would

not be able to anticipate or predict the breadth and depth of

these  possible  future resolutions.   Nonetheless,  we  must

ensure that we are in a position to be able to give effect to

them effectively and promptly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is therefore necessary to ensure that our laws

are  adequate and to overcome any possible lacuna that  would

prevent    Singapore   from   effectively   fulfilling    our

international   obligations.   This  Act  will   enable   the

Government to pass such regulations necessary to give  effect

to the decisions of the UN Security Council.  It will avoid a

situation where gaps in our laws prevent us from implementing

the UN Security Council resolutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that countries such as the United Kingdom,

New  Zealand, Canada and India (amongst others) already  have

in place facilitating legislation, mostly broadly similar, to

allow speedy implementation of Security Council decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2438</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UN is the most important international organisation

today, specifically for a small country like Singapore.  Yet,

there is no world government.  In this sense, there is always

a  tension  between what each country must do to  fulfil  its

international obligations and what each country  must  do  on

the basis of the sovereignty of its own people as represented

in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, Sir, the UN Security Council has powers under

Chapter  VII  to  make laws and to bind governments,  as  the

Minister has said.  This is particularly under Article 41  of

the  UN Charter, read together with Article 48.  In the past,

this  has not been of much use because each permanent  member

of  the Security Council can exercise a veto and, during  the

Cold  War,  the  disagreements  among  these  permanent  five

members  led to a very few resolutions being binding  on  the

governments of the world.  But since the end of the Cold War,

there  has been much more agreement among the permanent  five

and  many  more Chapter VII resolutions have been called  for

and  this  is likely to increase further in the wake  of  the

11th September events.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often good that the nations of the world can act

in  concert.  There are, however, other cases in which  there

may be some cause for concern.  While the general approach of

the present Bill is correct, I think these questions must  be

raised in the minds of people.  The first question is whether

Singaporean laws will be overridden.  The Bill provides  that

they  can  be.  However, it also provides an assurance,  Sir,

that constitutional protection continues.  This is reassuring

for  Singaporeans, that is to say, that while we will  follow

the  UN  Security  Council  directions,  we  will  still   be

protected by the Singapore Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, another question as to whether this

Bill,  when  given  effect, would be  through  the  Singapore

police or other officials.  This is because clause 2(1)(b) of

the Bill provides that the Government or the Minister might

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2439</b></font><br><br>



empower  whichever people they desire.  If I could just  read

that  relevant  clause.   This would  allow  "empowering  any

person  or  class of persons to exercise, when  investigating

any   offence   under  this  Act  or  any  regulations   made

thereunder,  all  or any of the powers of  a  police  officer

under  the  Criminal Procedure Code (Cap. 68) in relation  to

seizable  offences."  In this sense, I would ask the Minister

if   he  would  envisage  that  non-Singaporeans,  non-police

officers  or  other  persons would be used  to  effect  these

regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three smaller questions. First, while I

recognise  that  the UN Security Council  has  the  power  to

compel  all states, including small states such as Singapore,

to  follow its resolutions, there must be some thought  given

to the need to consult affected states. Singapore has, in the

past, talked about UN Security Council reform and brought  up

the  point  about the need to consult smaller  states  before

they  are  effected.   I would like the  Minister  to  answer

whether  this would continue to be our stand or whether  now,

we  will  simply  accept  whatever the  UN  Security  Council

decides  upon.   I ask this question in the context  of  some

sanctions and other moves which in the long term have come to

be  questioned by such a community.  These, for example,  are

the sanctions on Iraq that, in some views, have persisted for

too long a time and affected many of the Iraqi people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to ask is on the

process of how we do this.  As the Minister noted, in  almost

all  cases up to now, we have amended the laws on a  case  by

case basis. This requires that the laws would have to come to

Parliament to be approved or disapproved.  This is consistent

with  what is called the dualist theory of international law,

that  is  to  say, that while international law may  say  one

thing,   it  is  not  binding  in  Singapore  until   it   is

incorporated through our national laws.  And this  keeps  the

primary  focal  point on our Parliament as a  sovereign  law-making  body.  However, Sir, in this present Bill,  I  notice

that it will basically short-cut

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2440</b></font><br><br>



Parliament.  It will delegate to the Executive the  decisions

on how to implement UN Security Council resolutions.  Sir,  I

understand, in some ways, that these resolutions may come  at

such  a pace and with such urgency that there may not be time

to  consider a Bill fully in Parliament.  I wish to  ask  the

Minister  whether  there  will  be  some  time  for   another

mechanism,  perhaps a consultation with a  smaller  group  of

Members of Parliament, like the GPC for Foreign Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that I do acknowledge the need for

Singapore law to be consistent with international law, and  I

generally  support this Bill.  However, I wish  the  Minister

would  consider that the UN Security Council resolutions  are

only  one aspect of keeping our national laws consistent with

international  obligations.  And I must, in that  sense,  ask

what is our approach to other treaties and laws that bind us.

For instance, Singapore has ratified the Genocide Convention,

but  this  has not been fully incorporated into our  national

laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just have a few comments. This Bill could have, on

reflection, been introduced earlier perhaps.  There have been

many  acts of terrorism in this world.  Over the years, since

Singapore  became  independent and a  member  of  the  United

Nations,  were  there not earlier resolutions in  the  United

Nations  relating  to acts of terrorism  or  related  matters

where  Singapore had been a participant in the  debates,  and

therefore  we  could have adopted the resolutions  that  were

passed  in  the  United Nations, as in the  present  form  of

legislation in Singapore?  If not, I would like  to  ask  the

Hon.  Minister why this has not been done.  Also, how  active

has  been the Singapore Representative to the United Nations,

in terms of promoting resolutions to prevent terrorism?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I would like to raise is whether, in the

course of the debates in

the United Nations  -  and I am sure there must have been   - the  definition of "terrorism" was debated and defined.   And

if there was a proper definition of "terrorism", whether that

could be incorporated into our local legislation, so that  we

know exactly what "terrorism" means.  A simple definition  of

"terrorism"  could  be  one  who terrorises,  a  nation  that

terrorises or a group that terrorises.  So it could be a very

wide  definition.   Perhaps a form  of  definition  would  be

helpful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a sense, it could be argued that this Bill is

being introduced rather urgently because the United States of

America,  a  giant,  is  involved.  The  September  11,  2001

tragedy has been responsible, in a sense, for us to introduce

this  Bill in Parliament.  Whilst all of us are very sad  and

sympathetic to the families whose dear ones have passed  away

during this incident and others who are affected adversely by

this  tragedy, we, as parliamentarians, must be  seen  to  be

legislating local laws based on consistent principles.  And I

would submit that our UN Representative should be more active

in this regard, not because of the September 11 incident, but

any incident relating to such matters affecting terrorism  in

other parts of the world too, and not just the United States.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a financial provision in the Bill. I

would  like to seek clarification on this.  I am not sure  of

the  exact impact of it.  Would the provision in the  Banking

Act  on  banking  secrecy  be involved  when  this  piece  of

legislation  is enacted?  In terms of banking secrecy,  there

is  the  secrecy  not  to  divulge any  form  of  information

relating  to bank accounts.  Would the authorities  now  have

the  powers to investigate and look into the aspect of  where

finances  have been banked into or transferred  to,  so  that

acts  of  terrorism are not just a physical act, but to  find

out where the  finances have come  from and are going to,  so

that  terrorism could be minimised in Singapore,  the  region

and the world at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I would support this Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank the Members who have

spoken and I will now respond to their specific comments.   I

also wish to thank them for their support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Simon Tay asked for clarification on clause

2(b)  of  the  Bill,  whether this is in any  way  conferring

powers of investigation on non-Singaporean officials.  Let me

assure  him  that clause 2(b) is not intended and,  in  fact,

does  not  empower non-Singaporean law officials to  exercise

powers  of  investigation for offences under the  regulations

which  may  be made under the Bill.  This power is restricted

to   giving  powers  of  investigations  to  persons   within

Singapore.  It does not have extra-territorial scope,  either

for  non-Singaporean officials to exercise jurisdiction  here

or   for  Singaporeans  to  exercise  jurisdiction  in  other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most cases, offences under the Bill will be

investigated  by  the Police.  However, we  can  conceive  of

situations  where  it may be necessary to  confer  powers  of

investigations  on  other  persons.   They  may  be   customs

officials,   immigration  officials  or  commercial   affairs

officers.   These  officers, of course,  do  have  powers  of

investigation with respect to the Acts under which they  have

been   appointed.   But  if  not  for  this  Bill   and   the

regulations,  they may not have powers of investigations  for

offences under the proposed Bill.  That is why we have clause

2(b) of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay also asked about the process in the UN

Security Council, the role of smaller states and so on.  Yes,

it  is  true that the permanent five, in reality, are key  to

most of the decisions of the UN Security Council.  But if  he

is asking whether Singapore and other small states do have  a

role  and  whether  they are consulted in  the  process,  the

answer  to that is yes, they have a role.  It depends on  the

kind of ideas and constructive suggestions they bring to bear

on  either  the principle being discussed, in the details  of

the  implementation, or on procedural matters.  We  have,  in

the UN, a very hardworking team of officers led by our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2443</b></font><br><br>



Permanent Representative, and I think they are doing  a  very

good job in representing Singapore's interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we ask for consultation, it is not because we are a

small  state.  The consultation would be useful for  ensuring

that  whatever decisions that the Security Council takes have

as  broad-based  a support of the UN membership  and  of  the

international community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third point is that the structure of the Bill is

that  of an enabling legislation and most of the details will

have  to be implemented through regulations, and whether this

somehow  undermines the sovereignty of Parliament.   I  would

like  to  assure him that this is not so.  When  we  come  to

questions  of  implementing UN Security Council  resolutions,

particularly  of the nature of Resolution 1373,  often  speed

and timeliness is of the essence.  And as he knows, since  he

has  taught international law, the inadequacy of domestic law

cannot  be  an  excuse  for failure to perform  international

obligations.   Therefore,  because  of  the  breadth  of  the

Security  Council's resolutions and because  we  expect  many

follow-up  of the Security Council, which will require  other

measures  to be taken effectively and promptly by UN members,

we  cannot  anticipate  that  there  will  always  be  timely

occasion  to  come to Parliament to pass legislation  through

First Reading, Second Reading and Third Reading.  So this  is

the reason why we have to structure the Bill as it is and, as

I  have  mentioned in my main speech, in fact,  this  is  the

approach  taken by most countries whose legislation  we  have

surveyed.  And I guess they too realise the need for  speedy,

effective and prompt implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me also say that, in a sense, this

legislation  is  unusual in that it  is  regulation  to  give

effect to the UN Security Council resolutions, but it is  not

unusual  in the sense that in our body of laws, we have  many

examples  where   domestic  legislation  has  empowered   the

Minister  to  be able to make regulations and rules  to  give

effect to the basic norms set out in the parent legislation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2444</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked, following his first premise, whether we

could  consult  a  small group of Members of  Parliament.   I

think  this  is not really practical in order to be  able  to

give  effect  to the purposes for which we are enacting  this

legislation.  Let me take the example of UN Resolution  1373.

One  of  the provisions asks for almost effective  action  to

arrest  and take other measures with regard to terrorists  on

the  list or organisations under the Executive Order  of  the

United  States,  which, in a sense, has been adopted  by  the

Security Council's Committee under Resolution 1333.  When the

UN  Security  Council does that, it is not a question  of  us

having  to  consult  with the GPC and  so  on.   We  have  to

implement  it  immediately.  So, in that sense,  we  have  no

choice.    Otherwise,  we  are  in  default  of  UN  Security

Council's resolutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the Member will understand that this is an

obligation  on Singapore and all other members of the  United

Nations.  And if we were to tell the Secretary-General or the

Chairman  of whichever sanctions committee that we are  going

to  hold it up, and we are not going to arrest, or we are not

going  to  take other necessary actions, because we  have  to

consult  the GPC  -  without  any disrespect to  the  GPC   - then  we may have a situation of having failed to do what  we

must  do.   So  it is not in any way undermining  Members  of

Parliament.  The fact that we have come to Parliament to  get

this authorisation is, in fact, in keeping with the principle

of  getting  parliamentary approval, as many other  countries

have done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also raised the issue of the Genocide Convention.

His point is that apart from this legislation, have we looked

at  other obligations we may have in the United Nations,  and

have  we ensured that our domestic laws are adequate to  give

effect.  Let me assure him that we always examine this  issue

carefully.  In other words, if we are committing ourselves to

an   international  obligation,  such  as   conventions   and

treaties, have we got our domestic legislation adequately  in

place  to  be  able  to  give  effect  to  our  international

obligations?  So, as a general answer, let me assure him that

it is so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, about the Genocide Convention, I can only

repeat  what I said at the last occasion when, I believe,  it

was  he  who also raised this point.  We were advised by  the

Attorney-General's  Chambers  that  there  was  no  mandatory

obligation  to  enact express enabling legislation  and  that

most,  if  not  all, of the requirements under  the  Genocide

Convention  could  be done through existing  legislation  and

that  we  could also enact legislation to the Penal  Code  to

give  effect  to the Genocide Convention.  But  there  is  no

pressing  urgency  to do that, and it is a  matter  that  our

draftsmen  in  the Attorney-General's Chambers  have  on  the

agenda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered most of the questions of Mr

Simon Tay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Chandra Mohan also for his support, and he

has  raised a few questions too.  One is: why is it  that  we

did  not  enact the UN Act earlier; on reflection, we  should

have  anticipated  this?   Yes, we could  have  enacted  this

earlier.   But  we did not do so because we  found  that  our

previous  practice had served us well.  By that I  mean  that

where  we  have not been able to give effect to the  Security

Council's resolutions, we amended legislation as and when the

occasion  arose.   Because there was no pressing  urgency  to

have  this  kind  of  enabling  legislation.   Most  of   the

resolutions give ample time for implementation.  And also  we

found  that  we  were able to implement previous  resolutions

either  through  administrative measures or through  existing

legislation.   As  and  when  we  need  it,  we  amend  other

legislation, as I mentioned in my main speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what has happened really is that the scope and

nature  of UN sanctions have changed recently.  And  I  would

say  up  to  the  early 1990s, the sanctions were  relatively

straightforward  such as trade and arms  embargoes,  but  the

comprehensive  nature of sanctions now being  implemented  by

the United Nations Security Council presents a completely new

picture  and  this is why we have decided that  the  previous

system of ad hoc amendment of legislation may not be workable

anymore, and that is why we have come to this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2446</b></font><br><br>



House for this kind of enabling legislation which will enable

us  to  implement the resolution which is, as  you  may  have

seen,  very sweeping in nature.  It has changed in the  sense

that  time  becomes  of the essence.  You have  to  implement

speedily  and  report speedily to the Security  Council.   In

most  cases now, after the resolution is adopted, a committee

is  set  up,  which is loosely referred to as  the  Sanctions

Committee.   The members would be asked to report  very  soon

what  they have done and what kind of follow-up actions  they

have taken.  So really there is no luxury of time anymore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked how active we are at the United Nations in

proposing resolution on terrorism.  It is really not  a  case

of  Singapore  proposing our own resolutions to the  Security

Council.   It calls for international discussions in  various

forums,  both within as well as outside the UN.  Thus,  while

we are active in the UN Security Council, you would have read

in  the  papers that ASEAN recently had a ministerial meeting

on  transnational crimes where they had also decided to  take

specific  cooperative measures on terrorism.  It is a  matter

which  must be tackled at all fronts, both on the wide global

plane  at  the  UN  and also outside the UN at  the  relevant

forum,  including law enforcement at expert levels where  the

people are engaged in exchange of information and operational

cooperative measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the definition of terrorism. I must say

that  this  is  one  of  the  most difficult  issues  in  any

discussion on measures against terrorism.  It is a  difficult

issue for the Security Council, for the General Assembly  and

in  any  other  forum  where they are discussing  this.   The

Member  was  thinking aloud the definition of a terrorist  as

anyone "who commits terrorism" on a large scale, or something

to  that effect.  Then you would have another nice debate  as

to  what  is "terrorism" and what is not terrorism.  I  think

the  approach  taken by the Security Council  was  that  this

issue  may  have to be tackled at some stage, but you  cannot

allow  this  lack  of agreement or lack  of  clarity  on  the

details  to prevent international committees getting together

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2447</b></font><br><br>



taking  a collective action.  When the Committee, established

under Resolution 1373, gets down to business, they will  have

to  address some specific issues and this will be one of  the

issues that they will address.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the point that Singapore's position at the UN

and  elsewhere must be to condemn terrorism anywhere and  not

just terrorism that occurs in the United States.  But it  has

never  been our position that we only condemn terrorism which

has taken place in the United States.  If he had read all the

statements made by Singapore on terrorism, on acts  committed

elsewhere before September 11th or after September 11th,  and

if  he had followed the speeches given, starting from DPM  BG

Lee's  speech at the Forbes, then the Prime Minister's speech

at  the  memorial  service, right up to the Prime  Minister's

speech   yesterday,  if  one  thing  should   be   clear   to

Singaporeans  as well as to people outside Singapore,  it  is

that  we  have  been consistent in condemning  all  forms  of

terrorism,  whoever perpetrates it against whichever  country

or  whichever people it is directed against.  This  continues

to  be  our  firm stand, both within and outside  the  United

Nations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His final point was about banking secrecy. Let me

assure  him  that whatever is necessary to implement  the  UN

Security  Council's resolution to give effect to UN  Security

Council's resolution on freezing of funds, giving information

to  the  UN  on  whether  funds of terrorists  have  come  to

Singapore,  if  it  is not already covered  by  the  relevant

amendments to the Monetary Authority of Singapore  (MAS)  Act

last year, then it would be covered under the new regulation.

But  we  find  that  the  requirements  of  the  UN  Security

Council's resolution with regard to freezing of assets and so

on  can  be adequately done under the amendments to  the  MAS

legislation.  If it is not sufficient, then, of course, other

measures may be needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><h4>OVERSEAS VOTING) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.38 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

Background

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 19th April 2001, the Government amended the

Parliamentary  Elections Act to provide for overseas  voting,

and  announced  plans to have overseas voting in  the  coming

General Elections at five of Singapore's diplomatic missions,

namely,  Beijing, Hong Kong, Canberra, London and Washington.

Preparations were already underway, and on 26th September the

Elections  Department  announced that  eligible  Singaporeans

living overseas could start to register to vote at these five

missions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 29th September, the Government announced its decision

not   to  conduct  overseas  voting  in  the  coming  General

Election.   I will explain the rationale for the Government's

decision.

Security Considerations Overriding

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28th September 2001 the Government received

information on the actions that the United States planned  to

take.   The  Government  then came  to  the  conclusion  that

military action by the United States was imminent.   We  also

had  information  that  a  second  wave  of  attacks  by  the

terrorists was expected, especially after the United  States'

military  action, and the targets would not just  be  in  the

United  States.   This  second wave of  attacks  may  not  be

similar in nature as the first.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2449</b></font><br><br>



were  also media reports that biological and chemical weapons

might  be used.  The Government could not ignore these threat

scenarios,  and  the danger these would pose  to  our  people

overseas  should  we  go  ahead with  overseas  voting.   The

Government  then  did a re-assessment of  the  situation  and

decided  that it was best not to expose our citizens overseas

to  unnecessary  risks.  We were not able  to  disclose  this

information  in the press statement issued on 29th  September

2001   as  doing  so  at  that  time  would  compromise   our

intelligence sources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we know that United States military action began on

7th  October.  They were joined by the United Kingdom.  Osama

bin Ladin and  the Al-Qaeda leaders have said repeatedly that

they  would  strike  back.  There are now  several  cases  of

anthrax reported in the United States.  Although these  cases

have  not  been  linked  directly to the  terrorists,  United

States  Vice-President Dick Cheney said a few days  ago  that

the  rising  number  of  anthrax cases  could  be  linked  to

terrorists.  Bio-terrorism is a real possibility.   Over  the

weekend, the FBI said it had received information that  there

may  be additional attacks inside the United States or abroad

in  the next few days, and asked all law enforcement agencies

to  go on the highest alert.  One possible threat cited by  a

United States intelligence official was attacks on diplomatic

sites  overseas.   It is no consolation that  we  are  proven

right in our belief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Singaporeans to congregate at known locations

overseas  on a published date for the purpose of voting  will

certainly  expose our citizens to unnecessary security  risk.

We cannot take the security and safety of our fellow citizens

for  granted, no matter which part of the world they  may  be

in.   Many  capital  cities have gone  on  heightened  alert,

including  the  five  cities which  were  to  have  been  our

overseas  voting  centres.  We  cannot  expect  foreign  host

countries  to  guarantee  the safety  of  our  people,  under

current   circumstances.   Moreover  they  have   their   own

priorities and risks to manage.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2450</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our overseas missions have been advised to heighten

their   security   alertness,  such  as   looking   out   for

unidentified  vehicles parked close to the chancery  building

or  unattended receptacles and items.  However, there is only

so  much  that  they  can do.  Having to additionally  manage

voter  registration  and  voting will  dilute  the  missions'

resources   further,  and  hamper  their   effectiveness   in

essential  duties  such as covering and monitoring  the  fast

developing  and  changing events in their  respective  areas,

which   serve  to  protect  Singapore's  national  interests.

Putting too much stress on our missions will inevitably raise

the risk of security lapses, something we must avoid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tension has mounted following the military strikes

in  Afghanistan.   We  do not know when,  where  or  how  the

terrorists  will  strike  back.  Security  will  have  to  be

further tightened.  Events are unfolding as situations change

day by day.  We cannot anticipate what may come the next day.

We  have  to  be prepared for the worst. Freedom of  movement

could well be severely reduced.  Airports and roads could  be

closed,  and public transport at a standstill.  Our  missions

will  then  also  have to cope with the upsurge  of  consular

work, looking after the welfare of citizens who are overseas.

In  the  extreme, our missions may even have to be shut  down

partially  or completely, interrupting any elections  related

work or even stopping them entirely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As security considerations are overriding, the

Government  has  therefore  decided  reluctantly,  in   these

exceptional  circumstances, that there will  be  no  overseas

voting in the coming General Election.  Clause 2 of the  Bill

suspends   the   relevant  provisions  in  the  Parliamentary

Elections Act to effect this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Bill is deemed to take effect from 26th

September 2001, until the Bill is passed and signed into law,

the   present  law  allowing  for  registration  of  overseas

electors  remains in force.  This means that at  present  the

Registration  Officer  will  have  to  continue  to   receive

applications from overseas voters in accordance with the  law

in force today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2451</b></font><br><br>



Clause 3 of the Bill has thus been added to validate the acts

and decisions of the Registration Officer not to register any

non-resident citizens as an overseas elector taken since 28th

September 2001 until the registers of electors are certified.

Current Situation

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the sole reason for Government's decision is

security.   At  the 25th September sitting of  Parliament,  I

briefed Members of the House on the security threat faced  by

Singapore, as a result of the recent terrorist attacks in the

US.   The  Prime  Minister himself elaborated  on  this  last

evening at his dialogue with the trade union leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States and United Kingdom have started to

attack  terrorists hideouts in Afghanistan  on  7th  October.

The  financial  assets  of terrorist groups  have  also  been

frozen.   The  United  Nations Security  Council  has  passed

resolutions prohibiting the funding or the giving of any form

of  assistance  to  terrorists.  The  terrorist  groups  have

threatened to launch counter-attacks on countries taking part

in these anti-terrorist measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a responsible member of the United Nations

and  of  the world community.  We have repeatedly stated  our

stand  against terrorism and will play our part to bring  the

perpetrators   of  terrorism  to  justice.   Singapore   will

implement the recently passed United Nations Security Council

Resolution 1373 with the United Nations Bill just  passed  by

Parliament  this  afternoon,  to demonstrate  our  resolution

against  terrorism.   We will play our  part  in  the  global

effort   to  freeze  the  financial  resources  of  terrorist

networks.   It  is only when all the countries in  the  world

unite  against  terrorism that we can  hope  to  remove  this

scourge from the face of the earth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the

United  States in 1990, enabling the use of our bases  by  US

air  force  and navy units to transit through  Singapore.   A

higher volume of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2452</b></font><br><br>



aircraft   and   ships  are  transiting  through   Singapore,

especially since the US launched its retaliatory attacks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these recent developments, Singapore has

now  got to be more vigilant.  Like other countries, we  have

stepped up security measures to protect our people and  vital

installations and offices, here and abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members must not forget that Singapore has not been

spared  from  terrorist attacks.  In 1974, the  Japanese  Red

Army  hijacked a ferry, the Laju.  And in 1985 and 1986,  two

bombs  exploded  at Faber House in Orchard  Road.   In  1991,

Singapore  Airlines flight SQ 117 was hijacked  by  Pakistani

militants.   We  cannot,  therefore, afford  to  take  things

lightly  just because we have not been affected  directly  in

the September 11 attacks.

Suspension of Overseas Voting

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people have speculated that it was due to the

Government  wanting  to  call  a  snap  election   that   the

registration for overseas voting was suspended.  They surmise

that  the  Elections Department was not ready  for  an  early

election.   Let  me  say  that this is  not  the  case.   All

elements for overseas voting system are operationally  ready.

The  Elections  Department has already distributed  brochures

and  application  forms  to our missions  overseas.  It  also

briefed  the  officers from the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs

who, in turn, briefed the mission staff and helped out in the

public  enquiries and registration there.  The polling booths

and ballot boxes that were specially made for overseas voting

were  also  ready.  In fact, some officers were sent  to  the

five  missions  on  26th September when the announcement  was

made  by  the Elections Department to assist the missions  in

the registration of overseas voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained at length, the overriding

consideration is that of security. However, there  may  still

be  sceptics  or cynics who will choose not to believe  this.

So  should  there be an election soon, they will say,  "There

you  are,  I  told  you  so."   Let  me  reiterate  that  the

Government's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2453</b></font><br><br>



responsibility  is  to  protect its people.   We  will  avoid

putting   overseas  Singaporeans  at  unnecessary   risk   in

situations  which are not within our control.  The Government

could still call a snap election if it wanted to.  But it has

nothing to do with cancelling overseas registration.

Conclusion

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is just as disappointed as many

Singaporeans are that there will be no overseas voting in the

coming  General  Election.   The Elections  Department  would

have  gained  valuable experience if overseas voting  at  the

five  missions  proceeded as planned.  The  Government  hopes

that  the Singapore citizens abroad who had intended to  cast

their votes at these five voting centres will understand  the

extraordinary international security situation which has made

this decision necessary.  Finally, I stress that this is only

a  temporary suspension of overseas voting.  It is  certainly

not  a  permanent  reversal of Government policy.   The  Bill

provides for suspension of the relevant provisions related to

overseas  voting  only until the polling day  of  the  coming

General Election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to begin by

thanking  the  Minister  for his very  full  explanation  and

response to the market talk, or town talk, that there  was  a

connection between the suspension of overseas voting and  the

talk of an early General Election.  I think that Singaporeans

should  have the reassurance, as the Minister has  given  us,

that  this  House,  after deciding on overseas  voting,  does

value  overseas Singaporeans who are working abroad and  wish

to  cast  their votes.  And I am glad also that the  Minister

has  taken  pains to point out, in detail, how  the  relevant

Government agencies were ready to do this in time even  if  a

snap  election is called.  And I think in this sense, I would

agree  with  him  that, having heard him, even  if  an  early

General Election is called,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2454</b></font><br><br>



it would be coincidence rather than causation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has shared with us some of his evaluation

of  risks for our overseas Embassies.  Could he tell us  what

other  events might be affected?  For example,  would  it  be

that  events  at our Embassies abroad would be cut  down  or,

perhaps,  cut  out  altogether?  For  example,  large  public

receptions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I would agree with the Minister that it

is  best to forgo all five cities at one go.  There have been

some  suggestions, I think in the press, that if our  Embassy

in  USA was the chief risk, why not allow voting to carry  on

in  other countries?  I would, myself, think that this  would

be the wrong policy.  Firstly, I agree with the Minister that

it  is  not  sound  in practice because the terrorists  could

strike  anywhere.  Secondly, I would further add that  it  is

not  sound in principle because it would discriminate amongst

our  overseas  voters; that is, those  in  America  might  be

deprived whereas those, say, in China will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking further ahead, may I ask the Minister whether we

should  not  look  towards  secured  electronic  voting   for

overseas Singaporeans.  Can we not use this time between this

coming  GE and the next to look into this possibility?   This

should  be  good  for the ease and security of  voting.   And

secondly,  it  would  be  a very good  demonstration  of  the

security of electronic commerce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, voting at the

General  Election  is a right of every Singaporean  and  this

extends to some of our citizens living abroad as a result  of

the recent amendments to the Parliamentary Elections Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit, Mr Speaker, Sir, let our citizens decide

whether to vote or not to vote given the opportunity to  vote

when  they  are living abroad, even if it means a  threat  to

their  security, perceived or real.  Security  considerations

are  important, no doubt.  So is the right to vote.   Can  we

not  utilise  electronic filing system and electronic  voting

system to see how it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2455</b></font><br><br>



works?   And this can be devised as soon as possible so  that

the market talk about the suspension of voting by our foreign

citizens is quelled.  Can we not in the process also secretly

inform  our citizens, who are living abroad, that voting  can

be  held at a secret location?  And if you are really serious

about  this,  if we want to do it, we can.  Let  us  see  how

ingenious our Government is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems in this kind of issues is the lack

of information, or there is very little information available

to  our  citizens.   No doubt, the reason or  the  excuse  is

security  reasons.  And all in the name of security  reasons,

there  is  very little information for most people, including

parliamentarians.    Perhaps,  more  information   could   be

disseminated to our citizens and parliamentarians.   We  must

have  confidence in our citizens to analyse this  information

and  decide for themselves.  We must not treat it  as  though

they  will  react  adversely  to  any  information  that   is

disseminated  to  the citizens.  We must have  confidence  in

their sensible and rational ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the danger signs of terrorism against Singapore

and  our Embassies outside Singapore?  At the moment, we  are

not  quite sure.  No doubt, there may be information from the

internal  and  external  security agencies  to  convince  our

Minister that we must not have overseas voting at the moment.

But  the  lack  of information disseminated to the  citizenry

brings about this form of suspicion that there could be other

motives.   So,  perhaps we will have to  find  some  sort  of

balance where this could be taken care of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue, Mr Speaker, Sir, if we are really

serious about it, then do not call for General Election until

just  before  August 2002.  One could argue, why  the  hurry?

What  are the good reasons why we should have, from  what  we

hear,  election  to  be held soon?  If there  is  a  pressing

problem  of security of our nation, then why call for General

Election, because life goes on in Singapore, especially since

it is a situation where there have not been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2456</b></font><br><br>



any  major changes to bring about General Election, for which

our Government still has time?  It has got another nine to 10

months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you are going along that line, let us see what

happens  in the next few months.  If there is a reduction  in

the  discussion  and  acts of terrorism,  then  perhaps  this

particular Bill would not be necessary at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most overseas voters, as indicated by letters sent to

the press, are disappointed that they are not allowed to vote

at  the  next  General  Election.  The reason  given  by  the

Government for scrapping overseas voting is that the overseas

Missions are not able to maintain sufficient security in  the

light of the 11th September terrorist attacks in New York and

Washington DC, USA.  However, most overseas voters appear  to

be  sceptical  of  the reason given by the  Government.   One

overseas  voter asked, "If Washington is dangerous, then  why

not  continue  with the voting at the other  four  designated

centres in London, Beijing, Hong Kong and Canberra?"  Indeed,

why  not?  Many are also surprised that our overseas Missions

lack confidence in their security systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the Government is quick to cancel all

overseas voting shows the attitude of the Government  towards

the  constitutional rights of its citizens.  For a long  time

now,  the  Opposition suspects that the Government has  never

been  enthusiastic  about  the elections.   At  each  General

Election, it wants to get it over as fast as possible.   Many

General  Elections had been held at the most  awkward  times,

either  during festive-end or rainy seasons.  And the minimum

time  under  the  Constitution,  nine  days,  is  given   for

canvassing.  The scrapping of overseas voting in double-quick

time  is  evidence that the Government is  not  too  keen  on

giving Singaporeans their constitutional right to vote.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2457</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most overseas voters who wrote to the press recently

indicated  that  they  want  to  vote  at  the  next  General

Election, despite the terrorist attacks.  They feel that when

they  have  voted, they would have a stronger bond  to  their

homeland.   They  would feel that they are more  Singaporean,

and  they  also  want to reassure themselves  that  they  are

citizens  of  Singapore.  I think the Government should  lift

the  suspension  for overseas voting and allow  our  citizens

living  abroad to vote at the next General Election,  at  the

same  time, of course, making sure that all security measures

are taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government thinks that to open all five overseas

centres is not very safe, then, at least, it should allow the

other  four centres to go on.  There are substantial  numbers

of  Singapore citizens abroad, other than those  residing  in

America.   Overseas  voters who are  not  living  in  America

should  be  given a chance to vote, and I would even  suggest

that,  perhaps, more overseas voting centres be opened.   For

example,  in  Australia, other than just having  it  only  in

Canberra, we may have one, say, in Perth.  I understand  that

there are many, many Singapore students aged over 21 who  are

studying  in Perth.  They should be given a chance  to  vote.

Also,  there  are  many people who go over  to  China  to  do

business.  They should be given a chance to vote.  Maybe  one

other centre can be opened, other than Beijing.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, as I listened to the speakers before me, it is important

that  they be aware of the security issue, and that they have

not  given  sufficient  attention to that  aspect.   I  agree

entirely with the Minister that the security of our citizens,

especially  in  overseas  stations, is  paramount.   Citizens

probably  would prefer to exercise their rights in reasonably

secure situations, and it would be best if their lives not be

put  at risk due to the enhanced security problems now in the

West.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some speakers have mentioned about the use of

electronic voting, I should just like to ask the Minister  to

clarify one

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2458</b></font><br><br>



point.   Overseas voting and electronic voting  are  two  new

elements   that   were  brought  in  recently   through   the

Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Bill.  Would the Minister

confirm  that the Elections Department would still  carry  on

with the electronic voting pilot scheme in Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, let me first deal with the

question from Prof. Chin Tet Yung about electronic voting.  I

moved an amendment in Parliament on this some months ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Elections Department has been progressing

with  this  matter  for  many months  ever  since  Parliament

approved  having  electronic voting  in  the  coming  General

Election.   They  have  been working very  closely  with  the

vendors  and the systems designers to come up with a  system.

In fact, even before that, they also have a prototype plan to

educate the public about how e-voting is supposed to be  done

and  a  session was also arranged for our MPs to see how  the

system works.  But the details have yet to be worked out  and

these  details  have  to  be worked out  with  the  technical

people, the software writers, the designers, as well as  with

the vendors who supply the system.  And that is only one part

of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key part of it is how to ensure that electronic

voting  is supposed to do the job that we want it to do,  ie,

to  allow voters to vote in secret.  We have agreed that  the

Auditor-General  should  be  the  authority  to  certify  the

system.   The  Auditor-General has appointed a consultant  to

work  closely  with his staff, to help them  look  into  this

system to ensure that its objectives are met.  They have been

doing this for the last several months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Department has also spent money buying

equipment   and  on  developing  software  to   develop   the

electronic  voting  system  for use  in  the  coming  General

Election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there are many issues to be resolved. The key part

really is in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2459</b></font><br><br>



certification  exercise, as well as the  matrix  involved  in

determining  what goes in.  Apparently, I am told  that  this

has  taken  some  time, and issues on whether the  acceptance

tests and the certification tests can be ready in time before

the  next  General Election or not, we do not  know  because,

from  the  current timetable, they are supposed  to  complete

this  process by the end of December.  So, if the  system  is

ready  and  we  have elections, then, yes, e-voting  will  be

implemented.   But when we have elections and the  system  is

not  ready, then certainly we cannot use e-voting as a  pilot

in a one or two constituencies that we plan to do when I last

spoke.  So that is the status of electronic voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the other parts of the debate which

several  Members  have  also spoken, and  I  thank  them  for

raising  their  views here and allowing me an opportunity  to

clarify some of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked us to look at the way of securing

overseas  voting  and to come out with an  electronic  voting

system.   Even  a simple system like that in  which  we  talk

about  touch  screen and keying in "Yes" or  "No"  and  which

party,  etc,  already  takes time.   And  that  is  not  even

electronic  in  the  real sense of  the  word,  where  it  is

transmitted from one station to another.  It is just a simple

system  in a particular polling station and nothing goes  out

of  that  space.  When you have electronic voting  or  secure

overseas voting, through either the Web or through some other

means,  that is an issue far more difficult than the e-voting

that  we  are planning.  Even in the United States, I believe

one  state has commissioned an expert study on this and  they

have come to the conclusion that, today, there is no safe way

of  having Internet voting or voting on the Web.  There is no

way  that it can ensure that the system works for them in the

way  that  they wanted.  So, this also deals with Mr  Chandra

Mohan's point.  We cannot design a system just like that.  It

takes  expertise, many, many experts and hours, to  come  out

with something.  And if the country that has the most experts

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2460</b></font><br><br>



that  is most knowledgeable, the United States, has not tried

it, I think we must fear to tread.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of right to vote, I have dealt with this

at  great length - whether citizens have a right to vote  and

whether  overseas citizens have a right to  vote,  and  there

were many verbal gymnastic sessions that we had been through,

I  would not go into this detail here today.  If hon. Members

will refer to the Hansard as well as to the other speeches  I

have  made,  we have settled that quite clearly.   No  doubt,

some  people may still raise this question, but  the  law  is

very, very clear.  The law, as it stands before our amendment

to  allow  for  overseas  voting, is quite  clear  that  only

citizens resident in Singapore can vote.  Then we amended the

law  to provide for citizens overseas to vote, provided  they

meet  certain conditions.  We have set the conditions and  we

will  now  see how that will work out before we consider  any

change to these conditions.  So I will not deal with that for

now until we have tried that out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we want to open up more centres in other

parts  of the world, in other countries, whether it is  going

to be in Perth or Shanghai or Shenzhen, etc, I have also said

that  the  five centres that we have selected  are  the  five

capital cities and, according to the Vienna Convention, these

are places where we have our consular officers there, we have

our  diplomatic community there and we conduct  our  business

there as a sovereign Government.  That we will continue to do

so.   To  try  to expand all that into other areas,  I  think

there  are  other issues that we will have to  deal  with  as

well.  So we will leave that to later, when we have tried out

how  the  selected Missions can implement a system like  that

when we have overseas voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether to have it in the other four Missions, apart

from   Washington,  like  Mr  Chiam  and  Mr  Chandra   Mohan

suggested, Mr Simon Tay made a valid point that we should not

be  selective  in  allowing Singaporeans  overseas  to  vote.

Besides, the security consideration is the same.  We are  not

saying that only the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2461</b></font><br><br>



United  States has a problem.  In my speech, I have said,  at

length,  that we cannot expect what will come the  next  day.

Unfortunately,  Mr  Chiam was not here when  I  explained  in

great  detail the reasons why we have decided to cancel  this

registration of overseas voting, and he raised, in his speech

a  number of questions which I have actually dealt  with.   I

would  suggest  that he reads my speech when the  Hansard  is

out.   Or if he would like to borrow a copy of the statement,

I would be pleased to show it to him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Mr Chandra Mohan's suggestion to secretly tell

overseas voters about voting in a secret location, we  cannot

find a way to inform citizens secretly about voting in secret

places.  No matter how ingenious we are - we are clever - but

not  that  clever to find such an ingenious way of  informing

citizens secretly about secret voting locations.  One  of  my

Permanent  Secretaries  once told  me  when  I  was  a  young

officer, "Kan Seng, when two persons know of a matter, it  is

no  longer a secret."  So, how are we going to tell thousands

of overseas Singaporeans, "This is a secret location.  I tell

you secretly, please go and vote on this secret day."  It  is

just  beyond  my  ability to think about  it.   Maybe  if  Mr

Chandra  Mohan  can find a way of doing so,  please  secretly

tell me about it!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chandra Mohan's question on calling for the GE and

his suggestion that we do not call for it until the situation

is  more  secure since we have up to August 2002 to call  it,

let  me  say that it is the prerogative of the Government  to

call  for  an election any time between now and August  2002.

Who  is  to determine that this is the best time?  It  surely

must be the Government.  Who is to say that if we extend this

to   August   2002,  we  can  expect  no  further  unforeseen

circumstances?  I cannot guarantee that.  I cannot  tell  him

that if we defer this for the time being until the attack  is

over, until the terrorist counter-attack, everything will  be

peaceful and calm and we will back to our life as per normal.

I  cannot guarantee that today.  Even before September  11th,

in  some  places, maybe he can.  But there is  no  utopia  on

earth.  Unfortunately, we cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2462</b></font><br><br>



tell  what  may happen between now and August 2002.   So  the

Government  has to choose the best time to have an  election.

It  may be coming soon.  It may be August 2002.  So, we  will

have  to  wait  and see.  If people expect that  election  is

coming soon, then let them be prepared for it.  If they think

that we should follow Mr Chandra Mohan's advice and wait till

August 2002, so be it.  I think we let it be like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About giving information to people on security threats

that we face, we would like to share as much as possible but,

at  the  same time, we must also not unnecessarily alarm  our

people  about  every piece of information  that  we  receive.

Even  in  the United States, I do not think that all the  key

people   are  privy  to  all  the  secrets  and  intelligence

information.   Even  for the Intelligence  Committee  in  the

Congress,  I  do  not think they are privy to  every  bit  of

intelligence  information,  but  they  receive  Congressional

notes, briefings from the intelligence agencies.  If need be,

we will tell the public what happened but we will choose what

to  tell, because we also have to make sure that the  sources

of  information  that  we  receive are  also  protected.   By

nature,  security must be something that we  must  take  very

seriously, and not simply publicise it every time we  receive

a  piece of information.  We will tell the people as much  as

we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions that

were  raised  by Members here.  If there is anything  that  I

have missed out that Members think is important, please raise

it again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have a few questions about e-voting. On the road-show that the Minister is talking about,

when  will  it  come  on?  The second question  is  how  many

constituencies will have e-voting?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> We would like to do the road-show

with  the equipment and the system that closely resemble what

we  are  going  to do for the actual e-voting.   Then  it  is

meaningful in the public education exercise.  If we  were  to

use  the  prototype  that the Elections  Department  and  its

vendors worked out to educate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2463</b></font><br><br>



the public, I think it may confuse the people.  So we have to

wait for that said system to be ready before we can start the

road-show to educate the public.  As I have said, the  system

is not likely to be ready until the end of this year.  So, we

cannot  have  road-shows definitely before the  end  of  this

year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how many constituencies will have this e-voting, I

have said, as a pilot, we will choose one or maybe two single

member constituencies.  It is small scale, big enough for  us

to  try  out  and,  at  the same time,  give  us  a  hands-on

experience as well as educate the public on what e-voting  is

all  about.  If Potong Pasir would like to volunteer, we will

think about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I made it clear to the Minister

the  last  time when the prototype was shown to the MPs  that

Potong Pasir is definitely not interested in e-voting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> It is all right if Mr Chiam does not

like  it.  But Mr Low Thia Khiang, when he made a speech here

during  the  debate on the Second Reading  of  the  Amendment

Bill, welcomed it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, it is a question that the Minister

may have missed.  This is a simple question that while I give

the  benefit  of the doubt to the Government's assessment  of

security, I would like to ask the Minister whether any  other

changes  will be made to security at our overseas  embassies,

such  as the holding of large receptions.  Second, is a point

of  clarification.  When I mentioned about  the  prospect  of

looking   into  a  secured  electronic  voting  for  overseas

Singaporeans, I did not mean that it is for now, but I meant,

prospectively, for the next General Election.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, we will look at all kinds of

systems  that  may  come by.  In fact, after  we  showed  the

prototype to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2464</b></font><br><br>



Members  of Parliament and after we got a vendor to  come  up

with a system and they are still working on it, I also got  a

briefing  from  the  Indians who had an  e-voting  system,  a

simple gadget which had been implemented in several states in

India.  We have looked at the system.  It is very simple, and

we are exploring that too as a possibility.  Of course, there

is one missing key element in that Indian system, and that is

the  inability for us to know whether it is a real  voter  or

somebody else who pressed the key.  Whereas in our system, we

have  a serial number, and in case there is a challenge or  a

petition to the court, the court will then say, "Check,  open

this  up", and we will know whether there is such a voter  or

not.   But in the Indian system, this check is not available.

So  we  have asked them to explore whether they could put  in

something that will allow us to trace, whether it is  a  real

voter with the right name in the register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards to holding a large reception by our missions,

our  missions  would  have  to  take  all  the  factors  into

consideration, including the importance of the occasion,  the

security aspects, as well as other considerations before they

decide  whether to have or not to have a large reception.   I

must leave that to the missions to exercise their judgment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee
