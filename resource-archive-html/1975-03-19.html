<div align="center"><b>RESIGNATION OF DOCTORS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Health

and Home Affairs (a) how many doctors resigned

from the service between 1st January, 1974 and 28th February, 1975, and if he is aware of any

further resignations in the offing: and (b) what

action has been initiated to replace them and what

steps have been taken to ensure that adequate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



medical attention is afforded to patients  in  the

hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, between 1st January, 1974, and

28th February, 1975, 98 doctors resigned from  the

service. Eighty-three resigned in 1974 and  15  in

the first two months of 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any further resignations in the

offing. In the last two years most resignations of

doctors  took place at the beginning of the  year,

that is, after they have received their 13th month

payment in December.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 98 doctors who resigned, 69 were without

higher   qualifications,   26   possessed   higher

qualifications and two were consultants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the 83 doctors who resigned in 1974, 57 or

73%  were young doctors with less than four years'

service. Eight were experienced doctors with  more

than ten years' service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in 1974 and the first two months of 1975,

129    doctors    including   17    with    higher

qualifications  joined  the  service.  There  was,

therefore, a net gain of 31 doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors of consultant rank in service in 1974 were

80,  compared to 65 in 1973, and 48 in 1970. There

were 91 Senior Registrars in 1974, compared to  40

in  1970.  There  were  60 medical  officers  with

higher qualifications in 1974, compared to  36  in

1970. The quality of the medical services has  not

suffered.   In   fact,  there   have   been   more

consultants,    and    doctors     with     higher

qualifications   in  service   and   with   better

facilities and equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now about 100 vacancies in the

establishment for doctors. However,  at  any  time

about  40 National Service doctors are working  in

the hospitals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is to recruit more young doctors to

lessen  the workload on the existing staff because

of  the vacancies, as well as to man our expanding

medical  services. There is also  the  problem  of

retaining  them  in the service and  reducing  the

turnover  of  doctors. A number of positive  steps

have been taken to meet the problem. They are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> 1. Accelerated Promotion Opportunities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotions have now been made on merit. They are

no  longer  limited to the number of higher  posts

available    in   the   establishment.   Promotion

exercises have been held twice a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2. More Training Awards And Fellowships.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a Medical Traineeship Scheme young doctors

who want to become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



specialists can apply and be selected  as  trainee

designates. They are given guidance and facilities

to  acquire higher qualifications from our  School

of  Postgraduate Studies. At present there are  62

trainee  designates under the Scheme. A  selection

exercise is now being conducted for another  batch

of  more than 50 candidates. Awards and fellowship

for  courses  of  study as well as  for  practical

training  abroad  have been  given  liberally.  At

present  there are 14 Government doctors  studying

abroad  for specialist qualifications. Another  18

have been selected to go abroad on scholarship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3. Revision of Specialist Allowance.</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialist allowance payable to doctors with

higher  qualifications  has  been  improved  since

1969. The allowance ranges from $100 to $1,000 per

month according to the grade of the officer.  This

specialist  allowance  is  not  payable  to  other

professional officers in the Civil Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors without higher qualifications also have

had  increases  in remuneration  by  revisions  of

salary,  National Wages Council  Awards  and  13th

month  payments.  For example, a  medical  officer

after  the second year of service will now receive

an  all-in salary of $1,588.50 per month, compared

to $1,200 in 1972.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry is very much aware of the

difficulties  young  Government  doctors  have  in

finding  suitable accommodation. My  Ministry  has

therefore planned to build three 28-storey  blocks

comprising  a  total  of 264  five-room  apartment

units  as  quarters for Government doctors.  These

three  blocks  will be part of the development  of

the Singapore General Hospital at Outram Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, my Ministry is negotiating an offer by

the Port of Singapore Authority to let out or sell

to   our   doctors  apartments  being   built   at

Spottiswoode Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferential condition for housing is a better way

of attracting and retaining doctors in the service

than an outright increase in salary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the doctors tendered their

resignations,  did the Personnel  officer  in  the

Ministry  of Health try to persuade them  to  stay

and  so  retain these doctors? Or did the  officer

just  say, "If you want to resign, you can resign.

There are others, who want to join the service." I

would like to know if there were such instances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, we do not take such an

attitude.  The point is that we try  our  best  to

retain our doctors. Once the doctors have made  up

their  mind to resign, they will of course  resign

because  they  must have made other  arrangements.

But  we  do  try to find out what are the  reasons

behind  their  resignations and see  if  there  is

anything  possible we can do to prevent them  from

resigning. We have tried. But, as I have  said  in

my  reply, one of the reasons which induce  young

doctors  to resign is their difficulty in  finding

suitable  accommodation because of higher rentals.

That is the reason why my Ministry has planned  to

build   three   28-storey  blocks   of   five-room

apartments as quarters for Government doctors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah should not be under the

impression  that the Ministry's attitude  is  that

they  should resign if they want to. The point  is

that  if  they insist on resigning, there is  very

little we can do about it. But everything has been

done to encourage them to remain in service.

<br><br>2.40 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head O -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Communications has the very

onerous  task of reorganising our public transport

system. The Ministry also has to solve the growing

congestion  on our roads as well as to  streamline

our  traffic  system in line with  industrial  and

commercial  developments for the  benefit  of  our

people. This is a very important task and  I  hope

the  reorganisation of the public transport system

will be successful.

Sir, I would like to raise three questions. First,

it  is  about  the reorganisation  of  the  public

transport  system,  which  has  already  been   in

operation for two or three years. There  has  been

some  progress made but, according to the  public,

progress  has  been very slow. The  reorganisation

includes the introduction of bus lanes, pedestrian

walks and the restriction of traffic flow into the

CBD.  The purpose of these measures is, of course,

to  improve travel by public transport. Since  the

reorganisatiop. I would like to know whether there

has been any marked or radical improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what I hear, improvement has been

very slight because at peak hours traffic is still

very  congested. Moreover, we can see buses  break

down along the road. The buses also emit obnoxious

smoke and the condition inside the bus leaves much

room  for improvement. In regard to bus lanes  and

the   siting   of   bus  stops  there   are   many

shortcomings which need to be remedied. And  where

the  road  is too narrow, say, Robinson  Road,  at

about  5.00  p.m, everyday the buses  are  parked

along  the bus lane by the tens. In the  end,  the

bus lane is turned into a bus terminal where buses

are  parked.  So you find that all the  buses  are

squeezed together in a queue, one after the other,

thus  causing congestion of all the other vehicles

on the road.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member for Sembawang giving way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, I am rising on a point of order, and not on a

point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No. I am not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Ng says that-he is rising on a point of

order. So the Member for Sembawang has got to give

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice that amendment (2)* is

to be moved by the Member for Boon Teck. It refers

to  subhead AAA 1901 "Salaries of staff on loan to

Singapore Bus Service Ltd." So what the Member  is

saying could be discussed under that amendment.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head O be reduced by $ 10 in respect of subhead AAA 1901.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, are you now talking on the policy of

the Minister?  -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes. Sir, I am touching on the policy of the

Ministry. I was, talking about the situation after

the reorganisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Minister is fully aware of what

the  position  is  because there  is  a  committee

consisting  of  Permanent  Secretaries  from  five

Ministries who now and then report to the Minister

on the progress of the reorganisation. But what  I

want  to  say is that the actual progress  of  the

reorganisation has not been very satisfactory.  So

I  would like to ask the Minister whether  he  has

any  better  measures to improve public transport,

and whether the work of reorganisation is going on

in  accordance  with the recommendations  of  `the

White  Paper on Reorganisation of Motor Transport

Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question I would like ask the

Minister   concerning  the-  setting  up   of   an

undergr6und  rail system. Last year, the  Minister

made' a statement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



in  the  House about the Mass Rapid  Transit

system  that was going to be introduced  in  1980.

including the plan for an underground rail system.

What  progress  has been made in respect  of  this

plan,  and whether he can give a detailed  account

to this House.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Would the Minister like to answer now or would he

like  to  hear  a little more from all  the  other

Members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it would be better to

hear  all  the  Others first so  that  perhaps  my

answer could he a general one.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Rodrigo.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, last year, the Minister `pledged

to  alleviate the shocking conditions of  the  bus

transport system in Singapore. I must congratulate

the  Minister  this year, for  there  has  been  a

tremendous  improvement  in  our  mass   transport

system.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> However, there are a few anomalies, which I hope

the Minister will do his best to overcome. Certain

bus  services  are  very  irregular,  particularly

those  serving in the rural areas. As an  example,

service  190  from  Shenton  Way  to  Bukit  Merah

particularly  seems to be completely  absent  from 6.30  p.m, to 7.30 p.m. What I understand is  that

bus drivers and conductors running this service go

out  for  their meal breaks during this  hour  and

thus keep the poor commuters waiting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I understand that some bus drivers

use  to  speed  along  the road  and  reach  their

terminus  much' earlier than the scheduled  times,

and  no  one questions them for arriving early.  I

wonder  whether the SBS is seriously  checking  on

the scheduled stops at all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



the  bus stops along the route to ensure that  the

service is being run frequently and efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maintenance of buses seems to be rather poor.

Even  if  the engine is m a working condition,  is

the  bus  checked  to  ensure that  other  service

facilities are functioning effectively? There have

been instances when windows as well as ventilators

cannot  be closed during a shower. In these  cases

it  rains  not  only outside but also  inside  the

buses. On this matter, may I ask the Minister what

is  the  Registry of Vehicles doing about checking

the condition of the buses, and how frequently  is

a bus checked for serviceability? Is a certificate

of fitness issued by the ROV for each bus? In this

respect,  I must say that the Scheme B  buses  are

far  better in cleanliness, comfort, courtesy  and

service to the commuters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also observe that at the SBS maintenance

centres,  the  spare parts are left all  over  the

place.  This encourages theft as spare  parts  are

valuable  to  some people. Can something  be  done

about  this mess? They must understand  that  they

pay  a very high price for these parts and without

any  proper  enclosures or security measures  they

are bound to be stolen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rudeness on the part of conductors and drivers

has  been  reduced remarkably. A good job  done  I

must  say.  However,  bus drivers  still  have  to

improve  their  standard of driving.  Speeding  is

still a common offence among the drivers. There is

a lot of publicity when new buses are commissioned

on the roads every month. But hardly any publicity

is  given to the number of buses that are laid off

through  breakdowns and the many  major  accidents

caused  by  some  of the reckless SBS  drivers.  I

think the Minister will notice this when he drives

to  his office to see whether this is true. If the

same  number or more buses are taken off the  road

for these reasons, then additions of new buses  to

the  services are completely nullified. I feel  we

have  to import ready-made buses from overseas  by

the hundreds, and we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



to  grant  a loan to SBS for this on a  long  term

basis  to enable them to recover the cost of these

buses. In this way probably our transport problems

will be solved. Many people are willing to give up

their  cars  only  if  the  bus  service  is  more

efficient and if there are sufficient bus shelters

to protect them from the weather.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The display board on the bus showing the service

number  and  the route needs some improvement.  In

this  respect too the Scheme B service  buses  are

far  ahead of the SBS. It is pointless to  display

only  the  service  number  and  its  destination,

because  commuters would also  like  to  know  the

various  roads  along the service  route.  Surely,

this is not asking too much. A small display board

showing  the main roads along the route can  go  a

long way to help the travelling public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is being done about keeping the termini of

the  buses  clean and safe? Many of the  terminals

are  covered with traces of dirty black oil spills

which   arc  quite  often  a  source  of   danger.

particularly on rainy days. The terminals  at  Yio

Chu  Kang  Road  for service 73 and Upper  Thomson

Road for service 165 are some examples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new buses are supposed to have a new type of

seat    made    of   fibre-glass.    I    presume.

Unfortunately, this type does not last very  long.

Most  of  these  seats in the buses  are  in  poor

condition. If one is not careful, one is going  to

receive  nasty  cuts  from  a  damaged  seat.  Can

something be done to replace these seats with more

durable  material? The SBS should  not  only  look

into  the  question of quantity but  also  on  the

quality of buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At some terminals there is no indication which

particular  bus  is going to move out  first.  The

conductors, drivers and time-keepers are  no  help

either.  Surely the parking of buses at  terminals

could  be arranged in such a way that the  bus  at

one  end  will always leave first. This  will  not

keep  the  commuters guessing. There arc occasions

when  commuters  board  a stationary  bus  at  the

terminal but they are not told that that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



bus  is either spoilt or will not be the first  to

leave.  Though  so  many drivers,  conductors  and

timekeepers  are present, they just  look  at  the

commuters.  This  goes on very frequently  at  the

terminal   point   near  the   Singapore   General

Hospital. Can something be done about it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask if the Minister

will consider extending the bus service, which now

ends  at Shenton Way, to serve Keppel Road  ending

after the Telok Blangah housing estate. This  will

help  the many port workers who have to take  this

route.  Furthermore a bus service should  also  be

proposed from Cantonment Road to Keppel Road/Telok

Blangah Road for port workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at peak hours from 4.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m. the buses coming from the terminal at

Shenton  Way are always full. But along  the  way,

from  Robinson  Road  to the  junction  of  Market

Street  all  the  bus stops are crowded,  and  the

people  have to wait for hours. There  must  be  a

certain  system  of  re-routing  the  buses,  say,

certain buses should be routed from the terminals,

certain  buses  from Market Street, certain  buses

from the esplanade, and so on. But I am not saying

anything  more. The Hon. Minister must  understand

the  situation.  In  the  days  of  the  Singapore

Traction Company, when their superintendents  knew

that  the  commuters were waiting in crowds,  they

said,  "All right, get one bus down from somewhere

and  bring it here." Or on inspection, they  would

say.  "Bring this service here and tell  everybody

that this bus is going to Katong," or "This bus is

going  to Serangoon." Why cannot the SBS use  that

system? "I am giving more buses" - what is the use

of  giving  more buses? The buses at the terminals

are  already  full and commuters along  the  route

have to wait for hours.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister will notice this if he passes along

these  roads up to High Street at 5 o'clock. There

are more new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



buses but they are still insufficient because they

are  always full during peak hours. Therefore, SBS

has  to  arrange a way so that the passengers  can

get  the  bus  at the proper time  to  reach  home

early. But now they leave office at 5 o'clock  and

reach home at 7 o'clock. They work eight hours but

they  are out for 12 hours. Something must be done

and the very minor matters must be considered,  or

they will become a bad problem. I ask the Minister

to  go round these routes at 5 o'clock one day and

see what is happening.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b>Sir, it has always been recognised that there is a

shortage  of land for development in Singapore.  I

believe that there is even a special committee  to

ensure  that any available vacant land is properly

utilised, that is, with maximum economic  benefit.

The Central Business District scheme has taken  up

valuable  land  which can be  utilised  for  other

essential  projects  like recreational  parks  and

public housing. Notwithstanding the costs involved

in  the construction of the numerous fringe  area-car parks, the valuable land so acquired is in use

only  for part of the day. During the night  these

car parks will be left vacant. Millions of dollars

will  be spent in the construction of these fringe

area  car parks, the overhead signboards  and  the

necessary  checkpoints. The  only  consolation  in

this  scheme  is  that job opportunities  will  be

created.  Perhaps  the Ministry of  Communications

hopes to recover all or part of the cost from  the

fees  collected  arising out of  this  scheme  for

motorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regretted that the CBD scheme is to be

introduced  at  a  time when the public  transport

system   has   not   yet  shown  any   significant

improvement. Commuters have still to wait for long

hours for the buses. I concede that there is  some

improvement  in  the  conduct  of  bus  crews.  My

congratulations to the men who are responsible for

raising  the morale of the bus workers and putting

some semblance of efficient management in the SBS.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my opinion the CBD scheme when

implemented  will  have  more  disadvantages  than

advantages.   For   example,   the   Ministry   of

communications  was  mainly  instrumental  in  the

successful  elimination of pirate taxis  from  our

roads.  With the CBD scheme, there is  nothing  to

prevent an enterprising person to purchase a  car,

which is now at rock-bottom prices, round up  four

or  five  persons at great personal  risk  to  the

passengers  and  enter  the  CBD,  thus  making  a

profit; all with the blessings of the Ministry  of

Communications. What is to prevent employers  from

reimbursing  their executive and managerial  staff

for  the  area licence fees imposed? Professionals

similarly will have no problem in paying the  fees

as  they can pass this burden on to their clients.

Salesmen and bill collectors will make the  claims

to  their respective units for reimbursement. With

increased costs, the employers will certainly  add

this on to the cost of goods and services. In  the

end,   the  poor  consumers  suffer  through  such

further inflation; also -with the blessings of the

Ministry of communications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is no restriction on the number of

vehicles  that is allowed to enter  the  CBD,  and

coupled with the aforementioned loopholes, how can

we   hope  to  relieve  traffic  congestion?   The

question  is:  is it worthwhile to spend  so  much

money  on the CBD scheme only to derive so  little

benefit   from   it?  Surely   there   are   other

alternative measures, like prohibiting  cars  with

certain  licence  numbers from entering  the  CBD

area  at  specified times of the day. For example,

cars  with licence numbers ending with 1 and  2

may be prohibited from entering the CBD on Mondays

between  certain hours, and so on. In this  way,

every- motorist has to refrain entry into the  CBD

for  a  few  hours a week, and there  will  be  a'

definite reduction in vehicular traffic within the

CBD. I do not think that, the alternative measures

proposed will in any way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



involve  extensive enforcement or the  engagement

of  an  army  of  inspectors to  check  on  erring

motorists.  Stiff  penalties  together  with   the

points   demerit  system  will  be  a   sufficient

deterrent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-litter campaign succeeded not because

there  was  an army of health inspectors  swarming

all   over   the  place  hut  because  of   strict

enforcement and stiff penalties. The present  plan

tends  to favour those who can afford or who  have

the  means to recover the cost of the licence fees

and increased car park charges.' I do not think it

will  relieve traffic congestion within  the  CBD.

Assuming  that the proposed plan will succeed,  it

will  inevitably  transfer traffic  congestion  to

other parts of the city during peak hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Mr Chai Chong Yii):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson in his

eloquent speech virtually tore SBS into pieces. It

is admitted that public transport at the moment is

still  not at the level that we would like  it  to

be.  But  the  Government team of officials  which

moved   into  SBS  on, the  invitation   of   the

management only about seven months ago has managed

to  do  quite  a little bit. If I were  to  answer

right  now the faults or rather the defects  which

the  Member  for Anson has brought up, then  other

Members may not have any chance to speak. But what

I  can  say right now is that the faults mentioned

by  the Member for Anson are all being studied  in

detail  and,  given the required period  of  time,

they will all he put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Central-Business district mentioned

by  the  Member  for Toa Payoh, the `Minister  for

Communications  will be answering him.  Perhaps  I

should  stop right now so that other Members  will

have a chance to raise other

matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, perhaps the criticisms or queries

raised `by the `Members "for Sembawang and Anson

on the Singapore Bus Service are items which can

really be fully answered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



when  we come to amendment (2)* which will  be moved  by  the Member for Boon Teck and amendment (6)+ on the Registry of Vehicles.



<hr size="2" noshade>

The amendments read as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*(2) That the sum -to be allocated for, Head 0 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1901.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+(6)That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead FAA 1107.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Member for Sembawang raised two other

points  which  I think I can answer now. He mentioned  about the progress of the Mass  Transit Study.  Here again, it comes under amendment  (9)* (* The amendment reads as follows:(9) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA

8101.) and  if he wilt be patient enough to wait, we  can give him the answer then. But he did mention about the  Road  Transport  Action Committee's  policies which  are not well received and inquired  whether this came within the White Paper on the Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service  of Singapore.  I  would like to bring to  his  notice that  this White Paper was a three-year  plan  for

the  period 1970-73. So it has nothing to do  with

the   Road  Transport  Action  Committee  of  five

Permanent  Secretaries,  which  was  appointed  in

October  1973  after  the recommendations  of  the

White  Paper  have  already  been  more  or   less

accomplished, nor has it anything to do with the

follow-up  of  the recommendations  in  the  White

Paper.  These are new policies subsequent  to  the

publication of the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to differ with the Member that the

policies are not well received. If at all they are

not  popular  measures,  that  I  agree.  But  the

Government  has to be responsible. It has  got  to

make  unpopular decisions and hard  decisions  in,

order to resolve difficult problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can, however, reply more fully to the Member

for  Toa Payoh's reservations over the success  of

the schemes which we intend to implement to reduce

traffic   congestion  in  the   Central   Business

District.  So far,  about $7 million  has  been

committed  to implement the two traffic management

schemes,  namely, the park-and-ride and the  area

licensing schemes. This amount is for the con-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



struction of 12 fringe area car parks, parking

kiosks at these car parks, provision of new bus

shelters, provision of daily area licence sale

booths and the erection of overhead gantry signs

which are now all, over Singapore, as well as new

road direction signs. Contrary to what the Member

for Toa Payoh says, we expect a significant

improvement in traffic conditions `within the CBD

following the introduction of these two traffic

management measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various alternative methods of reducing the

number  of  vehicles entering the CBD  during  the

peak  periods have been examined before the  park-and-ride  and  the  area  licensing  schemes  were

selected  as  being  the most  appropriate  and

effective  measures for Singapore. The Member  has

indicated  one  method and there  are  also  other

methods  which  ,have  been  suggested,   like   - allowing vehicles with registration numbers ending

in  odd  numbers  entering the  CBD  on  Mondays,

Wednesdays and Fridays, and those ending  in  even

numbers on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Member for Toa Payoh did put in a

paper  and  it  was studied by the Road  Transport

Action  Committee. Unfortunately we have  to  tell

him  that  though his idea sounds very  simple  to

operate,    there   are   three   major    serious

difficulties  when  it  comes  to  implementation.

Firstly, it will place an automatic restriction of

almost  one  half of the car motoring public  and,

with   at   least   140,000  cars  registered   in

Singapore, this means that 70,000 car owners  will

not  be able to use those `cars: This is much  too

high  a  level of restriction on the movement  of

private  cars  for the time being. Secondly,  it

does not provide such affected motorists with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



genuine need or in an emergency to drive into  the

city  because they are not supposed to be  on  the

road.  So they just cannot move. Thirdly,  such  a

scheme  will  affect  all  motorists  whereas  the

proposed  area licensing scheme is only  aimed  at

restricting   car   drivers  from   entering   the

restricted  zone and not elsewhere. The restricted

zone  is  effective only for this two-hour period,

from  7.30 a.m, to 9.30 a.m, in the morning,  thus

having  a  very  minimum effect  on  business  and

commerce.  There is no restriction of  entry  into

the  restricted zone outside these two peak  hours

in the morning. The area licensing scheme provides

options to motorists who wish to continue to drive

into  the restricted zone. It is not just for  the

privileged few. They can come in at no extra  cost

provided the car has at least four passengers.  In

other words, we want to encourage them to form car

pools. Another alternative for motorists would  be

to  participate in the park and ride  scheme,  and

those  who choose this scheme would do  so  at  an

even  much cheaper cost than what they would  have

to  pay  for  seasonal parking in the  city  area,

because the cost of such seasonal parking could be

anything from $50 to $70 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious and conscientious effort must therefore

be  made by all car owners for a more rational use

of  our roads in the city. Motorists can choose to

pay for the privilege to drive into the restricted

area  provided  they pay a price, or  help  reduce

traffic congestion through formation of car pools,

or participate in the park and ride scheme, or opt

for  staggered hours outside the 7.30 a.m, to'9.30

a.m, time slot. Only those- and this is  a  small

fraction  -  who  choose and who  must  enter  the

restricted zone during these two hours  will  have

to  pay  a  price  which we would call  a  "social

cost".  This  can be viewed as a  charge  that  is

being  required  to pay for part of  the  cost  of

constructing the 12 fringe area car parks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, just a point of clarification. In my

memorandum to the Hon. Minister sometime  ago,  my

proposed scheme covers the whole of Singapore. But

in my speech just now I have particularly modified

it  so  that it applies to only the CBD. So it  is

not  correct to say that about half the number  of

motorists will be affected throughout the  day  or

all  over the island. It is only applicable during

the  peak  period,  and this will  meet  the  very

objective  that  we are aiming  at,  that  is,  to

reduce the number of motor cars entering the  CBD.

So  my  present  plan  is a  modification  of  the

earlier one.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> New proposals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, it gives mc a chance to say again that the

modified  plan cannot be accepted at  this  stage.

But  it  does  give me the opportunity  to  answer

another  point which was raised by the Member  for

Ton  Payoh  and which I have missed in my  answer,

i.e, that the fringe area car parks would not  be

utilized at night. I wish to assure him that  this

matter  has been considered and that these  fringe

area  car  parks which can hold as many as  10,000

cars  will be economically used. They will be  let

out  for  the parking of buses, lorries  and  even

cars, if necessary, at a fee to be charged. So  we

shall be making full use of these fringe area  car

parks. The Road Transport Action Committee will be

issuing  a  full  press statement to  explain  the

details  of the park and ride scheme and the  area

licensing  scheme in the middle of next month.  So

more details will be made available to Members  of

this House as well as to members of the public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (in Mandarin):</b> Sir, the Minister did not understand me very

clearly  just now. I said that the view of members

of   the   public   was  that  the   progress   in

reorganisation has been rather slow. They are  not

dissatisfied.  It  is just that the  progress  has

been rather slow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I raised was whether the

reorganisation has proceeded in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



accordance with the scheduled programme  as  given

in  the White Paper. For example, in the matter of

replacement of old vehicles, we still find  a  lot

of  old  vehicles running on the  road.  What  has

happened   to  the  replacement  scheme?   Is   it

according to the schedule as provided in the White

Paper?  I would like to ask the Minister concerned

to  inform  this  House whether the reorganisation

has  been proceeding according to schedule for the

three-year   period.  Further,  has  the   traffic

congestion situation improved much?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am sorry, Sir, for failing to answer all the

questions  raised by the Member for Sembawang.  As

regards   the   full   implementation    of    the

recommendations of the White Paper which was meant

to  be completed by the middle of 1973, I can only

say  that it was not a 100% implementation of  all

the  recommendations.  We  tried  as  far  as   we

possibly  could, but many of the details have  not

been  exactly implemented. It will take some  time

to  do  so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Road Transport Action

Committee's  policies not being  implemented  fast

enough,  I think there is a necessity to  consider

the repercussions. For some, it is probably moving

a  bit too fast for them. Perhaps it is better  to

hasten slowly. That is why, for the park and  ride

scheme  and the area licensing scheme, even though

the brochure was published more than a year ago it

is  coming into operation only after one full year

of publicity and explanation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (in Mandarin):</b> Sir, since the Minister has given an explanation,

I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1901.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I chose to remain silent in this Parliament

for  the  last 24 years and to listen to  all  the

constructive  criticisms as well as a  few  unfair

criticisms about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



our bus workers, but I am sure you will agree with

me  that  the time has come for me to  say  a  few

words  of  encouragement  for  the  ROV,  the  new

management,  as well as the 8,000 bus  workers  of SBS.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been searing criticisms in the past

against our bus drivers and conductors about their

conduct,  performance  and  inadequate   care   of

vehicles. These were valid criticisms, but the rut

that  set  in had quite a lot to do with the  poor

organisation and mismanagement as well. It  became

evident  that to bring order out of chaos, drastic

measures had to be taken to relieve commuters from

the  deplorable  inadequacies  and  inconveniences

which they had to face. The Government stepped  in

and  with  the  advent of the Government  team  of

officers there have been significant improvements.

Close   cooperation  between   the   Ministry   of

Communications, the union and the  new  management

has  cleared up a messy situation with the  active

participation of the workers. The contribution  of

the union with the support of the bus workers must

not  go  unheeded.  From a  ragged  lot,  the  bus

workers have found a new dignity as co-partners in

improving  the public bus transport system.  Terms

and  conditions of employment have  also  improved

and the new management has taken cognisance of the

welfare of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though, all in all, the improvements have been

generally  satisfactory, I  would  call  upon  the

management  to also take cognisance  of  the  fact

that  the mechanics, timekeepers, bus drivers  and

conductors   are  the  people  who  are   directly

involved  in  keeping the fleet of  buses  running

well  on time and earning revenue for the company.

They are, in other words, collectively responsible

for  the smooth and efficient operation of the bus

services,     and     they     shoulder      great

responsibilities.    The    management     should,

therefore, consider them on an equal footing  with

other employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still a few other areas which require

consideration. During peak hours, bus workers have

to  work under great stress and strain. When buses

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



full, it sometimes happens that buses will  have

to   overshoot  bus  stops  to  prevent  commuters

gathered  in large numbers from pushing their  way

in.  The commuters ,have also ,to develop a  sense

of  discipline  by  queuing up at  bus  stops  and

refraining  to  enter buses which  are  full  when

requested  to  do  so  by the conductor.  In  such

circumstances, it is unfair and unjust for  anyone

to pin the blame on bus conductors and drivers who

arc  responsible for the safety and comfort of the

passengers.  There  are also  instances  when  any

commuters are uncivil to bus conductors. These are

probably  the normal hazards of the job, hut  they

can be made tolerable if greater understanding  is

shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of bus terminals, the situation is far

from  satisfactory.  In  other  cities  large  bus

terminals  with adequate facilities  exist.  Apart

from  the  Toa  Payoh bus terminal, there  are  no

proper bus terminals in Singapore where buses  can

be  parked  in clearly demarcated bays or  various

routes.   This   would   facilitate   the   proper

identification  of buses and orderly  boarding  by

commuters. I suggest that the provision of  proper

bus    terminals    should   be    given    urgent

consideration, and that consideration should  also

be given in development projects for the provision

of   bus   terminals  with  reasonably  sufficient

facilities for canteens and sanitary needs.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the SBS which was, formed in

November  1973  is  easily  the  biggest   private

company   with  a  work  force  of   about   9,000

employees. The hon. Member for Boon Teck has  told

the  House  some-of  the  problems  faced  by  the

company and the bus workers. We all know that  SBS

is  formed  out of ten small Chinese bus companies

which  were,  managed on a family  basis.  So  the

company has to face a lot of problems. During  the

period  of the last seven months in which  I  have

been involved in the reorganisation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



quite a bit has, been done for the welfare of  the

bus workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of standard procedures and

systems   has  to  a  great  extent  reduced   the

unhappiness  of the bus workers. The company  has

also  provided  better  working  environment   and

recreational  facilities for the bus workers.  The

following  are some of the measures taken  by  the

company to improve the working conditions  of  the

bus workers as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Common procedures for recruitment and

selection of personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Standard office hours for the various bus

depots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Standardised daily wage deductions for bus

drivers  and  conductors were also implemented  in

all  the depots, thereby making it much easier for

reconciliation  of  wages. The  company  has  also

tried  its best to encourage thrift among the  bus

workers  by  contributing $5 to each POSB  savings

account opened by the bus workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The recommendation `of the NWC on wage

increases  was also implemented for  all  the  bus

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this has boosted up the morale of the bus

`workers  to  a great extent and the  bus  workers

have responded very well except a few.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the salary scale mentioned by the Member for Boon

Teck,  I  would like to inform the House that  the

bus   company   right  now   is   drawing   up   a

comprehensive  salary scale for all SBS  employees

so  as  to  keep  them informed  of  their  career

prospects in the company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touching on the point of the bus terminus, it is

quite true that we are still short of satisfactory

bus  terminus  owing to various  reasons,  one  of

which  is  shortage of land. But the  company  has

already  done  its  best  in  providing  one  very

important  need of the bus workers, that  is,  the

toilet  facilities,  in Lim Chu  Kang,  Sembawang,

Jalan  Kayu,  Ulu  Pandan, Kaki  Bukit  and  Jalan

Eunos.  -  These  facilities are  expected  to  be

completed early next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>

question is still being looked into.

clarification on this particular amount.

According to the Memorandum on the Main and

Development Estimates, this amount of $1.15

million will be subsequently recovered from  SBS.

Will it be recovered at cost or cost-plus?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> On this point, I would like to inform the House

that the company is paying 150% of the salaries of

the employees seconded to the bus company. - -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b>Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State did say

that  a  few  workers  had not  responded  to  the

measures  introduced by the SBS. I would  like  to

know what action has been taken against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

other  point  is  whether the  Hon.  Minister  has

considered the question of solving the problem  of

fatigue  of bus drivers during those long  drives,

as mentioned  by the Member for Boon Teck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> On the question of uninterrupted long distance

drives,  I  would like to say that this matter  is

now being looked into by breaking a long trip into

two  short  trips. But we have to look  `into  the

question of additional cost for the commuters.  As

a  result,  it  is  still not  being  implemented.

Should it be implemented, it would, of course,  be

on the understanding that the commuter will not be

made   to   pay   more,   although   he   may   be

inconvenienced  by  a  transfer  to  another  bus,

especially, for those who are staying  in  Changi

and working in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point about bus workers who did not

respond, the steps taken will be first to  try  to

win  them -over by educational means. And if  they

still  do  not respond by changing their  attitude

for  the  benefit of the company and- the' public,

`the ultimate result wilt be dismissal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I do not consider 150% of the salaries to be

a  very  good deal considering that these officers

seconded  to the SBS are all very' seasoned,  well

trained'   and  experienced  officers  from   ,the

various  Ministries. Their secondment  would  mean

that   the  standard  of  service  in  the   other

departments would" suffer,' and to that extent the

taxpayers suffer. We are, in fact, subsidising the

management of SBS. Considering that the Government

must  have spent vast sums of money over the years

to `train these people, I think" a more reasonable

deal would be that Government gets a share in  the

profits -subject to a figure not less than 150% of

the amount expended. Whatever profit or commission

that  the  Government receives  can  be  used  for

public  -purposes. I think this would  be  a  more

reasonable basis. We have a duty to help  the  SBS

to  raise the standard of service, but we  do  not

have  a  duty to help the private shareholders  to

make profit at, the expense of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b>Mr Speaker, Sir,' 1 wish to compliment the hon.

Member,  for Jalan Kayu for his cost-consciousness

as  regards the payment of salaries of  staff  who

have been seconded to assist SBS to reorganise and

improve  its  management. I think  it  is  a  very

unique and unprecedented move to second more  than

100  officers from Government and our Armed Forces

to help a private limited company like SBS. It has

been   done  by  Government  purely  because   for

historical  reasons an essential  public  service,

like the bus service, is in the hands of a private

company. If it were riot for this, I do not  think

the Government would lift a finger. The Government

would allow the company to collapse and to start a

new company.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 1 1/2 million people travel by bus, and it

is  not possible for the Government to allow it to

collapse.  And  after  the  Government   Team   of

Officials has gone in to investigate and find  out

exactly  what was wrong with the company, SBS  was

not    in    a   position   to   implement, the

recommendations of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



Government Team of Officials contained in a report

which  has  been published, and I  am  sure  every

Member  in  this  House has  studiously  read  it,

including the Member for Kallang. They were not in

a position to do a thing for themselves and surely

Government had to come in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Jalan Kayu had followed the

statement  that  was  issued by  the  Ministry  of

Communications at the time that the team was to be

seconded,  which was in July last year,  he  would

have realised that after Government had put in  so

much  effort to reorganise, improve and bring  the

standard  of service to a level which we  consider

is  necessary, the Government would not relax  its

hold  on  the  company we would like to  see  this

private  limited company become a  public  limited

company  with  shares on the Stock  Exchange,  and

that Government would have a shareholding in it. I

think it is a little too early to say that we  are

treating  SBS  rather  cheaply  because  we   have

already  moved in. We will see to it that  profits

are not made just for private shareholders and, if

and when we succeed, and I think we shall succeed,

in  raising  the  standard of  this  bus  company,

Government will have a participation in it, and  I

think it is our duty to do so. I hope it would not

appear  as if we want to squeeze the lemon dry  by

getting  the  maximum  out  of  SBS,  so  long  as

Government is not out-of-pocket for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our seamen seem to have a knack for getting

into trouble in foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



waters. Sometime  ago  there  was  an  incident  involving

Neptune   Orient  Lines,  and  this  resulted   in

Singapore  ships  being banned by  the  Australian

Seamen's  Union. Did our seamen come into  contact

with  Australian Seamen's Union and  make  use  of

foreign  unions to make a claim for higher  wages?

If not, it seems to be a gross interference on the

part  of the Australian Seamen's Union to lay down

rules on the wage structure of our union. What has

happened so far. Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I presume the Member for Anson is

referring  to  the  reported incident  which  took

place  last  month  involving the  Neptune  Orient

Lines  vessel,  the  Neptune Ruby,  in  Melbourne,

Australia The Neptune Orient Lines has a number of

vessels  plying to Australasian ports. Before  the

Neptune  Ruby  incident there were no  reports  of

interference with NOL ships although, prior to the

setting  up  of  the  Board  of  inquiry   by   my

colleague,  the Minister for Labour,  in  February

1973 to look into the dispute between the Maritime

Employers and the Singapore Seamen's Organisation,

there  were  a  number of reports of  interference

with ships, both Singapore and foreign registered,

in  which  Singapore seamen were employed  by  the

Australian Waterside Workers' Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Neptune Ruby was brought into commission

in  August  1972, she  was  manned  by  Singapore

officers and crew. However, as the vessel  was  on

long-term  charter to a Japanese shipping  company

whose    routes   were   Japan,   Australia    and

subsequently Japan Caribbean ports, NOL  made  the

decision  to  employ Filipino crew on the  Neptune

Ruby with the change of Articles for the seamen in

August  1973.  The decision was taken  while  they

were   on   vessels  which  do   not   call   back

periodically  at Singapore which are  not  popular

with  our  seafarers, and have in the  past  given

rise  to  problems of crew morale, and discipline.

When the Neptune Ruby arrived in Melbourne on 20th

February, 1975, one Filipino electrician on board,

who  was  to be replaced on disciplinary  grounds,

did approach the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



Australian   Waterside  Workers  Federation   for

assistance.  The AWWF representative  who  boarded

the  vessel was reported to have said that  unless

the problems of the electrician and those of three

other officers, who were also about to be released

by  replacement officers being flown  out  by  NOL

agents  in  the  Philippines,  were  resolved   no

linesmen  and tugs would be supplied to  sail  the

vessel.  The AWWF representative was said to  have

further  demanded  that the crew  members  of  the

Neptune  Ruby be paid the International  Transport

Federation rates of pay with retrospective  effect

from  the  date the current Articles of  Agreement

were  opened in August 1974, and further that  the

officers  whose  services were  to  be  terminated

should  be  paid  wages up to the  expiry  of  the

Articles,  that  is,  approximately  six   months'

wages.  The Neptune Ruby was, however, allowed  to

leave Melbourne on 26th February, 1975, after  the

personnel  who were to be replaced had  been  paid

three  months' wages as severance pay. The  demand

for the crew to be paid the ITF rates was dropped.

NOL has reported that no further difficulties have

been  experienced in the Australasian ports  since

the Neptune Ruby incident.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I add that the policy of the NOL continues to

be  one of giving preference to the employment  of

Singapore seamen. In fact, 74% of the officers and

crew  serving on NOL vessels are local  personnel.

However,  in the case of NOL vessels on  long-term

charter, crew of other nationalities may  have  to

be  employed  for  the time being for  operational

reasons.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tourism is a budding industry in Singapore

with  a  million people passing through  Singapore

annually.  The Singapore International Airport  is

the  place  that  gives the  passenger  his  first

impression  on  arrival  and  last  impression  on

departure.  On arrival a passenger is  immediately

accorded all the facilities and services. But when

he  leaves,  the good impression that  he  had  on

arrival  would be rudely disturbed when he finally

boards the plane.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans and tourists alike leave

Singapore  at  all  times  of  the  day  via   the

Singapore International Airport. During  the  peak

hours  the  check-in counters are very  congested,

and  the  passengers  have to  squeeze  their  way

through  the crowds of well-wishers. The  check-in

sometimes  takes as long as 30 to 45 minutes,  and

during  this time the passengers have to  wait  in

discomfort.  Not  only  is  this  area   extremely

inadequate  to  cater for the  growing  number  of

passengers but the atmosphere is also humid  which

the passengers have to endure before clearance. Of

course, this check-in area is not air-conditioned.

But  it is ironical to note that the electric fans

on  the  pillars should be directed at  the  staff

behind the counters, instead of at the passengers.

After  all,  the passengers are paying  a  service

charge  of $10 which is the highest rate  in  this

part of the world. Furthermore, they are also made

to feel the discomfort of the weather should there

be a shower at this area, which is not partitioned

off.  To  improve the situation, it  is  suggested

that immediate action should be taken to partition

off  the  frontage and air-condition the area.  By

doing so, it will reduce the noise pollution  from

the traffic outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the main concourse passengers are

again faced with the over-crowded area because  of

the  congestion.  Announcements of  departures  at

times  could  not  be heard and passengers  either

miss their flight or the departure is delayed. The

departure  transit  hail is also  very  congested.

There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



are  not enough benches for the passengers to  sir

and  some  of them either have to move  around  or

even sit on the floor. `lopping it off is the fact

that  there is a lack of signboards, not  only  in

this area but also in the whole terminal, to guide

passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 1 am most concerned that with about 60

services  operating at the Singapore International

Airport  this  state of affairs should  have  been

allowed  to  remain.  Some of  the  areas  in  the

terminal  were  constructed  to  cater  for  small

domestic  flights  years ago. But  with  the  fast

growing air traffic and with affluent Singaporeans

going  abroad, the Singapore International Airport

should  expand and provide all necessary  services

and  facilities to cater for the growing needs  of

passengers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Friend, the Member for

Kampung Kapur, has already brought up some of  the

shortcomings   in   the  Singapore   International

Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waving gallery at the Paya Lebar Airport has

been  closed for some time, and no substitute  has

been  offered.  We  have come  to  a  stage  where

persons   cannot  even  send  off  their   friends

properly.  Our  airport must be  one  of  the  few

international  airports in  the  world  without  a

waving  gallery. As a result, the waiting hail  is

so   congested.   At  times,  the   situation   is

unbearable for those who wait in the hall. I would

like to invite the Minister to see for himself the

situation  at  the airport when the  pilgrims  are

being  sent  off to Mecca, or at any  other  time.

What   an  impression  we  are  creating  to   the

departing tourists, who have to squeeze their  way

through a mass of humanity in order to get to  the

departure  gate. It was only a year ago  that  the

waving gallery was opened, and yet so soon it  has

been  closed. Why has there been bad  planning  on

the  part  of the Airport authorities?  The  seats

provided  are shockingly few. Would  it  cost  too

much, or would it be too much to provide some more

seats?  This state of affairs in the international

airport is disgrace-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



ful and not in keeping with Singapore's good image

on tourists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year a sum of $250,000 was allocated for

the  resurfacing of the existing  runway.  But  it

seems  that only $20,000 was spent. This year  the

allocation  is ten times the amount  allocated  in

the  previous  year.  It  seems  to  me  that  the

resurfacing of the existing runway was not carried

out  last  year, it is no wonder that  the  Pilots

Association remarked that Singapore Airport is one

of  the worst as far as runway is concerned. It is

bumpy  and  uneven. This is very  bad.  Surely  an

international  airport in this  particular  region

cannot  afford to have a bumpy and uneven  surface

for  its runway. Now, may I ask if this allocation

of  $2,580,000 is going to be utilized  this  year

for  resurfacing the runway? Or are  we  going  to

just  leave it and have another reallocation  done

next year again?



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the new Air Freight Terminal a vote of $2

million was granted in 1974. Out of this, a sum of

$1,960,000  is  being revoted for this  year.  The

provision  for  a  new Passenger Terminal  was  $3

million  in  1974 and $2,990,000 is being  revoted

for  this year~ that means only $10,000 was spent.

The  provision for the new Boeing 747  Hangar  was

$7,000,000 last year and the amount to be  revoted

this  year  is $6,400,000. I do not know  why  the

revotes  are  reducing when costs  are  going  up.

Airport  Fire  Service, fire substation  $400,000,

revote $400,000. Not a single cent was spent. Now,

what  is  really going on at the airport?  Are  we

taking  votes and getting revotes or is  any  work

really  being carried out at the airport?  Surely,

when estimates are given a certain sum of money is

required, and the money must be utilized. I  think

something is definitely wrong somewhere.  So  many

revotes are being made. Obviously the money is not

being  used  and,  therefore, work  is  not  being

carried out at the airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a reply to a certain Member of Parliament

in  the  previous year the Minister stated that  a

second terminal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



would  be required for the Airport at Paya  Lebar.

Now,  with  this decrease in tourist  traffic,  is

this terminal building still under review? Or  are

we  going  ahead  with  the  construction  of  the

building,  irrespective of  the  decrease  in  the

number of tourist traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Economic Survey of Singapore for 1974

it   is  stated  that  the  tourist  traffic   has

increased a great deal as compared to the previous

year.  What  I  want  to know  is  this:  is  this

increase brought about by traffic through the Port

or  Airport  or  the Causeway?  Or  is  there  any

decrease in traffic in any particular terminal? If

so, why?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Airlines has indicated that it is

going  to purchase a number of jumbo jets to  cope

with  the  tourist traffic. May I  know  if  these

jumbo jets have already been purchased, or is  the

purchase  still in SIA's mind? If so,  may  1  ask

whether  it is a wise move to purchase them  at  a

time  when tourist traffic is declining throughout

the  whole  world,  because of increased  cost  of

freight,  fuel  charges,  and  increased  cost  of

maintenance  and operations of standard  aircraft.

Furthermore,  what  guarantee is  there  that  our

tourist traffic will increase in future because of

world inflationary trends?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, I too want to speak about the voting and

revoting  of Development Estimates in  respect  of

the  Paya  Lebar Airport. Though it has been  well

covered  by the Member for Anson, I would like  to

point out that I also looked through the Estimates

for  the  last financial year which  I  think  the

Member  for  Anson did not look  up.  Last  year's

estimates were revoted from the year before  last.

Perhaps  next  year we would not  have  to  revote

again,  and instead the lack of improvements  that

were  complained of by the Members for  Anson  and

Kampung Kapur would have been carried out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

regrettably true that after many of the  estimates

for Paya Lebar Airport had been voted, revotes had

to be asked for. The reason is that it has taken a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



long  time  to get all these development proposals

started.  They  are development proposals  really,

Sir,  and  plans have got to be drawn and checked.

First  of all, of course, costs have gone  up  and

then  we have to seek approval of the Ministry  of

Finance before we can proceed with tenders and  so

on.  And  this has been going on over a period  of

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> But the revotes are being reduced. The Minister

says that costs have increased. Why is it that the

revotes are reducing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Well, it is not as simple as building a house

which could probably be done in a few months,  and

everything  is  over.  Most of  these  development

projects  are of a continuing nature  and  stretch

over  a  number  of years. So if the  Ministry  of

Finance feels that a particular project would take

five  years  to  complete and that  for  the  next

financial year it is possible to spend,  say  only

one-fifth  of that amount, that is all  that  they

will  allocate for that item. I do not think it  a

mystery  for  certain figures to shrink  in  size,

because  physically neither the Ministry  nor  the

contractors will be able to make full use  of  the

funds  that  have  been  allocated.  That  is  the

position,   and  I  think  it  also  answers   the

criticism   of  the  Member  for  Telok   Blangah.

Invariably,   the  provision  in  the  Development

Estimates  is  not  fully spent  and  the  unspent

amount  need to be revoted, because if we  do  not

ask for a revote, then we would not get it at all.

We  are lucky if we even have a $10 token vote  to

keep  it  alive. So I do not think the Member  for

Anson need be too excited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasons for low spending, and perhaps sometimes of

over-estimation, are as follows.  There  has  been

delay  in  the clearance and resettlement  of  the

affected  squatters  on  those  sites  which   are

required  for development projects. I  think  hon.

Members  of  affected  areas, like  Punggol   and

Tampines, will understand the situation. We do not

just  evict the squatters. It is not just evicting

one  squatter  but hundreds of them and  sometimes

thousands, and we begin to move and hasten slowly.

Because  of  the  hindrance  from  squatters,  the

necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



site  preparation work and piling work  cannot  be

done as anticipated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the projects are being partly financed by

the  Asian Development Bank in Manila. And we have

to go through lengthy administrative clearances to

get  their  approval  before a particular  project

could get off the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, technical and staffing difficulties are

encountered  in  the preparation of  specification

and  contract documents. For example, in the  case

of  the long range surveillance radar project  and

the  ticketing wing extension, as mentioned by the

Member  for Kampung Kapur, and conversion  of  the

former   postal  sorting  office  all  these   are

involved in development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, technical problems arise affecting the

commissioning  of  equipment  and  radar   already

purchased  and  installed.  We  are  still  having

difficulties,   teething   troubles,   that   need

adjustments, and this takes time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, delay in the finalisation of detailed

design  drawings  on  tendered  documents  by  the

appointed   consultants, the   Northrop   Airport

Development  Corporation,  for  the   Boeing   747

hangar, the new air freight terminal building, the

fire   station  and  the  new  passenger  terminal

building and the new parking apron. All these  are

part   and  parcel  of  the  multi-million  dollar

projects which take not just months but years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all I can say is that every effort has been

made to get the development projects done. As  can

be   seen,  once  the  Development  Planning  Sub-Committee  approves  the plans certain  procedures

have to be complied with, and this takes time. But

every effort is being made to get them through  as

quickly  as  possible. These development  projects

amount to $21.6 million in this case. I think that

is  about  all I can answer really to the question

of  why there is so much money but nothing appears

to  be moving. Lots of things are moving. That  it

moves rather slowly, I agree.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's explanation, I beg

by $10 in respect of subhead EAA 1107 (The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ng Kah Ting and P. Govindaswamy).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Postal Services Department has a very

great  responsibility as it  handles  hundreds  of

thousands of mail for our people, commercial firms

and  factories. It is responsible for  the  timely

transmission  and  delivery  of  mail.   Generally

speaking,  and to be fair, I would  say  that  the

Postal Services have improved over the years.  But

unfortunately,  of course, there  are  still  some

shortcomings  which  need to  be  brought  to  the

attention   of   the  Minister.  The  shortcomings

include the delay or late delivery of letters.  In

my  personal experience sometime ago I had to wait

for  three  days  for a Government  letter  to  be

delivered  to me. Apparently there had  been  some

considerable delay. Delivery of local mail  should

be effected overnight. So I hope that the Minister

will  look into this matter and ensure that delays

should  be minimised, if not entirely avoided.  If

it  is  because  of  traffic congestion  or  staff

problems, I think something can be done  to  solve

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that certain postmen have not

conducted  themselves very well. I  have  received

complaints from my constituents that some  postmen

simply throw the letters about, instead of putting

them into the letter boxes or handing them through

the  doorway. Very often these letters are  thrown

on  the five-foot way or the corridor, This  is  a

very  bad  way of delivering letters  because  the

letters  would  then become soiled or  mislaid.  I

hope  the  Minister will look into the matter  and

take remedial action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not going to complain about

the  postmen  because they have a  difficult  job.

Among the Division IV employees, the postman's job

is  the most difficult one. Everyone must remember

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am going to talk about postwomen. It

was proudly publicised recently that postwomen are

now   being   employed  by  the  Postal   Services

Department   as   part   of   the   reorganisation

programme. It has been observed that some of these

postwomen   look   more  like  school   girls   in

kindergarten  uniforms. Recruiting  them  make  us

believe  that  they  can take  the  place  of  the

postmen.  But the postman has to carry a  35-pound

bag.  How can we ask the postwoman to carry a  bag

of the same weight? For a policewoman, we normally

see her standing on duty. But not the postwoman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had been working in the Postal Department,

and  my shoulder level has dropped by half an inch

on  one side because of carrying the post bag.  My

tailor  also told me that one of my shoulders  has

dropped a little. So if we ask the postwoman to do

the  same  job, it would be unfair. There  are  so

many  jobs in the Postal Department which  can  be

allotted  to them. Do not give equal  job  to  the

postwomen,  but give them equal pay, even  if  the

Postal  Services  Department has to  employ  post-women to meet the shortage of postmen.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister enlighten the House whether

any specific requirements are spelt out in respect

of  height, build and weight when a recruitment is

carried  out? Is the Minister aware that a  number

of  these  postwomen are not able to ride bicycles

made  available to them because they  cannot  even

reach the bicycle pedal?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also observed that these girls often hold

the  peak cap in one hand when delivering mail  in

the  street.  This could be because they  want  to

shield  their faces from recognition,  or  because

they  are embarrassed having to put on the awkward

looking peak cap.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister tell us whether the present

postwomen are as efficient and able as the postmen

in the sorting and delivering of mail? Is the work

of  the  postwomen as demanding  as  that  of  the

postmen? Are we not a party to the hazard faced by

these girls on the dangerous roads?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I must congratulate the Member for Anson for

being  so  chivalrous  at his  age,  watching  and

observing the behaviour of our post-women.  He  is

certainly a young man at heart!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the high turnover in the postman's

grade and to provide more employment opportunities

for our women in the Republic, the Postal Services

Department  made  the move to  recruit  postwomen.

They  have  been recruited through the  Employment

Exchange.  In  view of the nature of their  duties

the  Special Committee in the Ministry  of  Labour

has  been  requested  to  supply  candidates  with

robust physique for appointment to this grade.  At

present there are 18 postwomen in service,  and  I

may  as  well  indicate where they are;  otherwise

every  one  will  think  that  our  postwomen  are

carrying  mails.  Eight are  on  bicycle  delivery

beats.  As it has been indicated that some of  the

bicycles are probably too high for them, we  hope

at the next financial year to get bicycles fit for

women; probably half the size if the postwomen are

of  small stature. In the mail collection section,

there  is one on van driving duty; parcel delivery

duty,  one;  indoor duty at the Mails and  Parcels

Centre.  Nelson  Road,  one;  and  seven  on  foot

delivery beats. The complaint is that they have to

carry  too heavy mail bags. The Postmaster-General

has  indicated that these bags will be reduced  in

size to suit their physique.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the peak caps, the Member for Anson

complains  that they are holding them  instead  of

wearing  them. These are interim arrangements  and

action  is being taken by the Department to supply

our postwomen with suitable peak caps, similar  to

those used by the Republic's policewomen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that all our post-women who have

been  recruited are generally satisfied with their

job  and working conditions. Arrangements will  be

made  with  the  Registry of Vehicles  to  conduct

Highway  Code  courses for our postwomen  so  that

they  can  be  employed on scooter  delivery,  and

perhaps  we  may  be  able to do  away  with  foot

delivery  for our postwomen. And we will  continue

to employ as many postwomen as there are vacancies

hereafter.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister said that our postwomen may be

employed   on  scooter  delivery.  This   may   be

dangerous. If you allow the post-women to  deliver

by scooter and if registered parcels and mails are

lost  on  delivery in the rural areas, then  there

will be more trouble.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am grateful to the Member for Anson for his

concern, and I assure him that this matter will be

looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the Member for Sembawang. He

expressed concern for the delay in the delivery of

mails.  Delays  in delivery can happen  under  the

following circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, incomplete, poor or illegible addressing

of  mail.  Incorrect addressing of  mail  includes

writing   the   wrong  postal   district   number.

Sometimes, due to seasonal peak periods, it  takes

a  bit  longer to deliver mail than for  a  normal

day. Of course, it is possible that our own postal

workers  could  have put the mail into  the  wrong

sorting  box,  and hence incorrectly delivered  by

the  delivery postmen. Under normal circumstances,

mails  can  take up from two to three days  to  be

delivered to the correct address, if posted  on  a

Friday,  Saturday  or  on  the  eve  of  a  public

holiday.  Normally  it  is  possible  to  have  an

overnight delivery, if posted in Singapore. I have

already explained how it is possible for mails  to

be delivered late for a variety of reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, perhaps I might say that the

Postal Services Department has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



a  workforce of only 400 postmen, and they have to

deliver  no  less than 173 million items  of  mail

each  year,  or  an average of more  than  half  a

million  items  each  day.  Errors  may  therefore

occur,  as  in the postal service of any  country.

This does not, of course, mean that inefficient or

irresponsible  mail delivery is  condoned  by  our

Postal  Services  Department.  So  if  there   are

complaints   I  would  appreciate   it   if   such

complaints are lodged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there have been no complaints

from  Sembawang constituency for a long time.  The

Member  for Sembawang, however, did mention  about

discourtesy on the part of postmen in the delivery

of  mail. He said that they threw the mail on  the

floor.  Here again, unless a complaint is  lodged,

we  can do little about it because all postmen and

postwomen  are  being told how to  behave  and  to

extend courtesy, and what the correct procedure is

and  methods of delivery of mail. If  we  get  any

report  of  improper conduct on the  part  of  our

postmen or postwomen, it would initially take  the

form  of caution if found guilty, and such conduct

will  be  noted  down.  If the  postman  concerned

should  persistently repeat these  irregularities,

he will be considered for more severe disciplinary

action   under  the  Public  Service  Disciplinary

Proceedings (Delegation of Functions) Rules, 1970,

or  the  Public  Service Disciplinary  Regulations

1970, as appropriate.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On a point of clarification. I am not objecting

to  the recruitment of postwomen. I am telling the

Minister  to  provide  our postwomen  with  easier

jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it is difficult to increase the efficiency of

the  Postal Services Department because there  are

only  400  postmen to handle 173 million items  of

mail. I hope the Minister can ask for more postmen

so   as   to  increase  the  efficiency   of   the

Department. I also agree that we can recruit  more

postwomen as they are suitable for the job and can

serve us more courteously.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead FAA l108 (The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Teong Eng Siong, Ang Nam Piau, P. Govindaswamy, Chin Harn Tong, N. Govindasamy and Ivan Baptist).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two points to raise. First, I would

like to refer to the question of smoky buses. Last

year  the  Minister posed the problem - either  we

have  smoky buses to carry passengers or  we  look

after  the smoky exhausts and have fewer buses  on

the  road.  The  inevitable  answer  to  that,  of

course,  was  that  we had to  have  smoky  buses.

However,  I  am  sure that by this time,  after  a

passage  of one year and with so many improvements

in  the bus service, this problem would have  been

solved  to  some extent. It is important  that  we

take  a more and more serious view of the presence

of  smoky  buses on the road. Tolerance  of  lower

standards   of  control  of  emission  of   smoke,

especially where SBS is concerned, means retarding

the  progress of our anti-pollution campaign.  How

can we take measures against one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>





sector  for  air pollution and do not take  proper

measures against another sector?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give one illustration of smoke on the road, one

need  only  to  take the instance  of  our  school

children jogging by the side of the road  as  part

of    their   extra-curricular   activities.   Not

infrequently   I   have  noticed   passing   heavy

vehicles, mostly buses, emitting smoke right  into

the  midst of these children doing their exercise.

How healthy is it for such children to breathe  in

heavily  polluted atmosphere on the road?  I  know

that  action has indeed been taken in  respect  of

smoky buses. If fines have been imposed on the SBS

for  smoky  buses,  further  penalties  should  be

imposed. They are making money. So I think we  can

be strict in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another matter, I would like to

draw the attention of the Registrar of Vehicles to

the  inadequate enforcement of traffic regulations

in   respect   of   heavy   commercial   vehicles,

especially Malaysian registered vehicles. In  many

places in Singapore, especially along Dunearn Road

and  Bukit  Timah  Road,  large  lorries  carrying

timber and vegetables at all times of the day,  do

not pay any heed to traffic regulations. They know

that  they  can  get away with it  because  it  is

difficult  to  impose measures against  them.  The

more  they  realise this, the more  flagrantly  do

they  flout  the  law. I do  not  think  that  any

vigorous action taken against these vehicles  will

necessarily sour up relations with Malaysia, for I

am sure they are not allowed to behave in this way

on  their own roads in Malaysia. May I, therefore,

urge the competent authority to take proper action

against  these  vehicles to discourage  them  from

this insolent act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a certain

problem  relating  to the taxi  drivers.  The  ROV

Traffic  Police  are  very discourteous  in  their

attitude  towards taxi drivers,  and  have  always

made things difficult for them. They are very rude

and always carry out spot-checks on taxis. They do

not want to listen to the complaints of the taxi



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>



drivers.  And  while checking the taxis,  if  they

cannot  find any fault with the engine, they  will

say  that the taxi is emitting obnoxious smoke and

then  order the taxi driver to drive his  taxi  to

the  ROV  compound for a further check there.  And

only  if they cannot find anything wrong with  the

taxi  will they allow the taxi driver to go  home.

Thus, the taxi drivers have wasted their time  and

as  a result lost their earnings. Is it reasonable

to treat the taxi drivers in this way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past I have also complained about spot-checking of taxis by the Traffic Police. Taxis

have  to be inspected and checked every six months

if  they are to ply on the road. This is to ensure

that  every  taxi  on  the  road  is  in  a  sound

condition. If the Traffic Police continues to spot

check  taxis  all the time, this is tantamount  to

creating  difficulties for the  taxi  drivers.  We

should not allow this to go on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is that the

ROV  Traffic Police have been unreasonable towards

taxi drivers. One taxi driver complained to me one

day  that  he received a summons from the  Traffic

Police stating that he had committed three traffic

offences. One of the charges was that the taxi was

parked in a taxi stand. If a taxi is not parked at

a  taxi  stand, where else can it be  parked?  The

second  charge  was  that  the  taxi  driver   had

switched  off his taxi meter. He told  me  that  a

passenger  wanted to go to a shop to buy something

and  the  taxi meter then showed the  fare  to  be

$1.80 and as he was supposed to be waiting he  was

not  supposed to switch off the meter.  The  third

charge  was  that the taxi driver was not  sitting

inside the taxi while waiting. He was at that time

standing  by the taxi. There was no need  for  the

Traffic  Police  to worry about the  taxi  "flying

off".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the taxi driver received such a summons with

all  these  unreasonable charges,  he  was  really

flabbergasted.  He  went at once  to  the  ROV  to

explain the situation and the officer accepted his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



explanation to withdraw the summons but he  wanted

the taxi driver to go to court to have the summons

squashed. This means that half a day's earning  is

lost  for the poor taxi driver. These unreasonable

charges  and  summonses  are  quite  numerous.   I

attribute  this to the fact that some of  the  ROV

Traffic  Policemen are either  not  aware  of  the

regulations  or they are just deliberately  trying

to  he difficult with the taxi drivers. That being

the  case I would like to ask the Minister to look

into  the matter very seriously and to get rid  of

all the black sheep in the ROV Traffic Police.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, many people have told me that

there  are far too few taxis in Singapore. I think

this  is  quite  possible  because  from  personal

experience  I have to wait for a taxi for  a  very

long time. On several occasions I have to wait for

as  long as 15 to 30 minutes before I could get  a

taxi. I have also come across empty taxis refusing

to  pick up fares even if they were to raise their

hand to request the drivers to stop. There are yet

other  taxi  drivers who stop in response  to  the

hand  signal  but they say that they cannot  drive

the  passengers to certain places. So  again  they

refuse to pick up the fare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Government should not allow this

situation  to  continue. The  authority  concerned

should exercise greater control over taxi drivers.

Furthermore,  it  is  my considered  opinion  that

there  is  a  real shortage of taxis in Singapore.

Otherwise  one does not have to wait for  so  long

before one can get a taxi. For the convenience  of

the  general  public.  I hope  the  Minister  will

consider issuing more taxi licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, lorries carrying sand, earth or

granite  chips  quite often spill  their  contents

onto  the  road. This is not only a very dangerous

practice  but  it also dirties the road  as  well.

Furthermore, these granite chips may even  shatter

the  windscreen of a passing car and thereby cause

unnecessary  accident.  It  is  high   time   that

legislation  was  introduced to provide  that  all

lorries carrying earth, sand or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>



granite chips should be covered with tarpaulin, as

is  the  practice of all lorries carrying rubbish.

It is not a very difficult piece of legislation to

introduce.  Neither is it going to  cost  a  great

deal to these transport operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the introduction of the bus lane, how

many  persons  have  been prosecuted  so  far  for

causing  obstruction during the peak  period?  Far

too many drivers have violated this regulation  by

driving  in  bus  lanes and cause  obstruction  to

buses during the stipulated times. How far is this

being controlled?



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the park and ride scheme is being monitored

by  the  whole world. It is no doubt a  very  good

scheme.  It is well thought and well planned.  How

successful  it will be is left to be seen.  It  is

our  hone  that it will be a success. The Minister

for   Communications  must  be  congratulated  for

introducing  this  scheme  with  the   object   of

reducing traffic congestion in the city during the

peak   hours.  But  personally  I   have   a   few

forebodings  about  the  park  and  ride   scheme.

Firstly,  motorists entering the CBD between  7.30

a.m, and 9.30 a.m, have to pay a $3 entrance  fee

per  vehicle.  Secondly,  businessmen  can  easily

afford  to  pay  this amount  and  enter  the  CBD

without  any trouble at all because all they  need

do  is  to show their receipt and claim the  money

that  they  have paid. So this partly defeats  the

scheme.  Thirdly,  motorists  can  enter  the  CBD

before  7.30 am, or after 9.30 am., and this  will

create  congestion to the same degree  as  we  are

experiencing  now.  Although  we  can  charge  the

motorists $3 per vehicle when they enter the  city

area,  what happens when they leave the city?  The

congestion  and the traffic jam will still  remain

the same. The problem is not solved. Should we not

extend  this scheme? The scheme is no  doubt  very

good  in  concept but it has got  to  be  properly

checked.  Singaporeans are a  very  adaptable  and

flexible  people. That is why we are a  successful

nation. If 7.30 a.m, is the time for the scheme to

be  effective, then all one has to do is to go  to

the city either before 7.30 a.m, or after 9.30 am.

How



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>



many  cars will, in fact, be reduced in this  way?

Further,  aggravation  and  frustration  will   be

caused in the evening when people leave the  city.

So the congestion will still be there. If there is

any  change,  it  will  be too  negligible  to  be

noticed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too many people in Singapore own cars as a status

symbol, and too many of them enter the city for no

particular  purpose.  Even  if  they  do  have   a

particular  purpose, it is of not much importance.

We  should  try and discourage people from  owning

cars  and  we should discourage them from entering

the city unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally I feel that the increased road tax

is  not  a  proper deterrent to car ownership.  It

would  be  far better to increase the tax  on  new

cars so as to make it prohibitive to own a car. In

this way the increase in the number of cars can be

controlled  to a greater extent, and those  people

who  buy cars as a status symbol would have second

thoughts about doing so. Further, households  with

more than one car should pay a special tax on  the

additional   cars  that  they   own.   This   will

discourage two-car or three-car families. In fact,

the  trend in modern cities is to reduce vehicular

traffic  as much as possible and to give the  city

back  to the pedestrian. Let us give our city back

to the pedestrian to whom it rightly belongs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is now going to

introduce  the area licence fee for the  park  and

ride  scheme. All right, if everyone pays for  the

licence, what happens? The same congestion will be

there.  They will say, "I will pay $60."  Everyone

buys the licence at $60. What happens? So what  is

the  Minister going to do to reduce congestion  of

traffic in the city areas?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, after having ruled for 16 years, the

Government  has  achieved  excellent  results   in

looking  after  the  interest  of  the  people  in

general. However, it does not mean that there  are

no shortcomings. In fact, if we are to look around

carefully, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>



will  be able to notice them clearly. One of  them

relates to the question of taxi-driving licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my understanding, at present there

are  about  15,000 licensed taxi drivers  but  the

number  of  taxis on the roads is only  5,000.  In

other  words,  a few thousand people holding  taxi

drivers' licences have little or no opportunity to

drive  taxis. Of course, I am not blaming the  ROV

officers  in charge for this situation.  In  fact,

the  reason for this situation is that many  years

ago  the  Authorities concerned had not been  very

strict  in  the  issue of taxi drivers'  licences.

Since  this  disproportionately excess  number  of

taxi drivers is evident, the ROV has got no reason

not  to face the issue squarely. Because of  this,

certain  problems have arisen. We  have  got  some

people who hold licences but are unemployed or are

unable   to  get  taxis  to  drive  as  a   proper

occupation, even if they want to. Secondly,  there

are  people who already have a full-time  job  but

because they also hold taxi drivers' licences they

do taxi driving as a part-time job. Thirdly, there

are people who already have permanent jobs and  do

not  drive taxis at present but because they  hold

taxi  drivers' licences they continue to hold such

licences  in case they may want to drive taxis  in

future.  Perhaps, ROV officials are not  aware  of

the  effects caused by such a situation.  And,  in

fact, this is a situation which causes concern and

sympathy. Those with full-time jobs and  who  take

up  taxi driving as a part-time employment usually

do   so  after  their  full  day's  work.  In  the

circumstances, they are bound to be exhausted  and

inefficient  in  their driving.  Their  consequent

lack  of  concentration may pose  another  traffic

hazard  on  the public thoroughfares. They  are  a

danger  to  themselves and  to  other  road  users

because  they  may cause accidents, perhaps  fatal

accidents  involving  their  passengers  or  other

persons at any moment anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year the Government

launched  a  campaign to keep  Singapore  accident

free. The Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>



of  Communications has also frequently stressed on

road  safety. But surprisingly, nothing  has  been

done in respect of such part-time taxi drivers who

may  endanger  the lives of their  passengers  and

other road users. On the other hand, because  some

taxis  are  taken  up  by  these  part-time   taxi

drivers, those genuine taxi drivers who depend  on

driving  taxis  for  a  living  find  that   their

livelihood  is  in  great jeopardy.  If  they  are

unemployed,  and  cannot get any  taxis  to  drive

because  there are more drivers than  taxis,  this

situation  induces  the taxi  owners  to  be  more

haughty  and  overbearing towards  them  and  even

exploit  them, thus causing even greater  hardship

to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

propose  to the ROV that holders of taxi  drivers'

licences   who  have  other  forms  of   full-time

employment and who drive taxis as a part-time job,

or those who hold taxi driving licences but do not

depend on taxi driving for a living, should not be

allowed  to renew their licences after  expiry.  I

also  propose  that taxi owners who do  not  drive

their   own  taxis  should  have  their   licences

cancelled. This is to ensure that those  who  hold

taxi  licences but do not have taxis to drive have

a  chance to earn a living. If we can do this,  we

will  be able to look after the livelihood of  the

taxi drivers more extensively and more fairly. Our

policy should be to help the majority in need, and

not to enrich those who are already well off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may read in the newspapers about complaints by

some  passengers. I have also received  complaints

from  some passengers that when they hail an empty

taxi,  the  taxi driver refuses to  stop.  We,  of

course,  agree that severe action should be  taken

against  those  taxi drivers who  refuse  to  stop

their  taxis without good reasons. But  there  are

cases when taxi drivers do not stop their vehicles

for some good reason. For example, when there is a

change  of  shifts  or when  they  are  called  by

telephone to fetch some passenger somewhere,  then

they will not be able to stop their vehicles half-way to pick up other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>



passengers.  So  when  a complaint  is  made,  the

traffic  authorities  do not  consider  all  these

reasons.   They  invariably  condemn  these   taxi

drivers  for  the alleged offence of  refusing  to

pick  short-trip  passengers.  However,  the  taxi

driver's  argument is, "Since I did not  stop  the

taxi  at  all how could I know that the  passenger

was  going  to take a short-journey?" People  also

accuse taxi drivers for refusing to pick up fares.

But  the drivers say, "We are earning a living  on

the  road,  so  why should we refuse  to  pick  up

passengers  without good reason?" In  fact,  their

argument  is quite reasonable. However, to  ensure

that  there  is  no  further  misunderstanding  or

groundless blame against the taxi drivers and that

no unnecessary trouble is caused to members of the

public,  why  not  let  the  ROV  stipulate   that

whenever  a taxi is unable to pick up a  passenger

along   the   way,   a  sign  with   the   wording

"Temporarily not for hire" should be conspicuously

displayed on the taxi. I hope that the authorities

concerned will consider my suggestion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a Parliament sitting last year, I said that

suitable arrangements should be made on that  side

of  the  road  opposite the special bus  lanes  to

enable public vehicles which are not permitted  to

use  the  bus  lanes  to stop  there  to  pick  up

passengers or to allow passengers to alight during

busy  hours.  But the Minister in charge  did  not

give me a direct answer. I would like to point out

again that this regulation on bus lanes introduced

by the Ministry of Communications is causing great

inconvenience   to  taxi  and  bus   drivers   and

passengers. In order to avoid in-convenience, many

passengers  have refused to travel  by  taxis  and

buses. Therefore, in order to suit the convenience

of  the passengers, some drivers have to risk  the

offence of stopping their vehicles on the side  of

the road where a yellow line is drawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, traffic fines have increased

following  inflation. Moreover, implementation  of

the   Points  Demerit  System  may  deprive  these

workers of their rice bowl at any moment. There-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>



fore,  I  would  appeal to the Minister  again  to

reconsider the provision of suitable stops for the

convenience of passengers and drivers of taxis and

buses.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Sir, on the question of buses emitting excessive

smoke,  steps  have  been  taken  to  reduce  this

nuisance and hazard. All buses are now required to

undergo monthly preventive maintenance at the  bus

depots  where special attention is paid to rectify

those buses with smoky exhausts. Smoke meters  are

now    available   in   all   the   bus    depots.

Unfortunately,  it  would take  some  time  before

smoky buses are totally eradicated from our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems involved can be fully appreciated if

its  causes  are fully understood. Smoky  exhausts

can  be  caused  by  mechanical failure,  such  as

faulty  injectors or fuel pumps. These  mechanical

faults  can  be  rectified during  the  preventive

maintenance or whenever such cases are brought  to

the attention of the company. Unfortunately, there

are  other  factors  causing  the  buses  to  emit

excessive  smoke  and they require  some  time  to

rectify. Excessive smoke can be emitted when buses

are  running  with  a  full  passenger  load,  and

especially  when  going  up  an  incline,  not  to

mention when the bus is overloaded. Another  cause

is  attributable to poor driving habits when gears

are  not changed in accordance with engine  speed,

or when excessive fuel is injected by heavy-footed

drivers, thus resulting in incomplete combustion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding heavily loaded buses emitting excessive

smoke, this problem can be stringently dealt  with

when  more  buses are available to meet the  heavy

peak-hour  demand  for public buses.  As  for  bad

driving  habits, this will require a slow  process

of educating the drivers to change their habits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the other point raised by the

Member   for  Anson  earlier  regarding  irregular

frequency,  I  would like to inform him  that  the

frequency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>



of  bus  services  is  now  slightly  better  than

previously,  although  there  is  still  room  for

further  improvement. There are  now  1,500  buses

operating  daily compared to 1,400 buses operating

in  April last year. To further improve frequency,

the company has taken the following steps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, split shift work was introduced on the

10th  of this month to put more buses on the  road

during peak hours.



It  is  expected  that about 60  additional  buses

would be put on the road under this scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a traffic research unit has been formed

to  monitor  actual times required to  complete  a

round-trip at various times of the day.  When  the

results are known, existing time schedules will be

changed, and the new ones strictly enforced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, enforcement squads of the company have

also stepped up their enforcement measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the complaint of poor frequency especially

in  the  rural areas, I would like to  inform  the

Member that the company has placed an order for 81

short-wheel-based  buses which would  be  suitable

for  use  in these areas where the roads  are  too

narrow for the jumbos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another step which the company is planning to take

to improve frequency is to post traffic regulators

at certain strategic points to regulate the timing

of  bus  services. The enforcement  officers  will

take down the timing and will also he empowered to

withhold  buses, if necessary, when they see  more

than one bus on the same service route arriving at

the  same spot at the same time. They are also  to

ensure  that  interruption  of  bus  services   is

reduced to the minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also complained about oil

spillage at the bus terminals. It is true that the

bus  terminals  are  not very  clean  due  to  oil

smudges caused by the spillage of diesel fuel  and

cylinder oil as well as minor repairs carried  out

at the terminals. Action has already been taken to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>



ensure  that the fuel tanks are fixed with  proper

caps  which  are  to be chained  to  the  tank  to

prevent  loss. For the information of the  Member,

all  new  buses purchased after January 1974  have

been  fitted with irremovable fuel tank  caps.  As

for  the oil spillage due to oil leakage from  the

gear  boxes  and  rear  axle,  this  can  only  be

eradicated  when the maintenance standard  of  the

buses  is  raised  to  a  higher  level  with  the

introduction  of  the schedule  preventive  scheme

expected  to be introduced sometime in  June  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also touched on the poor condition of

buses  on the road. Although the general condition

of  buses has improved quite considerably,  it  is

regrettably  true that a few buses which  are  not

very  clean or are dirty after a heavy shower  are

still seen on the road. But it must be appreciated

that a bus, dirtied as a result of a heavy shower,

needs time to be cleaned, and other than taking it

off  the  road,  it  has to  keep  to  its  roster

schedule.  However, the company  has  ordered  two

automatic washing machines, and they are now being

installed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also touched on broken windows, torn

seats  and  leaking  roofs.  These  problems   are

expected  to  be  rectified  sometime  this  year,

presumably  in  three to four months'  time,  when

more buses will be repaired under a special scheme

whereby  buses could be farmed out for repairs  by

reliable contractors. Perhaps the Member must have

read in the newspapers that on average about 3.000

seats are replaced by the company every month.  In

this instance, the bus company has also launched a

special  scheme  known  as  "Friends  of  SBS"  to

encourage  public-spirited commuters to  help  the

company  reduce  damage to  bus  seats  caused  by

vandalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's comment that the spare parts

are  "all over the place", I would like to  inform

the Member that 1 visit the bus company regularly,

and  so  far I have not come across the  situation

that  he  has described. If he would let  me  know

exactly where he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>



has  seen it, I would be very grateful and  I  can

assure him that I will look into that personally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other points raised, the Minister for

Communications will answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the spare parts, the

Minister  of State can see this at Upper  Aljunied

Road.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the House has already

been  fully  informed  about  the  criticisms  and

complaints against the Singapore Bus Service  Ltd.

after  listening  to two Members  who  are  deeply

involved  with  the affairs of SBS.  Firstly,  the

Member for Boon Teck has admitted that he had been

keeping  quiet for the last two years  because  of

the overwhelming problems that confronted him.  He

is  a  member  of  the Bus Services Reorganisation

Committee  which was formed in October  1973  just

when   the   Singapore  Bus   Service   Ltd, was

established.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Minister of State, has just now

tried  to  answer the criticisms, and he  is  best

suited to do so as he is concurrently the Chairman

of the Executive Committee of the SBS since August

1974. The complaints that have been listed out  by

the  Members for Sembawang and Anson and of  smoky

exhaust  by  the  Member for Katong  are  not  new

complaints.  They have been voiced in  this  House

for quite some years. Great efforts have been made

to  improve the situation and, of course, some  of

them  are  hardy  enough to persist.  But  we  can

assure  them and the public that every  effort  is

being made, as far as is humanly possible, to  put

things  right. So I do not propose to  go  further

into the matter as I shall, before winding up  the

debate  on this particular subhead on the Registry

of  Vehicles, have something more to say, not only

on SBS but of public transport in general.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now attempt to answer the various matters

raised  by  Members in this House. The Member  for

Anson   complained  about  spilling   by   lorries

carrying  earth, sand, etc., which  has  been  the

cause  of a number of accidents. I can assure  him

that  the matter will be looked into, and it would

appear  that this comes under the purview  of  the

Ministry of the Environment. We shall look further

into  this  matter  and, if  necessary,  introduce

legislation to control this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong has something to say about

the  work  of our enforcement squad. He mentioned,

in  particular, heavy goods vehicles from Malaysia

emitting  smoke and infringing traffic regulations

in  Singapore. I would like to say two  things.  I

myself  have instructed the ROV to look into  this

matter  some  months ago, and it is  being  looked

into.  But  may I just say that there are  certain

difficulties because of the shortage of  staff  in

respect  of  this  particular department.  He  has

received a written answer (Hansard, Vol. 34, No. 6, cols. 461-2) from my colleague,  the Minister for Home Affairs, which was tabled only a

few  days  ago, wherein it was indicated that  the

ROV  enforcement  squad,  which  has  an  approved

establishment  of 67, has only 42  personnel.  The

ROV  enforcement squad is actually an offshoot  of

the   Traffic  Police  in  the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs.  So  we  have,  therefore,  only  60%  of

authorised   strength.   Despite   this   strained

staffing  position, the ROV enforcement squad  has

been  able to maintain a reasonably high level  of

performance, not just on smoky exhausts but  other

duties as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the period January 1974 to February 1975,

the  squad  as a whole submitted no less  than  an

average  of 1,600 reports monthly. Over  the  last

two months, January and February of this year, the

enforcement  squad  made 4,200 and  3,400  reports

respectively, which averages about 100 reports per

man.  In  these circumstances, I hope it  will  be

appreciated  that  they are stretching  themselves

far and wide, and there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>



is  always a limit to what a human being can do  I

can  assure  him that we will continue to  enforce

the  regulations as far as it is humanly  possible

before  getting  a complaint from the  Member  for

Sembawang who says that our enforcement squad is a

bit  too  strict on taxi drivers. So we can  never

please  everybody. If we attempt to  please  A,  B

complains.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Please the right people!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Sembawang has this to say about

taxi  drivers: that in view of the fact that taxis

have   got  to  undergo  a  six-month  inspection,

therefore  it  would be unnecessary  to  check  on

smoky  exhausts. I think the Member is quite aware

that  taxis are very heavily used and if they  are

not  well  maintained  even  after  the  six-month

inspection, then probably within a week or a month

they are very likely to have smoky exhausts again.

I  am  afraid that, despite the regular  six-month

inspection of taxis, if it is reported  that  taxi

XYZ   is  found  to  be  emitting  visible   smoke

unreasonably, then  it will  have  to  report  in

again,  not immediately but after a bit  of  time.

And  this is where, after getting the summons, the

taxi  driver goes to the repair shop, gets it well

done  up  and turns up at the ROV. And, of course,

it  passes the test. So it cannot be said that  it

is  unreasonable to pull them up. But we are happy

that the taxi driver, after getting the summons to

appear  for  an  inspection as  a  result  of  the

complaint  of  a  smoky exhaust, has  put  matters

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the complaint of the Member for

Thomson. He says he has experienced difficulty  in

getting  taxis. I can confirm that this  has  been

the  position for some time. It is true. I do  not

deny  that.  But there may be certain reasons  for

the shortage. I think we can do no better than  to

look  at this morning's newspaper. The Member  for

Aljunied  had occasion to censure certain  members

of  Comfort for failing to let out their taxis  to

relief drivers. All taxis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>



could  be  used for two shifts. But  some  Comfort

members  prefer to sit on their back side and  not

let   their   taxis   out,  except   for   certain

undesirable  practices. So there is an  artificial

shortage  of taxis created by taxi owners  who  do

not  wish  to  have their taxis operating  on  two

shifts or even three shifts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to that, I would say this. We have agreed

that the NTUC Comfort should have all new licences

for  taxis. But at the moment they are to get only

an additional 200 taxis on the road. In my view  I

think  there should be more taxis. For some reason

or  other, NTUC prefers not to have too many taxis

operating because in 1971, after the bus  services

reorganisation, taxi business was not so  good  so

that  the  taxi drivers suffered a drop  in  their

income.  So  NTUC  does not want  that  to  happen

again.  I would persuade the NTUC to expand  their

fleet   as   quickly  as  possible,  because   all

available  new  licences will  be  given  to  NTUC

Comfort. I think the remedy is in the hands of the

NTUC Comfort. Of course there are times when there

is  a  change of shift, from Shift I to Shift  II,

sometime  between 3.30 p.m, and 5.00  p.m.  It  is

very  likely that the Member for Thomson hailed  a

taxi when it was changing shift, and so the driver

said, "Sorry, I am on my way home."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):Point of clarification, Sir. The complaint that

taxis fail to stop when hailed does not come  from

me  alone.  The Members for Paya Lebar and  Jurong

also had the same experience. The Minister can ask

them. So it is not just something that happened to

me.  Moreover,  it  is  not  that  such  incidents

happened just during shift changing. Sometimes  it

happened  at  2.00  p.m, and  sometimes  in   the

morning. So those occasions could not occur during

the time when the drivers were changing shifts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am grateful for the

clarification. I have agreed that there appears to

be  a  shortage of taxis, and I am saying to  NTUC

Comfort, "Please get on with it." I am only trying

to give certain possible reasons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>



why  if  you hail a taxi, the driver ignores  you,

and that is because of a change of shift.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has quite a lot to say

because  he is directly involved in the management

of  NIUC Comfort. I am pleased to say that he  has

made  a  great contribution in the solving of  our

transport problem. He has raised the question  why

the  Registry of Vehicles continues to allow those

who  are  not  in  full-time  employment  as  taxi

drivers to renew their taxi licences.

According to our records, as at January this  year

there were a total of 14,390 licensed taxi drivers

as  against 5,174 taxis. Based on the ratio  of  2

1/2  drivers to one taxi, assuming that each  taxi

would  be  used  for two shifts - he  himself  has

admitted  publicly that not all  taxis  are  being

used  for  two  shifts - we need only  12,910  taxi

drivers  for  these  5,174  taxis.  There   would,

therefore,  be  theoretically a surplus  of  1,480

taxi drivers' licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he has a point there when he said that if

a  person who has a full-time employment  holds  a

taxi  driver's licence, he is depriving a man  who

would like to be a taxi driver by profession.  The

Member  must  be  aware that since September  last

year  the  Registry of Vehicles has  been  holding

monthly  meetings, and the people who are  invited

to   attend   these   monthly   meetings   include

representatives  from  the  Traffic  Police,   the

Singapore   Taxi   Transport   Association,    the

Singapore  Taxi  Drivers'  Association  and   NTUC

Comfort. These meetings have been held to  discuss

matters concerning taxi operation, the conduct  of

drivers  and  other  related  problems.  I  would,

therefore,  ask  the Member if he  could  be  good

enough  to  raise  these issues at  these  monthly

meetings  and  perhaps a happy solution  could  be

brought about.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member next raised the query about not having

got  an  answer from me last year on why Scheme  A

buses are not given the privilege to use bus lanes

during  the  peak hours. I thought the reason  was

given, but may I now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>



say so in full. Scheme A vehicles consist not only

of  school buses but also vehicles like mini-buses

and  lorries,  and  under this  scheme  the  Adult

Workers  Contract  Licences  are  issued  to   the

operators.  Unlike  the SBS and  Scheme  B  buses,

Scheme A buses operate in such a way as to pick up

and  set  down  passengers at  certain  designated

points  and  not  along  public  roads.  Since  we

introduced  the  bus lanes as a new  measure  from

February  last  year we could not throw  open  the

reserved  bus lanes for all types of vehicles.  At

the  moment,  SBS buses and Scheme B buses  number

2,580.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the park and ride scheme comes into operation

in May, about 88 shuttle buses will also use these

bus  lanes. I would prefer allowing the  park  and

ride  scheme  and  the  area licensing  scheme  to

operate  first  before  we review  further  as  to

whether Scheme A buses may be permitted to use bus

lanes. I hope this answer would satisfy the Member

for  Aljunied - that the matter will be considered

at the right time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the points raised by the Member for

Anson   who   wishes  to  know   that   with   the

introduction  of the reserved bus lanes  how  many

people  have  been called up for contravening  the

regulations. I have some figures here. Up  to  the

end of February 1975, that is to say, for the last

13  months since it came into operation,  no  less

than   2,700  persons  were  issued  with  written

warnings for unauthorised use of bus lanes  during

the  restrictive  hours. We  have  not  taken  any

action because we felt that we should give it some

time  before applying the heavy hand. As everybody

knows,  since the 1st day of this month the points

demerit system has come into operation, and anyone

who  enters  the  reserved bus  lanes  during  the

restrictive  hours  will be  penalised  with  four

demerit   points.  I  think  this  should   be   a

sufficient  penalty, and if they commit  the  same

offence  thrice  over they will be  suspended  and

their  vehicles might even be expropriated. So  we

will allow the points demerit system to operate to

show the efficacy of the reserved bus lanes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I come to the park and ride scheme raised

by  the Member for Anson. He has misgivings  about

this  scheme. 1 have already indicated in my reply

to  the  hon. Member for Toa Payoh that we believe

that  the  implementation of  the  park  and  ride

scheme  and the area licensing scheme will have  a

significant effect in reducing traffic  congestion

on our roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, it may be recalled that at

this  time  last year, during the  debate  on  the

estimates  for  the Registry of Vehicles  for  the

financial  year  l974-75,  I  had  indicated,  as

reported in Hansard, of 20th March, 1974 [Vol. 33,

col. 466] as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Measures have been and will continue to be taken

to   provide  an  adequate  public  bus   service,

supplemented  where necessary with other  feasible

forms  of  public or group transport.  However,  a

public transport system cannot operate efficiently

if  it is not protected from the congestion caused

by  private cars in central areas, on high-density

routes  and  in peak-hour traffic. If the  traffic

congestion  cannot  be  eased  through   voluntary

means,  such  as  staggered  work-hours  and   the

formation  of car pools, then physical constraints

will  have  to be introduced to obtain a mandatory

change. The introduction of reserved bus lanes  is

one step in this direction.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I said, at col. 467:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has already been announced that a study is

underway  to  consider  a  park-and-ride   scheme,

whereby commuters could park their cars in  fringe

car  parks and take a shuttle bus into or  out  of

the Central Business District during peak periods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, measures to curb the rise in private

car ownership are also under study.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what is the position today?

Firstly,  as  regards SBS, we have  already  moved

into SBS - a Government Team of Officials which at

one  stage  comprised as many as 140 officers  but

now reduced to 10() - to reorganise and strengthen

its  management since the end of July 1974. At the

time  of the secondment of the Government Team  of

Officials, it was indicated that it might take two

to   three  years  to  achieve  the  objective  of

providing   a  clean  and  efficient  public   bus

service.  Although the services of SBS  have  been

improved, however, much remains to be done.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>



After the Government Team of Officials has been in

SBS  for seven months, the problems to be overcome

are   indeed  greater  than  at  first  envisaged.

Therefore,  it has been stated in the  President's

Address, [Hansard of 21st February, 1975, col. 6],

and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The bus service is improving. More improvement

can be made in another three to five years.'



<br><br>The  intention is clear - our Government,  through

our  Team  of  Officials in SBS, is determined  to

raise  the standard and the quality of  SBS  as  a

public  bus service befitting a modern  city  like

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our drive to reduce traffic congestion we have,

since July last year, started a six-month national

campaign   to  encourage  more  people  to   adopt

staggered   work  hours  and  to   encourage   the

formation  of  more  car  pools.  Thanks  to   the

cooperation  from  all  sides,  we  have  achieved

reasonable success in both respects today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of staggered work hours, over 120.000

workers  are  now adopting staggered  work  hours,

made  up  of  60,000  workers  employed  in  1,138

establishments in the private sector and a similar

number of workers in the public sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for car pools we have established a Car Pool

Management  Unit in the Registry  of  Vehicles  at

Middle  Road  in January this year  to  match  car

pools  through  the computer. To-date,  more  than

5.400 registration forms have been distributed and

316  car  pools  have been formed,  involving  229

adults  and  768 school children. In addition,  84

privately-formed car pools involving  417  persons

have  been registered with our Car Pool Management

Unit.  Soon,  100,000  car  owners  who  will   be

receiving their notices for renewal of road tax by

post   will   be  receiving  car  pools  publicity

brochures as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now on the threshold of implementing two

traffic management measures to drastically  reduce

the  present traffic congestion, namely, the  park

and ride shuttle bus scheme which is scheduled  to

come into operation in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>



May,  that is l 1/2 months from now, and the  area

licensing  scheme which will come  into  effect  a

month later in June.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can now be disclosed that the World Bank has

indicated great interest in our traffic management

measures  and  are  already  in  the  midst  of  a

research  study  to assess the  effects  of  these

traffic management measures. The interest shown is

because we are probably the only city in the world

to have so many traffic management measures to try

to  control traffic congestion and to improve  the

public bus transport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The World Bank research studies have already

conducted  interviews with  a  number  of  non-car

owning households which were completed in November

last   year,   and  interviews  with  car   owning

households are now in progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what has been the effect of

Government's policy to discourage the rapid growth

of  car  ownership, ever since the Road  Transport

Action Committee was established in October  1973?

The  figures of the number of new cars  registered

for  the three-month period, December to February,

for  the  three  years  are most  revealing.  From

December 1972 to February 1973, the number of  new

cars  registered  was 5.068. The  year  following.

December  1973  to February 1974, the  number  was

4,277,  a  drop  of  16%. From  December  1974  to

February  1975, the latest figures, the number  of

new  cars registered was 1,978, a drop of 54%. And

in  view  of  the latest increase  in  road  taxes

announced  on  3rd  March  by  my  colleague,  the

Minister for Finance, who is unrepentant,  we  can

expect the downward trend to continue.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now quote a news report published in the

Straits Times of 15th March, just a few days  ago,

on page 4, which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Day the car must give way

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geneva, Fri. - Swiss President Pierre Graber

yesterday opened Geneva's annual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>



motor  show  -  Europe's first major international

display  of  1975  - by warning  that  governments

might eventually have to restrict the movement  of

cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at the opening of a show at which

manufacturers are presenting the largest selection

of  new models for many years, Mr Graber said that

in an evolution towards greater concern with human

social   conditions   "the   citizen   must   know

spontaneously  how  to  appreciate  situations  in

which  individual interests must give way to those

of the national community."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if, God forbid, priority national needs should

one  day  call for a limitation of circulation  of

automobiles  or any other measure,  no  one  would

then regard it as an intolerable sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For in a society where humanism regains fully its

rights,  the  automobile should not constitute  an

end in itself," Mr Graber said. - Reuter.'



<br><br>Sir,  whereas governments elsewhere may  still  be

hesitant  whether or not to restrict the  movement

of  cars, we in Singapore have already decided  to

do  so.  Being an island city State  of  only  225

square  miles  and  having to  support  a  teeming

population of 2.2 million people, we cannot afford

just to sit tight and do nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Action, quite right. We do hope that given the

full  cooperation of all car users, we can improve

the  standards  and  quality  of  our  public  bus

service and also reduce traffic congestion on  our

roads by reducing the high growth of private  cars

in the quickest possible time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's patient and

detailed  reply,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CAA 2120.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead FAA 2270.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Punggol has indicated that he is

not moving his amendments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 8101 (The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Sia Khoon Seong.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Development Estimates, I notice

that  a sum of $848,900 is being provided just  to

undertake  a study of the Mass Transit System.  It

seems  to be a fantastic amount of money  just  to

make  a study of the system, when nothing has been

implemented as far as the system is concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be much better if we do not make a

study  of  the system - in fact, Phase II  of  the

system.  Our main aim is to reduce the  number  of

vehicles on the road at any cost. The Mass Transit

System  will not serve much purpose. Once our  bus

transport  system is greatly improved, we  do  not

require a Mass Transit System. Our island  is  too

small  and,  therefore, this system  will  not  be

feasible,  perhaps  even worse,  it  will  not  be

profitable. Therefore, I see no necessity for this

amount  of  money to be spent on the system,  even

with  the help of the United Nations. This  amount

of  money can be used in a more worthwhile  manner

if it is redirected to a more productive use where

the   citizens  can  benefit  directly.  The  Mass

Transit  System will mostly benefit the  motorist,

and  it  is  not  the motoring public  who  should

benefit or even pampered.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, unlike the Member for

Anson,  I feel that the Mass Rapid Transit  System

is  absolutely vital at this stage. It was  stated

in  the President's Address at the opening of this

session  of Parliament that the MRT would only  be

introduced  in  the late 1980s. I  think  that  is

rather  too slow a pace, particularly now  when  a

squeeze is being tightened on car owners, more and

more  people can be expected to commute by  public

transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, the Minister did show a lot of

confidence over the improvements



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>





envisaged in the SBS operations. While  I  am  not

trying  to say that I do not share his confidence,

I  think the problems in three years' time will be

greater  than the problems today, as  far  as  the

demand  for public transport is concerned.  It  is

like  the  dog chasing its own tail.  True,  there

will  be  improvements in the SBS operations.  But

will  the  improvements be effective or sufficient

enough  to  cope with the increased problems  that

are  going  to  be faced because  of  the  heavier

demand  for  public transport? As I said  earlier,

with  the  squeeze  now  being  tightened  on  car

owners,  we  can expect more and more  car  owners

commuting  by  public transport. On top  of  that,

every year thousands of school-leavers are joining

the  ranks of office-workers. They will also  help

to  increase the demand on public transport.  That

being the position, I am just wondering whether we

could  not quicken the pace to get the Mass  Rapid

Transit  System introduced, if not by this  decade

then, at least, in the early 1980s and not in  the

late 1980s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to inform this

House  of the latest position regarding the second

phase of the Feasibility Study on the MRT. I  hope

to  hear  of  a very good progress report  -  that

everything is going fine, and that we will be able

to  meet the target date much earlier. I hope that

will  be  the kind of answer he gives. Of  course,

the  Minister is always confident. This is one big

challenge  ahead  of  him,  and  with  his   usual

confidence, perhaps he will make it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, earlier

on  the  Member for Sembawang did raise the matter

of  the  Mass  Transit Study and I have  indicated

that this is probably the right time to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Reply to me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In passing. The other two Members, the Member for

Anson  and the Member for Moulmein, did  right  by

saying  that they want to talk on this subject.  I

happen to share



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



the  views  expressed by the Member for  Moulmein,

and I hope I am still brimming with enthusiasm.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members of the House will recall that at the

sitting  of Parliament on 28th August,  1974,  the

Report  in  Brief (Misc. Paper No. 3 of 1974)  was

tabled  covering  the findings and recommendations

of  Phase I of the Mass Transit Study. I am  happy

to report that the initial work on Phase II of the

Study,   which  will  incorporate  more   detailed

economic   and   financial   evaluation   of   the

recommended system, is underway. Like the  earlier

phase,  Phase II of the Study will be carried  out

by  a team of consultants, supported by Government

counterpart staff appointed by the Government  and

the World Bank. It is expected that this phase  of

the  Study  will be completed by the end  of  this

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a Mass Transit System of the type and scale

being  contemplated, the full impact of the system

must   be   studied  in  order  to  evaluate   the

feasibility   of   the   scheme.   Such    initial

feasibility studies usually cost about 1%  of  the

total  cost.  Assuming a conservative estimate  of

$1,000  million,  or  the  American  term  of   $1

billion,  for  the  system,  the  cost   for   the

feasibility  studies would be around $10  million.

But  the  total  cost of Phases I and  II  of  the

Singapore Mass Transit Study is estimated at  only

$4  1/2  million, which is less than 1/2%  of  the

total cost, of which our Government's contribution

is  about  $2.1  million, the rest being  provided

under  the  United Nations Development  Programme.

The  Member  for Anson said that  it  would  be  a

fantastic sum to spend. I would say this  to  him.

It  would be penny wise pound foolish not to incur

the   expense   of  a  Feasibility  Study   before

embarking on a $1,000 million project. No  prudent

Government   would  choose  to   avoid   such   an

expenditure.   The  Mass  Rapid   Transit   System

proposed  is  intended to be a long-term  solution

for  Singapore's  public transport  needs.  Travel

analyses  carried out have indicated  that  within

the next 15 years public transport demand would be

doubled what it is today. This is the result of  a

combination of factors of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



growing population, rising affluence, increasing

employment and social opportunities.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the present Government policy of

discouraging  car  ownership and  its  usage,  the

effect  could only result in Singaporeans  relying

even  more  on public transport. From observations

of   bus   operations,  it  is  clear   that   the

alternative of public transport, based  solely  on

buses   operating  on  surface  streets  in  mixed

traffic, will deteriorate and cannot be a workable

solution  to cater for the much greater  transport

demand  in  the future. A mass transit  system  is

therefore   ore   recommended   to   support   the

development envisaged for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not correct to say that the mass transit

system will benefit mostly the motorists. The bulk

of  its users, if built, is expected to come  from

the  non-vehicle owning trip-makers  who  have  no

alternative  but to rely on public transport,  and

to  that  extent motorists will also use the  mass

transit  system. The number of car trips  will  be

reduced,  and hence free road facilities for  more

essential  traffic.  During  the  interim  period,

until  we do have a mass transit system, Singapore

will  have to rely on the present system of public

transport based on buses.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, if the mass transit system does not work,

what will happen to the money spent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, let us wait for the feasibility study.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $56,409,450 for Head 0 ordered to stand

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BAA 1107 (The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ivan Baptist and Ho Kah Leong).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in far too many streets, rubbish collection

at  bin centres has been so badly done that  these

places  have  become breeding  grounds  for  rats,

flies,  cockroaches  and  countless  other  pests.

Further, the nauseating smell emanating from these

centres is quite often unbearable. Why cannot  the

Ministry  supply  more bins and  ensure  that  the

rubbish is collected more often?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also quite a number of other bin

centres  where  rubbish  has  not  been  collected

regularly  and  the bins are left unattended.  The

Minister  will  say that there is  a  shortage  of

manpower  and  vehicles. Sometimes, you  can  find

reports  of  this nature with photographs  in  our

afternoon and morning newspapers. Can the Minister

do  something to make sure that rubbish  is  being

collected  regularly? Furthermore, in some  places

when  the  daily  rubbish is being trucked  along,

dirty  water and rubbish spill all over the  road.

This  leaves  an  awful stench  all  the  way  and

passers-by have to bear with this "aroma".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the present

number of incinerators are adequate to burn up all

the   increased   volume  of  rubbish.   If   not,

additional incinerators should be built to burn up

the increased volume of rubbish.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to know how successful is the

prohibition of smoking in the buses. I find a good

number  of  people still smoke in buses.  Can  the

Minister  give  some  facts and  figures  on  this

subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Baptist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, I have submitted a question for oral answer,

and so I am not speaking on this amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two

questions.  One  is the selection, of  sites  for

hawker centres and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



the  number  of  stalls. We know  that  the  basic

policy of the Government in respect of hawkers  is

to  build  hawker centres to accommodate  licensed

roadside hawkers. This i5 not a bad policy at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is still something wanting in the

choice  of  site and the number of  stalls  to  be

provided   in  the  hawker  centres.  Members   of

Parliament have no say at all in this matter, even

if  they  have  such  problems arising  in  theirs

Contituencies.  I  feel  that  since  Members   of

Parliament  are in a better position to understand

their own constituents, they should be invited  to

air  their  views in the matter of the  number  of

hawker stalls and the site for hawker centres.  If

MPs  arc not allowed any say at all, then at least

they  should  be  consulted SO  as  to  avoid  the

selection  of  a wrong or unsuitable  site  for  a

hawker   centre.  An  erroneous  decision  usually

results  in  a lot of complaints being brought  to

the attention of the MPs concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to raise is about

hawker  inspectors and environmental public health

inspectors. Some Members have in the past few days

made  complaints about discourtesy on the part  of

civil servants towards members of the public. Here

I would like to give a few instances to illustrate

the  discourtesy and harassment  on  the  part  of

public  health  inspectors and hawker  inspectors.

These public servants feel that because they  have

the  power  to issue summonses, they  continue  to

issue  summonses until the shopkeepers and hawkers

succumb. Most shopkeepers and hawkers are very law-abiding citizens. They are conscious of the health

regulations, but during peak hours of business the

place is dirtied by the customers. So during  peak

hours  they do not have the time to clean  up  the

place and thus open themselves to summonses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently I received many complaints of this

nature.   These   hawkers  complained   that   the

inspectors are fussy and unreasonable or even  try

to  be  difficult  with the  people  concerned  by

issuing





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



summonses  indiscriminately. I think the  Minister

will  agree  with  me that in places  like  coffee

shops and markets, it is quite impossible to  keep

the  whole  place  spick and span  at  all  times.

Therefore,  public  health inspectors  and  hawker

inspectors should be sympathetic, considerate  and

reasonable.  If  at the end of the day's  business

the  place is not cleaned, then perhaps the hawker

and  health inspectors may be justified in issuing

summonses. Nothing can then be said against  them.

So  I  hope  the Minister can instruct the  hawker

inspectors  and health inspectors, who come  under

his  control, not to behave like overlords  ruling

over  the heads of the hawkers and members of  the

public.  They  should  be  reasonable  in  issuing

summonses.  Otherwise,  they  will  only  increase

their occupational hazards.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Sir, the Member for Anson is repeating what he

said  in  previous  Budget  sessions,  i.e, the

unsatisfactory  collection  of  rubbish.  I  have

replied  to him in detail during the last  Budget

session, and therefore I am not going to take too

much  time of the House by going over the grounds

again.  But let me remind the House that  rubbish

in  Singapore is collected regularly and at least

once a day. This is one of the few big cities  in

the  world  where rubbish is collected daily.  On

the  average the Ministry collects 1,200 tons  of

refuse daily and our trucks cover 260 routes each

and make 400 trips per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of refuse bins, it is not whether

there  are  enough or not enough  bins.  It  is  a

question of whether members of the public do  make

correct  use of the facilities at bin centres.  On

occasions  members  of  the  public  throw  refuse

around  bin centres instead of putting the  refuse

into  the  bins. This, of course, would  give  the

Member  for Anson the impression that rubbish  has

been left behind. There are occasions when rubbish

is  piled  up at bin centres. These occasions  are

few  and  when  they  arise,  it  is  due  to  the

breakdown  of  the  collecting  truck.  But,  once

information



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



is  received  by the Ministry that a refuse  truck

has broken down, another truck will be sent to  do

the collection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of bad smell coming from

trucks carrying refuse and of spillage, I can  say

that  situation is gradually improving. The Member

for  Anson probably had the unfortunate experience

of  driving behind a very old truck that sprang  a

leak.  We are replacing all these old trucks  with

leak-proof trucks so that, in future, if he should

be  driving behind one of these trucks he will not

be able to smell any, thing at all.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is incinerators. We dispose of

our refuse largely by dumping them in -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Changi.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> No. In Tampines Road. We tip this refuse largely

over  dumping  grounds outside the  city.  At  the

moment they are adequate enough to take 1,200 tons

of refuse daily. For the information of the House,

I  would just like to say that we are planning  to

build  an  incinerator of 1,200 tons capacity  per

day, and it is expected to be operational by 1978.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not able to give the Member for Anson facts

and figures on people who have been caught smoking

in  buses.  If he wants such detailed information,

he can send in a question for oral answer. What  I

know  is that enforcement action is taken  to  see

that  the  sign "No Smoking" in buses is  strictly

observed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Jurong, he complained

that  the inspectors are very hard on the  hawkers

and  are  issuing  summonses  indiscriminately.  I

cannot  accept that. There are certain  procedures

to  be  followed, and our inspectors are  told  to

adhere  strictly to them before they  issue  their

summonses. Usually a summons is issued only  after

a    warning   has   been   given.   Knowing   how

irresponsible  some hawkers can be, the  situation

would certainly deteriorate if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



we  are  lax  in enforcing the rule of cleanliness

among  our  hawkers. As it were, we  have  already

achieved a certain standard of cleanliness  and  I

would  hate to see it deteriorate. Once  it  does,

then we will have a tough time restoring it to our

present high standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that we do train our

health  inspectors to be polite,  but  firm,  with

members   of   the  public.  If  Members   receive

complaints  from hawkers that the inspectors  from

the  Ministry  have been very rigid  and  rude,  I

would ask them to listen to the other side of  the

story.  In instances where complaints of  rudeness

have  been brought to my attention, I always  make

it  a point to carry out a thorough investigation.

You will find that there are always two sides to a

story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I dislike is the implied threat in the

Member's statement with regard to the behaviour of

health inspectors. If I am not mistaken, he  wants

the  health inspector to be more polite, otherwise

the  consequences would be disastrous. Let me warn

those  who attempt to take the law into their  own

hands   and  hurt  health  inspectors  or   public

servants in the course of their duty. They will be

severely  dealt with when caught and  we  will  do

everything  possible to see that they are  caught.

After all the inspectors are doing their duty, and

it  has been impressed upon them that they must be

polite but firm. It is only this firmness that can

bring about the desired results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of consulting Members

in  the  design of hawker centres, the  Department

does  from time to time seek the views of Members.

But  I think Members will agree with me that  when

it  comes  to detailed planning the staff  of  the

Department who are professionals are in  a  better

position  to know the requirements. Of course,  we

would  be  very fortunate to be able to  find  the

most suitable place for a hawker centre and to  be

able  to provide more than enough stall-space  for

hawkers in the vicinity,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



but  the  ideal is not always possible. There  are

financial  limitations and space limitations,  but

wherever possible we will consult hon. Members.  I

must  stress  here again that the  final  decision

rests  with  my Ministry because in  building  any

structure not only one department is concerned but

many  others. It is only the professionals at  the

job  who will be able to give advice which is  not

only  suitable  but  also  in  keeping  with   the

regulations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to clarify. What I am saying is

that Members of Parliament should be consulted  in

regard  to the site of the hawker centre  and  the

number of stalls. If Members' views are sought,  I

would be very grateful. We do not want a situation

in  which Members of Parliament actually supervise

the  construction of the site. That is not what  I

am asking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of hawker inspectors,

although the Minister has said that they have been

instructed  to  be  polite in the  performance  of

their  duties,  very often they forget  about  the

need  to be polite. So they become very harsh with

the hawkers. For example, during the peak hours of

business in a market, a vegetable hawker may  have

dropped  one leaf of vegetable on the  ground  and

the  hawker inspector comes round and say,  "There

you  are. Pick it up, otherwise I will give you  a

summons."  Again, some inspectors  may  require  a

stallholder in a coffee shop to sweep the place at

a time when there are so many customers around, or

during   the   peak   hours.   This   action    is

unreasonable. Sir, you may be aware of the  belief

that  if you sweep the floor when there are a  lot

of  patrons  in  the coffee shop,  you  will  lose

business. Under the circumstances there should  be

some  flexibility and understanding. If the hawker

inspectors and health inspectors are polite,  they

can  expect politeness in return. Courtesy  begets

courtesy,  and  there will be no  unhappiness  and

unfortunate cases.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister complained that I have been

repeating  my  complaint about rubbish  again  and

again.  If  the  Minister  had  taken  action   in

clearing the rubbish, then I would be mad to bring

up   this  complaint  again.  The  population  has

increased,  so has the rubbish. The dustbins  that

have  been provided are too small and the  rubbish

spills  on to the floor. It is most probable  that

there are not enough lorries and men to clear  the

rubbish. Therefore, they have to clear the rubbish

at least twice or thrice a day.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as I said, I do not want to

take  too much time to go over the ground  that  I

had covered last year. There are some places where

rubbish   is  removed  three  times  a  day,   and

generally bin centres are kept clean. I  am  quite

satisfied that we have enough lorries now and  the

department  is  well organised to  keep  Singapore

clean.   We   keep  the  place  clean   regularly.

Otherwise the Member would complain of the "aroma"

not only in odd places but all over Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned that in most cases we

will seek the views of hon. Members whenever there

is  a  plan to build a hawker centre. Their  views

will  be  sought but, of course, the final details

have to be worked out by members of my staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned a case where just

because a hawker dropped a leaf of vegetable,  the

health inspector issued him with a summons. If the

health  inspector from my Ministry had  been  that

inconsiderate,  I  would have received  many  many

more complaints than I have received so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not satisfied with the explanation of

the  Minister. Last Saturday when, I  went  to  my

Branch  Office in my constituency at 7.00  am.,  I

saw  a  lot of rubbish piled up. I was very angry.

But  what could I do then? The smell was there and

I  could  not  get anything done at 7.00  am.  The

Minister says that rubbish is cleared every day. I

must ask



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



him  to  go  there  and see it  for  himself.  The

Minister just sits in the office. He must go round

and   see  for  himself.  Then  he  will  get  the

information.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I do go round the constituencies. I only want

to  ask  the Member this question: how many  times

did  he  find his place full of rubbish?  Probably

once   in   a  few  months.  Is  it  an   everyday

occurrence? If it is, he should have written to my

Ministry  and  I will see to it that something  is

done.  If  it is an everyday occurrence, I  wonder

how is it that he can sit on it for so long.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am not objecting to that. But during the festive

period there are lots of rubbish. He must consider

this factor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> That is exactly what I said. Sir, we clean the

place  regularly.  On normal  days  the  place  is

clean.  But when he talks about festival  days,  I

can  understand the situation because there is  an

accumulation  of rubbish during such seasons,  and

this will take time to clear.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not want to prolong

the debate; otherwise the Minister will get angry!

I therefore beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BCA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that land is limited in Singapore

and  we  cannot allocate too much land for use  as

graveyards  or cemeteries. There is, therefore,  a

need to change the people's customs and traditions

on  burials.  The people should be  encouraged  to

adopt   cremation  as  a  funeral  rite,   because

cremation being economical both in cost and  space

and cleaner merits active encouragement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether our Minister, who is well

known for campaigns, will be prepared to launch  a

nation-wide campaign to encourage the adoption  of

cremation  as the standard funeral rite.  In  line

with  this  campaign  we should  also  build  more

crematoria   and  columbaria,  which   should   be

distributed  evenly instead of concentrating  them

in  a  certain  area. With proper distribution  of

crematoria,  it  will be more convenient  for  the

people.  There should also be a proper  place  for

the  columbaria that the ashes could  be  kept  in

accordance with the different religious rites.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is in regard to funeral

parlours.  At present, many people are  living  in

flats as land is so limited. There should be  more

funeral   parlours  to  serve  the   people.   The

Government should not only build funeral  parlours

but  also allow private enterprises to build  more

funeral  parlours.  I understand  that  a  certain

association has applied for planning approval  for

the  construction of a crematorium and  a  funeral

parlour,  but the application was turned  down.  I

would  like  to  know  why  this  application  was

rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, it is a good suggestion that

we build more crematoria all over Singapore. There

are plans for their construction but they have  to

be  sent  to  the  Building Control  Division  for

planning  approval. We must find  suitable  sites.

Similarly,  permission  will  be  given  for   the

establishment   of  funeral  parlours   all   over

Singapore. But hon. Members must realise  that  if

funeral parlours are set up in crowded areas,  the

neighbouring  residents might find it inconvenient

and  might  not  like  to  live  next  to  funeral

parlours.  Therefore, suitable sites  have  to  be

carefully considered for the setting up of funeral

parlours.    Anyway,   the   matter    is    under

consideration.  Once  it is  being  decided  where

these suitable sites are, an announcement will  be

made.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of a campaign to

further  the adoption of cremation, I am  glad  to

inform hon. Members that the idea of cremation has

caught on. Latest figures show that about 41 %  of

the dead in Singapore were cremated. Of course, we

will  keep on encouraging cremation. A columbarium

will  be  built at Mount Vernon where the cremated

ashes can be kept.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BEA 1109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am raising this matter just to ask the Minister

to  give us information, for the enlightenment  of

this  House and perhaps the public, regarding  the

functions    of   the   Training   and   Education

Department. Who are the people being trained,  and

what are the purposes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Training and Education Department of my

Ministry  has not received any publicity  and  the

public is not quite aware of what it is doing.  So

I  am glad to have this opportunity to clarify the

role  of the Training and Education Department  in

the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Training and Education Department of my

Ministry  was  set  up to train personnel  of  the

Ministry, in particular, the field staff,  and  to

educate the public on environmental public  health

matters.   These   are  some   of   the   courses:

Orientation  Course  for Assistant  Public  Health

Inspectors,   Water  Pollution  Control   Courses,

Refresher    Courses   in   Public   Health    Law

Enforcement,  Technicians  Sanitary   Course   for

technical staff of the Sewerage Department, Sewage

Treatment Works Operators Course for the technical

staff  attached to the Sewage Treatment Works  and

Industrial   Waterworks,   Intensive   Course   on

Sewerage  and Sanitation for technicians preparing

for Departmental examinations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the Royal Society of Health

courses for Public Health Inspectors. This is

quite an important course because they are awarded

certificates. This is carried out in conjunction

with the Royal Society of Health in England. In

1973, 28 Public Health Inspectors underwent this

course, and 34 in 1974. This year 39 students are

attending this course. There is also a Royal

Society of Health course on Air Pollution Control.

Eighteen students are now doing this course. All

in all, for 1974 we have a total of more than 200

students undergoing the various courses in the

Ministry. Students from other statutory boards or

government departments also enrol in the courses

appropriate to their duties. As I said just now,

these courses are run to train our inspectors in

law enforcement, in their attitude and behaviour

towards the public, and also in their approach to

work. So these courses are a very necessary

adjunct to the Ministry because they teach members

of the staff not only the technical know-how but

also the way to carry out their work effectively.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I am very grateful to the Minister for his

interesting  outline  of the educational  work  of

that  section  of his Ministry.  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of

Messrs  Ng Kah Ting, Ho See Beng, Teong Eng Siong,

Sim Boon Woo, P. Govindaswamy and Cheong Yuen Chee -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head P be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead BGA 1111.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting has indicated that he is not

moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead BGA 1111.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Ministry of the Environment came

under  the charge of the present Minister, it  has

achieved progress at "a thousand miles a day",  so

to  speak.  This is an undeniable fact. Therefore,

we should praise his Ministry for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



its  work.  When  praise is  due  we  should  give

praise,  and similarly when criticism is  deserved

we should duly criticise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there have been complaints against

hawker   inspectors   about  their   conflict   or

misunderstanding  with  hawkers.  Just   now   the

Minister said that the Ministry of the Environment

is  conducting  educational courses,  including  a

course  on human relations. This is very  good.  I

hope  there  is no training course on Tae-kwon-Do,

because   that   is  not  proper.   These   hawker

inspectors  can  work  very  well  but  they  lack

experience.  They lack tolerance as well  as  good

and  patient  manners needed to  carry  out  their

work.  Sometimes  in  dealing  with  hawkers  they

behave  like detectives trying to catch criminals.

I  have  personally  seen this behaviour  on  many

occasions.  What  I would like to  raise  here  is

about  the  licensed hawkers who sometimes  commit

certain  minor  offences.  I  would  like  to  ask

whether  the  hawker inspectors are  empowered  to

confiscate  their  goods, when they  can  get  the

court to issue summons to the offending hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such incident occurred to a fish hawker in my

constituency.  Having tendered for  some  fish  at

about  7.00 a.m, or 8.00 am, at the Jurong Central

Fish  Market one day, he returned to  put  up  his

stall.  In doing so he had to put the fish on  the

five-foot  way. Unaware to him, a hawker inspector

came  up  and said that his fish were  causing  an

obstruction  to  the  pedestrian  walk.  He   then

confiscated  all his fish. Thus, his  capital  was

gone. This kind of incident is not really serious.

It  is  a minor incident and we should give humane

consideration to such minor cases, otherwise  they

might   damage   the   good  reputation   of   our

Government.  I  would  urge the  Minister  to  pay

particular attention to such incidents in order to

prevent them from happening again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, undoubtedly the Government has taken an

active  part in improving the welfare of  hawkers.

For  instance, in recent years the Government  has

built



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



a  number  of hawker centres which provide  modern

healthy  amenities  for them to  carry  out  their

trade.    In    previous   years   a   nation-wide

registration  of all hawkers was carried  out  and

temporary licences were issued so that they  could

have fixed sites to carry on their trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Hawkers Department has improved the

welfare   of   licensed  hawkers,  the  unlicensed

hawkers   how, ever  are  still   facing   great

difficulties.  Those who engage in  hawking  as  a

means  of  livelihood are mainly  elderly  people.

Some  of them set up their stalls by the road side

selling  cigarettes, newspapers  or  magazines  in

order to earn a little to help maintain the meagre

livelihood of their household.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hawker who was selling putu mayam,

which is an Indian variety of bee hoon. This  putu

mayam  is  very  popular among the  poorer  people

because it is very cheap. These putu mayam hawkers

usually carry baskets of putu mayam on their heads

when  they hawk. Newspaper vendors, however,  sell

newspapers  by  going  from  house  to  house   on

bicycles.  These  hawkers are not registered  with

the  Hawkers  Department  and  are  therefore  not

issued with any licences at all. This makes  their

trade illegal. When spotted by a hawker inspector,

they  will be issued with a summons. But  if  they

were  to stop their trade, they will have no means

to  earn  a livelihood. Sometimes they are  served

with  about  five, six or even 10 summonses  in  a

month. In my constituency a few such hawkers  have

been  served with just such a number of  summonses

per  month. Some hawker inspectors even confiscate

their   goods.  As  the  Member  for  Bras   Basah

mentioned just now, they take away the putu  mayam

or  the  newspapers, thus causing a great loss  to

the hawkers concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these hawkers are our citizens. If we do not

give them a means to earn a living, they will have

to go to the Social



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



Welfare  Department and the Government  will  thus

have  the  additional financial burden of  looking

after  them.  So  I would like the  Government  to

grant them a means of livelihood and so give  them

the opportunity to earn a living.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to irritate

the  Minister,  but I want something  to  be  done

about  the  hawkers in my constituency. Therefore,

the  tune  of my plea will be very soft.  I  would

like to touch on the problems of the hawkers in my

constituency,  and  I hope the  Minister  for  the

Environment will give sympathetic consideration to

my  plea for those hawkers who are either licensed

or are temporarily licensed to hawk. These hawkers

were  formerly living at Changi Point.  They  were

affected  by resettlement and, as a result,  their

livelihood   has  been  severely  affected.   Sir,

another  problem is this. The fishermen at  Lorong

Dangai   in   Changi   were   also   affected   by

resettlement and have been accommodated in Housing

Board  flats. Having been resettled far away  from

the sea, they have therefore completely lost their

only  means of living, i.e, fishing. These  people

have  made  an  appeal  for allocation  of  hawker

stalls in the Bedok New Town.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another appeal from the hawkers who are

licensed to hawk at Changi Road and Bedok Road  is

that  they be given permission to sell their goods

at  Koh  Sek Lim Road between 7.00 a.m, and  8.00

a.m.,  before proceeding to the place  which  they

are licensed to sell. Sir, I must stress that this

practice  has been going on for a long  time.  The

former hawker inspector who was in charge of  that

place knew the situation of these hawkers. But the

moment  a new hawker inspector is posted  to  that

place, he does not know about the situation. As  a

result,  these poor hawkers have been  warned,  as

the Minister has said, and then summoned. With the

resettlement   and   redevelopment    of    Changi

constituency  and  all its attendant  problems.  I

hope  inconvenience to these people can be reduced

to  the  minimum.  I  would,  therefore,  ask  the

Minister to consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



these  points sympathetically so as to make  these

people a little bit happier.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I fully agree with my colleagues, the

Members   for  Jurong,  Bras  Basah   and   Changi

regarding  the  hawker  inspectors.   I   am   not

criticising  them as such because they  are  doing

their  duty.  But  they are doing  their  job  too

seriously,  and  do not give any  warning  to  the

hawkers. These hawkers have already been licensed,

and  so  we  must  consider their  position.  They

always  try to clean the place. But when  do  they

clean  it?  It is only after they have closed  the

shop,  will they clean the place. And if the place

is   found  dirty,  then  action  can  be   taken.

Otherwise  it  is  very bad  to  make  the  people

suffer. It is no good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the general policy of the Hawkers

Department  to  resite all hawkers in  the  hawker

centres. By now, a considerable number of  hawkers

have  been  resited.  The Hawkers  Department  has

indeed  done  an excellent job. But then,  sad  to

say,  there  are still a great number  of  hawkers

hawking  in the back lanes and shoddy areas.  When

will  these  hawkers  be  resited  in  the  hawker

centres?  May  I  know  also whether  the  hawkers

around  the Shenton Way bus terminus and the  back

lane of Choon Guan Street would be resited in  the

hawker centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that when an exercise is carried out

to  resite these hawkers, the hawker centre should

be  sited in my constituency because these hawkers

have been doing business there and they prefer  to

be resited in the same locality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how often are hawkers required to be

medically  examined? Very often  the  cholera  and

typhoid  epidemics are spread by  hawkers.  It  is

high time for all hawkers to be medically examined

without  any charge, so that they can be certified

fit before they are permitted to sell food.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, the recent outbreak of typhoid fever has

prompted  me  to  raise several  questions  as  to

whether  present measures are adequate to  control

the  spread of such diseases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



through the  handling of food by hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have a large number of hawker centres

which  provide  clean and healthy environment  for

the  hawkers,  the licensing of these  hawkers  is

confined   only   to  those  hawkers   under   the

management of the Hawkers Department. The  hawkers

under   the   management  of   the   Housing   and

Development  Board need not obtain  licences  from

the   Hawkers  Department.  However,  the  tenancy

agreement  between  the  Housing  Board  and   the

hawkers  contains  pro, visions  similar  to  the

regulations of the Hawkers Department. The point I

wish  to make, Sir, is: why cannot all hawkers  be

licensed under one single authority so that  there

will be better and more effective control?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, there are some loopholes ii, the

regulations  on  the control of  hygiene  in  food

preparation. For hawkers who are already sited  in

the  Housing Board hawker centres, the problem  is

not so great as most of them are living in Housing

Board  flats  where  the surroundings  are  clean.

Moreover,  they  have modem sanitation.  But  what

about  those  hawkers sited in the hawker  centres

managed  by the Hawkers Department? These  hawkers

prepare  the  food in their own homes,  which  are

usually  in the rural or squatter areas. I  wonder

whether  there is any control over the preparation

of  food by these hawkers, and whether inspections

are  made  of the place where the cooked  food  is

prepared  so  as  to protect the public  from  the

hazards of such diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for cleanliness, I notice that quite a number

of  itinerant hawkers who sell roast pork  (it  is

sio  bak, as spoken in Hokkien, and not char  siu,

as  spoken in Cantonese) convey their food  openly

on  vehicles through the streets which  often  are

very dusty, especially when a road excavation work

is  going  on.  I would suggest that  the  Hawkers

Department  impose  regulations  requiring   these

hawkers to cover their food when they hawk.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, presumably the Member for Toa Payoh thinks

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>



the  health  inspectors of  the  Ministry  of  the

Environment are not strict enough in enforcing the

regulations  governing hawkers. He  has  suggested

that  we  should pass further regulations  to  see

that   the  food  is  covered.  We  already   have

regulations  requiring food to be covered,  either

in  transit or on display for sale. Presumably  in

this instance, my health inspectors have been very

kind  and  flexible  in  the  enforcement  of  the

regulations.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Members will agree with me that the

inspectors  in my Department do not have  an  easy

job.  As  a result, I am finding it very difficult

to   recruit   the  full  complement   of   health

inspectors.  The staff turnover is great.  So  not

only  must  the health inspector be firm,  but  he

must also be tactful. That is why, as I have said,

we have set up a training department to teach them

not only the know-how of the job but also to teach

them the right way to deal with the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah mentioned a case of

unfair  confiscation on the  part  of  the  health

inspectors in his constituency. Well,  as  I  say,

there  are always two sides to a picture.  He  has

got  his version. And if he is not satisfied  with

it, he can give me the details and I will find out

what  is  the  other  side of  the  picture.  Then

probably we can arrive at a point where justice is

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to accede to the appeal of the Member for

Sembawang  as well as the Member for Changi  means

that I would have to recommend to Cabinet that  we

close  down  the Hawkers Department. What  is  the

point  of having a Hawkers Department if we  allow

every Tom, Dick and Harry to just go out and hawk.

Here, we are spending millions of dollars engaging

inspectors,  teaching  them  how  to  enforce  the

regulations,  organising  campaigns   for   better

health standards -

Department and spending so much money on campaigns

on   antipollution,  Keep  Singapore  Clean,  Keep

Singapore  Green, better food for  better  health,

when,  on  the other hand, Members say, "Let  them

hawk.   These  are  difficult  cases.   They   are

suffering." Our policy is to see that all  hawkers

are  sited  in centres where they can  sell  their

food  in  really good surroundings with  amenities

like potable water; where they can keep themselves

and  the  food  they sell clean and  can  practise

health  hygiene.  This i5 the reason  why  we  are

spending so much money. On the one hand,  we  hear

the Member for Toa Payoh saying that we should  go

down and see that hawkers prepare their food under

very  sanitary conditions and, on the other  hand,

we  have an appeal saying, "Please let them sell".

In Singapore, there are hardship cases, of course.

Definitely. A lot of our people have gone  through

a  lot of hardships. Resettlement causes a lot  of

hardships.  There  is  no doubt  about  that.  But

Singapore  has  been able to survive  because  our

population is able to adapt themselves to changing

circumstances,  and  it  is  our  policy  not   to

encourage hawking especially for young able-bodied

people as there is a shortage of skilled labour in

the  more productive sectors of our economy.  They

can  be trained and they should be trained. In our

opinion,  there are 31,000 hawkers  in  Singapore,

bona  fide  licensed hawkers, and this  number  is

sufficient for the needs of Singapore. If  I  were

to  accede  to  the  request  of  the  Member  for

Sembawang, then the policy of moving hawkers  into

centres with healthy and sanitary surroundings, so

that there would be no outbreaks of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



cholera  and typhoid, will be defeated. The  whole

policy will be defeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While sympathising with the Member for Changi on

the  plight  of  his constituents, here  again,  I

cannot  accede to his request to allow the hawkers

in his constituency to sell in two places. If that

is  allowed, then the whole policy will  go  awry.

There is already a shortage of suitable places  to

rehouse another 16,000 bona fide hawkers and  here

I  am being asked, "Will you allow the hawkers  in

my  constituency to sell at this place for  a  few

hours  and  then in another place for another  few

hours?" Very soon all the MPs will come up  to  me

and  say,  "Can you do the same for  my  hawkers?"

What will the result be? We move them into what we

think  are  suitable areas and they can  do  their

trade  under  sanitary  conditions.  This  is  the

policy of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Changi stated that the former

inspector   understood   the   difficulties   and,

according to him, allowed the hawkers to  sell  in

two places. Whether it is the former inspector  or

the  new  inspector, he knows the policy. If  that

has  been allowed in the past, then there has been

some neglect on the part of that inspector. It  is

not the policy to allow that because otherwise  it

will defeat the policy that has been decided by my

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we have to continue with very firm

action  against unlicensed hawkers.  If  we  allow

unlicensed  hawkers to continue hawking  then  the

whole purpose of licensing them and resiting  them

into hawker centres will be defeated. We find that

the  only most effective way to dissuade them from

illegal hawking is to confiscate their goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am unable to assure the Member for Anson,

or   for   that  matter  the  Members  for   other

constituencies, that hawker centres will be  built

in  places within their own constituencies.  As  I

explained  earlier,  there is  limited  space  and

limited finance. It would be ideal if we can build

a  hawker centre for each and every MP and in  the

place of their choice together with sufficient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



space   to   allot   enough   stalls   for   their

constituents. But unfortunately the ideal  is  not

attainable because of certain limitations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already spent $4.2 million. For 1975-76,

we  are  providing another $4.2 million for hawker

centres and markets. We have spent quite a lot  of

money already. We have built 20 markets and hawker

centres.   They  are  under  various   stages   of

construction.  But to build hawker  centres  in  a

place  which Members consider ideal and which  the

hawkers consider ideal, is beyond our capacity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards medical examination for hawkers,

we  are doing that. But we cannot do it for  every

hawker. It is free, I know, but the hawkers  would

suffer  because  it will take one week  to  really

examine  them as we are doing now when  we  resite

them  and  put them in hawker centres. And  during

this  time  they  will lose their earnings.  As  I

said,  there are 31,000 hawkers and together  with

their  assistants, there will be about 40,000-odd.

And  it is almost physically impossible to examine

all  of  them. So we do what we can. If  there  is

trace of any outbreak of cholera or typhoid in any

area,  we  go there and we really examine  all  of

them  in  that  area. But medical examination  and

screening does not mean that hereafter he will not

be  a  danger  to the public. He can  still  be  a

danger  to the public if he subsequently comes  in

contact with typhoid or cholera germs. And if  his

personal  hygiene is not up to standard,  he  will

pass  it  on.  I  think the best means  of  making

hawkers  realise  that clean personal  habits  are

essential  would be for members of the  public  to

avoid  hawkers  with dirty habits.  That  is  more

effective  than  all  the  fines  imposed  by   my

inspectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the suggestion that we should

inspect and supervise food prepared by hawkers  in

squatter areas, here again it is not practical. We

are already short of doctors and, as I said, I  am

finding  it  very  difficult  to  recruit   health

inspectors. To supervise the preparation  of  food

by   every  hawker  in  every  squatter  area   is

impracticable. Members know that different hawkers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



sell their food at different times of the day  and

the  food is therefore prepared at different times

too. It is physically impossible to carry out this

suggestion. The only way to ensure that  they  are

clean is to allow only licensed hawkers to sell in

hawker  centres under sanitary conditions, closely

and strictly supervised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if any Member remains unsatisfied because I

have  missed  replying to their  questions,  I  am

prepared to answer them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, it is very hard to please the Minister. I

have  never  mentioned about allowing  every  Tom,

Dick  and  Harry to hawk all over  the  place.  My

request  is that those fishermen, who are old  and

unable to fish because they have been resettled in

Housing  Board  flats far away from  the  sea,  be

given licences in Bedok New Town where markets and

stalls  will  be built. That is my  question,  and

that  is my plea. I am not asking the Minister  to

allow everyone to hawk. At the present moment,  as

I  said,  the reason why these hawkers are hawking

at  one  place  at a certain time and  at  another

place at a different time is because at that place

in  Changi there is no market or no proper  hawker

centre and therefore this problem has arisen.  For

humanitarian reasons, we have got to be flexible in

life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, the Minister has just mentioned that it is

physically  impossible to check on the preparation

of  food  in the squatter and rural areas.  May  I

suggest  that spot checks be made in the  interest

of hygiene?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while on this point, may I just assist the

Member  for  Changi? The hawker centres  that  are

being  constructed  in his constituency  may  come

under  the  management of the Housing  Board,  and

there  are certain provisions under the  rules  of

the Housing Board that bona fide cases of hardship

will be given places. I do not think his case will

come under the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, my colleagues, the Backbenchers, and the

public  outside  are puzzled.  There  are  markets

managed  by the Housing Board, markets managed  by

the  Ministry of the Environment, and I hear  that

there  are  markets  managed by  the  Jurong  Town

Corporation  and the Port of Singapore  Authority.

As  for  me, hawkers or stall-holders are one  and

the  same. Whether they are managed by the Housing

Board, JTC or PSA or whatever authority, something

must be done.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, what I am concerned about is a matter of

policy.  I would like to ask the Minister  whether

it  is  the policy of the Government to confiscate

the  goods  of licensed hawkers if they  commit  a

certain  offence. Is it really necessary  to  take

such  a drastic step as confiscation of his goods?

This is my point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is not the policy to confiscate the goods. But

there  must be other good reasons. I do  not  know

about  this particular case and I do not think  we

should waste time on particular instances. If  the

Member  wants it to be clarified, please write  to

me giving details of the case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, there may be justification for doing that to

an  unlicensed hawker. But what I am talking about

is  that of a licensed hawker. He cannot run away.

He  can  be summoned for whatever offence  he  has

committed;   but   why   should   the   Government

confiscate his goods? This is my point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> As I say, I do not know about the case. It could

be  that  the hawker was told, "Would  you  please

move your goods as you are blocking traffic?"  The

hawker was probably recalcitrant and said, "Go  to

hell  with you. I will remove it at my own  time."

Therefore,  it  was taken away. It could  be  like

this; I do not know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Ministry of the Environment

puts  up its logo in every market place and hawker

centre    under   its   control.   It    is    for

administrative' effi-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



ciency  that some markets are controlled  by  PSA,

JTC  and  HDB. For the Ministry of the Environment

to  control hawkers all over Singapore  is  a  bit

unwieldy.  So  it is a question of  administrative

expediency. Authorities or statutory bodies  which

build  markets or hawker centres within their  own

estates look after them, but they all observe  the

same Hawker Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if fishermen can become good

hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They can try.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We are not encouraging hawking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably it will be better for the fishermen to

engage in some other occupation. I doubt very much

whether a good fisherman can become a good hawker.

He  will probably go bankrupt in no time. We would

probably  save him a lot of trouble by not  giving

him  a  licence. But as we are unable to  resettle

all  bona  tide hawkers into designated areas,  we

are not issuing new licences. The problem will  be

a  perennial one. On the one hand, we are not able

to  accommodate all bona fide hawkers and, on  the

other hand, we are issuing more licences.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now I heard the Minister say that he

would  not  encourage more people  to  do  hawking

because  there are already enough hawkers  around.

According  to  present regulations the  department

concerned  is permitting those over 40 years  old,

whose   livelihood  is  difficult  and   who   are

receiving public assistance, to be hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, for every rule there is an exception. Of

course, in real cases of hardship we will make  an

exception.   One   exception  is   that   national

servicemen   who  are  trained  as  cooks   during

national  service  and  have become  exceptionally

good  cooks and who have discharged their national

service   liability  well  will,  if   there   are

vacancies  in the markets, be issued  with  hawker

licences. This is a reward for good service in the

army and an encouragement to people to cook better

and more tasty food.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, there are several points I would like to

make  to  supplement  the  replies  given  by   my

Minister.  The  Member  for  Jurong  made  certain

comments  concerning hawkers  and  the  siting  of

hawker centres. At the moment the matter is  dealt

with by several departments, the HDB, PSA, and the

JTC  besides the Ministry of the Environment.  The

present  arrangement is this.  In  regard  to  the

designing or planning of hawker centres, if it  is

to  be  in, say Jurong Town area, then it is dealt

with by the Jurong Town Corporation. Because if it

is  not  handled  by them there  will  be  certain

inconveniences  and  difficulties  in  respect  of

choice of site, supervision, etc. This resulted in

the  various  authorities  being  responsible  for

control of hawkers in their own areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the question of whether or not a Member

of  Parliament should be consulted in the  setting

up  of a hawker centre in his constituency, in  so

far   as  the  Ministry  of  the  Environment   is

concerned  the Member of Parliament concerned  has

generally been consulted in the choice of a  site.

As  regards Jurong, two reasons could be given for

the  Member's complaint. The first is that the JTC

has  only  recently  set up a hawkers  department.

Secondly,  two of the sites chosen are  extensions

of  old  market places. Since the sites have  been

fixed,   there   is  hardly  any  possibility   of

reversing the decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about unlicensed hawkers in

Jurong.  At that time the JTC had not yet  set  up

its  own  hawkers  department,  and  moreover  the

factories  there  were in need of their  services.

Therefore, the JTC could only decide on the  sites

for  the hawker centres in Jurong Town, while  the

expenses and the management thereof came under our

control.  But now any new hawker centre in  Jurong

Town will be managed by the JTC authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang mentioned about

newsvendors.  According  to  our  records,  if   a

newsvendor  does not have a stall  at  a  definite

place, he need not hold a hawker licence. We  have

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



taken  any  action  against such  news-vendors.  A

newsvendors  normally delivers the newspaper  from

house to house on a bicycle. But if he sets  up  a

stall,  he  would be bound by certain regulations,

and  we will then take measures to deal with  him.

As  we have said, it is easy to talk but difficult

to   practise.  So  it  is  very  well   to   give

encouraging answers to please people, but it  will

not  be  practical if in the end  they  cannot  be

fulfilled. In this regard I hope many Members will

agree with my view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia many countries with Parliamentary

democratic systems have failed. It is because  the

governments in these countries could only pay lip-service and could not actually practise what  they

preached,   which  caused  the  degeneration   and

subsequent   dismemberment  of   the   governments

concerned.  On  the other hand, in the  course  of

carrying  out  of  our policy if  we  desist  from

action   for  fear  of  adversely  affecting   the

interests of a minority, then we shall not be able

to  accomplish  anything. If  we  want  to  please

everybody, we would not be able to succeed in  our

business  of  government. However,  in  a  densely

populated  country like ours, if  we  do  not  pay

attention to the time factor then, to my mind, the

country will in future be in dire difficulties. It

is  only  when we can make full use  of  the  time

available  and  avail ourselves of the  favourable

conditions  around us that we can  carry  out  our

policy  of bringing a better life for our  country

and our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to add relates to what

the  Member for Changi had said about the problems

of  the  fishermen. The Member for Toa  Payoh  has

also  added  the  point about  the  management  of

hawkers by the HDB. According to my understanding,

the   Resettlement  Department  of  the  HDB  will

usually   bring  the  matter  to  the  appropriate

authority  which has jurisdiction over the  matter

concerned. In other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>



words,  if  the  matter raised comes  under  their

jurisdiction,  such  as when there  are  vacancies

left,  the  department  concerned  would  try   to

accommodate such people like resettled  fishermen.

Other  matters  will  be taken  up  by  the  other

relevant  departments  concerned.  I  myself  have

considerable experience dealing with HDB  hawkers.

Under  normal circumstances if a hawker centre  is

built  in  an HDB estate and ready for allocation,

then   the  Estate  Officer  of  the  Area  Office

concerned will discuss with the MP concerned about

resettlement  cases  and  other  matters  relating

thereto.  So  in the circumstances I  believe  the

Member  for Changi would be consulted by the  Area

Office  concerned when the fishermen  in  question

were to be resettled, so that the matter could  be

solved amicably.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In view of the lengthy reply, although it is not

very  satisfactory,  I beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Development Estimates for the financial  year  1st
