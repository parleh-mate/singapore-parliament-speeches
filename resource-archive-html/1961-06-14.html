<div align="center"><b>LEASES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND</b></div>



<br><br>2.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House considers that in any legislation

in  respect  of the grant of leases of  agricultural

land,  provision  should be  made  in  the  case  of

working  coconut  and  rubber estates,  whereby  the

tenant should be given the option of either a  lease

at economic rent or a licence to occupy the land for

specific  user such as rearing of poultry  or  pigs,

with  the right to possession and enjoyment  to  the

coconut or rubber remaining in the landlord.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the House will recall that two

Bills - the  Agricultural Leases Bill and the  Control

of  Rent  (Amendment  No.  3)  Bill - went  to  Select

Committee and, arising out of the representations in

the  Select Committee, a curious phenomenon has come

to  light  on which considerable ingenuity and  time

will have to be spent to work out the rights of  the

interested parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of an estimated 30,000 acres of the Master

Plan's agricultural belt, an estimated one-third, or

10,000 acres, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



covered by coconut and rubber plantations. In nearly

all   these  plantations  there  is,  de  facto,   a

situation  where the landlord has let  out  not  the

land  but a licence to tenants or squatters to  rear

pigs,  poultry or fish, whilst retaining  possession

and  tapping  his rubber or collecting his  coconut.

Therefore,  the  provision  to  allow  a  tenant  to

acquire  a  lease from the landlord at  an  economic

rent,  subject  to  certain  maximum  safeguards  on

behalf of the tenant, will work an obvious injustice

in  that,  first, the tenant never had enjoyment  of

either the coconut or the rubber, and his rent  (the

base  upon which the maximum economic rent is tied),

because  he did not enjoy the fruits of the  coconut

and  the  rubber, was a nominal one.  Therefore,  to

grant  the  tenant a lease would be to  exclude  the

landlord  from  possession  and  enjoyment  of   his

crop - be  it  rubber or coconut - and give  the  tenant

something which he never had, never was entitled to,

and never expect-ed to be entitled to. Therefore, it

is  being considered now - and I am recommending  this

to  the House - that in any legislation in respect of

the  grant of leases of agricultural land, provision

should  be made, in the ease of working coconut  and

rubber  estates, whereby the tenant should be  given

the option of either a lease at economic rent, or  a

licence to occupy the land for specific user such as

the  rearing of poultry or pigs, with the  right  to

possession  and enjoyment to the coconut  or  rubber

remaining in the landlord. In other words,  what  we

hope  to  achieve would be, in effect, to  give  the

tenant  a  licence  which  is  irrevocable   for   a

specified  term of, say, 12 years, but  the  licence

will  specify  the  user to which  the  licensee  is

entitled. I mean, if he has been rearing chickens or

pigs, he will continue to rear chickens or pigs, but

the  landlord will continue to collect  his  coconut

and rubber. The alternative is for the tenant to pay

the  whole economic rent and he collects the  rubber

and the coconut.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am unable to say that we can produce legislation

which will please all parties, but I do suggest that

if  we  are to do justice in this case, this is  the

only way in which we can ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



that  conditions  are created in which  farmers  are

given  if  not security of tenure, then security  of

user  of  land for specified purposes to  carry  out

activities in agriculture - be it poultry-farming  or

pig-rearing - and,  at  the  same  time,   allow   the

landlord to continue to derive that interest in  the

land  which he always had, namely the collection  of

rubber and coconut.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government to allow the

two  Bills  to  lapse. The House will  be  prorogued

sometime  in  the  near  future.  In  fact,  it  was

prorogued last year after the May sitting.  But  for

various  reasons which have to do with  legislation,

we  have  taken  this  sitting in  June.  After  the

prorogation,  it  is hoped that new  Bills  will  be

introduced which will incorporate these new clauses.

By  tabling  this motion, I am, in fact, inviting  a

debate - I  hope a constructive one - as to how  we  can

equitably   work   out   our   policy   of    giving

encouragement  to agriculture but  under  terms  and

conditions  which  would not impose  an  unnecessary

radical change in the proprietary position of

land-ownership  or  the enjoyment of the  fruits  of  the

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention here that several

representations  have  been  made  in   the   Select

Committee, a number of which are unacceptable to  us

as the Government. I can only say now that we cannot

hope  to  push such legislation through without,  in

principle,  accepting  the fact  that  there  is  an

interference of the right of ownership to land,  and

that   by   this  legislation  we  are,   in   fact,

interfering with the absolute right of ownership  to

land.  There have been representations from  private

estates   and   the  Land  and  Housing  Development

Association  saying that to push through  these  new

provisions  would,  in fact, be to  foist  statutory

tenants  on  landlords, that they  had  bought  land

which  had  no  tenants  prior  to  1947,  and  that

therefore  they  would be deprived of  a  reasonable

expectation  of their ability to get  rid  of  their

tenants  as  and  when they wished to  build.  I  am

afraid that, in principle,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



we  cannot consider all such representations  if  we

are  to pursue the objects of the Bill, but we  can,

to  a certain extent, meet periphery representations

as to the workings of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, representation has been made on the

point that for the Bill to have the phrase "economic

rent"  and, at the same time, to tie down  economic

rent  to  a  maximum  of a certain  percentage  over

present rent is, in fact, a contradiction in  terms.

Logically it is. Certain amendments in this  respect

to  make  it  less illogical but nevertheless  still

practical are being considered. On the side  of  the

tenants,  they  also  would  not  like  any  maximum

mentioned,  not for the reason that they  think  the

maximum  is  not to their advantage, but  that  they

feel  there would be a tendency for landlords always

to  insist on the maximum in negotiating for leases.

Both the representations - the one from the landlords

that the maximum rent being tied to present rent and

economic  rent is illogical, and the other one  from

the  tenants  that  maximum  rent  should  never  be

mentioned  at all because it would incite  landlords

to  demand  the  maximum - are being  considered,  and

provision  will be introduced in the new Bill  which

will, we hope, meet the objections from both parties

insofar  as they can be reconciled. There  was  also

representation  that there should be  not  just  one

arbitrator  who is a Government official,  but  that

there should also be a tribunal - one representing the

landowners and one representing the tenants. And  it

is  proposed  to  introduce a provision  whereby  in

cases  where  the arbitrator deems it necessary,  he

can call upon the services of the tribunal to assist

him.  But in normal cases where he does not deem  it

necessary, he can proceed by himself. The-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering whether

the  Prime  Minister is not going perhaps away  from

the motion itself. In fact, I think he is inviting a

debate on the Report of the Select Committee. If  he

carries on in this strain, then, of course, he  will

invite   a  debate  on  the  whole  of  the   Select

Committee's Report and all the representations which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



have  been made. The motion itself seems to  confine

the  aspect of this problem to the grant  of  leases

vis-a-vis working coconut and rubber estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Just as you like, Mr Speaker.

I  had  no  intention to expand  the  scope  of  the

motion.  I  only  wish to give the  Members  of  the

House, and through the House the parties interested,

a  brief  impression of the deliberations which  are

taking  place on the representations that have  been

put  in. But the one question upon which I would ask

for  a  debate  is  that of resolving  those  cases,

covering  about  one-third of  the  land,  where  at

present there are two persons enjoying the rights of

user of the land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I

can  quite appreciate the difficulty encountered  by

the  Government  in the introduction  of  that  Bill

which  went  to  Select Committee. We did  encounter

such  a  difficulty during our time, and we  support

the principle of seeing to it that, in so far as the

tenant  who  has been using the land for a  specific

use  is  concerned, he should be allowed to continue

that  tenancy for that specific use. But one anomaly

may creep in when the occupier of that land, who  is

using  it to raise poultry, wants a lease for rubber

estate and coconut estate. He may be made use of  by

competitors  who would like to break up the  estate,

and  I  do not know in what way that can be met.  Of

course,  on  the whole, we support the principle  of

this motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there any other Member who wishes

to speak? Does the Prime Minister wish to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Mr Speaker. I do not wish

to  reply. I have fairly stated the position of  the

Government. At a later date, there will be provision

to incorporate these provisions in a new Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House considers that in any legislation

in  respect  of the grant of leases of  agricultural

land,  provision  should be  made  in  the  case  of

working  coconut  and  rubber estates,  whereby  the

tenant should be given the option of either a  lease

at economic rent or a licence to occupy the land for

specific  user such as rearing of poultry  or  pigs,

with  the right to possession and enjoyment  to  the

coconut or rubber remaining in the landlord.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD TRAFFIC BILL</b></div>



Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation for the Road Traffic

Bill, and I beg to move, "That the Bill be now  read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will know that in accordance with  the

policy  of the Government, action is being taken  to

integrate  the  functions of  local  authorities  in

Singapore with those of the Government. In regard to

the  Bill  which  is now before the  House,  we  are

concerned  with  the  integration  of  the   various

functions   and  processes  which  relate   to   the

administration of road traffic in general and to the

office  of  the Registrar of Vehicles in particular.

The  responsibility,  Sir, for these  functions  and

processes   is   at  present  shared   between   the

Government  and the local authorities.  It  will  in

future  lie solely with the Government. This entails

a  transfer  to the Government of the responsibility

for  all those functions previously exercised by the

City Council and the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Road Traffic Ordinance provides for

the registration and licensing of motor vehicles and

is not concerned with the registration and licensing

of  non-motor vehicles. At present, it is  the  City

Council  which  is the licensing authority  for  the

purposes  of  registration and  licensing  of  motor

vehicles, and the executive officer responsible  for

the various details of registration and licensing is

the   Registrar  of  Vehicles,  an  officer  of  the

Council. The functions relating to the licensing  of

drivers is at present vested in the Police. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



existing   Road  Traffic  Ordinance  also   contains

provisions   governing  the  use  by   vehicles   of

Singapore's highways, as, for example, the provision

of  parking places; the emplacement of road  traffic

signs; and the restrictions placed from time to time

on   the  use  of  roads.  In  connection  with  the

operation of these provisions, the highway authority

is  the  City Council, and the Police, who have  the

general  responsibility for the operation  of  these

provisions,   are   required   to   exercise    such

responsibility  in  consultation   with   the   City

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Municipal and Local Government

Ordinances  contain provisions for the  registration

and  licensing of non-motor vehicles such as  carts,

trishaws  and  bicycles. There are  also  provisions

regulating  the conduct of personnel who drive  such

vehicles,  as well as provisions which regulate  the

operation  of  public  service  vehicles,  as,   for

example,  hired cars or taxis as they  are  commonly

known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, may I briefly state the situation which

will  arise  on integration? The City  Council  will

cease  to exist. Responsibility for the Registry  of

Vehicles  will  he transferred to the  Deputy  Prime

Minister's  portfolio. The Municipal  Ordinance  and

the Local Government Ordinance will be repealed, and

it   will   be  clearly  necessary  for  alternative

legislation  to  be  enacted to  replace  all  those

provisions,  under which the Registrar  of  Vehicles

functions   at  present,  in  respect  of  non-motor

vehicles  and  of  public service vehicles.  I  must

explain,  Sir,  that although the direct  effect  of

integration will be the transfer of the Registry  of

Vehicles  from  the City Council to the  Government,

there   have  also  been  other  operations   which,

although they have no direct bearing on integration,

have nevertheless been undertaken in the context  of

such integration. First, the responsibility for  the

issue   of   ordinary  driving  licences   will   be

transferred  from  the Police to  the  Registrar  of

Vehicles.   Secondly,   whereas   at   present   the

responsibility for enforcement of the provisions  of

the Road Traffic Ordinance is shared between the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



Police  and the Registrar, this responsibility  will

in  future  devolve wholely on the Police.  Thirdly,

the function of compounding traffic offences will be

transferred from the Police, who now exercise it, to

District Judges and Magistrates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is empowered to make rules to prescribe, inter alia, the offences which may be

compounded  and the amount which may be  offered  by

way  of  composition in respect of any such offence.

It  is proposed to set out in such rules a scale  of

amounts  which may be offered by way of  composition

for such offences, and, within the limits specified,

District   Judges   and   Magistrates   will    have

discretionary  power  to offer  the  offenders  such

amounts as they think fit with a view to compounding

the  offences  in  question.  For  any  compoundable

traffic  offence  which is repeated,  the  scale  of

composition  rates will he increased  for  a  second

offence and for third and subsequent offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, Sir, that in amending the Road

Traffic Ordinance the opportunity has been taken  to

bring  certain  traffic offences in  line  with  the

legislation  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  in   the

Federation  of  Malaya.  It  is  also  proposed   to

introduce  a  system  of  service  of  summonses  by

registered  post,  which  is  designed  to  conserve

Police manpower. Further, the provisions of the Road

Traffic  Ordinance are to be extended to two  areas,

the Naval Base and Pulau Bukom, with the concurrence

of the authorities concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I would like, for a moment, to

revert  to  the  subject  of  the  registration  and

licensing of non-motor vehicles which was previously

carried  out  under the provisions of the  Municipal

Ordinance,  but  which, as the Bill now  before  the

House envisages, will in future be carried out under

the  provisions of the Road Traffic Ordinance.  Now,

Sir,  a  perusal  of  Part I of  the  existing  Road

Traffic  Ordinance  will  show  that  the  Ordinance

already provides satisfactory machinery for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



collection  of  revenue by way of  registration  and

licence in respect of motor vehicles. It seemed both

simple  and appropriate to adapt this machinery  for

the  collection of revenue in respect  of  non-motor

vehicles  as well. Under the existing provisions  of

the   Municipal   Ordinance  and  Local   Government

Ordinance, non-motor vehicles (except bicycles) were

either  registered  annually or taxed  annually,  or

both. In future, it is proposed that these non-motor

vehicles  (except bicycles) will be treated  exactly

in  the same way as motor vehicles, that is to  say,

registered once and for all and licensed  annually.

The  method  adopted in the Bill  was  generally  to

remove the word "motor" from the provisions of  Part

I  of the Road Traffic Ordinance, which, ipso facto,

makes  that  Part  applicable to all  vehicles.  The

level  and quantum of licence fees will be  designed

so  that  these  fees  will be equated  to  the  tax

previously paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licensing of public service vehicles - taxis

and  buses - is a quite separate exercise, and  a  new

Part  II  has been introduced in the Bill  for  this

purpose.  This new Part reproduces the corresponding

provisions of the Local Government Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the transfer from the Police to the

Registrar  of  Vehicles of the function  of  issuing

driving licences, the deletion of references to  the

Deputy  Commissioner of Police, who was the previous

licensing officer, and the substitution therefor  of

references to the Registrar of Vehicles in  sections

13  to  21  of  the  Road Traffic  Ordinance  (which

correspond  to  clauses 13 to 21 of  the  Bill)  has

given effect to the intention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of roads in section 2 of the Road

Traffic  Ordinance has been amended, as hon. Members

will  observe  on  a  perusal of the  definition  of

"road"  in  clause  2  of the  Bill.  A  "road"  now

includes any road in Pulau Bukom and any road within

the  Naval Base. As I explained earlier, the  effect

of  this definition will be to extend the provisions

of the Road Traffic Ordinance to these two areas.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to draw the attention of

hon.  Members to clauses 24 to 28 of the Bill  which

relate  to  reckless or dangerous  driving;  driving

without   due   care  or  reasonable  consideration;

causing  death  by  reckless or  dangerous  driving;

driving while under the influence of drink or drugs;

and  being  in charge of a motor vehicle when  under

the  influence of drink or drugs. These  provisions,

as  I mentioned earlier, have been brought into line

with  Federation and United Kingdom legislation.  It

is  worthy  of note that a specific penalty  is  now

provided  for  causing  death  by  driving  a  motor

vehicle  recklessly or at a speed  or  in  a  manner

which is dangerous to the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the amendments to which I have

referred, the Road Traffic Bill retains the form and

substance of the present Road Traffic Ordinance. For

convenience of reference, I have caused to be placed

at  the  end  of  each  clause  of  the  Bill  which

corresponds  to  a  section  in  the  Road   Traffic

Ordinance,  the  section number  of  the  Ordinance,

except in cases where the provision is a new one not

previously contained in the Ordinance or is based on

other legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is only one aspect of the Bill which I wish to

deal  with and which the Minister passed over  quite

cursorily in his Second reading speech. That is  the

question  of  the removal of the power  to  compound

from  the Police into the hands of a District  Judge

or  a  Magistrate.  Sir, I am  not  questioning  the

desirability  of  the  provision  of  the  power  to

compound,  but what is exercising my mind,  Sir,  is

whether  it is desirable to transfer this  power  to

compound  from the Police, as it now  exists,  to  a

District Judge or a Magistrate. I had hoped that the

Minister would give some reason for this transfer of

power   from  the  Police  to  a  Magistrate,   but,

unfortunately, he did not touch upon it.  I  do  not

know whether the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



are, on principle, objecting to a Government servant

exercising  the power to compound, or  whether  they

are thinking that the power to compound in the hands

of  a  District Judge or a Magistrate might be  used

more  expeditiously and to the satisfaction  of  all

parties concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard in this House how difficult it

is  to get work through the Courts, because they are

congested, and the difficulty of getting Magistrates

and District Judges. If that is a correct statement,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am wondering whether a transfer

of  the  power  to compound from the Police  to  the

Magistracy would not involve the Magistracy in  more

work  and,  therefore,  tend  to  inconvenience  the

public  in  so far as these offences in  respect  of

which  compositions could be effected are concerned.

I  myself do not know how many of such offences  are

compounded per day or per week, but if the number is

large,  Mr Speaker, Sir, then I feel that  possibly

this  provision,  however desirable  it  may  be  in

principle, might lead to the position where, because

of  the bottleneck in the District Courts, work will

be  held up. Now, the clause as worded here  in  the

Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, envisages the offences being

spotted  by  the  Traffic  Police,  and  where   the

offences  are  of  a  nature  where  compounding  is

possible,  then  I take it the Traffic  Police  will

then  refer  them  to  the  District  Judge  or  the

Magistrate  as  the  case  may  be,  and  then   the

Magistrate,  I take it, would have to issue  notices

to the persons concerned offering them a composition

in  respect of the offence. All this means  work  in

the Magistracy, and whether that is going to lead to

a  bottleneck  and clogging up of the  clearance  of

these  offences, I myself am not in  a  position  to

say. But I pose the question to the Minister, and if

he is reasonably satisfied that this is not going to

cause  dislocation, then I have nothing  further  to

say.  But  I  wish to make this point, that  if  the

Government  is introducing clause 79 merely  because

it  objects to a Government servant exercising  this

power, then I would like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



to remind the Hon. the Minister that under the

Customs Ordinance the power to compound is still

with the Senior Customs Officer.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No other Member wishes to speak? I

would suggest that perhaps a more convenient way  of

dealing  with the subject raised by the  Member  for

Farrer  Park would be in Committee, because it  only

deals  with one clause, and when we come  to  clause

79,  perhaps the Minister would like to reply  then.

We  are  debating now the general principles of  the

Bill.  Does the Minister wish to reply to that  now?

It is the only point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the reason why we

have  taken away the powers of compounding  offences

from  the  Traffic  Police and placed  them  in  the

District  Judges  is that under the new  integration

arrangements it is proposed that all the duties with

regard  to  enforcement  should  be  vested  in  the

Traffic Police, and it is felt that it is only right

and  just  that  in  that  situation  the  power  of

compounding  offences should  be  removed  from  the

Traffic  Police  and  placed in  the  hands  of  the

District  Judges  and Magistrates.  To  prevent  the

Police  from being cluttered up with a lot  of  this

work,  it is provided that the Minister should  make

Rules  setting out the circumstances under which  an

offence can be compounded and also the limits of the

fines  in  respect  of  the offences  which  can  be

compounded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been found that the

Traffic  Police  tend to deal with  these  cases  of

compounding  in  a very perfunctory manner.  It  has

been  brought  to my attention that sometimes  first

offenders are fined the maximum that is provided for

the offence under the present system of compounding.

It  is provided that the Minister can make Rules for

the compounding of these offences. The limits of the

fines  can  be  set  out under  these  Rules  and  a

graduated  scale  of fines worked  out.  Under  this

system, it will be quite easy for the District Judge

or   the   Magistrate  to  assess  the  penalty   if

compounding is allowed. Say there is a first offence

of  driving without lights. In that case,  the  fine

for that particular type of offence can be laid down

in  the  graduated scale of fines. If it occurs  for

the first time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>



then  all  that the District Judge or the Magistrate

will  be required to do is to say that he imposes  a

penalty of $5. If it happens a second time,  he  can

increase the fine according to the graduated  scale.

In  these Rules, it can also be provided that  if  a

motorist has taken due heed of his previous breaches

of the traffic regulations - say after a period of one

or more years he has a clean slate - but he is brought

up  again,  then he cannot be fined the maximum  for

the  offence  but  he  can be  treated  as  a  first

offender.  That  is the purpose  of  this  scale  of

fines.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it will

lead  to  the  Police  Courts and  the  Magistrates'

Courts  being  concerned with a  greater  amount  of

work. I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that that will meet

the objections of the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take it that as the

enforcing  authority  under  this  Bill  will  still

continue  to  be the Traffic Police, therefore,  the

offence  in respect of which the powers to compound

will  arise will necessarily come to the  notice  of

the  police  in  the  first  instance.  The  present

position  is  this. The offence having come  to  the

notice  of  the Traffic Police, they might  issue  a

notice to compound from the Office itself. But under

the  altered  system envisaged  by  clause  79,  the

police,  having come to know of such a  compoundable

offence,  will have to take that offence  away  from

its  own  Department  and carry  it  (possibly  some

departmental  instruction will go with  it)  to  the

Traffic  Court  may be, either the Traffic  District

Judge  or any Magistrate there. And I take  it  that

every  Monday  morning,  or  Wednesday  morning,  or

Friday  morning, as the case may be, there  will  be

this  traffic  officer with all  these  compoundable

offences,  and he will have to interview either  the

District  Judge or the Magistrate, and  give  him  a

list  of  all these offences. Whereupon the District

Judge  or  the Magistrate will then have to instruct

his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



usher  or  somebody in his section to prepare  these

notices  to the various offenders, offering  them  a

composition.  The traffic offender  can  refuse  the

composition,  and if he does, then, of  course,  the

Traffic  Police will have to determine whether  they

wish  to  lodge  a  prosecution  against  him.   So,

therefore,  you  get these two extra  administrative

steps  which become necessary if clause  79  becomes

law.  It tends to increase the administrative  work,

although  I  appreciate the principle enunciated  by

the  Minister  for  Labour and Law  that  where  the

Traffic Police themselves are, shall I say, catching

the offenders, it is not desirable to leave them  to

adjudicate upon the composition; but that  principle

has  been accepted by the Government and it is still

being   carried  out  by  them  under  the   Customs

Ordinance.  There  are customs  officers  going  for

customs offences, and yet the senior customs officer

is  given authority to compound. So, therefore, that

principle in itself cannot be raised in this matter,

because that has been conceded by the Government  so

far as the Customs Department is concerned. However,

Sir,  I  do not wish to press the point. But I  only

raise it because I thought it might affect the  easy

manner in which these cases have been dealt with.  I

remember when this question was first mooted in  the

Legislative  Council, I think it was some  seven  or

eight  years  ago, the reason why  the  police  were

given this power was for them to get all these minor

traffic offences out of the District Courts  or  the

Police Courts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all these are

administrative duties that we are taking  away  from

the  Traffic  Police; they are concerned  only  with

enforcement. I agree there will be some  extra  work

for  the  District Judges and Magistrates, but  they

will have the staff to cope with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a short Bill which seeks to provide that a

person who has passed

the final examination for the degree of Bachelor of

Laws in the University of

Malaya shall be regarded as a qualified person for

the purposes of the Advocates

and Solicitors Ordinance. The effect is that such a

person will be able to read

in Chambers (and if no other amendment is made to

the Advocates and Solicitors Ordinance), to apply for admission as an

advocate and solicitor after having attended and received instruction in

law in the office of an advocate  and solicitor of not less than seven years'

standing for a period of not





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



less than twelve months. This is, however, intended

to be an interim measure

and it is hoped that a more comprehensive amending

Ordinance will be

introduced later in the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of how a graduate in law of the

University of Malaya will be allowed to qualify for admission as an advocate and

solicitor of the Supreme

Court in Singapore and in the Federation of Malaya

has been discussed over the

past few years. There has been general agreement on

the main principle that

the degree of LL.B. of the University of Malaya

should be recognised as a qualification

for admission to the local Bars and that

there should be a short period

of articles or reading in Chambers before the

graduate is admitted as an advocate

and solicitor. It has unfortunately not, however,

been possible to get agreement

on all the details of the amendments that are

needed. The Committee set up

by the Government of the Federation on which there

are representatives of the

Singapore Government and the University, have only

recently completed its

deliberations and the recommendations of Ihe

Committee will have to be

accepted by the two Governments and the Bar

Committee of Singapore and

the Bar Council of the Federation of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



Malaya. It has, therefore, not been possible for  us

to introduce the comprehensive   Bill   to  amend  the   Advocates   and

Solicitors Ordinance. As, however,

the  Faculty of Law of the University of Malaya  has

already produced its first

graduates and as these graduates have already joined

the Government service

or  begun to read in Chambers, it is felt that  some

interim legislation should be

enacted to define their position. The Bill refers to

the  passing  of  the examination  and  not  to  the

possession of the degree,

as the degrees are not now conferred till six months

after the final examinations.   Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I signify

that  I  have received the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation that the Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of the Bill is to bring the Stamp

Ordinance up-to-date in the

light  of  past  experience  in  order  to  overcome

certain  administrative difficulties encountered  in

the past, and to improve

efficiency in administering the Stamp Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to eliminate unnecessary delay and

administrative inconvenience, it

is  now  proposed  to  empower the  Commissioner  of

Stamps to delegate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



powers,  functions and duties vested in him  by  the

Ordinance to any person

having   official   duty   or   employed   in    the

admimstration of the Stamp Ordinance.

For the same reason, it is proposed to transfer the

powers to authorise the

officer  in  charge  of any Stamp  Office  to  issue

imprest stamps, to issue a licence giving permission

to use a franking

machine to pay stamp duty and to authorise any  bank

doing business in

Singapore to compound for the payment of duty on any

unstamped cheques,

from the Minister to the Commissioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also aims at tightening up the provisions

to deal with evasion more

effectively.  It provides that only  stamps  of  the

State  of  Singapore shall be used  for  payment  of

stamp  duty.  At  present  the  Ordinance  does  not

specify the

period  within which an instrument should be stamped

after adjudication by

the  Commissioner  so that the Commissioner  has  no

power to compel the taxpayer  to  have such instrument stamped  within  any

specified period. Clause 6 of

the  Bill  provides  that such instrument  shall  be

stamped within 14 days after

notice  of  the assessment made by the Commissioner,

or within 14 days after

the  issue of the Order of the High Court or  within

such further period specified

by  the  Commissioner or High Court as the case  may

be. This will assist the

Commissioner  in the collection of duty  payable  by

the taxpayer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, under section 45 of the Ordinance,

transfers, of shares cannot be

stamped  until the number of shares are entered.  In

view of the fact that certain

types  of  shares now no longer carry distinguishing

numbers, provision is now

made  by  clause  7  of  the  Bill  to  empower  the

Commissioner in suitable cases to permit a  transfer

of shares to be stamped even though the number of

shares is not entered in the transfer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 of the Bill provides that where an

instrument is to be stamped

vvithin  a  certain  period  after  execution,  such

period shall commence on the day

after the execution of the instrument.

Clause  11  provides for the right of Government  to

claim duty which has

been under-assessed and to recover



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



penalty  in respect of offences committed under  the

Ordinance,  and clause 12 is designed to tighten  up

the provisions relating to such penalty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8, 10 and 13 of the Bill provide

respectively   for   consequential   amendments   to

sections  46,  53 and 63 of the Ordinance  following

the  revision of the rates of duty under Schedule  A

by the Stamp (Amendment) Ordinance, 1952.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also gives effect to the proposal to

raise   the   practising  fee   of   Advocates   and

Solicitors, which was announced by the Minister  for

Finance   in  his  Budget  Statement  on  the   29th

November, 1960.

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as hon. Members can see from the Explanatory

Statement, this Winding Up Bill seeks to wind up the

Certificates  Fund  constituted  under  the  Victory

Savings Certificates Ordinance, 1946.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal Ordinance was passed on 10th

October,   1946,   and  under  its  provisions   the

Certificates  Fund  was set up to  borrow  money  to

provide for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



reconstruction of capital works after World War  II.

Certificates were sold at a discounted value of  $15

each,  and  when they reached maturity in  10  years

from the date of issue, holders were entitled to $20

per  certificate. Redemptions were allowed any  time

before  the  expiry  of 10 years and  the  surrender

values of a unit certificate were graduated from $15

when  less than one year to $20 on completion of  10

years.  Certificates were sold from  1946  to  1950,

when  sales were terminated. The total sale  of  the

certificates was only $809,542.50.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the buyers of the certificates started

handing in their certificates for redemption  within

a  year after the certificates were introduced,  and

after 1948 the amount of certificates presented for

redemption was more than the amount sold. As stated,

the  date  of maturity of certificates is  10  years

from date of issue. Since the last certificates were

sold in 1950, all the certificates sold have matured

and  no certificates will earn interest after  1960.

Therefore, it is now proposed to wind up the Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains provisions which are largely

procedural.  Clause 5 provides that not  later  than

six  months after the coming into operation  of  the

Ordinance, the assets of the Fund shall be converted

into   cash  and  used  to  settle  all  outstanding

principal   and  interest  payments  on   unredeemed

certificates.  Notice is to be given to  holders  of

unredeemed certificates so that they will have ample

warning that the Fund is going to be wound up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any dispute regarding any payment or

repayment,  the  Minister may pay  the  amount  into

court  or  may make other appropriate provision  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all claims have been paid or provided for,

the  balance,  if  any,  is to  be  paid  into  the

Consolidated Fund.
