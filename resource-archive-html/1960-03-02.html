<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>TENANTS OF ALSAGOFF ESTATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Protection against eviction)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Prime Minister, in view of the impending break  up

of the Alsagoff Trust, which includes the Alsagoff

Estate,  what  steps will the Government  take  to

ensure the protection of the tenants of the Estate

against eviction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime</b>

<b>Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked by

the Prime Minister to reply to the question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alsagoff Estate is a private Estate and the

Government  has  no information on  any  impending

hypothetical situation.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  has

further information, could he enlighten us on this

matter?  Could the Government use its  legislative

power  under  the  Land Acquisition  Ordinance  to

purchase the Estate, divide it into lots and later

on sell the lots to the present tenants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Sir, I require further notice

of  that  question. All I can say is that it  does

not  seem  likely that the situation of  wholesale

eviction of the tenants will arise. Like the other

tenants, in Singapore, the Control of Rent  Ordinance will afford them some protection.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LAND IN JALAN EUNOS MALAY SETTLEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Applications for allotment received, approved and rejected)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister  how  many applications for allotment  of

land  in  the  Jalan Eunos Malay  Settlement  were

received   since   June  1959;   how   many   such

applications were approved and how



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



many rejected; and what does the Government intend

to do with the remaining applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime</b>

<b>Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also been

asked  by  the  Prime Minister to  reply  to  this

question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been 1,174 applications since June

1959.  There  have  been  no  allocations  and  no

rejections.  The basis of future allocations  will

be according to a points system under which regard

is  taken  of income, size of family and  existing

living  conditions.  Seventy-seven  lots  are  now

available and will be allocated in March or  April

in accordance with the points system.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  require a definite reply from the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Prime Minister as to whether  or

not  the  rejected applicants who have paid  their

deposits will be given further consideration  when

applications are invited again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>OFFICIAL LANGUAGE OF STATE OF SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister whether the Government will make Malay as

the  only  official  language  of  the  State   of

Singapore;  when will that be done;  and  for  how

long  will  English be retained  as  the  official

language   in  the  administration  of  Government

Departments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): It is at present

impossible  for the Government to say whether,  or

when, Malay will be the only official language  of

the  State  of Singapore. Until Malay  has  become

sufficiently understood and adequately mastered by

the civil service and political leaders, it is not

practical  to  talk of Malay as the only  official

language. In these matters, we shall closely watch

and  learn from the progress and experience of the

Government of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to sum up, "It is the heart's desire

to  embrace the mountain, but of no avail as it is

beyond arm's reach."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): The answer is

ambiguous. Could I receive a definite reply as  to

why  it  is  impossible  for  the  Government   to

implement the policy of making Malay the  official

language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I have

explained just now that, at the present moment, it

is  impossible to say whether, or when, Malay will

be  the  only  official language of the  State  of

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ELECTRICITY SUPPLY TO JOHORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Prime

Minister  what was the total revenue for the  year

1959 from the electricity supplied by Singapore to

Johore,  and what is the policy of the  Government

in regard to the continuance of such supply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime</b>

<b>Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, I have been asked by the

Prime Minister to answer this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total revenue for the year 1959 from

electricity  supplied by Singapore to  Johore  was

approximately  $1.57 million which  is  3.97  per

cent of the total sales for 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This supply of electricity to Johore will

continue  until  the  Central Electricity  Board's

proposed new Power Station at Johore Bahru  is  in

operation.  The electrical connections can  remain

as a standby after that date if required.

<div align="center"><b>CRIME STATISTICS FOR 1959</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Home Affairs to state the half-yearly figures

for  1959  in respect of (i) each type of  offence

committed  and classified under "offences  against

the  person" and "offences against property",  and

(ii) the number of secret society incidents.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC CONCERN OVER INCREASE IN CRIMES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr A. P. Rajah</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs whether he is aware of the, growing public

concern  over the increase in crimes in  the  last

few  months, and if he will state what  steps  the

Government  proposes to take or is taking  in  the

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no

justification for growing concern because  serious

crime has, in fact, gone down during the last four

months since the Government began its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



relentless campaign against criminal elements.  In

particular,   the   figures  of   secret   society

incidents have dropped from 175 in the four months

between  1st  February and 31st May, 1959,  to  99

between 1st October, 1959, and 31st January, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am rather surprised to note that the Member

for  Farrer  Park should now express  his  concern

when  not so long ago he criticised the Government

for strengthening the law against motor vehicle of

fences  because he was so worried in case his  car

might be confiscated by Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures being taken and which will continue

to  be taken are the detention and supervision  of

criminals   under  the  Criminal  Law   (Temporary

Provisions)   Ordinance,   the   more    intensive

application  of  the  various  Ordinances   passed

recently,   the  maximum  use  of  Police   mobile

reserves  for  systematic patrolling  of  the  bad

areas,    recruiting   to   the    full    present

establishment,   strengthening  of   the   C.I.D.,

increased  training for detective police  officers

and  the  building  up  of  the  already  improved

police/public relations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister for

Home  Affairs  aware of the fact that  during  the

months of January and February this year well-nigh

20  murders have been committed in Singapore,  and

does   he   think  that  that  is  not  a  serious

situation?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am hot

certain whether the Member for Farrer Park has got

his figures correct, that there were more than  20

murders  in  January  and  February.  I  think   a

distinction  must be made between  secret  society

murders and crimes of passion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member next to him for some reason or

other were to plunge a knife into his friend,  the

Police  could not stop it. What the Police can  do

is  to  try to bring down the incidence of  secret

society murders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, like the Minister for Home

Affairs,  I  am not interested in crime passionnel

but  I  am  interested in the rate of murder  that

goes on in Singapore at the moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 1958, Mr Speaker, Sir, according to

the Singapore Annual Report, there were in all  42

murders;  but for the months January and  February

in  the  year  1960,  well-nigh  20  murders  have

already been committed, and if this rate of murder

is maintained, Singapore will certainly -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Have a decreasing population!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes, it certainly will take unto

itself   the   reputation  of   being   the   most

"murderous" State in the world!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member and every

other  Member must realise that this  is  Question

Time   and   supplementary  questions   only   are

permitted, not statements.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, for the

information of the Member for Farrer Park, between

1st February and 31st May, 1959, six secret society

murders were committed; between 1st June and  30th

September,  1959, six murders were  committed;  and

between  1st October, 1959, and 31st January,  1960,

there were only four secret society murders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A supplementary question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Yes. Will the Minister be willing to

give the figures for February, 1960?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Today is the 2nd of March

seven days. Can the Minister tell us whether it is

an  accident that all the murders happened  to  be

committed during those seven days, or whether that

shows a rise in murder cases in Singapore?

<div align="center"><b>FREE EDUCATION FOR MALAYS IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Estimated Expenditure in 1960)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> asked the

Minister  for  Education  what  is  the  estimated

expenditure  on  free  education  for  Malays   in

secondary  schools  in  1960,  and  whether   free

education includes the provision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



textbooks and exemption from payment of  fees  for

extra-curricular activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an

estimated  number of 4,700 Malay pupils  attending

post  primary and secondary schools in the English

and   Malay  streams  in  Singapore.  Since   free

secondary  education for Malays will be restricted

to  those who are either born in Singapore or  are

children of Singapore citizens, not all the  4,700

Malay  pupils  will  qualify  for  free  secondary

education.  But  on the basis of 4,000,  say,  the

total  estimated loss in revenue for remission  of

school fees would be in the region of $150,000 per

annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free secondary education scheme for Malays

will not include free textbooks nor exemption from

payment  of  fees for extra-curricular activities.

The   present  free  textbook  loan  scheme   will

continue  to operate in accordance with the  means

test applicable to all children, that is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the family income is below $150 per

month,  and  two  or  three  children   are

attending school, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if the family income is less than $200 per

month,  and  four  or more children  attend

school.

<br><br>

The  total  1960 vote for the free  textbook  loan

scheme  is  $150,000,  of  which  $50,000  is  for

secondary  schools. According to 1959  experience,

this  sum  should be adequate for 1960. Should  it

prove inadequate during the course of the year, an

application for supplementary vote will be made as

usual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the remission of miscellaneous fees

for  extra-curricular activities,  the  discretion

will  continue  to be exercised by  principals  of

schools.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai):</b>

Will  the  Minister inform the House whether  this

figure  of  $150,000 for the textbook loan  scheme

includes  provision  for all  school  children  in

secondary  schools, or is it meant only for  Malay

students in secondary schools?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stated

that  the  total 1960 vote for the  free  textbook

loan  scheme  is  $150,000, of  which  $50,000  is

applicable to secondary schools and is  meant  for

all   secondary  schools,  not  necessarily  Malay

pupils.  I  would  further add  that  there  is  a

special quota for Malay pupils, in that they get a

double  quota - that  is,  if  the  enrolment  in  a

certain school deserves a book loan of $300,  that

school  would have its loan increased to  $600  if

its  pupils  are composed entirely  of  Malays.  A

double  quota is especially made for Malay  pupils

in our schools.

Parliamentary  Secretary can now move  the  Second

<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to provide for the

registration  and  control of all  mutual  benefit

organisations as defined in clause 2 of the  Bill.

A  number  of  such organisations are  at  present

registered under the Business Names Ordinance, the

Companies  Ordinance  or the Societies  Ordinance,

but  it is proposed that in future all such mutual

benefit  organisations should be registered  under

the provisions of the new Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing mutual benefit organisations which are

registered  under the Business Names Ordinance  or

the  Companies Ordinance are required to apply for

registration under the new Ordinance within thirty

days   of  the  coming  into  operation  of   this

Ordinance,   while  mutual  benefit  organisations

registered or exempted from registration under the

Societies  Ordinance  are required  to  apply  for

registration  under the new Ordinance  within  one

year  of the date of coming into operation of this

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this difference is that, while it

is   possible   to  have  some  control   of   the

organisations concerned if they are registered  or

exempted  under the Societies Ordinance,  no  such

control  is  possible if they have been registered

under   the  Business  Names  Ordinance   or   the

Companies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is necessary for me to

elaborate  on  the reasons and the  need  for  the

registration  and control of such  mutual  benefit

organisations. Unless strict control  is  kept  on

the  activities of such organisations, there is  a

possibility  of  persons  being  cheated  of   the

moneys, which they have saved for their old age or

for the benefit of their dependants. In the United

Kingdom,  the  activities of similar organisations

are  controlled by the Friendly Societies Act, and

in  the Federation there are special provisions in

the Societies Ordinance to deal with death benefit

societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal provisions of the Bill are dealt

with in the Explanatory Statement of the Bill, and

I  feel  it is unnecessary for me to elaborate  on

them. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



provisions  of  the Bill are, to a  large  extent,

based  on those of the Friendly Societies  Act  of

the  United  Kingdom, though some  provisions  are

taken from the Federation Societies Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is complementary to the Societies

(Amendment) Bill and, in order that the provisions

of  the Bill can be examined in detail, I propose,

when  the Bill is read a Second time, to move that

it be referred to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of

Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven other Members to

be  nominated  by the Committee of Selection.-[Mr

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very short and simple Bill, which

seeks  to  repeal  the Local Government  Elections

Ordinance,  1957, which is no longer  required  as

there  will  no  longer be  any  City  Council  or

District  Council elections. This  is  in  keeping

with the declared policy of the present Government

to   have   unified  administration  in  Singapore

instead  of two parallel administrations,  namely,

Central Government and Local Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the absorption by the

Central  Government of the City  Council  and  the

Rural  Board, which was to be replaced by District

Councils, and the integration of the various Local

Government bodies with the various departments  of

the Central Government, are already in the process

of  implementation. With the abolition, therefore,

of these Local Government bodies, the need for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



election  to  such  bodies  does  not  arise;  and

therefore    the   Local   Government    Elections

Ordinance, 1957, can now be repealed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].

amendment; read the Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1)

of  section  174  of the Labour  Ordinance,  1955

(No.  40  of  1955),  resolves  that  the  Labour

Regulations, 1959, published as Notification  No.

S  (N.S.) 63 in the Gazette Supplement No. 16  of

21st  August,  1959, as contained  in  Paper  S.L.

(New Series) 10 of 1959, be approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Labour Regulations, 1959,

were presented to the Legislative Assembly on  the

29th August, 1959. These regulations were made  to

require  employers  of workmen to  keep  registers

showing  particulars  regarding  their  employees,

such  as wages and allowances due during each wage

period  and details of holidays, annual leave  and

sick leave. They have not as yet been approved  by

a  resolution  of the Assembly, and are  therefore

not in force. To



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



bring  these regulations into force, it  would  be

necessary  for  a resolution to be passed  in  the

Assembly as provided in section 174 of the  Labour

Ordinance,  1955.  Hence  the  necessity  of  this

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have repeatedly pointed out

that  this  Government has had to carry  the  baby

because  of the lapses of the previous Government,

and  I  should like to draw the attention  of  the

House  to the fact that it was necessary for  this

Government to introduce regulations to enforce the

provisions  of  the  Labour  Ordinance  which  was

passed by the previous Government in 1955. Sir,  I

now  move  that this Assembly approves the  Labour

Regulations, 1959, as presented to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

into  existence another new place of safety  under
