<div align="center"><b>PANDAN FOREST RESERVE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Prawn pond development)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  by what method he proposes to let  out  for

development  as prawn ponds the area  in  the  Pandan

Forest  Reserve  other  than  the  200  acres  to  be

reserved for development on a co-operative basis.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I have not had sufficient

time to decide on the method yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Is it true that

there   have  already  been  many  applications   for

development of this area?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3010</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> That is so, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Is the Minister considering the

letting  out  of  the  land for development  by  such

applications  or  is  he having  the  whole  question

considered afresh?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> As I said, Sir, I have not had

much time to give the matter thought.

<div align="center"><b>BANNING OF PIG-KEEPING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BY WAR DEPARTMENT IN ULU PANDAN AND PASIR PANJANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and

Industry  whether he is aware that the War Department

is  banning pig-keeping by farmers who are tenants on

War Department Land in a large area of Ulu Pandan and

Pasir  Panjang  from  31st January,  1958;  and  what

action  he  proposes  to  take  to  ensure  that  the

livelihood of these farmers is safeguarded.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Yes, Sir, I am aware that this

has  been proposed in certain areas. Discussions have

been  held in my Ministry with the Ministry of Health

and  the  Ministry  of  Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing  and  the  latter  has  now  approached   the

appropriate  military authority with  suggestions  to

protect  the  interests of both parties, namely,  the

Services  as  well as the smallholders. It  is  hoped

that these suggestions will prove acceptable.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware

that some 150 families with a production of something

like 10,000 pigs per year are involved and that there

will  be  considerable  hardship  not  only  to   the

families   but  also  in  our  markets  if  something

stringent is not done?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Ministry is doing all

it can.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Will the Minister undertake as a first step

to  see  that any action due to be taken by  the  War

Department  on or after 1st February, 1958,  will  be

postponed?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3011</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The military authorities have

been approached, Sir, on these lines.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> I thank the Minister for the action he

intends taking now and would inform him that I  shall

put  down  a further Question at the January  sitting

for the Minister to report the progress.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> There is no question of "intends

taking". Sir, action is already being taken  and  the

hon. Member is welcome to ask further Questions.

<div align="center"><b>PUBLICATION OF DATA ON PRAWN BIOLOGY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Minister for Commerce and

Industry whether he will, have arrangements made  for

the  Department of Fisheries to publish its  data  on

prawn   biology  for  general  information  and,   in

particular,  for prawn-pond operators and  interested

scientists.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, this has already been done.

The  Chief  Fisheries  Officer.  Singapore,  has,  in

simple  terms, outlined the salient features  of  the

biology  of  the Peneid prawns, which would  interest

the  ordinary  man, in an article based  on  research

reports by American biologists published in the Rural

News  Vol.  1, No. 11, dated 9th August,  1956.  This

article was written for the information of prawn-pond

operators and others who may be interested.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Minister see

that  data of interest to expert biologists concerned

is also made available?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, scientists and others who

wish   for   further  data  are   referred   to   the

publications  in  the  American Biological  Bulletin,

Vol.  196,  No. 2 of 1949, giving the result  of  the

work on the biology of the Peneid prawns carried  out

by Drs. W. N. Anderson, J. E. King and M. J. Linder.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Is the Minister aware that those are the

findings  of American biologists in a different  part

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3012</b></font><br><br>



world?  Will  he  have  the  data  gathered  by   the

Department  of  Fisheries in Singapore published  for

the interest of scientists?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, publishing data for the

information of scientists is not the function of  the

Ministry   of  Commerce  and  Industry.  That   could

properly be taken up by the University of Malaya  and

other seats of academic research and information.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does that mean in fact

that  the  Department of Fisheries has no  scientific

data  at its disposal? Further, is the Minister aware

that  as  the  data  gathered by  the  Department  of

Fisheries  clearly differs from that of other  expert

biologists, it is in the public interest that  it  be

published?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the data that the

Department  of Fisheries has is from the  results  of

investigations made by these three American doctors I

quoted.  Anyone who is interested in getting detailed

information  on the data could refer to the  American

Biological Bulletin which I have already quoted in my

earlier answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> If the Minister is unwilling to have data

gathered  by the Department of Fisheries,  Singapore,

published, does it not only go to show that there  is

considerable  doubt  as  to  the  reasonableness   of

alienating the Pandan Nature Reserve?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are embarking on a debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, may I answer it?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, if the Minister wishes to answer

it.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> As I have said, Sir, the

Fisheries Department has made no research of its own.

That  was  the job of the fisheries research  station

which  had  the "Manihine" here but we  do  not  know

whether  research has been made on these  lines.  The

Fisheries  Department  has  data  gathered  from  the

research carried out by those American biologists and

I  am not aware of any other scientific study made by

any other group.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3013</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Is the Minister not aware that the answer

is extremely unsatisfactory? We give notice that we

shall raise this matter again.

<div align="center"><b>APPROPRIATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply:

[1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>10.10 a.m.



<div align="center"><b>FIRST SCHEDULE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 1 be reduced by

$1,800 in respect of item (20) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this we hope is the last Budget in which the

item  "Governor"  will appear on the Estimates.  Next

year,  the  title will be changed to Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara. The expenses may not decrease but what we  do

not  wish  to have appearing next year are allowances

for  persons who act in place of the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  if  he  should go away for  a  holiday.  Sir,

before I launch into a tirade at the officers who are

going  to collect this $1,800, I would like  to  know

from  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary  how   the

computation is made.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> In

accordance  with the practice in other colonies,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, it has been the practice since 1953  to

pay  the Officer Administering the Government in  the

absence of His Excellency the Governor 95 per cent of

the basic emoluments of the Governor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> 95 per cent of the basic

emoluments   of  the  Governor,  not  the  difference

between the substantive holder's pay and the  pay  of

the Governor?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Perhaps I might explain it in another way,

Sir.  We pay the Officer Administering the Government

an  allowance to bring his total emoluments up to  95

per cent of the Governor's basic salary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3014</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could we know who is sharing this

$1,800?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I cannot look into the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As far as we can see, Sir, the

only   people  who  act  as  Governors  or   Officers

Administering   the  Government  are   the   colonial

officials. It seems to me that this is a nice  little

racket  ever  since 1953 when they were running  this

Chamber.  They create tradition. They  never  did  it

before.  In  1953, they thought it was a  good  idea:

"Give ourselves more money." Why not? This money does

not  belong  to  them; it belongs to  the  people  of

Singapore!



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> On a point of information, Sir. Prior to

1953, under the Governor's Ordinance - I think that  is

the title of the Ordinance - it was the practice to pay

the  Officer  Administering the Government  half  the

Governor's  basic salary and half his own salary.  In

1953, we brought our practice into line with that  of

the  rest  of the colonial dependencies and paid  the

Officer Administering the Government a sum sufficient

to  bring his total emoluments up to 95 per  cent  of

the Governor's basic salary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And while the Governor is on

holiday, at the same time I presume he draws his full

Governor's pay?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the hon. Member should now

make his speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes. What we would like to say is

this.  If we want to give everybody money all  round,

why  not  do  it also for the elected Ministers?  The

Chief  Minister goes off on holiday; the Deputy Chief

Minister  gets  an  acting  pay.  The  Deputy   Chief

Minister  becomes  the  Acting  Chief  Minister,  his

Assistant Minister gets his acting pay and so we  can

play   this  merry-go-round,  and  at  any  one  time

somebody will get extra money. If we are against this

in principle, this item will disappear in next year's

Estimates which I think will not be prepared  by  the

present Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3015</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am most distressed to learn that the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar does  not  adhere  to  the

principle that a man should be paid for what he does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $379,570 for Head 1 stand part of

the Schedule."



<br><br>10.15 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

view  of  our constitutional development,  this  item

will  be the last one appearing on our Budget. I hope

that  this  item  which is going to  be  spent  until

September 1958 will be spent up to that time  and  no

further. The Government has promised that there shall

be  general elections in August or September 1958 and

this item, I should say, should be budgeted right  up

to September 1958 and thereafter it should come under

a new head probably under the heading "Head of State"

and I fail to see why the Government has not put this

into  the  Estimates.  Is it  the  intention  of  the

Government  that this should be continued even  after

the general elections in 1958?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is indeed lamentable for a Member of the All-Party  Delegation which went to London and negotiated

for   a  new  agreement  not  to  know  what  he  has

negotiated  for.  What has been  decided  and  agreed

between   the  United  Kingdom  Government  and   the

Singapore   delegation   is   that   when   the   new

constitution comes into force there shall be a period

of six months wherein the present Governor will serve

as the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> He can then come under that

head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I think we should not be

always  looking at the gloomy side of life.  This  is

one  of  the brighter moments. Sometime next year  or

sometime in 1959, one lucky Malayan-born person  will

sit  in  Government House. I was intrigued the  other

day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3016</b></font><br><br>



to  hear  the new Governor say that he was  going  to

hand  over Government House presumably with  all  the

crockery, the forks and spoons, the Royal crest,  the

pictures,  the  air-conditioning machines,  the  nice

lawns and all the paraphernalia and patina that  make

for  the  pomp  and  glory of a colonial  government.

There  must  be  a  lot  of  heart-searching  as  the

elections  draw nearer as to who is going to  be  the

lucky  person.  He  will  be a  lucky  person  indeed

because he will inherit not only the big mansion with

all  the  spacious grounds but also two butlers,  two

assistant  butlers, twenty domestic staff, two  cooks

(one graded lower than the other) and five chauffeurs

(two undoubtedly experienced ones getting a salary of $154-6A-184  and three less experienced ones  getting $114-4A-138).  That gives a measure of the  necessary

pomp that must surround such an important person.  As

we  take over the bureaucratic machine, we get  these

few choice places open. In the Federation it has been

quite an entertaining spectacle to see people move up

to  high  office  to  embassies all  over  the  world

leaving very unpleasant contests to be fought out. In

Singapore, it is generally agreed that whoever  wants

to  become  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  must  not  be

involved  in  politics. If he has  been  involved  in

politics, then he should be somebody who has left his

political  past in some corner and has  made  friends

all  round  ever since. What is more he must - this  is

the more serious side - be of the calibre that will  be

able  to take over not only the dignity of the office

because  the  dignity will remain,  but  the  greater

responsibility   which   it   entails   in    dealing

diplomatically and tactfully with the elected Members

from   whom  he  must  invite  leaders  to   form   a

government.   In  fact,  when  we  were   in   London

negotiating this Yang di-Pertuan Negara, I could  not

help  but think that perhaps we owe a tribute to  the

ex-Chief  Minister  for  this  scheme.  This  is  his

brainchild and he deserves full marks for it. We  the

PAP, were not particularly concerned whether we had a

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara or a Governor-General  or  a

Governor. But other people were very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3017</b></font><br><br>



particular  about forms particularly when  they  were

out for seats in the United Nations. It was important

that the whole set-up of a sovereign nation should be

carefully stated including the head of a state.  When

we  settled it this year, I calculated the number  of

possible applicants for this job. Sir, he cannot be a political because then he will be a menace.  He  will

choose  the  wrong persons to form a  government.  He

will  choose  the  wrong  Party  and  there  will  be

political  instability.  He  cannot  be  too   deeply

involved  in politics at present. So that writes  off

all  the  present Members of this Assembly and  those

who  are  storming on election platforms. I was  left

eventually  with a short list of five.  If  the  five

gentlemen - and I think there are only five  who  might

discharge  this duty with some distinction  and  with

some  dignity - know what is in store for the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara under the new constitution,  when  he

takes over Government House with all the crockery and

all  the paraphernalia of that august domain, he will

remember  that his is probably the most ticklish  job

ever given to any functionary head of state in South-East Asia. I do not know what other political Parties

have  in  mind  for this job but, as far  as  we  are

concerned, that man requires a great deal of courage,

deep  political understanding of the South-East Asian

situation  and  the  ability to ride  a  crisis  with

firmness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 2 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead I therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently the courts have been really fully

occupied right from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3018</b></font><br><br>



High  Court  clown to the criminal courts  and  there

have been many cases where people want to get justice

very quickly, and could not have their cases heard at

an  early  date.  We have heard complaints  from  the

public  that many cases have been postponed to  dates

many  months ahead. There have been leading  articles

in  the  papers  lamenting this point.  I  think  the

Government should remedy this so that all cases could

be heard in the shortest period possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, Sir, I notice that most of the

courts  in Singapore are situated right in the centre

of  the town. There are many summonses or many  cases

involving  people living in rural  areas  and  it  is

sometimes very difficult for the rural people to know

to which court they must go. I have had many cases of

people  coming  to  me to ask me where  a  particular

court  is  situated; whether they should  go  to  the

court right in front of the Central Police Station or

to  the  one next to the City Council. In one or  two

cases,  I  think  they failed to  appear  before  the

courts  not because they dared to fail to appear  but

because  they  were  just lost.  Next  year,  in  the

Development  Estimates,  many  district  offices  are

coming  up. At present too, there are many  community

centres situated all over Singapore. I would say that

it  would be better to bring the courts to the  rural

areas rather than bring the rural people to the  city

courts.  I  can  give an instance,  Sir,  where  this

should  prove  practicable. On a day when  a  hundred

hawkers  are  summoned to appear before  a  court,  I

think  that in such cases, it would be better if  the

court  is  situated in a centre that  is  nearest  to

their place of operation rather than to get each  and

every  one of them to come right into town for  their

hearings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of justice, I would like to bring to

the attention of this House the difficulty to the man

in the street. Justice would be available to the rich

because  they are in the position to pay.  For  those

who are poor with an income of less than $300 or with

a  total possession of less than $300. Government has

started a free



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3019</b></font><br><br>



legal  aid  system. But there is a  large  number  of

people who cannot sometimes seek justice. I mention a

few  instances of people who are knocked down by cars

through  negligence  and  because  they  are  in   no

position  to  engage  a lawyer,  many  of  them  have

abandoned  their claims against insurance  companies.

These are the people who suffer because they have not

enough  money to seek justice and yet they  are  rich

enough  to  be excluded from this free legal  aid.  I

wonder  if Government is having any scheme to  assist

this  large section of the people who I think  should

get justice.



<br><br>10.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I should inform the hon. Member that the

Government has under consideration at the moment  the

question   of  the  decentralisation  of   Government

courts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, one of the most important

branches of the bureaucracy of a democratic system is

an independent and efficient judiciary. We decided in

London  this year that the independence of our  local

judiciary  shall  be guaranteed and  that  no  Puisne

Judge of the High Court or Chief Justice who has been

appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the advice

of  the  Prime Minister, after consultation with  the

Chief  Justice and the Council of Ministers,  can  be

removed  unless the matter has been referred  to  the

Privy  Council, and the Privy Council has recommended

that they should be removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what gravely disturbs me is not so much the lack

of  independence of the judiciary, but the fact that,

because of the education policy in the past, there is

now a dearth of experienced and competent lawyers  to

take  over the lower rungs of the judiciary. It is  a

fact  which  all  practising lawyers know,  that  the

stronger  a  judge the less is the influence  on  any

particular decision of counsel appearing before  him.

One  of the most unhappy features that a lawyer would

like  to avoid seeing in our courts is where a  young

and  inexperienced magistrate is buffeted between two

experienced counsels, and the fear of being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3020</b></font><br><br>



taken up on appeal by one or other of the experienced

counsels and of being torn to pieces in the appellate

court  is  more  often  than not  a  reason  for  the

inexperienced magistrate reaching a decision  on  one

side or the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome the fact that the Government has

recruited  people from the profession  straight  into

puisne  judgeships. It is the only way to do  it, in

view  not  only  of  the  shortage  of  senior  legal

officers  but also because it is a desirable practice

in  itself. The difficulty of course is the  question

of  emoluments. The Bar Committee has written to  the

Colonial  Office, I think, to have  the  salaries  of

judges  revised.  Now, Sir, I am  not  in  favour  of

piecemeal  adjustment  because  the  whole   of   the

hierarchy will be upset if one tampers with any  part

of  the  top hierarchy but it is a problem  which  we

must  face.  If  you  want to get  able,  experienced

lawyers  to  give up their practice and take  over  a

judgeship,  then you must be prepared to  offer  them

something  more  than  just  the  pomp, dignity  and

importance  of  that office. How much that  something

must be has got to be taken in relation to the pay of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara and the Speaker  of  the

Assembly. There was an order of protocol drawn up  by

the  Colonial Office some time this year.  I  do  not

know  if  what  transpired is still confidential  but

anyway  the Colonial Office was extremely anxious  to

maintain   the  order  of  precedence.  First,   they

conceded  that  there  shall be the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  who  will not be a Colonial Office  man.  But

they insisted that immediately after the Speaker, the

British  Commissioner  or the  High  Commissioner  or

whatever  he  will  be called shall  march  first  in

procession to indicate the importance of his  office,

that  he  holds special reserve powers and powers  of

life  and death over the constitution, etc.,  etc.  I

think the Chief Justice came in immediately after the

Speaker  or  the  Speaker came  in  after  the  Chief

Justice - I  was not sure which way it was.  All  these

things  must be taken into account when  we  fix  the

salaries  of  judges.  You  cannot  have  one  person

trooping  out in front drawing $2,150 and the  person

trooping



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3021</b></font><br><br>



behind   drawing  $3,575  otherwise  the   sense   of

propriety will be greatly disrupted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say on the judiciary is this:

it  was a right decision we made in London, that  the

judiciary  could  be  Malayanised.  It  was  a  right

decision that the Government took in recruiting  from

the  profession, but adjustments will have to be made

as  to  the  terms and conditions for those  who  are

recruited from the profession. What we are  going  to

do  about  this shortage of trained men to take  over

the lower rungs of the judiciary is a matter which  I

think must receive very serious consideration if  the

next Minister for Justice is not to be saddled with a

lot  of  incompetent magistrates whose  judgments  go

constantly  up  for appeal. It is  not  altogether  a

matter  which  can be solved just by saying  so.  The

number  of trained men - as I have said, and I keep  on

condemning  the colonial system because I think  they

are  responsible for it - is so few. And the reason  is

that when the British Colonial Office discovered that

lawyers  naturally  turned to politics  they  stopped

scholarships  for lawyers and they gave  scholarships

for  engineers, doctors, dentists, and  anything  you

like  under  the  sun,  provided  that  you  did  not

interfere  with the political system. The result  was

that only the useless rich man's son became a lawyer.

As  you well know, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is one of the

easiest professional examinations to pass in England.

The  result is that we are saddled with them now. The

University  of Malaya can only remedy this  situation

in  about  six or seven years when the first recruits

will be forthcoming. Between then and now we have  to

see that the standard of our magistracy is maintained

somehow  or  the  other while  the  younger  men  are

gaining  experience. I am sure that the situation  is

even  more serious in the Attorney-General's Chamber.

I  shudder to think what would have happened but  for

the fact that there were a few lawyers trained in the

years  before the war who are now able to assume  the

higher appointments in the departments - both legal and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3022</b></font><br><br>



judiciary.  We hope that this problem  is  solved  if

only  on a temporary basis until a long-term solution

offers itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

agree  that the remuneration of professional men  who

are  required to fill the public services  should  be

revised.  One must compare to a certain  extent  with

the  remuneration  of what a professional  man  would

obtain  if  he  were  not in the  Government  service

otherwise we shall only get the second-rate  men  who

will fill the very responsible posts required for the

smooth  running  of Government. I am afraid  that  in

this  country  we still do not have  people  who  are

prepared  to  make a sacrifice in their  salaries  to

maintain the prestige and the self-sacrifice required

in  public  work and to remedy that we should  revise

the  scale of  fees in order to attract really  good

professional  men.  For  instance,  doctors  in   the

medical service



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Does the hon. Member realise

that  we are on Head 2- Judicial, and that he  should

concentrate on the judiciary for the time being?  His

remarks, I think, would be more appropriate  when  we

come to the Head-Chief Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Yes. So I think that one of the

best ways to shorten the length of time required  for

the  hearing  of  cases could be achieved  by  having

"strong"  men on the Bench who will stand up  to  the

eloquence  of lawyers who take up hours in court  and

thereby save time. I think that is one of the reasons

why  we  cannot attract experienced young men to  the

Bench.



<br><br>10.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we in the legal service of the  colony

will  be  the first to welcome any move to strengthen

our  ranks but I cannot accept the implication in the

Member    for    Tanjong   Pagar's    reference    to

"incompetence"   in  connection  with   the   present

magistracy. The present magistrates are in my opinion

striving  extremely  hard and cannot  in  honesty  be

described as incompetent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3023</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

I was very careful in my remarks not to describe them

as incompetent. What I sought to convey was that they

lacked the experience. We know that they are striving

very  hard but it must be admitted that some of  them

lack  the experience having just been called  to  the

Bar,  or  having been called to the Bar  one  or  two

years ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad that

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar has made the  position

clear.  I  freely admit that the amount of experience

enjoyed  by  the magistrates is not considerable  but

now  that the suggestion of "incompetence" - I am  sure

that  the word was used - has been so withdrawn, I  say

no more about that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of salaries is a matter that is under

consideration  and the factors that the  hon.  Member

has  mentioned such as the emoluments of the head  of

state and of your own office are matters that will be

considered.  There  are  of  course  others:  age  of

retirement, pensions, medical attention and  all  the

hundred  and  one things that go with  conditions  of

service and prospects within the service and we  must

consider  also - I think this is quite  important -  the

relative  levels of emoluments in other  territories.

It   is  not  possible  to  review  and  revise   the

emoluments  of  any  one particular  service  without

taking   into  consideration  all  other   Government

services  but I can assure the House that this  is  a

matter  which  is  now receiving attention  and  will

continue  receiving  attention until  a  satisfactory

solution has been reached.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  recollect  the statement made  by  the  Hon. the

Minister   for  Commerce  and  Industry   last   week

regarding  the industrialisation of this country.  He

stated  that our local capitalists prefer  to  invest

their  money  for a quick return in  rubber  and  tin

rather  than to invest it on a long-term  basis.  Now

coming  to the subject of judiciary, the position  is

somewhat peculiar alike. We heard both sides of  this

House say that we should obtain more experienced  men

to  fill  the senior posts in the judiciary  but  one

cannot deny the fact that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3024</b></font><br><br>



amongst  the private lawyers there are many brilliant

legal  professional men. Why they do not come forward

to  join this most important service is because  they

are  attracted by the bigger income that they can get

from  their private practice. Therefore,  I  wish  to

remind  this  House,  especially the  Government,  to

think  of  a  way  to control the professional  legal

charges which are sometimes fantastically high and to

encourage  such people to join the judiciary  instead

of  making  a quick million dollars from their  legal

practice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, in view of what the Hon. the

Attorney-General  said,  I  think   that   I   should

elaborate further on what I mean by the weaknesses of

our  young  magistracy. There are  a  few  exceptions

which  I  myself  have encountered.  They  are  young

people  having just been called to the Bar, who  have

learned  very quickly how to reach the  issues  in  a

particular case and how at the same time to  maintain

the dignity of the magistrate in his court and not to

descend to the dust and heat of the arena. But I give

this by way of illustration. I had to appear before a

young  magistrate, conscientious but  young,  and  we

spent the whole afternoon on all kinds of side issues

because  he was so careful in not wanting to  make  a

mistake   that   he   investigated   every   possible

alternative up every possible alley. We came  to  the

right  conclusion in the end but after having  wasted

the whole afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there are two ways to solve this. One,

say,  "All  right,  it must be so until  they  gather

experience of what to do." The other is to find  some

interim solution whereby experienced men are  put  in

almost every other court to see that the cases  where

difficulties are likely to arise are put  before  the

experienced  magistrates. It is at  the  moment  done

purely  on  the basis of seniority. Certain  criminal

district courts have an order or precedence according

to  seniority  in  the service  and  except  in  very

exceptional cases, it is really the luck of the  draw

before which magistrate a case appears. My suggestion

for an interim solution has two aspects. One, somehow

get your more experienced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3025</b></font><br><br>



men  to staff every other court if they cannot  staff

every  court. Two, make sure that, in the  fixing  of

the  cases  where  difficulties are likely  to  arise

either in involved facts or in involved laws, a  case

is  put before an experienced man. Otherwise time  is

wasted  not  only in the trial before the  magistrate

but  in the chances of the appeal before an appellate

tribunal. This is a problem of which one could take a

fatalistic view and say, "Well, anyway, leave it till

five  or  ten years and the magistrates will  acquire

experience  and the young Counsels in  the  Attorney-General's Chambers have been knocking about enough in

the  High  Court to gather experience to become  good

judges."   But,   in   the   meantime,   a   lot   of

dissatisfaction is created both with  those  who  are

being prosecuted and with those who are litigating in

the  courts and with members of the profession. There

are  certain judges before whom counsels  shudder  to

have  a  case. That is a fact because we know that  a

matter which would take one hour before an ordinarily

competent  man  would take a whole  day  if  it  goes

before  certain persons. It is an open secret in  the

profession and the Attorney-General and his  officers

must  be fully aware of it. Well, such people  should

not  be put on the Bench. We had one case-I think the

Attorney-General  is fully aware  of  the  particular

case-where  he did not consider the man competent  or

did  not consider the man suitable and he was  pushed

out to be a magistrate or a civil district judge. The

result  was  that every case that appears before  him

takes  three  times  as  long as  it  normally  would

whether  or not it reaches the correct conclusion  in

the  end,  and this is a matter of great  importance.

The  Attorney-General  and  his  officers  cannot  be

unaware of what is open gossip at the Bar.



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not sought to

interrupt the hon. Member but I feel that some of the

things be has said have come near to contravening, if

not  the  letter,  the spirit of our Standing  Orders

and,  as  I will not run into the danger of following

him, I do not propose to reply in any detail



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3026</b></font><br><br>



but  I would say this that those responsible for  the

selection of officers of the legal, service and those

responsible for the administration of our courts  are

fully  aware  of the difficulties that confront  them

and   are   doing   their  best  to  overcome   those

difficulties.  We cannot have a magistracy  in  which

litigants can pick and choose their judges and  while

at  first  sight this avoidance of the "luck  of  the

draw"  suggestion may be attractive, it is  one  that

will  not work. We cannot have one magistrate fit  to

deal with one type of case and one magistrate fit  to

deal  with another. To allow that is to admit  defeat

and  we  are not defeated. I am quite satisfied  that

those  responsible  are taking the  proper  steps  to

improve the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now perhaps I might refer to a matter mentioned by

the  Member for Changi. Were he in the profession,  I

think  he  would have a very different  view  of  the

earnings of the average member of the local Bar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,865,510 for Head 2 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 3 -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir I

move  the amendment standing in my name on the  Order

Paper,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 3 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (2) of sub-head 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I selected this particular subhead

not  necessarily  meaning that  the  particular  item

should  be  reduced  by $10 but just  to  initiate  a

debate on the whole subhead. I hope I am in order?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please proceed.



<br><br>11.00 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the total expenditure of the

Council  of  Ministers is $161,970. The  Council  has

been  set up to look after the affairs of the  Colony

and  the  Ministers on it are expected to  remain  on

duty  most  of  the  time,  and  to  incur  as  small

expenditure  as  possible  for  the  benefit  of  the

taxpayers. But look at subhead 2,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3027</b></font><br><br>



item  (6),  Telegrams, on page 38 of  the  Estimates.

This year, telegrams cost $48,000. Detailed estimated

expenditure  for 1958 under subhead 2 is  not  given,

but the total is put down as $63,350, out of a total.

of $161,970 for the head. Is it expected that $48,000

will again be spent on telegrams?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telegrams are needed mostly only when Ministers are

away.  No explanation has been given but I think  the

cost  of telegrams is included in the subhead  total.

We  have  seen that not one, two, or three, but  four

Ministers  are away from the Colony at one time.  How

is Government run in this way? Of course we know that

there  are the Permanent Secretaries but is  it  wise

that  four Ministers should be away at a time?  Their

duty  is  to  run the administration. When  they  are

away,  the heaviest expenditure must be on telegrams,

to give or take instructions or advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to see Ministers travel less and

so less money is spent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am afraid I cannot agree with my friend

the hon. Member for Telok Ayer that the provision for

the  Council of Ministers is extravagant. There is  a

high-powered  secretariat dealing with a  very  great

volume of business and all the provision for staff is

required.  If it were not provided, I am  afraid  the

secretariat  would not function as  successfully  and

efficiently as it does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of recurrent expenditure, I think

the  Member  will see, if he examines the  Estimates,

that the amount provided for services other than  air

mail  charges and telegrams is very small  indeed.  I

think   the  provision  for  air  mail  charges   for

diplomatic   bags   explains   itself.   As   regards

telegrams, I think the Member believes the  provision

is  only  in  connection with telegrams sent  to  the

Ministers  while  they  are actually  away  from  the

Colony.  That is not the case, Sir. A certain  amount

of  expenditure is incurred on telegrams to Ministers

when  they  attend overseas conferences  such  as  on

constitutional  matters, but the  vast  bulk  of  the

expenditure  under this item is on  ordinary  routine

telegrams between this territory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3028</b></font><br><br>



and  the  Colonial Office and other governments.  The

figure has been very carefully calculated. This  vote

has    been   the   subject   of   applications   for

supplementary  votes in the past  and  the  provision

this year is based on past expenditure incurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the hon. Member will accept my

explanation   and   assurance  that   there   is   no

extravagance  or  needless  expenditure  under   this

particular head.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, a wrong impression may be

created  by what the hon. Member for Telok  Ayer  has

said,  that four Ministers were away from the  Colony

at one time. That has happened only twice in the term

of  office  of the Labour Front Government.  One  was

when  the  ex-Chief  Minister  went  to  London   for

constitutional  talks, when two Ministers  were  left

behind;  the  second occasion was  when  the  present

Chief  Minister also went to London, early this year,

for  constitutional  talks and  successfully  brought

back agreement for a new status for Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am rather surprised that the

Chief Minister has not replied to me on this subject,

as  he  should  have. There is no defence  or  excuse

whatsoever. Once, twice many Ministers were away. Why

had  a fourth Minister to go to Japan at a particular

period  in  the  absence  of three  others  from  the

Colony? Is there any explanation?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I am rather tired of this point  raised

by  the  hon. Member for Telok Ayer. At the time  the

delegates    went   to   London   for   the    second

constitutional  talks, it was anticipated  that  they

would be back within a certain period. Provision  had

been  made  for  me  to visit Japan.  Government  had

accepted  an invitation from the Japanese Government.

which  would pay for my expenses in Japan,  to  visit

them partly on a goodwill mission and partly to visit

institutions   in   the   company   of   my   Medical

Superintendent  of  the  General  Hospital.   As   it

happened, however, the constitutional talks in London

were delayed. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3029</b></font><br><br>



think  it  was  only for four days  that  my  absence

overlapped the return of the delegates from London.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to see that

after  a  second  visit to Tokyo,  the  Minister  for

Health could still be very tired.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

created  an independent Public Service Commission  to

see  that the best men get the jobs. So far as  I  am

aware,  the P.S.C. has been doing its job but I  want

to  draw its attention to a few points, especially to

the   fact   that  it  is  an  entirely   independent

commission, independent of Government interference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that in certain cases where Government likes

to  fill a post, there have been manoeuvres. It  will

specifically  require a certain qualification  for  a

post,  let  us  say requirement (a). If an  applicant

holds  not only the qualification specified  in  (a),

but   has   further  qualifications  (b)   and   (c),

Government  may  be in the habit of saying,  "No,  we

just   require  one  qualification",  that  is   that

specified  in  (a). I would say that  that  would  be

possible in, say, a simple, hypothetical case of  the

medical  services.  We will say  one  person  may  be

specifically qualified in health while another has  a

degree  which only covers health, yet Government  may

say, "We want the second qualification", and that  is

put down as the requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Government always has another idea - of

putting a person on to acting capacities and then

claiming that he has the necessary experience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3030</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt the Public Service Commission is an

independent  body but it has to consider  suggestions

and  recommendations from all sides. I would say that

it  should not be unduly influenced when it  suspects

that   jobs   are  being  tailored  for  those   whom

Government  wants  to put in. I would  ask  that  the

Commission  exercise  great care,  and  in  cases  of

acting posts, exercise double care.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation;

the  hon.  Member  talked about being  "qualified  in

health".  Does he mean that the person is  physically

or  mentally strong? What does he mean by  "qualified

in health"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that a

Minister  should ask such a question really  astounds

me.  We are not talking about health in the sense  of

the  health of the Hon. the Minister for Health, for

example.  The  Hon.  The Minister  for  Commerce  and

Industry  should understand that when we  talk  about

health  in the matter of qualifications, we refer  to

degree qualifications. I am really surprised that  he

should  express it in this manner, showing his  utter

ignorance.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr

Speaker, I am glad that the hon. Member for Serangoon

has duly praised the Public Service Commission. I  am

sure  we  all  appreciate  the  very  good  work  and

impartiality of the P.S.C., and its independence. The

Member  for Serangoon, however, was trying  to  imply

that  Government tries to interfere with the  P.S.C.,

to  tailor  jobs, and  to  advertise  jobs  to  suit

Government's intentions - in fact trying to meddle with

the  work of the P.S.C. I can assure the Member  that

that is furthest from Government's intention.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, the allegation that when

advertisements are inserted inviting applications for

appointment  to  the  civil  service  the  Government

tailors   the   qualifications  to   suit   its   own

convenience,  is totally baseless. Advertisements  as

well as circulars inviting applications for posts  in

the  civil service are first of all cleared with  the

Public Service Commission before action can be taken.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $268,190 for Head 5 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 6 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $600,420 for Head 6 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3031</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.15 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7 -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move the

amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again in order to initiate a debate, I move a

reduction in the amount of the first item, but really

I  only  mean to comment as a friend; not to throw  a

brickbat but to give advice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Assembly are elected by vote. Voters

thereby  place  confidence in their elected  Members,

that they will safeguard their interests properly  in

every respect. It is an honour to be a Minister,  and

to be Chief Minister is a very high honour. Ministers

have  to  live up to it. In other countries, salaries

of  Ministers  are nominal. I am not here  discussing

the  scale of salaries which has been already  fixed,

though what happens in future I do not know.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this case also, I must draw the attention of

my  good friend, the Hon. the Chief Minister, to  the

necessity  to restrict travel and so on.  It  may  be

very necessary sometimes for him to travel, but there

are  times  when  such travel  can  be  left  to  the

officials  who  carry  out the policy  of  Ministers.

Really the officials require experience and they  are

there more or less permanently while Ministers change

every  one,  two,  three or four years  according  to

political  conditions. Here I might very respectfully

and,  if  I  may say so, as a friend, draw the  Chief

Minister's attention to his journeys to Geneva or New

Delhi,  journeys which could have been made by  heads

of  department. That would have saved expenditure and

also given experience of conferences to not one,  but

two officials if possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3032</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter I would refer to is entertainment

expenses,   subhead  4,  page  48.  In  a  democratic

government, the Chief Minister is the chief person, I

do  admit, to entertain or show respect to  heads  of

various  other countries passing through.  We  are  a

very  small  colony  compared  with  the  big  states

surrounding  us;  so although we  have  got  to  show

respect  to  visitors, we should do that  in  a  very

economical way. Singapore is mainly a stopping  place

en  route  to  Kuala Lumpur for airplane services  or

steamers,  and visitors passing through Singapore  do

like  to  pay  courtesy calls on the  Chief  Minister

although  their destination is really the Federation,

which is an independent country. We can therefore  be

economical - instead of dinner, we can invite  visitors

to tea. That will save expense. Or give a lunch. Only

when very necessary or essential do we give a dinner,

not otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another head of the state, the

Governor.  He  should share his part of entertaining,

so  expenses  can then be less and we can  thus  save

some money for the sake of the colony taxpayers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just passing these remarks in a friendly way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed

very  touched  by  the friendly attitude  of  my  old

friend,  the  hon.  Member for  Telok  Ayer.  He  has

tendered one or two advices to me and I feel  I  have

to  comment  on  them, say, on the  meetings  of  the

International Labour Organisation in Geneva  and  New

Delhi.  He  said  that,  in  his  view,  it  was  not

necessary for the Minister to attend such conferences

and   that  they  should  be  attended  by  permanent

officials.  These  two conferences were  attended  by

Ministers of the participating countries to speak  on

the policies of their governments, and I attended  as

the relevant Minister representing Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then touched on the entertainment

expenses vote of $10,000. Sir, I can assure him  that

I  have been most economical in my expenditure  under

this  item.  I do not throw parties, to all  visiting

dignitaries. In most cases when I take some  of  them

around, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3033</b></font><br><br>



expenses come out of my own pocket. It is only when I

have  a  party  to  which  I invite  members  of  the

Government  and  the  Opposition  that  the  cost  is

charged to the entertainment expenses vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I believe that

relationships  with our neighbours  come  within  the

portfolio of the Hon. the Chief Minister. At present,

Sir,  I  am  worried  about our  relations  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya. What I am thinking  about  is

whether our Chief Minister has properly put our  case

over  to  the  Federation so that the two territories

will  go  forward as a single economic Unit. All  the

time  we hope that Singapore and the Federation  will

finally  come  together as one  political  unit,  but

today  we hear rumours that there will be a clamp  on

the causeway-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hate interrupting, especially

in  Committee of Supply, but it appears  to  me  that

that subject touches on external affairs which, if  I

am  not  mistaken, comes within the Ministry  of  the

Chief Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I think that such affairs as

this are decided by the Council of Ministers with the

Chief Minister at its head.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, but I do not mean that the Chief

Minister  does  not come into the  picture  when  the

Ministry  of the Chief Secretary is being debated.  I

might  be wrong but perhaps the Chief Secretary could

inform  the  House whether external affairs  of  this

nature   come  within  the  Ministry  of  the   Chief

Secretary? If they do, then of course a debate can be

initiated when we come to the head dealing  with  the

Ministry  of the Chief Secretary. Perhaps  the  Chief

Secretary could clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> External affairs is under my Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member will wait

patiently  until  we  come to the  Chief  Secretary's

Ministry; then he can develop his argument?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, Sir. We shall develop it

when we come to that head.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3034</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now under subhead 1, item (11), I find provision for

an  economic adviser. (He should probably  have  come

within  the  Ministry of Commerce  and  Industry.)  I

shall  drop  external  affairs  and  talk  about  the

economy  of Singapore. We are engaging an adviser  at

the all-inclusive rate of $4,000 per month or $48,000

per  year. I am certain he must have tendered all his

advice but the more important thing is, is the advice

acted upon? If such advice has been acted upon,  what

improvements  have we got to show? The present  trend

of  events  does  not seem to indicate  that  we  are

spending this money very wisely. If it is a matter of

getting  good advice, I think we should get  it  from

that eminent person. Here the advice would appear not

to  have  been  acted upon, and we  would  like  some

elucidation on this point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the post of

Economic  Adviser was debated, in this Assembly  last

December.  The reason for the post is that Government

feels  that  it  is  very vital  to  the  economy  of

Singapore  to  retain the valuable  services  of  the

Economic  Adviser.  The Member  for  Serangoon  asked

whether  the  advice he has tendered to us  has  been

acted  upon. Surely it is ridiculous to suggest  that

we  engage  a  man as a specialist to  advise  us  on

certain  matters  and then we do not  heed  him.  The

Member  may  think  otherwise but we  find  that  the

presence  in  the Colony of the Economic Adviser  and

the  work  he has been doing in my Ministry  is  very

vital at the present time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I was prompted to ask the Chief

Minister  whether the advice was acted  upon  because

see no improvement in Singapore business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I have been troubled all the time

by  what the Hon. the Minister for Communications and

Works  has  said before - that many experts  have  been

asked  by  Government to come to Singapore, that  one

expert  contradicts another, and that finally he  had

to throw out all the advice of the experts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3035</b></font><br><br>



and  act  on his own advice. If this is the  case  in

this instance, we would be wasting money.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would

appear  that  the hon. Member is dense  or  is  being

deliberately dense. It was pointed out to him  by  my

colleague  the Minister for Communications and  Works

that  when  he  seeks the advice of a  specialist  he

sticks to that advice, he does not go on looking  for

further advice because experience has shown that when

you seek advice from different specialists, different

advice is tendered.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied

with the reply and assurance to my points. As I said,

I only wanted to initiate a debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, may I still stress that ours is only a

small  place - some 220 square miles  with  1�  million

population - and that it is a stop-over  place  on  the

way  to the Federation for ministers of various other

countries who, as a matter of courtesy, call  on  the

Chief Minister of Singapore. I am glad that the Chief

Minister will be careful not to overspend.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member begging leave to

withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> If that is so, Sir, I do not wish

to take up the time of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member then beg leave to

withdraw the amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> No, Sir, I shall remain silent.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I might remind hon. Members that if

they  express  satisfaction with an explanation,  the

usual course is to beg leave to withdraw an amendment

and,  if  there is no dissenting voice, the amendment

is accordingly withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3036</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 7 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 1 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, as we can see from the "Remarks"

column  of  the Estimates, page 47, the Secretary  to

the  Chief Minister was graded G. Now he is to  be  a

time-scale officer. I would like to know what is  the

principle involved in grading these posts, or whether

it  is  left to the whims of each individual Minister

and  Ministry  to grade secretaries to Ministers  and

fix any scale they think, fit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

information of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, the

reason why the scale for the Secretary in my Ministry

has  been, shall we say, down-graded, from superscale

G  to time-scale is because, first and foremost,  the

Chief  Minister  must have a free choice  as  to  who

should work for him as his Secretary. If it is to  be

limited  to  superscale  G officers,  the  choice  is

thereby greatly limited; but if it were to be open to

time-scale  officers with an allowance of  $200,  the

field is greater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far three officers have been working as Secretary

in  my  Ministry  but not one of them  has  yet  been

placed  on superscale G. What they have been  drawing

is  their  usual  salary  plus  half  the  difference

between  this and the superscale G with a maximum  of

$200.  But  if he is a time-scale officer, no  matter

what his salary is, we will now give him an allowance

of  $200, which in effect means that he will get more

than if he were to come into a superscale G post.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of

clarification? The hon. Member knows there cannot be

a debate on any details?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I am not satisfied with the

explanation. First, I do not think the Chief Minister

can be correct when he says that the purpose of this

operation of down-grading the post is to give his

Secretary more money



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3037</b></font><br><br>



than  if he becomes a superscale Grade G officer.  Of

course  I  agree that the Minister must have  a  free

choice  as to who should be his secretary, but surely

it  cannot  be to give him more money than  he  could

earn in a time-scale post?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I am afraid the hon.

Member has got the wrong end of the stick. It is  not

the intention to pay more money to the Secretary. The

purpose  is  that if the post is reduced to  a  time-scale  job with an allowance of $200, I will  have  a

bigger field from which to choose my secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is this allowance of $200

which is going to be added to the salary of this time-scale officer holding the post?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The allowance, Sir, is a fixed

one  in  the same way as that paid, shall we say,  to

the  A.D.C. to the Governor and to one or  two  other

officers, particularly his Private Secretary.  Making

it  an  allowance with a maximum of $200 is an easier

method   of  computation  than  to  pay  a  man   the

difference between his usual salary and that  of  the

superscale G post. In effect the amounts are the same

unless the man has reached the top of his time-scale.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $239,810 for Head 7 ordered to stand part

of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3037</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 8 -



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of subhead 10 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment to the subhead "City

Council  Elections", I want to draw the attention  of

this   House  to  the  very  unsatisfactory   polling

arrangements for these elections. I will  only  refer

to  those  in  my  own area of which I  have  special

knowledge,    although    I    believe    there    is

dissatisfaction in other areas as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as I saw the Gazette notices regarding the

placing  of  polling stations and the allocation  of

voters to stations in the Ulu Pandan area, I wrote  a

letter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3038</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Hon. the Chief Secretary.  I  pointed  out,

firstly, that voters at the 7th mile Holland Road had

to travel past one polling station in Holland Village

to  another one in Farrer Road (which is not  in  the

Ulu Pandan Division at all but outside it); secondly,

that,  voters  at the 94 mile Clementi  Road  had  to

travel  past  both these two polling  stations  to  a

third  in  Duchess  Road  off  Bukit  Timah  Road,  a

distance of at least four miles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked in particular that the Clementi Road votes

should  be  allowed  to go to Holland  Village,  thus

reducing  the distance they have to travel from  four

miles to two, but I was told that there were only 150

of  them  or so, that there were bus routes available

and  that  nothing could be done. Sir, I invite  the

Hon. the  Chief Secretary to travel with me  by  bus

from 9� mile Clementi Road to Duchess Road, involving

three changes of buses, and back, and see how long it

takes. Perhaps after being taken not on one ride  but

six,   he   will  not  maintain  this   attitude   of

indifference  to  the convenience of  kampong  voters

whom  we  are  trying to encourage to cast  votes  at

democratic elections probably for the first time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add further that this state of affairs would

never  have arisen if the rural Ulu Pandan  area  had

been  left  in  a  District Council  area,  where  it

belongs,   instead  of  the  Government   obstinately

insisting   on   bringing  it  within  City   Council

jurisdiction against our advice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wondered what the

Member  for Tanglin was going to dwell upon  when  he

moved this amendment. I am sure Members of this House

will  appreciate that the Government has on its hands

perhaps  the  biggest and one of the  most  important

elections  in  the  history of  Singapore,  that  the

arrangements are all on a very large scale  and  that

we  have  done  our best to make them as satisfactory

and convenient as can be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I think we have not done badly at

all.  There  may be, as the Member for Tanglin  said,

one  or  two  places  where  conditions  are  not  so

satisfactory in that there will be a bit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3039</b></font><br><br>



of  inconvenience to voters in the matter of choosing

polling  stations.  I would like to  point  out  that

siting   of   polling   stations   depends   on   the

availability of buildings, and in the case  mentioned

by  the  Member for Tanglin, one of the  difficulties

was  that  in the register of voters for the  Holland

Road area all the voters were put in one block and it

was  not  easy  to subdivide them into  smaller  ones

owing to difficulty in locating house numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware of the route which the Member for Tanglin

has  described.  I  have  explained  it  to  him  but

apparently he is not satisfied with my explanation. I

can  give  the assurance, Sir, that we  will  try  to

improve  matters for the next election, but  I  would

like  the House to bear with us in this present  very

big  one,  in which the arrangements and organisation

have been on a very large scale; if we do cause a bit

of   inconvenience,   we   ask   for   patience   and

understanding,  Sir. On the whole we  have  done  our

best  to accommodate the 520,000 voters who will cast

their votes on polling day on 21st December.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate what the

Hon. the Chief Secretary has stated - that this  is  a

most important election and that the availability  of

buildings constitutes a great difficulty. But will he

explain  why it is that voters in Clementi  Road,  to

whom  I  referred, are allowed to by-pass two polling

stations en route to a third four miles away?



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member for

Tanglin  has  accused  the  Chief  Secretary  of   an

indifferent attitude in making arrangements  for  the

polling  stations  for the forthcoming  City  Council

elections. I would like to refute this allegation and

accusation very emphatically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the Member for Tanglin had raised the

question of polling stations in Ulu Pandan.  We  have

investigated the matter very carefully. The  fact  of

course  is this, that he has his own ideas and  views

about  certain  polling stations  and  their  siting,

whereas our Returning Officer has different ones.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3040</b></font><br><br>



Therefore  it is quite clear that it is a  matter  of

opinion  as  to  where a polling  station  should  be

sited. As far as possible, the Returning Officer  has

made  a  very  true  selection of the  situation  and

recommended a certain site.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use trying to cast any aspersion on the

efficiency of the Department; nor is it right at this

time to make any imputations or accusations about the

'indifferent' manner in which the Department has been

functioning. We all have to bear this in mind - the one

fact - that  we have very inadequate accommodation  for

the  number of people who may come to the polls.  All

these aspects will have to be taken into account when

matters of this nature are raised. We cannot agree to

hon, members' views in a matter like this.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have not for a moment

questioned the siting of the polling stations in  the

area to which we are referring. I am only asking  for

an  explanation as to why certain voters are required

to by-pass no less than two polling stations en route

to a third.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, the two polling stations are too

small to cater for more voters than what is estimated

they can deal with.



<br><br>11.45 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, we understand it is not easy

to  please everybody but what we do take objection to

is  this - by  the  time  we  knew  where  the  polling

stations were going to be, arrangements had proceeded

so  far  that it was impossible to alter any  one  of

them  without grave dislocation of the administrative

machinery. The day it was announced in the Press, all

the  cards which were to be posted to electors on the

Register  were,  according to the Returning  Officer,

already  prepared or almost completed, and to  change

any  polling  station  would mean  re-addressing  all

those  cards.  For that reason, it was impossible  to

make any alteration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Returning Officer, or the Chief Secretary on

his behalf, had given prior information to candidates

or to political



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3041</b></font><br><br>



Parties   of  the  arrangements  that  he  was   then

contemplating, surely it would have been possible for

all  the  political  Parties and candidates  to  have

suggested   alternative  arrangements  in  particular

cases.  For instance, one centre in what was formerly

Tanjong  Pagar  and is now Kreta Ayer,  in  the  City

Council  elections,  will not be voting  within  that

area  but  will  go off to the Malay School  in  Park

Road,   completely  outside  the  area   in   another

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that this has not taken place

in  previous elections. Sir, if we had known in  time

of   this  proposal,  we  might  have  acted  without

dislocating the whole administrative process. This is

no  aspersion  on the Returning Officer,  but  if  he

himself   or   his   staff  could  not   find   other

arrangements, we might have been able to  suggest  to

him  other facilities available in the neighbourhood.

But  by  the time we knew about the need for it,  the

thing  was  too  late,  the  whole  matter  had  been

settled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in cases of

polling stations I think the principle should be that

maximum convenience should be given to the voters and

not  to the returning officers concerned. I quote one

instance,  Sir, In  the Boon  Teck  Road  area,  the

polling   station  is  sited  near  the  main   road - Balestier   Road - where  there   is   a   Blue   Cross

headquarters. The voters, however, live right  inside

Boon  Teck  Road, in a large number of  houses.  They

will  have to go through a stretch of road  which  is

almost  impassable. If the weather is  bad,  I  think

there  will  be  a chance of vehicles  bogging  down.

Instead of giving a greater measure of convenience to

the people inside the road to go to a polling station

in  the  village, all the thousands who want to  vote

will have to pass through that bad stretch of road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government may say that there is no alternative site

but  I know that those who know of the siting of that

polling  station did go to the Government  department

concerned and offer an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3042</b></font><br><br>



alternative site right inside the village, but that

was not considered. It was said to be too late.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if Government will not consult the people on a

matter  like this, and site all the polling  stations

at  their  own convenience and not that of voters,  I

should  say  that the fault lies squarely with  those

who  are concerned with siting polling stations. Lack

of   premises   is   out  of  the  question   because

alternative sites have been suggested to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in this matter it is not too late even now

to have the polling station sited right inside if-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> - we are to expect a higher

percentage of voting. We must put polling stations at

the  convenience of the voters. This will mean saving

them transport and many hours.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, the Member for Serangoon suggests

that Government selects polling stations for its  own

convenience. I disagree entirely with him. As I  said

just  now,  we select polling stations  to  suit  the

convenience of everybody. On the whole we  have  done

well to reach that objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which the Member makes,

namely,  that  we must select these polling  stations

for the maximum convenience of everybody and that  we

should,  if necessary, con-suit the various political

Parties.  One  difficulty which  may  arise  is  that

perhaps  political  Parties have different  views  on

where a polling station should be sited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which the Member raised was that it is

not too late to alter the site of polling stations. I

am  sure. Sir, that all Members will agree that it is

too late. You cannot do anything now; if you want  to

change anything now, it will cause confusion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, under the head "Chief

Secretary", I believe that citizenship registration



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. We are still on

the first amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3043</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 14 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment, Mr Speaker, must be considered in

conjunction with my next one, that is concerning Head

8,  item (1), subhead 24. Under subhead 14, item (1),

the Secretary for Home and External Affairs, Grade E,

title  changed (as mentioned in the "Remarks" column,

page 54 of the Estimates) from Secretary for Internal

Affairs, post regraded from grade D; in other  words,

there was a downgrading. Under subhead 24, item  (1),

Secretary for Defence, Grade D, the title is  changed

from Secretary for Defence and Internal Security.  In

other  words,  it is now proposed to  split  up  this

particular  office  of  Secretary  for  Defence   and

Internal Security. What I do not understand is how do

they settle the grades?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In subhead 14 (1) the officer will have nine

Division  I  officers  under him;  five  Division  II

officers,  items  (11)  to  (14);  37  Division   III

officers, items (15) to (23); and six Division IV. In

other  words,  he  has a far larger staff  than  this

other  officer  to be called Secretary  for  Defence,

Grade  D, who will only have six Division I officers,

two  Division II, six Division III, and one  Division

IV.  Sir, the man who is going to be put on as  Grade

D,  Secretary for Defence, has a staff which is  less

than half that of the Secretary for Home and External

Affairs, Grade E.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now who settled all this grading? Is there any

principle, any yardstick? Or is this all done at  the

whim   and   fancy  of  the  Director  of  Personnel,

Permanent Secretary (Establishment) or whoever may be

the  officer in charge who minuted up to him?  Surely

there  must  have  been some kind of principle,  some

kind  of yardstick that must have been applied before

one is put down as Grade D and the other as Grade  E,

and  the  man with the bigger staff turns out  to  be

less important?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is "That the sum to be

allotted for Head 8 be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3044</b></font><br><br>



reduced  by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead  14

therein",  and,  as  indicated by  the  hon.  Member,

discussion may range over the next amendment standing

in his name, "That the sum to be allotted for Head  8

be  reduced by $10 in respect of item (1) of  subhead

24 therein."



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I expected the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar to speak on the lines that he  has

spoken.  On the face of it, it would appear that  the

grading of these two posts may not be correct, but  I

think  the  grading is all right.  Experience  in  my

Ministry  for  the  last  two  years  has  shown   it

desirable  that  there should be a  rearrangement  of

duties  within the branches of the Chief  Secretary's

Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now proposed to bring under one branch,

control  of internal security and intelligence,  home

affairs and that part of external affairs which falls

within my Ministry. The post of Secretary for Chinese

Affairs has been abolished and the duties of his post

will  be  performed by the head of the new branch  as

mentioned,  i.e. the Secretary for Home and  External

Affairs.  The  intention is, Sir,  that  although  it

would appear that the Secretary for Home and External

Affairs would have a bigger staff and that the  other

sections -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He has a bigger

staff; there is no "appearing" about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> I am sorry, I should have said he has a

bigger  staff. The other sections have  been  brought

under  this branch and the intention is that  certain

aspects of the work of my Ministry will be dealt with

by  the Deputy Chief Secretary himself and not by the

Secretary  for  Home and External Affairs;  and  that

there  would  be access in these matters direct  from

the   Assistant  Secretaries  to  the  Deputy   Chief

Secretary,  who  is the Permanent  Secretary  of  the

Ministry.  This post of Home and External Affairs  is

considered to be that of a Deputy Secretary, like the

posts of Deputy Secretaries in other Ministries which

is  also graded E, for example Deputy Secretaries  in

the Ministries of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3045</b></font><br><br>



Local  Government, Lands and Housing, and of Commerce

and  Industry. These Deputy Secretaries  are  all  of

Grade E status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this new arrangement, the Secretary for Defence

would  be  released from responsibility for  internal

security.  This would enable him to devote  his  full

time  to  matters concerning - can I  speak  on  both

amendments, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Certainly.



<br><br>12.00 noon



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> - concerning the Singapore forces which

are at present expanding, and policy matters relating

to  defence.  The Secretary for Defence, although  he

works under the Deputy Chief Secretary, will also  be

required to deal directly for administrative  reasons

with the heads of the military services in Singapore,

and his responsibilities will be of a somewhat higher

nature  than  those of some other Deputy  Secretaries

within the Government structure and whose grading  is

E.  It  is  because  of this special  nature  of  his

duties,  the work of his Ministry in connection  with

the  expansion  and development of our local  defence

forces,  and  the need to have defence  planning  for

Singapore, that the post has been graded the same  as

it was formerly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason for making this reorganisation, Sir,

is  that  it  would  enable  my  Ministry  to  remain

flexible  and  adaptable  to  changes  when  the  new

Constitution  comes  in.  There  might  then   be   a

reorganisation  of the work in my Ministry;  part  of

its  work may be taken over by some Ministry or other

under  the  new  Constitution.  We  have  made   this

reorganisation to make my Ministry somewhat  flexible

to  enable changes if necessary to take place in  the

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Whose expert judgment was it? Was

there expert judgment on it? If so, whose was it, and

what was the criterion?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I did indicate at our informal

meeting  that  hon.  Members would  be  permitted  to

ventilate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3046</b></font><br><br>



grievances in Committee of Supply, but I think a line

must be drawn as to how far that can go. If we are to

embark  on a debate on the details of items, then  in

the  first  instance we shall be  going  against  the

relevant Standing Order which says that there  cannot

be  a debate on details of expenditure; and secondly,

we  may  be  encroaching on the jurisdiction  of  the

Estimates Committee which, I have no doubt, will,  on

representation, look into details of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am far from

wanting  to  go into details. You would have  noticed

that my next amendment is on subhead 36, item (4), on

the  Organisation  and  Methods  Adviser.  The  whole

question is one of principle. Was there somebody  who

knew  his  job  who  weighed  up  the  merits  of   a

particular  Department? Or was it just some  confused

and  not  very clear-thinking expert, who was  really

not  an  expert on this business of organisation  and

methods,  who made up his mind to tinker  with  this,

that and the other? And this would lead on to my next

point,  on subhead 36, item (4), the question of  the

Organisation  and Methods Adviser. We  approved  this

appointment in 1957, under Command Paper 30 of  1957;

has this appointment been filled?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Perhaps the hon. Member's remarks vis-a-vis these other items could be properly raised when

his  motion  in regard to item (4) of subhead  36  is

reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the hon. Member for Serangoon wishes to

speak on external affairs; this is the opportunity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, on the matter of

relationships with the Federation of Malaya,  I  have

been   greatly  perturbed  by  rumours  or  newspaper

reports  that  the  Federation is to  clamp  down  on

travel from Singapore across the Causeway. This  does

indicate to me that the Singapore Government has  not

been  doing  its job for the people here. Perhaps  it

has never put the case properly to the Government  of

the    Federation.   If   there   has   been   proper

understanding, then we would expect that  there  will

not only be no clamp, but real



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3047</b></font><br><br>



freedom  of travel between the two countries all  the

time,   a  thing  which  should  be  encouraged   and

established.  Furthermore, we  would  expect  greater

economic co-operation in all matters concerning trade

and allied matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as we see it, the Singapore Government seems

not  to  be in a position to assist progress in  this

direction.  If  it  fails in this duty  of  promoting

greater  understanding between the  two  territories,

resulting  in a blockade of the Causeway and  greater

differences  in  economic  policies,  it  will  bring

hardship not only to the people of Singapore but also

to  the  Federation as a whole. This question  is  of

paramount  importance and we expect our Ministers  to

exert their utmost in this direction. If they fail to

do  that, then I think Singapore will suffer by their

acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this heading again, Sir - Home and External

Affairs - I   would  like  to  raise   another   point,

citizenship  registration. At present  we  have  many

classes  of  people being registered. Those  born  in

Singapore automatically are registered as citizens of

Singapore.  There are others born outside  Singapore,

the  aliens. Aliens who have lived here for the  last

eight years are eligible to be registered as citizens

by  making  a  simple declaration. All they  have  to

produce  is  their identity cards showing  that  they

have  been in Singapore for that period and not  been

away  for more than six months. This class of  people

will  now be protected. In the case of those born  in

Singapore  who  can  produce birth  certificates  and

establish  that  those certificates belong  to  them,

there will be no difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am going to talk about a class of people born

in  Singapore, who declare that they were born  here,

but  who  have no birth certificates. In the days  of

long  ago - 30,  40 or 50 years ago - births  might  not

have  been  reported, or reported but the  dates  and

places might be forgotten; there is no possibility of

such citizens being able to show proof that they were

born  here.  Under  the present registration  system,

they  cannot register as citizens. On their  identity

cards it is stated that they are born in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3048</b></font><br><br>



Singapore,  but  when it comes to  proving  it,  they

cannot do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will be the position of these people? If we

require proof, then I am afraid that they will suffer

and  be placed in an inferior position compared  with

aliens   who   have  made  declarations  and   become

citizens. Aliens can swear an oath of allegiance  and

become citizens, but the people I am referring to are

not   allowed   to  swear  the  oath  to   take   out

citizenship. Unless the Government is willing to take

the  identity card as proof, people in this  category

will be placed in a very awkward position; and later,

when   it  comes  to  travel  facilities  and   other

benefits, they may be left in the lurch - in a position

far worse than aliens who acquired citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to speak on external affairs, Head  8.  I

wonder whether the present Government has weighed the

genuine  feelings  of the people of Singapore, their

keenness  about the coming Afro-Asian  Conference  in

Cairo.  If  Press reports are correct, the Federation

of  Malaya  is prepared to send a delegation  to  the

meeting. The Singapore Government should give a clear

statement whether it is also prepared to do so or  to

join the Federation in sending a delegation to attend

this most significant conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to talk about home affairs. As one who

has carefully examined the past administration of the

Government I can say that at least three evil  things

have  not  been  lessened. The first is  gambling.  I

wonder  how  many  kinds  of gambling  now  exist  in

Singapore,  especially illegal lotteries? The  famous

ban-ji plo is in operation; and chap ji ki, operating

day  and night, is sucking the blood of the poor  and

the low income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authorities can answer that at present there is

a  loophole in our laws and we cannot prosecute these

operators.  Sir,  I  wish the Government  would  take

immediate  steps  to  stop this widespread  gambling,

especially  illegal lotteries. It can  ascertain  how

widespread



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3049</b></font><br><br>



these  repercussions  are  from  the  hawkers,   taxi

drivers  and market stallholders - how much  of  their

income  is  affected in this widespread  gambling.  I

wonder what the authorities in charge of home affairs

will do about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is gangsters. It is also known,

Sir,  that  gangsters  now  threaten  not  only   the

millionaires  but  also  the  students  and  hawkers.

Politics  are  also involved. Political Parties  have

relied  on  gangsters  and I wonder  what  preventive

measures  have  been taken by the  Chief  Secretary's

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is the Banishment Ordinance. I

wonder   how  much  value  still  remains   in   this

Ordinance,  used  to  punish and  banish  undesirable

characters.  In the past we might have faith  in  the

integrity   or  wisdom  of  Government  in  banishing

gangsters  or  undesirable characters; but  when  the

Ordinance is used to banish a person like Dr  Chuang

Chu  Lin, the people of Singapore begin to doubt. Dr

Chuang  is  such a well-known educationist  connected

with  Chinese  education for so long,  and  everybody

knows  that  he is not an undesirable character;  any

citizen  will  be  very willing to uphold  him  as  a

lawful and loyal citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore take this opportunity to suggest to

the  Government  that it should reconsider  repealing

the   Banishment  Ordinance  and  review   cases   of

banishment  including that of Dr Chuang.  This  will

give   back   confidence  to  the   public   in   the

administration  and  make them  feel  that  there  is

stability.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think this is an appropriate time to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced

by   $10  in  respect  of  item  (1)  of  subhead  14

therein."-(Mr Lee Kuan Yew).



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there have been remarks regarding external affairs. I

just  want  to  ask: What powers have we  as  far  as

external affairs are concerned? We, as a colony, have

nothing to do with this question of external affairs.

Of  course, we politicians should keep our  eyes  and

ears  open,  but we have no powers under the  present

constitution, nor have we under the new constitution.

The  British Government has kept them. Of course,  we

will  have  internal self-government. That means  you

manage your own affairs in your own little city,  and

run it like good boys, or you do not get this also.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will have all elected Assemblymen under the

new constitution. We will have the high-sounding name

of  Prime  Minister and, instead of the Governor,  we

will  have  the  Yang di-Pertuan  Negara.  These  are

changes  in names only but we have not got  the  real

substance at all with us. We have no say in  external

affairs.  I  doubt whether we will have any  say  for

some time to come in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference has been made to the Federation. The

Federation  is  an  independent country.  It  has  to

preserve   its  own  independence.  I   have   always

refrained from talking about the Federation  in  this

Assembly for the simple reason that, because  of  our

economic  position, nothing should be said which  may

displease the Federation. The Chief Minister seems to

love entering into marriages and then annulling them.

Sir, this is a definite announcement of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3051</b></font><br><br>



their  policy  by the Federation Government.  Such  a

marriage,  if it comes, will find both the bride  and

bridegroom  old. Sir, what I would suggest  is  that,

instead of talking about all this, we should  try  to

maintain  harmonious  relations with  the  Federation

because of our economic dependence on them. We  have,

as  I  said, no say in external affairs, and it seems

to  me that this colony will be kept as it is as long

as  is  possible, primarily now for the interests  of

Australia  and  New  Zealand. In our  own  interests,

therefore, I would like to tell my Singapore  friends

to  unite and try to get maximum powers as time  goes

on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  under  this  particular  item  Members  of  the

Opposition  have touched on certain  points  which  I

feel  require explanations. One hon. Member says that

we  have  no power over external affairs. It is  true

that even under the new constitution we have no power

over  external affairs other than trade and  cultural

relations. But it does not mean that, because  we  do

not  have  that  power, we should  not  have  in  our

administration  an officer whose special  job  is  to

look  after this side of things. It is necessary that

we  should have such an officer so that he  can  keep

Singapore  informed  of the day-to-day  goings-on  in

matters of external affairs. While it is true,  as  I

have  admitted, that we have no power  over  external

affairs,  yet  the  Council  of  Ministers  has  been

brought  in very closely in such matters.  Our  views

have been sought and they have always been respected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Member brought in the question of

registration of citizenship in so far as  people  who

are  local  born are concerned. I am  sure  the  hon.

Member  is aware that, in regard to people  who  were

born in Singapore, no registration is necessary. They

are automatically citizens of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Member brought in the Banishment Ordinance

and  said  that  this  Ordinance  should  be  applied

vigorously against gangsters. I would like to  inform

the  hon. Member that times have changed, that  those

who are involved in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3052</b></font><br><br>



such  activities  are those who are local  born.  The

Banishment Ordinance cannot be applied to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point, Sir, and that is, relations with the

Federation.  Our  relations with the Federation  have

been  of  the  very best. I do not  think  any  other

government  can have the same measure of co-operation

that  we  have been having. But one must  not  forget

that it is not only what the Government does and what

the  Government says that counts in our relationship.

It  is  what  the people of Singapore do  and  events

happening  in  Singapore that have an impact  on  the

relationship that we have built up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

afraid  I  am not satisfied with the answer given  by

the   Hon. the  Chief  Minister  regarding  external

affairs.  This morning I raised the question  whether

the  Labour  Front  Coalition  Government  would   be

prepared  to send a delegation to attend  the  coming

Afro-Asian Conference to be held in Cairo. Of course,

we  know  very well that external affairs even  under

the  future constitution will remain in the hands  of

the  United  Kingdom. But since the  Hon, the  Chief

Minister has said that the Council of Ministers keeps

in  close touch with external affairs and its opinion

is  sought  and  respected, may I  therefore  enquire

whether  the  Labour Front Coalition Government  will

agree  with  me that it is the strong desire  of  the

people  of Singapore that we should send a delegation

to, or join the Federation at least as an observer to

attend, the Afro-Asian Conference to be held in Cairo

in  order to demonstrate the true spirit of the Afro-Asian nations.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Stewart (Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Chief Secretary (Mr S. T. Stewart):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, under this item and I think the  other

item,  Secretary  for  Defence,  matters  on  general

policy have been brought up and debated. I would like

to  return  again to the point which the  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar first raised, and that was the question

of  grading. I have already explained the reasons for

reorganisation of these posts. Their grading has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3053</b></font><br><br>



decided  after  complete  consultation  between   the

officers  of  my  Ministry and the Treasury,  and  we

consider that the grading is correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if

good   relationship  with  the  Federation  has  been

maintained at the expense of Singapore, then I  agree

with the Government that we have maintained that good

relationship;  but what I am seeking  is  a  balanced

relationship whereby both parties will share the good

things which they both want. In this respect, I think

if  Government  can  enumerate  to  us  what  benefit

Singapore  has  derived from such a  relationship,  I

shall be very happy indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of citizenship registration, I am

afraid,  Sir, that the Chief Minister has missed  the

point entirely. I am not disputing that those born in

Singapore need not register. Everybody knows that.  I

am  only asking what the Government's policy is  with

regard  to those who were born in Singapore,  but  do

not  have  documentary  evidence  to  prove  it.  For

example, a person born 40 years ago in Singapore  may

not  have a birth certificate, or a person might have

reported his birth but has forgotten his date and  so

on.  Would the Government be satisfied in such  cases

to  accept  as  true  evidence  the  declarations  as

contained in the Identity Cards or declarations  made

by  way  of  statutory declarations? I  mention  this

because if Government does not allow this, then  this

class of people will later on be worse off than those

who  are aliens registering for Singapore citizenship

now, when it come to travel facilities, etc.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

Member  says  I have misunderstood him.  Therefore  I

have  paid  greater  attention to  him  when  he  was

speaking just now. And I still find that he  has  not

put  his  case, shall we say, succinctly and  clearly

before  us. In reply to what he has said  so  far,  I

would like again to point out to him that evidence of

birth is not demanded of them before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3054</b></font><br><br>



they  can  become  citizens  of  Singapore.  If   the

identity card of a person shows that he was  born  in

Singapore,  then  he is automatically  a  citizen  of

Singapore and put on the electoral rolls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  reply  given by the Chief Minister may,  in  his

personal  opinion, be correct, but he has missed  the

point  on  the question of applying for passports.  I

quite  agree that anybody whose identity  card  shows

that he is Singapore born is automatically placed  on

the  electoral  rolls, but the question  of  becoming

Singapore  citizens  does  not  only  touch  on   the

question  of voting or to be voted into power.  There

are  a  lot of complications attached to the question

of   Singapore  citizenship  when  applying   for   a

passport. So will the Chief Minister tell this  House

whether  a  declaration  is  considered  valid,   and

whether a passport will be issued on production of  a

statutory  declaration when the identity  card  shows

the person to be born in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There will be a great increase in

statutory declarations!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Oh, yes, plenty.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, now I

understand  the  question. In fact, I understood  the

question  already, but as the hon Member himself  did

not frame it in as clear a way as the hon. Member for

Queenstown, I found I was only called upon to  answer

what was brought up by the hon. Member, not something

that  I thought he meant to bring up and did not know

how to bring up!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of passports for Singapore

citizens,  Sir, this is a matter which has  not  been

finalised.  For  the  present  purpose  of  having  a

general  election to bring the new constitution  into

force,   the  Singapore  Citizenship  Ordinance   was

brought into being. Between now and until the  coming

into  force of the new constitution, that citizenship

has only local currency. It has no currency outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as an application for a British passport is

concerned, at the present



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3055</b></font><br><br>



time  it is necessary for an applicant to give  proof

of  birth. It has happened that, in cases of the kind

brought  up by the hon. Member, although an applicant

has  no  birth certificate, if he is able to  satisfy

the  Controller of Immigration that he  was  born  in

Singapore  and  he  does  not  even  have   a   birth

certificate, a passport has been issued to him.  Just

to give an illustration, Sir. A man was born 40 years

ago,   the   hon.  Member  said.  He  has  no   birth

certificate because his parents did not register  his

birth  or because he is not aware whether his parents

had or had not registered his birth. If he is able to

get  someone who is in a position to certify that he,

of   his  own  personal  knowledge,  knows  that  the

applicant  was born in Singapore on such and  such  a

date, that evidence is good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lee

Kuan Yew:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 24 therein.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As regards my next amendment

standing on the Order Paper, i.e. amendment (iii),  I

beg leave to withdraw it. It has already been touched

upon.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is not moving it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not moving it, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (4) of subhead 36 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already touched upon this matter of the

proper  evaluation of the jobs and one of the  things

that   should  be  done  is  to  fill  the  post   of

Organisation  and Methods Adviser. I  would  like  to

know from the Government whether they have a suitable

candidate  in  view, and when this position  will  be

filled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would very much

like   to   appoint  this  Organisation  and  Methods

Adviser.  The  difficulty  encountered  has  been  in

finding  a suitable man. When one was found,  he  was

not attracted by the salary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3056</b></font><br><br>



offered.  The salary which we have provided  for  the

expert has been based upon our previous experience in

trying  to  obtain the services of such  an  officer.

There  is a heavy demand in other parts of the  world

for  the services of specialist officers, and we  can

only hope to get an expert if we are prepared to  pay

what  he  can demand elsewhere. The salary  which  he

will  be  paid, which you will see in the  Estimates,

Sir,  is  quite  high. But even that salary  has  not

proved  to  be sufficiently attractive to obtain  his

services.  I  would  like  to  say  that  we  on  the

Government   side  are  very  keen  on  having   this

Organisation and Methods Adviser. We will  try  again

to  find  another expert, but we do  not  propose  to

increase the salary which is fixed in the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I think this may be a convenient

point  at  which  I  can  raise  another  matter   in

connection with the establishment. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

I  am  informed  by the Staff Side of the  Government

Whitley   Council   that  the  Government   side   is

circulating a proposal to have further consolidations

of  temporary allowances into basic salary, and  then

having  the  Public Service Commission Ordinance  and

the  European  Officers Abolition  Terms  Ordinance - I

have  forgotten the exact title of it,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,   but   it   is  the  Ordinance  providing   for

compensation  for  abolition  of  European  officers'

posts - incorporated in an Order in Council. I have not

seen  the  circular. In fact, this matter was  raised

with me at a very late stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into it in detail, I would like to

state, as a matter of principle, that when we went to

London this year we agreed on certain things. One  of

the things we agreed on was that the constitution and

its   draft   would  be  discussed  by  the   Parties

represented on the delegation before any changes were

introduced.  And  if  the  proposal  which   I   have

mentioned  just now is gone through, then  what  will

happen is that no government in Singapore will be  in

a  position to make any alterations to the wage scale

of  government  servants. If this is true,  I  cannot

understand this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3057</b></font><br><br>



armadillo  complex. Nobody is immune from the  change

that  is  coming to Singapore. If we try  to  armour-plate  ourselves with Orders in Council to  see  that

our interests are protected for all time, then all it

would  do is to create greater public irritation  and

outcry  against these issues. It would probably  lead

to  further  deterioration of  the  position  of  the

public   service  in  the  eyes  of  the  people   of

Singapore.  Sir,  I would be very happy  to  hear  it

refuted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I wonder if the Chief Secretary

can  tell  this  House whether it is going  to  be  a

permanent      appointment     or     a     temporary

appointment - temporary in the sense  that  it  affects

the  reorganisation  of  the  department -  and  after

reorganisation will this appointment be abolished?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I would like to know is what are the

duties of this Organisation and Methods Adviser?  The

City  Council  set  up  an Organisation  and  Methods

Department  about  two years ago, and  speaking  from

experience,  Sir, all that it has done  has  been  to

cause  more disorganisation than organisation.  So  I

wonder  if the Chief Secretary can explain the duties

of  the  officer  to  be appointed  and  whether  his

appointment is temporary or permanent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Organisation and

Methods Adviser will be on contract for three  years.

It  is proposed that the task of this officer will be

to  train  local men in the organisation and  methods

technique  and  to  set  up  a  section  which   will

eventually be fully staffed by local officers trained

in  this work. It is also proposed from time to  time

to  send these officers for further training  in  the

United Kingdom Treasury and in Australia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out also, Sir, that the

section  is intended to provide for proper  attention

to   be   paid   to  the  efficiency  of   Government

departments in the full sense, which includes economy

consistent  with  the maintenance of  speed  and  the

quality of work.

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> I would

like  to reply to the point raised by the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar.  Sir,I understood him  to  say  that

Government  had  issued a circular in  which  it  was

proposed that there should be a further consolidation

of  variable  allowance into basic  salary.  Is  that

correct?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> That, Sir, is not the case. A proposal has

been  made by the Staff Side that there should  be  a

further  consolidation  of  variable  allowance  into

basic  salary. I think I can speak for the Government

when I say that the proposal will not be supported.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Could I have refutation of the

allegation made that an Order in Council is  proposed

to  be  brought  into  being to  replace  the  Public

Service  Commission Ordinance and  the  Ordinance  in

regard to abolition terms?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is true, Sir, that an Order

in  Council  will be made to incorporate  the  Public

Service  Commission  Ordinance and  the  Compensation

Ordinance.  It  is  just  to ensure  that  these  two

Ordinances are properly enshrined.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Can the Chief Minister assure us

that  neither  of these Ordinances will be  abolished

and  incorporated  into Orders in Council  until  all

departure   is   made   from  the   Report   of   the

Constitutional. Commission?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> If I may reply to this, Sir. The proposal

made  by  the hon. Member is quite beyond  me  and  I

think  we  should  have  notice  of  that  particular

question. I just do not understand what he is talking

about.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Chief Minister does.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.00p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This is another anomaly which I am

anxious to have the Government clear up. I move, Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (5) of subhead 36 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take item (5) together with

item   (10).  They  both  come  under  Establishment,

Personal Emoluments, subhead 36. We have against item (5):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Secretaries, Class III, three [$1,100-40A-1,260],



<br><br>and under item (10):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Secretaries, three [$680-35A-750/ bar/785-35A- 1,030/bar! 1,100-40A-1,420].



<br><br>Are  there six such Assistant Secretaries,  three  on

just  a segment of the full timescale, $1,100-$1,260,

or  will  there  be three, who are in fact  Assistant

Secretaries under item (10), but who will be  boosted

up  under  item  (5)?  It is nice  to  the  Permanent

Secretary (Establishment).



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, with regard to item (5) subhead

36, Sir, you will notice that there is no increase of

posts.  The holders of these posts are two  Assistant

Secretaries  who deal with service matters,  and  one

Assistant  Secretary  who is  the  Secretary  of  the

Official  Side  of the Singapore Civil Service  Joint

Council. These posts were established some years  ago

and,  in  accordance  with the  practice  then,  were

classified as Class III posts to be held by  officers

of some seniority. There are certain drawbacks in the

system  of  classes  within  the  timescale  of   the

Administrative  service,  and  since  1955  timescale

posts  in  the  Establishment have not  been  classed

showing   the  timescale.  Posts  previously  classed

continue  to be so. We ourselves are not  very  happy

about this, Sir, but if there is a case of doing away

with  these  classes  entirely,  we  shall  have   to

negotiate with the Staff Side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to item (10) of subhead 36, Sir, there

is  also no increase in the number of posts over the

present  establishment. These posts were  created  in

recent years and are on the full time-scale. We would

like to emphasise that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3060</b></font><br><br>



it  has  been realised that six Assistant Secretaries

is  the  bare minimum which the Establishment  Branch

should have. The three Assistant Secretaries in posts

against  item  (5)  subhead 36 are  not  drawing  the

salary scale as shown therein.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I just wish to make this further

comment. If the three officers who are supposed to be

budgeted  for in item (5) are not drawing the  salary

scale shown there, then why are we not presented with

a Budget which shows the correct position?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (7) of subhead 36 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item (7) sets out that there are 20 Supernumerary

officers and this sum of money is "Reserve for leave,

training,  overlap and special duties". I understand,

Sir,  that the Governor has issued instructions that,

as  Government are short of Administrative  officers,

none of them are to go away for training for the time

being.  If  that  is  true, what  is  the  sum  being

budgeted for?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member asking for

information or is he moving an amendment? I  wish  to

be quite certain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> At this stage I am moving this

formally.  I shall press the matter further  after  I

have a reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> This provision is necessary to provide

for  the  salaries of officers in training (that  is,

Administrative  cadets), officers on leave,  officers

on  special  duties, and to provide for overlap.  The

training  is for cadet officers who are on  probation

for three years. At present, there are ten cadets  in

training  and  provision has also been  made  for  an

intake  of  officers in 1958. With regard  to  leave,

Sir,  this  provision  also covers  the  salaries  of

expatriate and local officers on leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the overlapping of special duties, Sir,

we envisage the position where we may wish to replace

an officer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3061</b></font><br><br>



and we cannot make the change at once, and there will

be  an overlap sometimes for a period of one week  or

two  weeks or even a month and we pay these  officers

for their overlap duties from this vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Chief Secretary has not

answered my point. Has there been a directive that no

Administrative  officers are  to  be  sent  away  for

training  whilst we are short of them, or  has  there

not  been  such  a  directive? If there  was  such  a

directive, as I was informed there was, what is  this

vote for training all about?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, we have reduced the number of

Administrative  officers who have gone  for  overseas

training.  This is really an item which  comes  under

another  vote, Sir. A reduction has been  imposed  in

view  of  the difficult staffing position which  does

not permit of many administrative officers being sent

for  training.  In  1957, 28 administrative  officers

were  sent for training, but in 1958 the number  will

be  very  much less. This particular item is  not  in

respect  of  overseas training. It is in  respect  of

local training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (8) of subhead 36 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (8) is related to item (14) in this way.

There  are ten Supernumerary Administrative  officers

budgeted for in item (8). In item (14) there  are  20

Supernumerary Executive officer posts being  created.

The  whole purpose of the Executive service, we  were

informed,  was that it would economise on the  number

of   officers  required.  Instead  of  having  purely

Administrative officers or purely Clerical  officers,

we  have an intermediate class which would be able to

do   part   top   clerical  jobs   and   part   lower

administrative jobs. We are creating 20 such officers

in  this particular section of the government machine

and  there are still ten Supernumerary Administrative

officers budgeted for under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3062</b></font><br><br>



item  (8).  Further, item (8) shows an increase  over

last  year  of  about  $21,000.  Sir,  far  from  the

Government   fulfilling  what   was   its   professed

intention, it seems to us that they have created more

jobs  on  the executive level without a corresponding

decrease on the administrative level.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the sum to be

allotted  for Head 8 be reduced by $10 in respect  of

item  (8)  of subhead 36 therein" and, as  indicated,

discussion  may  range over the next item,  that  is,

"That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$10 in respect of item (14) of subhead 36 therein."



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I am certainly having a field day!

In  respect  of item (8) of subhead 36, Supernumerary

Administrative   officers,  of  the  eight   officers

recommended  by  the  Public Service  Commission  for

appointment as Supernumerary Administrative officers,

three  have  been confirmed in their appointments  at

the  end  of the trial period of six months  in  July

1957.  The  remaining five officers  have  had  their

trial  period extended for a further six  months  and

their   cases  are  now  before  the  Public  Service

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision in the Estimates for ten Supernumerary

Administrative officers is necessary to  provide  for

the  salaries of these officers who may be  confirmed

and for those officers who may, if Government decides

to  repeat the scheme, be selected. We may decide  to

repeat  it.  I  do not think the number  of  officers

under  this  scheme  in any way  conflicts  with  the

number    of    Executive   officer   (Supernumerary)

posts - twenty. These posts in the Establishment Office

are  provided in the Estimates as a pool for training

for  special  duties and as a reserve for overlapping

duties in cases of postings and so forth. This scheme

is  being  formulated  for the training  of  officers

appointed   to   the  Executive   service   and   was

recommended  by the Executive Service  Joint  Council

Working  Committee consisting of the Staff  Side  and

Official   Side  representatives.  As  I  say,   this

provision also covers cases of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3063</b></font><br><br>



secondment  of  officers for work on commissions  and

committees for which there are no established  posts,

and  it  will also provide for officers  who  may  be

required  to  assist in emergency arrangements  like,

for  instance,  the registration of citizens.  Again,

Sir, as I have mentioned a little while ago, when  it

comes  to  the  question of overlapping duties,  this

only  occurs when it is necessary to effect a  change

in the holder of an office. It is often necessary for

the  officer succeeding the holder to understudy  the

work for some weeks or even months. Provision for the

salaries of such officers is paid from this vote.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I am not moving them, Sir. Now I

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 8 be reduced by

$30,000 in respect of subhead 50 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rent on Quarters" is estimated to go down by

$10,000   over  last  year's  approved  Estimate   of

$40,000,   and   it  says  there,   in   the   little

explanation, "Required for rental of six flats."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that government quarters are

not  available to new local senior officers who  have

not already been occupying government quarters. It is

also  well-known that, as a result of Malayanisation,

there are considerable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3064</b></font><br><br>



numbers of vacant government bungalows.  In

fact,  it was pointed out to me the other day that  a

particular bungalow along Mountbatten Road  has  been

vacant  for six months. I cannot understand  why  the

Government should allow money to be spent in this way

just to please officers who prefer to have convenient

flats instead of government bungalows.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I think it would surprise this

House  to  know that, far from having  a  surplus  of

quarters,  we  are  going to be faced  in  1958  with

another shortage of quarters. At first sight, it does

look  queer  that with Malayanisation,  the  quarters

position is still difficult, but it is, Sir, I myself

at  first thought that the quarters position would be

eased.  It has been somewhat eased in the sense  that

the  number of officers on the waiting list has  gone

down,  but  as  I  have  pointed  out,  the  quarters

position will be difficult next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flats which we hope to rent will be placed in

the  common  pool of quarters, which are administered

by  the Temporary Quarters Committee, which is run by

my  Ministry. That is how it comes into this part  of

the  Estimates. A possible shortage of quarters  will

arise  in  1958 because of the need to house military

officers on contract who are brought out to train the

Singapore Military Forces and the Singapore  Infantry

Regiment.  We have also now to give consideration  to

quarters  for  locally  recruited  officers  of   our

military forces. We have to cater for the Polytechnic

staff  and  experts  on loan from  foreign  countries

under the Colombo Plan and U.N.O. programmes. I think

we will have to recruit more doctors next year and we

will  have  to  provide quarters for them.  It  would

surprise Members to know that we will not have enough

of quarters and we do need these flats. The provision

of  $30,000  is only 75 per cent of that provided  in

1957,  and  we  hope that we will be  able  to  house

anything up to a dozen officers or experts, according

to the quality of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3065</b></font><br><br>



the quarters rented. In 1957, we had



six  flats but it is possible that we may be  able  to

get  more  flats,  depending on  the  quality  of  the

quarters rented. I can assure the hon. Member that  we

have  not  put  this  amount in  for  nothing  in  the

Estimates.  The quarters position next  year  will  be

difficult, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $8,206,770 for Head 8 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 9 -



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 9 he reduced by

$10 in respect of item (1) of subhead I therein.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3066</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again I have chosen for discussion item (1) in

the  Budget. Sir, I have been speaking on this subject

year  after year. I have not yet understood  why  this

"white  elephant",  which is  mostly  staffed  by  the

expatriates,  should be maintained at the  expense  of

the  public. I would like to ask whether there are any

local-born  officers in Divisions I and  II-I  see  no

such  details  in the Budget. Sir, on the  Engineering

Division  we are spending $1,095,950. How many  local-born  trained  in  the  technical  side  are  in  this

division?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another question I would like to ask is this:

the total estimated expenditure is given as $3,687,830

with the remark, "Part recoverable from Federation  of

Malaya." Sir, in 1957 the amount was $3,591,100.  What

was  the  share  received by us as  indicated  in  the

Remarks column?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point, Sir. Out of the total estimated

expenditure  of  $3,687,830, there is on  the  Revenue

side an amount of $1,287,520. This leaves a balance of

$2,400,310  in  expenditure. From this  also  will  be

deducted what we receive from the Federation. I  would

like to know how much?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many sides to this subject, Sir,In the

past,  the  question has been whether  the  Government

should run broadcasting, whether it should be a  joint

venture,  or  whether it should be a corporation.  The

reply received every year has been that the matter  is

under   consideration.  The  life   of   the   present

Government  is nearly ending and still we are  in  the

same position. What is the decision?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to have the breakdown cost, as I

requested, before I can go further on this subject.  I

hope the Financial Secretary will reply to this.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, with regard to the Member for

Telok Ayer's point in connection with this Department,

I  would  like to give him certain figures  concerning

the number of local-born officers in Division I.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Directorate and Administration Division, the

number  of  posts is three: the number of  expatriate

officers is two - one   until  April  1958 - and  the  number  of  Asian

officers is one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Programme Division the number of posts is 14

of  which seven are still vacant. The number of Asian

officers  is  five,  and  the  number  of  expatriate

officers is two.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Schools Division, the number of posts is

eight:  the  number  of vacant posts  is  three;  the

number  of  Asian  officers is  two;  the  number  of

expatriate officers is three - one until 1960  and  two

until 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Engineering Division the number of posts is

ten:  two  are  vacant; one Asian officer  now  on  a

scholarship  will  return from Australia  in  January

1958  and another Asian officer will return from  the

United  Kingdom in 1961. The number of Asian officers

is two, and the number of expatriate officers is six - one until 1961 and five until 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the News Division, including the Special News

Service,  the  number of posts is six: there  is  one

vacant  post; the number of Asian officers  is  three

and  the number of expatriates is two - one until  May

1958 and the other until December 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the hon. Member is satisfied with this

question  of  local-born and expatriate  officers  in

Radio Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the revenue and expenditure of the

Department,  it  being a Pan-Malayan Department,  the

expenditure on Personal Emoluments and Other  Charges

Annually Recurrent is apportionable between Singapore

and  the  Federation  of  Malaya  in  the  ratio   of

Broadcast  Listeners' Licences in each territory.  As

the  number  of  such licences in the  Federation  of

Malaya  is  considerably higher  than  that  in  this

colony, you will see, from Appendix H at page 375  of

the Estimates, that the sum of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3068</b></font><br><br>



$2,275,410 will be payable to Singapore in 1958. The

revenue in 1958 will be as follows:-



<pre>

                                                      $

  Amount due from the Federation of Malaya        2,275,410



 Broadcast Listeners' licences, item 8, page17    1,250,000



 Miscellaneous receipts, item 6, page 18             37,520

                                                  ---------

                                 Total          $ 3,562,930

                                                  ---------



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Telok Ayer has pointed out, the

total expenditure of the Department as shown in  page

70   of   the  1958  Estimates  is  $3,687,830.   The

difference  then  is an estimated sum  of  $  124,900

only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Ayer has also said that

year  after  year he has asked whether  Radio  Malaya

should   be  a  government  department  or  a  public

corporation  and the reply he has always received  is

that  the question is under consideration. Sir, I  am

afraid  that to the question what is the future  fate

of  Radio  Malaya, the answer is still the same  this

year,  and that is, it is under consideration because

it  is  a  Pan Malayan Department and its  future  is

engaging  the  attention of the  Governments  of  the

Federation  and Singapore. Hon. Members  will  recall

that  in  the Federal Council meeting on the  4th  of

this month, His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong  in

his speech said that the Government of the Federation

of   Malaya   proposed   to  examine   the   existing

arrangements in the broadcasting service with a  view

to  ensuring complete control over future policy  and

eventually to arrange for the Federation to have  its

own  broadcasting service. As I said, this matter  is

being  given consideration and I cannot say  anything

except  to  repeat again that the question  of  Radio

Malaya is still under consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> (Queenstown): Mr Speaker, Sir,

speaking on the appointments held by expatriates  and

Asians,  I  notice  on  page  64,  item  24,  in  the

Programme Division, the creation of a new post called

the  Controller of Programmes. Now here is the reason

why  this post is created - I refer to page 444 of  the

Estimates:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A new post of Controller of Programmes has been

created so that adequate supervision can be given  to

the  nine sections in the Programme Division (English

Programmes,  Chinese Programmes,  Indian  Programmes,

Malay  Programmes, Record Library, Reference Library,

Script  Traffic,  Production Assistant's  Office  and

Radio  Orchestra).  The duties  of  a  Controller  of

Programmes  have in the past been undertaken  by  the

Deputy Director, who as a result was unable to  carry

out  his normal duties. It is also necessary to  have

an  upper  timescale  post in this  Division  of  the

Department to give parity with other Divisions, e.g..

News    Division,   Schools   Division,   Engineering

Division."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This job was normally carried out by the Deputy

Director  and it appears now that, according  to  the

Government, the Deputy Director cannot carry out  the

duties  of  this post. Yet I see that the appointment

of  Principal Administrative Officer on page  63  has

been  abolished. Now why create a post here and  then

abolish a post there? Is the Deputy Director so  busy

that  he  cannot manage just merely to supervise,  as

clearly stated in the reason given above? His work is

just  to supervise and, apart from his normal duties,

is  it not possible for him to supervise the work  of

the Programme Division?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, on this question of appointments on page

64,  let  us  compare item (25) with items  (27)  and

(28).  In  item  (25)  we have an  English  Programme

Supervisor  whose salary scale is $960-35A-1,240.  In

items  (27)  and (28) we have the Chinese and  Indian

Programme Supervisors whose salary is 5560: 630: 660:

690-30A-930/bar/960-35A-1,240. Why should there be  a

disparity  between  the English Programme  Supervisor

and the Chinese and Indian Programme Supervisors?  Is

it  because  of the word "English" that  the  English

Programme Supervisor carries a higher salary than the

Chinese  and Indian Programme Supervisors? Or  is  it

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3070</b></font><br><br>



this  post-English  Programme  Supervisor - is

held by an expatriate officer?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Chief Secretary can tell us whether

the post of Controller of Programmes is to be filled

by an expatriate officer and who will be appointed to

the three Programme Supervisor appointments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, a new post of Controller of

Programmes  is  required. His  responsibility  is  to

supervise  the  nine sections which  the  Member  for

Queenstown  mentioned, and his duties, which  are  of

course  full-time, have hitherto been  undertaken  by

the  Deputy Director who, as a result, has  not  been

available for normal Deputy Director duties. With the

abolition  of  the  post of Principal  Administrative

Officer, the Deputy Director will take over  some  of

the  functions of that post. That is the  reason  why

the  post  of  Principal Administrative  Officer  was

abolished.  The Deputy Director takes over  his  post

and   is  in  turn  relieved  of  responsibility  for

supervision of the Programme Division which  will  be

undertaken by the Controller of Programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the other point raised by the Member

for  Queenstown, I certainly do not  agree  with  his

reason  for  the apparent difference  in  the  salary

scale - it  is  only  a question of  the  segment.  The

difference is not because of the fact that  the  post

is filled by an expatriate or that the word "English"

has magic attached to it!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, I am not at all

satisfied with the reply given by the Hon. the  Chief

Secretary.  Sir,  this  is  a  department  which,  if

properly run, should earn revenue instead of being  a

liability    on   the   taxpayer.   It   is    highly

unsatisfactory,  Sir,  that the Coalition  Government

has  up  to now not been able to come to any decision

on  the  matter  of policy, whether the  Broadcasting

Department  should  be a corporation  or  whether  it

should be run by the Government, and on what basis. I

am  also  very  unhappy  to see  in  the  Engineering

Division  seven expatriates in office and  one  Asian

who,  I believe, is to return from training overseas.

Now this state of affairs is very sad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3071</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir, I

said  that  of ten posts in the Engineering  Division

two  are vacant posts, and of these two vacant posts,

one of them is being held against an Asian officer on

scholarship  to Australia and there is another  Asian

now  in the United Kingdom. There are at present  two

Asian  officers occupying two of the eight  posts  in

the Engineering Division.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> In other words, am I to understand

that there are six expatriates there?



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> That is correct.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question was

centred  more on whether expatriates or  Asians  will

fill  the  four appointments which I have  mentioned,

that  is,  the Controller of Programmes, the  English

Programme    Supervisor,   the   Chinese    Programme

Supervisor and the Indian Programme Supervisor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that would be a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, item (39) says a sum of $13,640 is to be spent

on   a   Programme  Organiser,  Qualified   Education

Officer,  and an Unqualified Education Officer.  Sir,

if  I  may  take  also  item (40)  we  have  again  a

repetition of Unqualified Education Officer. I do not

know  what  this signifies. We have heard  a  lot  of

derogatory remarks made about the schools broadcasts.

Nobody  thinks  it  is worth while carrying  on  with

them. I would like to know what is the meaning of  an

Unqualified  Education Officer and why he  should  be

getting  more than a Qualified Education Officer,  as

appears on page 229, Head 45-Education-subhead 1 item

(41) . I find there against Education Officer for Men,

Honours  Degree, the salary scale starts at $445  and

ends   at   $920.  And  these  Unqualified  Education

Officers who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3072</b></font><br><br>



have  not  made  a  great  success  of  Radio  Malaya

broadcasts get $560 up to $1,240. Are such people  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum that has been budgeted for

canned programmes is estimated to go up by $23,200 in

1958.  I fully understand the desirability of  having

good  canned  programmes from whatever  part  of  the

world  we can get them. It does, however, seem to  me

illogical that we should be spending more and more on

staff  in order to have original programmes  and  yet

instead of having these original programmes take  the

place  of  the canned programmes, we are paying  more

for  canned programmes. Obviously all the  new  staff

that  we are hoping to recruit cannot be of much  use

because  canned programmes will be occupying more  of

the time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Stewart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Stewart:</b> Sir, I appreciate what the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar has said, but I am sure he must  admit

that  we  have to go on with canned programmes  also.

respect  of  plays, music, and so forth broadcast  in

both  territories. In effect, this  vote  covers  all

copyright  fees  payable by the two Governments.  The

explanation  for the $23,000 odd extra this  year  is

that an additional sum of $4,500 is required for  the

payment  of copyright on Malay literature, drama  and

publications  of various kinds used for broadcasting.

Hitherto  Malayan authors have not been protected  by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $3,687,830 for Head 9 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 10 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $388,760 for Head 10 ordered to stand

part of the Schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3074</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11-



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allotted for Head 11 be reduced

by $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 4 therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have again chosen item (1) under this head

for  discussion of the whole subject. Sir, we see  in

the Budget "Royal Malayan Navy", "Malayan Royal Naval

Volunteer  Reserve",  "Singapore  Military   Forces",

"Singapore Infantry Regiment", "Malayan Auxiliary Air

Force", etc, costing us so many million dollars. Sir,

when   the  Royal  Malayan  Navy  was  created,   our

constitutional position was quite different.  Now  we

have  a  neighbour  which is an independent  country.

Singapore  has  very little to look  after  and  very

little to fight for. Is it necessary at all to  spend

so  much  money on naval establishments?  If  we  are, spending, for whose benefit are we spending, and for

which war are we spending? Further, Sir, can we go on

spending on such items when we ourselves as  a  small

colony  would  be quite helpless? The  last  war  has

already  shown  us what we should do  [Interruption.]

Yes,  you  people left the local people in the  lurch

and we had to suffer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Some local chaps scooted!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> What I discovered at that time was

that  we  were helpless against air attack.  We  were

never  attacked  from  the  sea  side.  Singapore  is

surrounded  by small islands and we can  prevent  the

enemy  from  entering by laying  mines,  etc.  If  my

memory  serves,  the  enemy  never  tried  to  attack

Singapore  from the sea. In the conditions prevailing

at  present in the world, is it worth while to go  on

spending millions and millions on a project which may

be   quite  useless,  having  regard  to  the  recent

developments  of sputniks and so many  other  things?

Can we not utilise this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3075</b></font><br><br>



money  for  the  betterment  of  our  own  people  by

providing  health and medical services, and education

and so on?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, we are also spending a lot

on  military forces. Why so much? Are we to fight any

one?  Will we be able to resist anyone? What actually

is wanted is the means whereby we can secure internal

control and help the police. Yes, I do agree that our

youngsters must take up military service. It will  be

of  use in an emergency and it will help them to keep

fit. But do we want so many battalions and should  we

waste  so  much money on army equipment and training?

After  all, whom are we paying to train? Expatriates?

Of course, we have got to do this because we have not

got  our  own  trained personnel. Sir,  therefore,  I

would  suggest  that  considerable  economy  can   be

effected under this head.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support   this  amendment  wholeheartedly.  I   still

remember during the debate on the Second Reading  the

reply   of  the  Hon. the  Chief  Secretary  to   my

suggestion  that  we scrap entirely defence,  and  he

gave a very humorous example that we could not refuse

to  buy  an umbrella although the rain had  not  come

yet. I would like to take this opportunity to ask him

whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3076</b></font><br><br>



this  umbrella is made of paper, silk  or  nylon,  or

from which direction the rain is coming. Certainly  I

have to agree with the Member for Telok Ayer that  in

this   sputnik  age  local  defence   seems   to   be

ridiculous, especially on a small island  like  ours.

Because we are now marching towards independence  and

in every independent country it must have everything,

including an army, power, I wish-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I beg to report that the Committee of

Supply  has  made progress on the Appropriation  Bill

and ask leave to sit again tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question for Oral Answer stood on the

Order Paper of 16th December, 1957:-



<div align="center"><b>CITIZENSHIP (TEMPORARY RESIDENTS) BRITISH PASSPORTS (Singapore citizens)</b></div>



<br><br><!--Mr Lim Cher Kheng-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>"Mr  Lim  Cher  Kheng:</b> To ask the  Chief  Secretary

whether  he  is aware of the possibility  of  persons

holding temporary identity cards being registered  as

citizens  of  Singapore: to state whether  a  person,

after   having  been  registered  as  a  citizen   of

Singapore,  is entitled to be issued with  a  British

passport; and whether he will make a statement."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to Standing Order 16 (2), the Chief

Secretary supplied the following answer:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(a) There is no such thing as a temporary identity

card,  but  where  a person is in Singapore  only  by

authority of a limited immigration pass or permit the

period  of  validity of such pass or  perrmt  is  for

administrative convenience endorsed on  the  identity

card.  It  is  unlikely that except in  very  unusual

circumstances  a  citizen of the United  Kingdom  and

Colonies  (or  of  the Republic of  India  under  the

recent direction) would be allowed to remain here  on

a temporary immigration pass or permit long enough to

meet the residential qualification for citizenship;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) At present, registration as a citizen of

Singapore does not alter a person's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 3080</b></font><br><br>



nationality  or  eligibility  for  a  British

passport. When the British Nationality Act, 1948,  is

amended  as mentioned in the Report of the  Singapore

Constitutional  Conference  published  as   Sessional

Paper  Misc.  No.  2 of 1957, consideration  will  be

given  to  the question of eligibility for  passports

and  if  necessary, a statement will be made at  that
