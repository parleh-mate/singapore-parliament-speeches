<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>BLACK OPERATIONS AGAINST SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>





<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs,  in  the  light of recent revelations  about

Black Operations mounted against the Government  from

a  number of countries, whether he will elaborate  on

the   implications   with  regard  to   international

relations governing our foreign policies; and  if  he

will   also  indicate  how  these  will  affect   the

relations of Singapore with the countries concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the last

part  of  the  question, may  I  say  that  relations

between Singapore and the countries from which  black

operations  were  directed have not suffered  to  any

appreciable degree. This is because we are  satisfied

that  the governments concerned were not involved  in

these unfriendly activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer in particular to the cases of Mr Leong Mun

Kwai and Mr Tan Wah Piow, both of whom have been used

for  black  operations  not  by  governments  but  by

hostile groups and individuals in friendly countries.

If  hon.  Members  would read Mr Leong's  disclosures

very carefully, it is clear that he had been directed

by officials and politicians who appear to have acted

without the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



knowledge  or  approval  of  responsible  people   in

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Mr Tan Wah Piow is slightly different.

Unlike  Mr Leong, he was more successful in  doing  a

bunk  and  finding  sanctuary in a friendly  country.

Hence  we  were  not  able  to  interrogate  him  and

confront him with such evidence as we have.  But,  in

my  view, he is of the same breed as Mr Leong. Though

Mr Tan Wah Piow transgressed British laws by entering

the  country with an ineptly forged passport, he  was

lucky  enough  to  have had some  rather  influential

friends  in that country. Instead of being hauled  up

on  criminal  charges, he has been  rewarded  with  a

place  in  Bradford University where he is dedicating

himself,   I   understand,  to  the  study   of   the

intricacies of British law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, we are satisfied that the responsible

leaders of government in the United Kingdom could not

have  been  parties to the rewarding of a  forger,  a

black  agent,  an  army  deserter  and  an  architect

student  who  failed  to  make  the  grade   in   our

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to low level mercenaries like Mr Leong

and   Mr   Tan  Wah  Piow,  there  are  more   deadly

ideological  operators  and  pseudo  revolutionaries.

They  work,  with  the active or passive  support  of

foreign  governments,  to further  one  of  the  many

varieties  of  communism.  Singapore  is   and   will

continue  to be a target for this kind of  subversive

operations.     Misguided    liberals,    disgruntled

politicians    and   alienated   intellectuals    are

additional  grist to the subversive mill. The  latter

generally tend to dismiss all references to communist

subversion  and  periodic  arrest  and  detention  of

subversives   as  bogies  raised  by   a   government

intolerant of dissent. This is precisely the frame of

mind  the  dedicated communists encourage and  foster

among  the  less dedicated who take up revolution  as

part-time recreation or as a form of psychotherapy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence the readiness with which this kind of

revolutionary breaks down and spills the beans  when,

with  the  first arrest, he discovers that revolution

is a deadly business.











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>





The  fact that these are misguided weaklings does not

make them any less dangerous to Singapore. By helping

to  confuse  the people about the ultimate objectives

of  the  dedicated  communists they,  whatever  their

intentions, objectively further the communist  cause.

Once the communists win, these liberals will be among

the first casualties. We only get these weaklings  to

own   up  publicly  to  their  stupidities  but   the

Communists, once they are in power as had happened in

countries  in  our  region, treat them  as  dangerous

vermin to be exterminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With reference to the earlier part of the question,

in  the  conduct of our international  relations  the

Government  and the people must never lose  sight  of

the fact that an independent Singapore will always be

a target for subversion. More so in a period of great

and  small  power rivalries in our region - rivalries

not  only between communist and non-communist nations

but  also  between  communist  nations.  So  in  this

battle,  Singapore  will  always  be  a  target   for

influence by these countries and therefore an  object

for  subversion. Singapore may be small  but  in  the

power  game  control over Singapore is. for  a  rival

power  or nation, the key to the control of Southeast

Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is how the British saw Singapore in the hey-day

of  British imperialism and that is how the  Japanese

saw  it during their brief hour of glory in Southeast

Asia.  Singapore in Singaporean hands may  not  be  a

threat.  But Singapore in the hands of a great  power

or  some  other  power is a key to  the  control  and

dominance of Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the day Singaporeans or their government are

persuaded that subversion, whether from the right  or

from  the  left  is  a bogey, is  a  figment  of  the

imagination of a desperate government, that day  will

mark  the  beginning  of the end  of  an  independent

Singapore.  Once the people develop cynicism  towards

the periodic arrest and detention of communists, that

is  the  day  the communists will have  succeeded  in

their purpose of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



getting  our people to believe that there is no  such

thing as subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case there is no need for the PAP Government

with  its decisive electoral strength to play up  the

communist bogey to win elections or maintain  popular

support. We have no need to do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason therefore why we are arresting people

like  Mr  Leong and Mr Raman and making public  their

admissions  is not that we need these confessions  to

bolster  our standing with the people but  really  to

educate   our   people,  especially   the   so-called

liberals,  about political realities  which  must  be

taken  into consideration in the formulation  of  our

foreign policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why, Mr Speaker, Sir, we waited till after

the  elections before taking action against them.  We

knew  and  suspected that something of  the  kind  of

either  black operations or subversion was going  on.

Had  we  done  so before the elections,  such  action

would  have  been  seen as the  desperate  act  of  a

Government  unsure of electoral support in  the  last

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only must our people realise that they must live

with  the reality of subversion for a long, long time

but   they  must  also  know  how  subversion  works.

Unfortunately,  Mr Speaker, not many  people  believe

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many people in Singapore who are

easy  prey  for subversives. After all, in  the  last

elections  thousands of people were taken  in  by  Mr

Leong  Mun Kwai and his friends into voting for their

candidates  or  the candidates they supported.  After

all,  Mr  Leong,  as  did Mr Raman,  did  succeed  in

impressing  a very intelligent man like Mr Jeyaretnam

and  his friends in the Workers Party that they  were

true and loyal Singaporeans working for Singapore and

many  people  did  vote for Mr Jeyaretnam.  True,  Mr

Jeyaretnam  claims that he is no fool, but  the  fact

remains  that  Mr  Leong and Mr  Raman  did  fool  Mr

Jeyaretnam. They must have, for it could  not  be,  I

hope, that Mr Jeyaretnam knew what both of them  were

up to. In fact, Mr Raman has fooled him so completely

that even after Mr Raman











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



admitted  publicly  that  he  was  a  communist,   Mr

Jeyaretnam stated publicly that Mr Raman  was  not  a

communist.  So when one can fool a man to  the  point

where  he  makes a fool of himself, that  is  fooling

with  complete success. Maybe Mr Jeyaretnam knows  Mr

Raman's  mind better than Mr Raman does. If Mr  Leong

and  Mr  Raman can so completely fool Mr  Jeyaretnam,

then  I  do  not  believe that even  tomorrow,  after

listening  to  this,  he  will  withdraw  his  public

statement that Mr Raman is not a communist.  He  will

still  persist in believing that Mr Raman  is  not  a

communist. So if they can fool Mr Jeyaretnam to  make

foolish utterances, then that is all the more  reason

why  we  should redouble our efforts to  educate  our

people  about  the  reality  of  subversion  and  its

devious ways. And this is one of the reasons  why  so

much  of  time  and  space is being  devoted  in  the

newspapers   to   publicising  the  statements,   the

admissions, by Mr Raman. Tomorrow it will be Mr Arun,

and I do not know who else during the coming weeks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

supplementary question. It appears that Mr  G.  Raman

has  been involved in subversive activities for quite

some  time.  Generally speaking, communist  activists

are believed to be disciplined adults.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the Member's supplementary

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> May I ask the hon. Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  what brought about  the  voluminous

confessions of Mr G. Raman in such a short time?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime ago I wrote

an  article  in  which I divided our communists,  and

possibly  communists  in other  countries,  into  two

categories.  The  first category comprises  dedicated

communists  who believe in their cause and  who  will

die for their cause. The other category, to summarise

my   thesis,  comprises  what  I  would  call  ``goat

communists".  These  are the  liberals  who  play  at

revolution, and the communists often use them, as  in

World  War  II when the Army wanted to clear  a  mine

field `they first sent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



goats to find out where the mines were and to explode

them. They are expendables.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the role of people like Mr Raman and others.

He  is  not  the  only one to come out  and  confess.

Earlier  on  we  had  a  ballerina  and  others   who

confessed.   These  are  affluent  communists,   goat

communists, who play at revolution. They think  there

is  a  lot of excitement, hoping to find a place  for

themselves  - you know, thwarted ambitions,  personal

grudges,  vanity.  So  they  play  around.  And  they

believed that because they had very powerful  friends

in  the  United Kingdom, the Western world,  who  are

liberals,  newspaper men, to play up their cause,  we

would  be  scared to proceed against  them.  But  the

moment we do, when they are detained and brought  for

interrogation they see the evidence that we have  and

the  prospect that if they do not tell the truth they

can  be detained for five years. If the PAP is  going

to  last  for the next 15 years, then they  must  ask

themselves,  is this what revolution  is  all  about?

Because  if  the communists come, as has happened  in

one  or two countries in this part of the world,  the

first  people they eliminate are the goat  communists

who,  they say, are weak enough to simulate communism

and  therefore are dangerous, because when  Communism

is  in  power they will simulate liberalism. So  they

exterminate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suspect that people like Mr Raman and so on

are  affluent communists, part-time communists,  goat

communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Hon.  Minister for Foreign Affairs re-affirm in  this

House that despite the public confessions of both  Mr

G.  Raman  and  Mr  Leong Mun Kwai relations  between

Singapore and countries like Malaysia and the  United

Kingdom will continue to be good?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have stated

earlier,  the  relations between the governments  are

good,  because  we do not regard these operations  as

operations  conducted by the respective  governments.

Both  governments,  I believe, are equally  satisfied

that on basic issues. Singapore/











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>





Malaysia and Singapore/Britain in particular. we have

the  same  objective, that is,  to  preserve  a  non-communist  world. In fact, if there is any digression

or  diversion  by  black operations.  we  are  really

tripping  one  another. I hope this realisation  will

sink in because relations between the governments are

good  and, I hope, will continue to be good,  unless,

of  course,  the  Communists should take  over  these

countries.  Then,  of  course,  relations   must   be

invariably bad.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in the light of communist

subversion  which,  as  the hon.  Minister  has  just

mentioned,  Singapore will continue to  face,  it  is

noted that SAF officers will be given instruction  on

Marxism-Leninism.  Will the Hon.  Minister  enlighten

this  House  -  in what way will such instruction  or

training  assist  the Government in  its  efforts  to

counter this threat?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the education has

already started, and we have got the best lecturer on

Marxism-Leninism in Mr Raman. He has been telling the

people  for  the  last  two  days  exactly  how  they

operate.  We  cannot  convince  Mr  Jeyaretnam.   but

fortunately  for us, Singapore does  not  consist  of

Jeyaretnams. So this is the first lesson in  Marxism-Leninism,  not  in  theory but in practice.  We  hope

tomorrow everybody will listen to Mr Arun who is  not

a  Marxist  but who has been dragged in. He  will  be

narrating  how  they operate. There  is  a  gentleman

called  Mr  Derek  Davies who is  also,  I  think,  a

stooge, an unwitting stooge, of the communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are lessons in Marxism - how the communists

can   manipulate  non-communists  or  near-communists

without   their   knowing   that   they   are   being

manipulated.  This  is one lesson which  has  already

started.  I  hope  it  will be supplemented  by  more

systematic instructions in Marxism-Leninism,  not  as

they  say  it is but as it actually is. I  hope  that

Members  of  Parliament will buy the Marxist-Leninist

books  available in Singapore, study them,  and  also

listen  to  the  speeches of the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs who from time to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



time  issues  little statements to show what  Marxism

really is.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

only one question I want to ask. We are a member of

the Commonwealth, are we not?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Then we can bring this matter up

at  a  meeting of Commonwealth countries. If  we  say

that  Tan  Wah  Piow's case is a very  small  matter,

another case will come up. Whether or not, it will be

considered at a meeting of Commonwealth countries, we

should  seek  their assistance. What is  the  use  of

being in the Commonwealth if they are not cooperating

with us? They are going against us. Tan Wah Piow  has

been   accepted  by  them.  They  should  know   that

Singapore  is  a  member  of the  Commonwealth.  They

should  do  something about it. The Foreign  Minister

should  take immediate action on this matter. It  may

be  a very small matter but in future it may be a big

affair. Singapore must be very careful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand the

strength  of feeling of the hon. Member. But  I  have

made  it quite clear that Mr Tan Wah Piow's operation

had  not  been directed by the Commonwealth.  It  had

been directed by a small group of gentlemen. One  was

Malcolm  Caldwell, who has claimed that  he  is  even

superior  to  Mao because he says he is  an  anarcho-Maoist. These are individuals who are usually of some

influence.  They  have got him a  place  in  Bradford

University.  I  think  the  best  punishment  we  can

inflict on those responsible for this is to let  them

<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi</b> asked the Minister for

National Development and Communications what measures

will be taken to ensure that debris, rusty iron rods,

metal  and stones are cleared before playgrounds  and

open  areas  in  the  Housing and  Development  Board

estates are turfed. and that the use of barbed  wires

in these areas will be prohibited.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Housing and Development Board has  in  the

past asked the contractors to make good the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



playgrounds and open areas in cases where debris were

not  properly  cleared. The Board will continue  with

this  practice, and also exercise greater supervision

on  the  contractors to ensure that  all  debris  are

removed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of the contractors to clean

up  open  spaces and other grounds within a  specific

time  after  completing their work. The  Housing  and

Development  Board will impose a fine  on  those  who

fail  to  do  so. In addition, they are  required  to

clear the debris immediately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barbed wires are used to fence in newly turfed

areas.  They will be removed once the turf  is  fully

established.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

does  the hon. Minister realise that the barbed wires

could cause serious injury to children, especially at

night when certain areas are not lit?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the first

place,  children are not supposed to walk  around  at

night  in  open spaces where contractors are working.

Let  me perhaps tell the Member that if it is a well-planned  and well-executed playground meant  strictly

for  children to play, then in that case  the  barbed

wires   can  easily  be  removed  and  perhaps  other

substitutes like wire, string or perhaps straw if  he

likes,  could  be  used to fence  around  fields  and

certain plants as we do now. But in this case we  are

talking of turfing of playing fields.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, just to clarify a point, I

would  like  to  ask  the Senior  Minister  of  State

whether  he realises that in Lorong 8, for  instance,

the  turfed  area  has a boundary  with  barbed  wire

fencing running beside a pathway. At night this  area

is  not  well  lit,  and there  is  the  danger  that

children  might accidentally get cut by these  barbed

wires.  Something has to be done.  Could  we  have  a

positive answer on this, please?



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the answer is positive. If

the  Member can inform us of such incidents, we  will

definitely look into the matter.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, if the Senior Minister of State is

obliging enough, I will be very happy to bring him to

the housing estate and show him a piece of metal

jutting out of the ground, not at the corner of the

estate but in the `middle of the area where people

walk up and down, especially children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is not true that barbed wires are

always  located in areas which are not frequented  by

children.  I was at Ang Mo Kio last night  and  I  saw

barbed   wires  along  the  pavement  of   the   main

passageways.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the HDB area office will be

most  appreciative if the Member can point out  where

the metal piece is. Like all playing fields and areas

under  the  HDB's management, things of  this  nature

have  occurred  and  will occur.  I  am  answering  a

question  here  regarding the removal  of  debris  by

contractors,  and  I  say  again  that  it   is   the

responsibility  of  the  contractors  to  remove  the

debris, and that a fine will be levied if he does not

do  it  properly.  But  that does  not  suggest  that

incidents  of that nature will never occur.  I  would

therefore  appreciate  it if the  hon.  Member  could

bring  it  to  our attention so that we can  have  it

removed.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, if the Estates

<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

question is: have the officials of the Housing  Board

ensured  themselves  that before turfing  is  carried

out,  every  boulder,  metal and  sharp  objects  are

cleared off the ground?

will try our best to do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Hon. Minister has not

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Redevelopment will be considered where the flats

are 3-storey or less and the density is low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Sale is considered where the flats are more than

three storeys and the density is high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans to sell the SIT flats at the

<div align="center"><b>FEES PAYABLE ON PURCHASE OF HDB FLATS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Clarification)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  and  Communications,  in  view  of   the

confusion caused by certain political parties  during

the recent general elections about the engagement  of

lawyers  for  purchases  of Housing  and  Development

Board flats, if he will clarify what fees are payable

to the Board by purchasers of the Board's flats.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

fees  payable  to  the Board are  $15  for  engrossed

documents and $5 administrative fee. That is all  the

purchaser  of  a  HDB flat has to pay  to  the  Board

itself.











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, like any other house purchaser, he has also

to  pay  the  usual conveyancing fees to the  various

Government departments, namely:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Stamp Fee for lease at 2% of sale price for the

first  $30,000,  and an additional $16  for  a  lease

exceeding three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Fees for registration of lease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Government Survey Fee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Stamp Fee for mortgage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Fees for registration of mortgage.



<br><br>The  HDB  merely  collects these fees  on  behalf  of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, for a 3-room new flat in Ang Mo Kio which

costs  $15,800, the purchaser will have to  pay  the

following  fees  if he takes a 20-year  loan,  after

paying the 20% down payment of $3,200:-



<pre>

Engrossment of documents                       $  15



Administrative Fee                             $   5

Stamp Fees for lease

(2% of $15,800 plus $16 for a 99-year lease)   $ 332



Fees for registration of lease                 $  27



Government Survey fee                          $ 100



Stamp Fees for mortgage

(Loan of $12,600)                              $  66



Fees for registration of mortgage              $  22



                                        Total  $ 567

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total sum is $567, out of which the HDB only

collects $20.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in the light of the Senior

Minister  of State's reply, can I ask him a  question

on  the Government survey fee of $100, if I heard him

right?  Is  it not too high a sum to levy? Could  the

authority to reduce this fee of $100?

people  is  being planned, just outside  the  adverse

noise  zone  of  the Changi Airport.  The  town  will

comprise  a series of neighbourhoods, each  with  its

own  centre. When completed, it will be provided with

a comprehensive range of amenities and facilities for

the   enjoyment  of  the  residents,   including   an

extensive green park on its periphery. The town  will

be  provided  with primary and secondary  schools,  a

vocational institute, a junior college and  a  sports

complex.  There  will  also be a modern  traffic-free

town  centre  to  be attractively  designed  for  the

pedestrians.   Finally,   a   comprehensive    public

transport  system will be designed to make all  parts

of  the town accessible from one another. There  will

also  be back-up facilities for the Airport, such  as

warehousing  and  storage of cargoes  and  sites  for

associated  aerospace  industries.  These  facilities

will  be planned close to the Airport for operational

convenience.

scheme  for Serangoon Garden Estate will improve  the

bus service and when the scheme will be introduced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

presently,  the  Singapore  Bus  Service  Ltd   (SBS)

operates  seven  normal services and one  Blue  Arrow

service serving Serangoon Garden Estate. Despite this

large number of services operating into and from  the

Estate.  the  level  of  service  provided   to   the

residents  is unsatisfactory owing to the inefficient

network of services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing bus service system needs to be

rationalised  because  there  is  a  great  deal   of

wasteful  deployment of buses as a  result  of  route

duplication. Buses operate into the Estate throughout

the  day thereby lengthening the time taken for  each

trip.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study was made by SBS in October last year with a

view  to  improving  the  level  of  bus  service  to

Serangoon Garden Estate. After consultations with the

hon. Member for Serangoon Gardens and the members  of

his Citizens Consultative Committee, SBS has proposed

the following improvements:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Some services will be abolished to reduce

wasteful  duplication while other  services  will  be

modified  to better serve the residents. As a  result

of this route rationalisation, service frequency will

be  improved  from  14 1/2 minutes to about  9 1/2  minutes

during peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A one-man-operated internal service will be

introduced  into  the Estate during  off-peak  hours.

This will provide residents in the Estate with a much

better level of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed route rationalisation is being examined

by the Bus Services Licensing Authority to see if the

services could be further streamlined. The new scheme

will probably be introduced in April as soon as it is

finalised  and approved by the Bus Services Licensing

Authority.

Thomson Road to Avenue 6, Ang Mo Kio.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the East-West Arterial Road from Upper

Thomson  Road  to Avenue 8. Ang Mo Kio, is  completed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-South Arterial Road project comprises 3.2

km  of  roadway and two bridge structures.  This  new

North-South Road will run from Avenue 1, Ang Mo  Kio,

to  cross over Braddell Road and link up with Thomson

Road.   As   parts   of  the  site  are   encumbered,

construction  work for the project is  being  carried

out  in stages. Phase I of the project near Avenue  1

comprising  a bridge across Sungei Kallang  and  some

respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire project is expected to complete by

November 1979. With the completion of this road,  the

traffic  congestion along Upper Thomson Road will  be

relieved considerably as City-bound traffic from  Ang

facilitate crossing, the Public Works Department  has

installed  a  pedestrian pushbutton  signal  crossing

near  this location, which operates from 5 am. to  11

a.m.  daily. At other times when pedestrian movements

are  not  heavy, it is not necessary to  operate  the

traffic signals as this would slow down traffic  flow

and  cause severe traffic congestion around this area

during the evening peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Serangoon Garden Way is only a two-lane road,

it  is  unlikely  that a pedestrian  overhead  bridge

across this narrow road will be used by pedestrians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not recommended to construct an

overhead  bridge linking the market and  post  office

sides of Serangoon Garden Way.

<div align="center"><b>(Production of local programmes)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon</b> asked the Minister for

Culture and Science and Technology whether Radio  and

Television   Singapore   will   be   producing   more

programmes of its own using the talent and  resources

available locally, instead of relying











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



almost  completely on imported programmes  which  are

often ambivalent to our national aspirations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, production of TV

programmes,  especially  colour  programmes,  is   an

involved activity. Adequate facilities and staff  are

necessary  though not the only relevant factors.  The

available  pool of script writers and artistes  is  a

prerequisite.  Unfortunately  we  do  not   have   an

adequate  pool  of such local talents.  In  spite  of

this,  RTS  will  endeavour  to  produce  more  local

programmes wherever local talents are available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not correct to say that our TV services rely

almost completely on imported programmes. In terms of

the  total  hours of TV programmes per average  week,

IocaIIy produced programmes constitute 66% as against

34% of imported programmes. Likewise, in terms of the

number of TV programmes telecast in an average  week,

84  are imported programmes as compared to 67 locally

produced  programmes.  The  imported  programmes  are

stringently  vetted  before  they  are  acquired  and

telecast.  Last  year  a  total  of  70  series  were

rejected outright after auditioning. Some were  found

unsuitable  as  they projected Western permissiveness

and  decadence.  Others  were rejected  because  they

contained too much crime and violence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may also wish to know that all Radio

output except the English Service is locally produced

or  locally  compiled. Even in  the  English  Service

overseas produced programmes constitute only  10%  of

its output.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Sir, will the Minister

clarify  whether  the 66% of air  time  taken  up  by

locally  produced programmes include repeat telecast,

since   inevitably  most  of  the  locally   produced

programmes are repeated within the week?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> No, I do not think it includes

repeat  telecast. It is very expensive to  produce  a

programme locally, and therefore we have to make full

use of it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



Since  most  of  the locally produced programmes  are

documentaries, it is a good practice to  repeat  them

because  not everyone has the opportunity  to  see  a

certain programme at the time when it is telecast.



<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Sir, since the Minister

says  that  there  is a lack of local  talents,  what

plans  does the Ministry have to' develop these local

talents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, we have always been trying

to  develop and train local talent, but unfortunately

the pool of local talent is very limited. This is due

not only to the limited number of people but also  to

the limited area of employment. At the present moment

TV  artistes  are  only employed  by  the  Television

Service. Other than that there is no real outlet  for

them.  In  other  countries  where  a  film  industry

exists,  the artistes are mainly drawn from the  film

industry. But in the case of Singapore we do not have

a  film  industry  and it is quite difficult  to  get

talent or to have full-time performers because  these

people cannot get a good living out of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on Question

[28th February, 1977].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of

the  Government  for the financial year  1st  April,

1977 to 31st March, 1978" - [Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>3.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  support the Motion standing  in  the

name of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found myself much in agreement with what the hon.

Minister said in his Budget Statement. Our economy in

1976  was  in much better shape than it  was  in  the

earlier year. In part, of course, this was due to the

economic recovery and dampening of inflation  in  the

leading  industrial countries. But we  can  take  due

credit for the large





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>





number  of  sensible domestic measures  and  policies

which  enabled our economy to recover rapidly. I  can

find  little fault with the basic policies in respect

of  manpower, science and technology, infrastructure,

taxation and promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me. however, to offer a few comments which I

hope will contribute to improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's Economic Survey drew attention to the

recovery of the manufacturing sector by 10% and noted

the  rise by 3% in productivity in that sector.  Lest

we rush to congratulate ourselves and our workers for

the improvement in productivity, we should not forget

that  such  improvements usually occur as an  economy

pulls  out of recession. We shall still need to  bend

every  effort  to  make improvements in  productivity

continually.  Furthermore, the Economic  Survey  also

noted   that   much  of  the  overall   increase   in

manufacturing output was accounted for by an  upsurge

in  petroleum refining activities. Hon.  Members  may

recall   that  the  petroleum  refining  sector   had

suffered much in 1975 as a result of the end  of  the

Vietnam War.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Col. 571 of the Economic Survey reported that

private  capital expenditure in 1976 grew  by  6%  to

$2,359 million. The increase, however, was due to the

acquisitiveness  of  Neptune  Orient   Lines,   whose

Managing Director has assumed the role of Member  for

Marine Parade. This increase masked a decline  of  8%

in  capital expenditure on buildings and works and  a

10%  decline  for  machinery and  equipment.  I  draw

attention  to  this,  Sir,  because  the  volume   of

investment  particularly in plant and equipment  will

affect the productive capacity of our economy in  the

future. This failure of investment to respond is,  of

course, not unique to us. As I pointed out during the

debate  last  year  and earlier this  year.  economic

recovery   in   the  advanced  countries   is   being

threatened  by  the failure of new investments  being

undertaken  in sufficient volume. I hope,  therefore,

that we can make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



much  more  headway  with the  schemes  to  stimulate

private  industrial development such as  the  Capital

Assistance  Scheme  and the Small Industries  Finance

Scheme.  Both  of  these add up to  a  paltry  $17.73

million so far!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister may also want to pay some

attention   to   the   decline  of   private   sector

construction of 12% in 1976. I hope he is  monitoring

the situation so that we can avoid cycles of scarcity

and  excess, particularly of office buildings,  which

will affect business rentals, and hence, the costs of

doing business in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honourable Member for Punggol may be concerned

to know from col. 568 of the Economic Survey that the

fishing industry declined by 5% in 1976.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> That is not too bad. Not to worry.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Perhaps he is comforted by the 8%

increase    in    pig    production,    the     waste

notwithstanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Hon. Minister gave a number of tax

concessions.  In  particular, I welcome  the  further

relief  in  respect of estate duty. However,  I  hope

that  raising  the exemption limit  from  $50,000  to

$100,000  will not lead to a corresponding escalation

of assessed valuation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister mentioned a budget deficit of

$1,505   million,  a  32%  rise  compared  to   1976.

According to the Economic Survey, in past years,  the

Central Provident Fund provided 70% of the loans. The

amount  of CPF contributions in 1977 should be  close

to  $1,000  million. At the same time  funds  at  the

disposal of the Post Office Savings Bank rose by $408

million  in 1976 to a total of $957 million.  And  we

have  $8.2  billion  in foreign reserves  as  against

foreign debt of only $660 million. Clearly, there  is

no  lack of availability of funds. However,  I  am  a

little concerned about the distribution of public and

private investment expenditure in Singapore. In 1973,

the private share of total investment was 82.7% while

in  1976 the corresponding share was only 75%. I hope

that either the Ministry of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



Finance  or  the Monetary Authority of  Singapore  is

studying  the  flow of funds and the  utilisation  of

funds  in Singapore. While I welcome the Post  Office

Savings Bank's efforts at encouraging saving, part of

its funds represent a redirection from private banks.

To  the  extent that this is so, the private sector's

access  to  that savings for investment  purposes  is

restricted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may also note that there is no reference to

exchange  rate policy in the Economic Survey  or  the

Budget  Statement. While I am sure that the  Monetary

Authority  of  Singapore is  in  competent  hands,  I

should like to see some reference in future. Exchange

rate  policy  has a bearing on monetary,  fiscal  and

wage  policies and vice versa. For example,  in  col.

635  of  the Economic Survey, it is noted that  money

supply,  defined as MI, grew at 18%,  due  mainly  to

larger inflow of foreign funds. This, however,  could

be  due  to  a  repressed exchange rate  designed  to

preserve the competitiveness of our exports. If  this

is  so,  the  increase  in  foreign  reserves  is  no

mystery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also like to see quarterly figures

presented  in  the Economic Survey  so  that  we  can

better  analyse the trends in our economy.  Moreover,

end-of-year figures, particularly in such items  like

money supply can be quite misleading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at our prospects in 1977, although I am very

concerned   about   the   undercurrents    such    as

insufficient investment in the industrial  countries,

the year itself should be fair for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in full support of the basic economic

policies laid down by the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a

period  when  the world economy has barely  recovered

from the oil hike of a few years ago, and the effects

of  the latest OPEC increase in oil price yet  to  be

felt,  it  is most welcome to have a moderate  budget

for  the  coming  fiscal year.  I  would  call  it  a

painless  budget,  for  it provided  no  shocks.  The

emphasis, as in the past few years, has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>



been on investment projects and generally to create a

more   conducive   economic   climate   for   foreign

investments  which  will  in  turn  create  more  job

opportunities. The increase in taxes on  alcohol  and

tobacco will not, of course, be welcomed by those who

habitually  drink  and smoke, nor  by  those  in  the

tobacco  and  alcohol industries,  nor  by  those  in

allied trades because of possible falling sales. But,

Mr Speaker, Sir, who can say that alcohol and tobacco

are  basic commodities essential for life?  In  fact,

healthier living is to do without them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of the budget estimates which I

welcome  is  the  raising of the  maximum  amount  of

estate  duty for exemption purposes from  $50,000  to

$100,000.  As  we  all  know,  every  year  sees   an

increasing  number  of Singaporeans  becoming  owner-occupiers of houses or flats. In many cases, this has

only  been  made  possible through  the  Government's

public housing schemes enabling CPF contributions  to

be  utilised for the purchase of HDB and HUDC  flats.

For  these categories of Singaporeans. owning a  flat

would  otherwise  not be possible.  These  lower  and

middle income groups must realise that our Government

provide them the opportunities and the incentives  to

have  a stake in our society. This is their privilege

as Singaporeans, and as of right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thus providing for the lower and middle income

groups opportunities at home-ownership, we are surely

striving for a more egalitarian society. The  private

property  developers and entrepreneurs can no  longer

have  a  monopoly on housing. I would say the general

effect   of   the  Government  housing  schemes   has

stabilised  the prices on the property  market  -  no

longer  can  there be the quick and vast  returns  on

property  speculation  and  development.  Growth  and

development  of  housing now take  place  in  a  more

orderly   and  gradual  fashion;  the  not-so-wealthy

sections  of  Singapore society  are  thus  not  left

behind,  nor  are  they denied the  opportunities  of

house ownership. Thus, the budget estimates before us

in  raising  the amount from $50,000 to $100,000  for

exemption from estate duty is a very











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>





welcome  one.  This will ensure that those  who  have

utilised their CPF contributions for the purchase  of

HDB  and  HUDC flats will not be penalised. What  the

CPF is meant for, that is, security at retirement, is

now more usefully deployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in all budget debates at the start

of   every   fiscal  year,  especially  so   at   the

commencement  of a new term of office  -  the  Fourth

Parliament of the Republic - it is not irrelevant  for

the  Government  to take stock of  the  machinery  of

Government - i.e. the civil service and the statutory

boards. We cannot ignore the role played by the civil

servants  in  implementing  fiscal  policies  of  the

Government,   or   for   that  matter   the   general

functionings of a government. Because the same  party

continues  to  be in power. this must  not  lull  the

civil service into an attitude of complacency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last session of this House, some comments

were  made on the civil servants. The point  which  I

now  wish to make is that what the civil servants do,

and   how  they  go  about  doing  their  work,   has

constantly to be examined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil servants, in implementing Government

decisions and policies, and especially the top  civil

servants  who  also  advise Government  Ministers  on

their portfolios must, in my opinion, have as broad a

perspective  as  possible of the  matters  they  deal

with.  I  have observed that the upper ranks  of  the

civil  service  tend to be attached to  a  particular

Ministry  or  Department for many years. Without  the

constant  and  regular  rotation  of  the  top  civil

servants, I get the impression that some of them  are

so  entrenched  that they have the  full  support  of

their  Ministers,  and therefore,  they  assume  that

whatever  they  do  will always be  backed  by  their

Ministers. This is surely not very desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, pros and cons for the

frequency  of  rotation of civil servants  among  the

various Ministries and Departments. On the one  hand,

there are valid arguments for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



the need for continuity in the staffing of Ministries

and  Departments. This is to facilitate not only  the

process  of  decision-making by  the  Government  and

Ministers, but also internal administration,  and  in

serving  the  public. I recognise that in Departments

such  as the Inland Revenue, Police, Customs  or  the

Industrial  Relations Division  of  the  Ministry  of

Labour,  either  because of the nature  of  the  work

involved  or  the  continuity of  services  rendered,

there  need  not  be the same degree of  rotation  of

staff   for  the  middle-ranking  and  junior   civil

servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there is an equally valid

argument  that  the  civil  servants  in  the  higher

reaches of Government service should have as wide  an

experience  as  possible  of  administration  in  the

various  Ministries or Departments, so that they  can

have  a better understanding of the people whom  they

are  supposed  to serve. Members of  this  House  may

recall  that  several years back  when  there  was  a

difference of opinion over priorities in expenditure,

this was resolved by the Minister for Finance and the

Minister of Defence interchanging portfolios.  It  is

natural  for each Ministry to view the priorities  of

the  Republic on the basis of the needs and functions

of  the respective Ministry. My point in quoting  the

example  is  that the outcome of the  interchange  of

portfolios has turned out to be most satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very probable that in the functioning of the

various  Ministries  misunderstandings  might   arise

among senior civil servants who are attached for  too

long  to  the same Ministries, and who might  not  be

able  to appreciate the dimension of any problem from

an  overall point of view. There is thus an advantage

in regularly rotating senior civil servants among the

various Ministries and Departments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a constant re-appraisal of the functions of

the  civil  service, undesirable characteristics  may

arise.  Some top civil servants develop the mentality

of  pleasing  only their Ministers, and,  of  course,

everyone tries to please the Prime Minister. If  they

report  everything is ship-shape to their  Ministers.

then nothing is wrong with the











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



Ministries  they  are in. Should  junior  staff  have

grievances. or if their workload cannot be discharged

satisfactorily,  this  does  not  matter,  since  the

Minister  concerned  does  not  know.  This  has  the

adverse  effect of junior civil servants  doing  only

the  minimum,  and doing things only to please  their

superiors. They no longer discharge their  duties  as

responsibilities, rather as chores in order  to  keep

their  jobs. Staff morale may be low; efficiency  may

be  low.  When this bureaucratic attitude builds  up,

the  public  is adversely affected. Matters  are  not

attended  to  promptly. For example, the  problem  of

getting  an immediate and satisfactory response  from

the  civil  servants.  I am sure  some  of  the  hon.

Members  in this House have experienced, as  I  have.

the frustrations in getting civil servants to act  on

the   complaints  we  have  made  on  behalf  of  our

constituents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When complaints are sent directly to the press, they

seem  to  be  attended to much quicker by  the  civil

servants  than  those complaints  they  receive  from

Backbenchers.  This  would  seem  to  me  that  civil

servants  are  afraid  of the unfavourable  publicity

which  might  draw the attention of their  superiors,

and.  indeed  the  Ministers, to their  shortcomings.

Therefore,  they have every reason and inducement  to

act  promptly  on letters of complaint in  the  local

press. Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask: is this right,  or

is this desirable? While I agree that the local press

should serve as a forum for views and complaints, and

that   the   Ministries  and  Government  Departments

concerned are seen to do their jobs, is this all  for

show?  lam  not  suggesting that all  Ministries  and

Government  Departments are chronically  inefficient,

but  there  appears  to be this developing  trend.  I

contend,  therefore,  in  order  to  keep  the  civil

service on its toes, particularly the rank and  file,

there  should  be  regular rotation of  senior  civil

servants.  New  brooms, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  can  sweep

cleaner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second characteristic which can develop, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  if  the  top echelons  of  the  civil

service  are not regularly rotated is the possibility

of  empire  building. By this I mean  a  tendency  to

develop a power base on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



the  part  of  the  top  civil servants,  achieved  I

suppose  by  promoting only people who see eye-to-eye

with their superiors. I am not saying that this is  a

common practice, but the tendency is surely there. If

there  is more frequent and more regular rotation  of

top  civil  servants, they will not be able  to  grow

powerful roots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third feature of civil servants which I find

objectionable   is   the  secrecy   which   sometimes

surrounds  their work, and a habit of  name-dropping.

As an excuse for not disclosing the true state of the

matter,  which  might be embarrassing  to  the  civil

servants, as possibly the matter concerned  is  in  a

sorry  state for lack of attention, they  dispose  of

any queries by saying the matter is being studied  by

the  Minister  who  does not want publicity.  Matters

which  should  be attended to, therefore,  get  swept

under a carpet of secrecy. No one need know that  the

civil  service is getting more bureaucratic and  less

efficient. The top civil servants, after remaining in

their positions for long periods of time. would often

make  reference to a certain Minister,  or  even  the

Prime  Minister,  in order to deter further  queries.

Likewise, some are in the habit of quoting the  Prime

Minister, e.g. name-drop that so-and-so is  from  the

Prime Minister's Office, and he gets attended to very

promptly. Others, even the Members of Parliament  are

met  with  a  sluggish response, if at all  there  is

going to be a response.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope. therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, that in a budget

debate the effect of our fiscal measures must be seen

against the interests of the people, and here I  have

stressed  how the civil service fits in.  Any  budget

before the House must be aimed at establishing a more

just and a more humane society. However, the attitude

must  never  arise that there is a "them  and  us"  - those who are governed. and those who govern. Because

we in Parliament are collectively the servants of the

people - those in the civil service are not there  to

serve us, but the people. In this connection, I  have

asked  for  a  re-appraisal of the  civil  service  - perhaps a kind of "shake-up" is in order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.55p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to

the  average taxpayer in the wage earning, class, the

budget is a disappointment. As the economic situation

recovered,  albeit  slowly in 1976,  he  had  perhaps

wistfully hoped that there would be some form of  tax

relief in 1977. In the event he is disappointed. From

his  point  of  view,  the budget  is  not  really  a

painless  one. He is not sure whether  he  should  be

thankful  or  annoyed  with  the  Hon.  Minister  for

showing  such  persistent concern for his  health  by

raising the taxes on tobacco and liquors second  year

running; even the concession in estate duty on owner-occupied  property appears quite meaningless  to  him

for  the  time  being, as he has no  wish  of  taking

advantage  of  it  as yet. It would  have  been  more

meaningful  if  he were allowed the use  of  his  CPF

balance  which  has  by  now  totalled  thousands  of

dollars attracting only a meagre rate of interest, to

repay  part  of  the mortgage which  he  has  on  his

private accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our average taxpayer ponders on the implications

of the Hon. Minister's Budget Statement, I believe he

feels  a little sore and perhaps confused as to  what

it  all  means -all these talk about "from  each  his

best;  to each his worth". It seems to him that under

the existing tax structure if a person is unfortunate

enough  to  be a wage-earner who, for the purpose  of

the  Inland Revenue Department, may be defined  as  a

person  having  no  chance of being  able  to  either

legally  avoid or illegally evade the full  incidence

of  tax, the better he is in his job the more heavily

he is taxed as he rises in his position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the plights of our tax-paying wage-earners have

been raised time and again in this House but the Hon.

Minister  for Finance has time and again  refused  to

consider  any  change  in  a  system  which  we  have

inherited  from  our colonial past and,  to  say  the

least, is clearly unsuitable for a fast changing  and

developing society as our own. We aim to motivate our

members to give of their best and to give rewards and

recognition  to  those who excel in high  performance

but our tax



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



system does not seem to reflect this philosophy! What

we  have is a system that encourages every man to try

to  be his own boss so that he could beat the system,

so  to  speak,  and  enjoy  all  the  tax  deductions

generally available to business firms, big or  small.

The  end result: A nation of shopkeepers - if  we  do

not watch out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few days ago we heard of the Hon. Minister

for  Health  lamenting the high rate of  turnover  of

young  doctors  at Government hospitals;  instead  of

just blaming these people for their lack of sense  of

belonging  or loyalty or whatever you may  choose  to

call it, should we not try to look objectively at the

way  in  which they are remunerated and  the  way  in

which  they  are  taxed if they stay on  as  employed

persons  as against the financial prospects of  their

becoming their own bosses in private practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the personal taxation system that we have, I

submit,  needs  to  be completely  overhauled  fairly

quickly  before an increasing number of key personnel

which   include   all  categories   of   professional

managers, administrators and technicians employed  on

salaries,  in  both our private and  public  sectors,

work themselves to a point of financial disincentive.

When  that  point is reached, a person  either  feels

discontented,  in which case he starts  to  look  for

greener  pastures  or  try to set  up  some  sort  of

business or practice on his own; or, he simply allows

himself to slacken off in his job. There will be only

four  cylinders  instead of eight cylinders  working,

Sir. Or maybe two cylinders! Whichever the course  of

action or attitude he finally adopts, it does  us  no

good  as,  at this stage of our economic development,

we  need  all the experienced people in the  industry

and in Government service continuing to give of their

best.  It  is  all  very well to say  we  believe  in

"taxing the rich to subsidise the poor", or do we?  I

am not sure. Are we sure that those bearing the brunt

of  tax  incidence are really "the  rich"  and  those

benefitting  from  whatever  little  State  subsidies

left, are really "the poor"? I am not sure, Sir,  but

I would humbly suggest to the Minister for Finance to

give some thought to my queries. With all the brains











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



that  he  has  at his command in his Ministry,  I  am

sure, Sir, he would be able to come up with an answer

and  hopefully we, the wage earners, can look forward

to  a  more equitable system of taxation at the  next

Budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to turn to the Hon. Minister's

comments on Trade Development in 1977. First of  all,

I  would  like to know what he proposes to  do  about

narrowing the very substantial trade deficit of close

to  $2 billion with Japan. This is not the first time

queries  are  raised in this House on this  perennial

imbalance  of  trade and it would  seem  to  me  that

little has been done to get the Japanese to buy  more

from  us.  If  we  have not already lodged  a  strong

representation with the Japanese government  in  this

regard,  I  would  urge the Government  to  seriously

consider doing so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Trade Development generally, I agree with the

Hon.   Minister  that  our  tactics  should   be   to

consolidate markets that we already have and  at  the

same  time  explore new ones. The idea of setting  up

permanent  exhibition centres in  selected  countries

abroad is a good one, but before doing so I feel that

we  should  perhaps  look  at  our  export  promotion

efforts ir. a rather more systematic manner and  with

the same degree of special care and attention that we

have  devoted  to  the  task of investment  promotion

abroad.  Up  to  this  point  of  time,  our   export

promotion  efforts seem to be conducted  haphazardly,

rather disorganised if I may say so, and without much

co-ordination.  We  hear  of  trade   missions   from

different organisations going off every now and then,

but  what  follow-up actions are taken and with  what

results  -do  like to know. I think we could  achieve

more   if   there   is   proper   overall   planning,

organisation  and  co-ordination  among  the  various

trade  and manufacturers' associations. Surely,  Sir,

the  creation  of an export promotion agency  is  the

answer.  With the Government providing the  necessary

organisation and the lead. I have no doubt  that  our

businessmen  will  be only too happy  to  give  their

wholehearted  support and cooperation.  There  is  no

short-cut in trade development. In order to  do  well

in our export drive, we need to know more about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



overseas  markets; to know more. we  need  to  travel

more and ultimately we will sell more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an insurance man, I find it difficult not to

say  a few words on the concessionary tax rate of 10%

announced by the Minister on reinsurance business. To

the   lay  public,  this  gesture  on  the  part   of

Government may not mean very much but, speaking as  a

professional. I cannot help feeling excited over  the

likely prospect of Singapore developing rapidly  into

a  significant international reinsurance centre  over

the next few years. The concessionary tax rate of 10%

added  to  our locational advantage and good business

infrastructure,   such   as   a   highly    efficient

telecommunication  system among  other  things,  will

greatly  assist in the development of  this  type  of

international  business. It is a  little  known  fact

that  one  of the larger items of Britain's invisible

earnings  is  from  insurance  and  reinsurance.  For

example, in the year 1974 the City of London  derived

41%  of  its  invisible earnings from  insurance  and

reinsurance,  whereas  the  rather  more  prestigious

business of banking contributed only 20% of  a  total

sum of 905 million pound.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swiss and the Germans have also over the years

developed  extensive  interests  in  the  reinsurance

business.  Given  the  necessary  encouragement  from

Government and the determination on the part  of  the

private sector to succeed, there can be little  doubt

that  the  tax incentive will go down as an important

milestone in the history of the insurance industry in

Singapore. The gesture on the part of the Government,

I   hope.  is  also  an  indication  of  the  greater

recognition  of the potentials of insurance  business

by the Government which hitherto has paid very little

attention  to the development of insurance  industry.

This is evidenced by the fact that for some time now,

the  Insurance Commissioner's office has been without

a  full-time  Commissioner; the present  Commissioner

being concurrently a Deputy Secretary attached to the

Ministry of Finance, and insurance is but one of his

many    responsibiIities.   Since   the    Minister's

announcement of the tax concession I have read in the

press that with effect from 1st











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>





April  the Insurance Commissioner's office will  come

under  the  control  of  the  Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore, and I do sincerely hope that this will  be

a change for the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, the efficacy of the tax

incentive will be determined by two things:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Willingness on the part of the industry to

invest   on   personnel  development  and   training.

Reinsurance   business  by   its   very   nature   is

international in scope. We need, therefore, to  train

up  a new breed of insurance men who will be not only

technically   competent   but   also    possess    an

international outlook.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Greater appreciation of the technical and

practical  aspects of the insurance business  by  the

regulatory   authorities.   It   is   accepted   that

legislative  control  on such  type  of  business  is

necessary   and   desirable.  Over-regulation   will,

however, on the other hand stifle the growth  of  the

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaningful dialogue has hitherto existed between the

industry and the Insurance Commissioner's office, and

I  feel  sure that notwithstanding the organisational

change    there   will   continue   to   be   regular

opportunities for views to be exchanged  between  the

Insurance Commissioner and the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding his Statement to the House, the Hon.

Minister  forecasts that the weather is getting  fine

and fair and that our Ship of State is in good shape.

Sir,  as  I see it, given the same competent command.

our  Ship of State should be able to face up  to  any

weather condition, foul or fair.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the

Motion standing in the name of the Hon. Minister  for

Finance.  The  Minister  has  described  the  1976

economic performance as "not unsatisfactory." With  a

7%  real growth in GDP, a 2% inflation rate (in terms

of GDP deflator) and a 8.1% increase in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



domestic fixed capital formation, the performance  is

a  fairly  good  one, particularly  in  view  of  the

sluggish  economic recovery of the advanced countries

which  our  economy is heavily dependent on,  in  the

second   half  of  the  year.  Regarding  our  growth

prospect  for  1977, the Minister is  more  cautious,

taking  note that the OECD countries are expected  to

grow at a slower rate than in 1976.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of economic uncertainties, the painless

budget as proposed by the Minister is a sensible one.

Only  minor  tax  increases  on  liquor  and  tobacco

products are proposed; at the same time, the increase

in the Government recurrent expenditure is kept to  a

minimum. thus allowing more revenue resources  to  be

transferred  for  development  purposes.   Hopefully.

between  now  and  the  next  Budget  statement,  the

Minister  will not give us any surprises and  shocks.

The  recovery  of our economy is still  too  new  and

fragile to absorb any shock of major tax increases. I

note  that  the  Minister, in  his  Addendum  to  the

Presidential  Address,  has reserved  the  option  of

changing taxes as "one way of helping to encourage or

discourage  one kind of activity over another."  This

is fair enough. as using tax changes as an instrument

for  reallocating resources among economic activities

is  an integral part of fiscal policy. However, it is

hoped  that  the important suggestions  made  by  the

Fiscal  Policy  Implementation Committee  are  to  be

debated  in  this House before they are  implemented.

This  will  be in accordance with the spirit  of  the

President's  statement  that  "No  major  policy   or

legislation  should  be passed  without  the  closest

scrutiny,  and  passed only after the  most  thorough

debate."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget statement, the Minister has also

stressed   the  importance  of  diversification   and

flexibility   in  our  development  strategies.   and

reiterated    the   five-point   Economic    Strategy

Programme.  Diversification means finding alternative

markets,  engaging in different economic  activities,

and  purchasing  from different sources  of  supplies

simultaneously. With diversification, our economy  is

less vulnerable to a sudden slack of a given activity

or in a given market. In general. we











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



have  been  successful in diversifying  our  economic

activities. On the other hand. our economy  is  still

heavily  dependent  on the USA,  Japan  and  the  EEC

countries.  Economic realities dictate that  for  our

future economic growth, we have to continue to depend

on  these  advanced  countries for  markets  for  our

exports,  sources of capital inflow, and supplies  of

machinery and equipment and technology.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geo-political considerations, particularly after the

Communist  victory in Indo-China.  have  brought  the

ASEAN countries closer together than before. This  is

evident from the five ASEAN industrial projects,  our

bilateral  tariff  accords with the  Philippines  and

Thailand,   and   the  recent  Agreement   on   ASEAN

Preferential Trading Arrangements. These are  welcome

steps  towards greater regional economic cooperation.

Let us, however, also be realistic. Given the present

disparities  in  the  level of development.  economic

structure,  trade pattern and pace  and  strategy  of

industrialization,   intra-ASEAN   trade   would   be

comparatively  less important than ASEAN  trade  with

the  USA, Japan and the EEC countries. and the  scope

for  industrial cooperation among the ASEAN countries

would  remain  limited for a long time  to  come.  At

present, the better strategy .for the ASEAN countries

would be to form a united front in dealing with these

three advanced economic blocs in matters relating  to

tariff  and non-tariff barriers. In this context,  it

is  of  particular importance for the ASEAN countries

to  pressurise  Japan which has  been  enjoying  huge

surpluses in trade with ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, flexible economic policies mean that we should

do  away with any rigid form of economic planning. In

fact,  the Government has not published any five-year

economic  plan  since independence. Instead,  ad  hoc

policies  have been implemented to soften the  impact

of economic crisis originating from external sources,

and  to  seize new economic opportunities which  have

appeared   on  the  horizon.  Given  the   need   for

flexibility and the emphasis on efficiency, it is not

surprising  that statutory boards have been  used  to

implement or even to spearhead various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>

economic  and  social  development  programmes.   The

attractiveness of this form of organisation  is  that

it  enjoys  greater  flexibility and  is  given  more

initiative  to  carry  out  its  specific   functions

without  the loss of ultimate responsibility  to  the

appropriate  Cabinet  Minister.  However,  as   board

members  and top management staff have been appointed

by  the  Minister concerned, the activities of  these

boards    are   one   step   removed   from    direct

accountability to the Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem area pertains to the appointment of

directors. Top civil servants are normally  appointed

to  board membership and some of them often  take  on

several directorships simultaneously. On the positive

side,  interlocking directorship helps to keep  these

boards in line with major Government policies; on the

negative,  it can be a source of strain and  pressure

to  the  civil  service. With their time  and  energy

divided  between several jobs, these  civil  servants

cannot devote their best efforts and talents to  each

job  and  at the same time thoroughly understand  the

problems  at hand. Also, because of their  positions,

the  opinions  of  these top civil servants  normally

carry  susbtantial weight in the boards. A  few  over

zealous  and  powerful civil servants  may  therefore

reduce managerial initiative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a national plan which maps out the

relationship  between  various statutory  boards  and

their relationship with the governmental departments,

coordination between these organizations seem  to  be

lacking, thus giving rise to duplication of effort in

some cases and unnecessary delay in others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the role of statutory boards in our national

development is likely to become n-ore important.  the

abovementioned  problems and some  other  problems  I

have  not yet mentioned have to be rectified so  that

their   usefulness  and  efficiency  would   not   be

affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the five-point

Economic  Strategy Programme. The programme has  been

expounded  by the Minister for Finance. The programme

is











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>





realistic, as it reflects the nature of the Singapore

economy  as well as her role as an urban centre.  The

programme  would also help us to attain the long-term

objective  of  transforming  our  economy   into   an

industrial  centre  and  a  base  for  regional   and

international services. However, I would like to make

a  few  comments. First, on the manpower  development

programme. the Hon. Minister has only made  reference

to  graduates  of  technical institutions,  I  wonder

whether  the output of university graduates has  been

included   in  the  manpower  development  programme.

Recently, a local newspaper has flashed the  headline

about  the  employment prospects for some  university

graduates.  Sir,  it  would  be  a  waste  of   human

resources   if  we  continue  to  produce  unemployed

graduates. I wonder whether the Ministries of Finance

and Education have arrived at some coordinated policy

on  the  intake of university students  into  various

faculties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, although training and education would

increase the working capacity of an employee, whether

he  will  give  his  best depends  on  his  attitudes

towards  work.  The Minister has mentioned  that  "to

instill   correct  work  attitudes  in  our  workers,

employers must provide a proper working environment."

Sir,  I  think this is grossly inadequate.  The  much

more   important  motivational  forces  are  rewards.

Rewards could be classified into two types: intrinsic

rewards  such as a sense of accomplishment, pride  in

one's  products  and job satisfaction  and  extrinsic

rewards,  such as wage increases, bonuses. promotions

etc.  Sir,  I  submit  that in a market  economy  and

materialistic   society  like  Singapore,   intrinsic

rewards have become impotent as a motivational force,

particularly in areas where the production process is

characterized by capital-intensity, a fine degree  of

specialisation, and mass production. Thus,  the  most

pragmatic   and   effective  approach   to   motivate

employees  (not just workers), to give of their  best

and to raise productivity is to assure them that they

can   derive   monetary  gains  from  such   efforts.

Employers must draw up appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



incentive  schemes, not just provide  better  working

environment if workers are to be motivated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to this matter, the Minister has

correctly pointed out that while workers must put  in

their best, employers have an equal responsibility to

improve their management of personnel or of plant and

equipment to increase productivity. May I add that it

is  also  the responsibility of' employers  to  train

workers   and  to  upgrade  their  skills.  This   is

particularly true in the case where the employers are

the  multi-national corporations. Our Government  has

given  various concessions and incentives to  attract

these corporations; it is only fair that they should,

in   return,   train  our  workers,  transfer   their

technology and management techniques, thus helping us

to increase our economic productive capacity.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has presented

a   very  moderate  and  sound  budget  for  the  new

financial  year on the 28th of last month.  It  is  a

well  balanced  budget. The people of  Singapore  are

happy to hear that there are four tax concessions and

no  increase in revenue through increased taxation on

necessities.  Only  the duties on liquor,  cigarettes

and tobacco are increased with immediate effect. Such

taxes  do  not  concern the people's daily  life.  As

cigarettes,  tobacco  and liquor  are  considered  as

luxury  items  and  harmful  to  health,  I  am  sure

Singaporeans  are happy to accept the right  decision

of  the  Government in imposing more taxes  on  these

three commodities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the new Budget

announced   by   the  Minister  for  Finance,   total

expenditure for the new financial year will be $5,459

million  as  against  the main  revenue  estimate  of

$3,362  million.  After  almost  self-cancelling  tax

increases   and   tax  concessions,   the   projected

budgetary deficit is about 8% up, at $1,505  million.

According  to  my  own analysis, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I

think  this deficit in our Budget does not mean  that

our  economy  is  in trouble. As I can  see  it,  the

estimated











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



revenue of $3,362 million is more than enough to meet

the  recurrent expenditure, and secondly the  deficit

has  arisen mainly from the appropriation  of  $2,708

million  as development expenditure to stimulate  the

economy and accelerate economic recovery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Mr Speaker, Sir, to meet the deficit,

the  Minister  for Finance has proposed some  drawing

down from the Development Fund of Surpluses that have

been  accumulated over the years or borrowing by  the

Government.  In  view of the Republic's  high  credit

standing  in international markets, there should  not

be any problem with the raising of loans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget is ably presented by the

Minister for Finance. Therefore, it is very difficult

for  a  non-economist like me to make comment on  the

Budget.  I have read the Budget Statement many  times

over  the  last  few  days. I  really  find  it  very

difficult to criticise the Budget Statement except to

bring  out  a  few  points for the attention  of  our

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has

mentioned  that  our manpower development  programmes

must   now  emphasise  training  in  more  and   more

specialised skills. I think our Government has  taken

a  right step in this direction. As we know, manpower

is the most valuable resource we have. Therefore, the

best possible training and education must be provided

to   our   young  population  if  they  are   to   be

sufficiently  equipped  to serve  the  needs  of  our

nation and industry. Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know,

today,  Singapore still has to rely a great  deal  on

imported  foreign  expertise  in  both  commerce  and

industry.   With   our  present  rate   of   manpower

development  programmes, I hope our  Government  will

inform  the House when Singapore will be able  to  be

self-sufficient   in  her  needs  for   professional,

management,   technological  and  other   specialised

skills.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir. in the rapid process of

urbanisation and industrialisation in Singapore,  our

life  styles  have changed, but I wonder  whether  we

have  changed for the better or for worse. Sir, there

is one thing I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



am quite sure. Progress will bring along with it more

wealth.  In  some  Western  countries  today,   over-affluence  has caused youths to lose their  diligence

and willingness to work. They fall out of society and

take to escapist life styles, seeking refuge in drug-taking  or  form their own sub-cultures. Fortunately,

Sir,  Singapore is not entirely immune to such social

diseases, but with greater preventives, we  can  save

our  children  from degenerating cults alien  to  our

country,   like   hippism  and  drug-addiction.   The

responsibility  of  protecting our future  generation

falls on us, both Government and parents. It will  be

a  demanding task which we have to carry it out well.

How  shall  we educate our children in the future  on

their  responsibility to themselves and  to  society?

This  problem must be faced now and it is  one  which

calls  for long term planning. Our education must  be

bilingual,  including moral and civic training.  This

is  a  primary need if we are to build a  strong  and

rich nation, with both heart and soul.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our future is full of uncertainties

and difficulties. Our future is a challenging one. In

the  next few years we have to face the challenge  to

govern and the challenge to hold the nation together.

We must not fail. Otherwise whatever we have achieved

over the past years under the able leadership of  the

People's Action Party Government will be lost through

chaos  created by ourselves. Mr Speaker, Sir, in  any

chaotic situation, life cannot remain comfortable, no

matter  how advanced we may be or how much we possess

materially.   Normal  life  will  be  uprooted;   for

instance,  general strikes and riots in the  Lim  Yew

Hock  Government.  We must learn  from  such  painful

experiences  if  we  are not  to  be  pushed  to  the

threshold of national disaster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I conclude my speech, may I

seek  an assurance from the Hon. Minister for Finance

that our Financial Policy is not only to continue  to

pursue our long term economic strategy programme  for

our  economy's transformation to an industrial centre

and  a  base for regional and international  services

but to see that our per capita income distribution is

always towards











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>





equity.  As we know. Sir, for the past few years  our

per  capita income distribution is not ideal  as  the

trend is not always towards equity. There is still  a

wide  gap  between the rich and poor.  Therefore,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I hope the Hon. Minister  for  Finance

will  look  into  this serious and  important  matter

urgently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, all in all, Singapore is in a

very  sound financial position. This is a budget that

is  welcomed  by  all the people of Singapore  and  I

hereby wish to join my other colleagues in support of

the Financial Policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to join my colleagues  in

paying tribute to the Finance Minister for giving  us

such  a clear picture of our economic performance  in

1976  in  his  Budget statement. In  1976  we  saw  a

gradual  recovery of the world economy. However,  the

economic  situation was still gloomy because  of  the

uncertainty  of  oil prices and the fear  of  another

round    of    galloping   inflation.   Under    such

circumstances, industrialised countries were not  too

hopeful  for  a  good  economic  performance.  We  in

Singapore also faced the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



same  problems  and yet we managed  to  have  a  real

economic  growth  rate of 7%, a  satisfactory  growth

rate considering the overall economic conditions  at.

home  and abroad. This, I should say, is due  largely

to  our  efficient  Government  in  implementing  our

policy  of  diversified  economic  activities,  which

helps   cushion   the   impact  of   world   economic

fluctuations on our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our nation is a small nation, dependent on foreign

countries  for  our requirements.  We  are  therefore

vulnerable  to unfavourable economic developments  in

other  countries. In other words, most of the factors

that  affect  our  economic  growth  are  beyond  our

control.  But our Government does not use this  as  a

scapegoat  for not being able to manage our resources

well. On the contrary, the Government tried its best,

manipulating the factors which were under its control

so as to counter the unfavourable economic effects of

the  factors which were beyond its control. The  fact

that  we managed 7% real economic growth rate whereas

industrialised  countries  in  the  Organisation  for

Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD)  managed

only  5%  real  economic  growth  rate  reflects  the

success of our Government's efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic prospects for 1977 are not very bright.

This  is  due  to the slowing down of world  economic

recovery.  Industrialised  countries,  fearing   that

another  round of inflation will set in, are cautious

in  their economic development. Another restraint  to

economic  stimulation is the uncertainty of  the  oil

price  caused  by the split of the OPEC nations  over

the  increase  of  oil price which  resulted  in  the

recent two-tier oil price. Therefore, as a whole, our

economic   prospects  for  1977  do  not   seem   too

promising.  However, the Government has  a  plan  for

action.  In  the  efforts to further  strengthen  our

economy,  the  Minister for Finance said  that  steps

would  be  taken to strengthen our trade,  investment

and  diplomatic offices in key centres  to  safeguard

our  economic interests. Greater efforts will be made

to  attract  more investment from the United  States,

Japan,  West  Europe and West Asia  and  to  maintain

steady progress in our











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



economy. With a firm economic base and the steps that

will  be taken, the prospects of achieving an  annual

growth  rate of 6 to 8% are not gloomy.  It  is  also

hoped  that  the domestic policies drawn  up  by  the

Government will counteract some of the more  negative

effects  of  the  world  economic  slowdown  of   our

economic performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the aim of the Government to contain wage

inflation  in our country. Therefore, the  Government

has drawn up policies of orderly wage increases. Wage

increases  are based on the productivity of  workers.

It is largely due to the success of our wage policies

that   we   are   able  to  remain   competitive   in

international  trade.  These policies  are  essential

because   of   the   present  world  situation.   The

industrialised countries were badly affected  in  the

severe slump a few years ago and the slow recovery of

the  world  economy that follows. As  a  result,  the

industrialised  countries  are  faced   with   severe

unemployment  and spare manufacturing capacities.  In

order  to  solve their problems, these countries  may

reduce  the  prices  of their manufactured  goods  to

stimulate  their  economies.  Thus  we  have  to   be

prepared   for  such  action  by  the  industrialised

countries.  To  remain competitive  in  international

trade, we have to keep the prices of our manufactured

goods low. Thus the need to control wage increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, increases in wages are based on the

recommendations of the National Wages Council  (NWC).

This method of granting wage increases has favourable

effects  on  our economy - it prevents  workers  from

demanding   excessive  increases  in   their   wages.

However,  it  is not without criticism.  There  is  a

danger  that  employers  may take  advantage  of  the

Government's  restraint  on  wage  increases  by  not

granting  wage increases to workers even  though  the

productivity  of the workers has gone  up.  Instances

when  employers pay large amounts of bonus  to  their

top  executives and yet refuse to grant pay increases

recommended  by the NWC to the workers have  come  to

light  from  time  to  time. Perhaps  the  Government

should give some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



attention  to the problem before undesirable  effects

set in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC's recommendations for wage increases are

based   on  the  productivity  of  workers.  However,

measuring the productivity of workers is by no  means

easy.  The only guide to the productivity of  workers

is  the profit of the employer. Therefore, it may  be

better  to make it compulsory for employers to  grant

salary  increases  recommended by the  NWC.  The  NWC

should  recommend a range of percentage increases  in

salary.  To make the increases in salary commensurate

with  the  increases  in productivity,  increases  in

salary  should  be  based  on  the  profits  of   the

employers. Thus employers must grant salary increases

within  the  range recommended by the  NWC.  One  may

argue that those employers who are just breaking even

or  are  making a loss will be forced to go bankrupt.

If  we  look at it from the economic point  of  view,

this may be favourable. Our resources are scarce  and

therefore we must make full use of them. If employers

are  not able to make optimum use of their resources,

it is better that they go out of business so that the

resources   can   be   redeployed  more   efficiently

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now touch on the question of tax

increases  and concessions. On the whole, the  budget

can  be described as a relatively painless one,  with

increases in tax only for cigarettes and intoxicating

liquors.  Generally,  it is very  moderate  and  well

received   as  it  does  not  directly   affect   the

livelihood  of  the  majority  of  the  people.  Such

increases  will undoubtedly be passed on to consumers

by  the  dealers, and the smokers and  drinkers  will

certainly  have  to pay a higher price.  The  aim  of

increasing  the tax on cigarettes. according  to  the

Finance Minister, is to discourage smoking and not on

revenue consideration since the yield in revenue will

be  offset  by tax concessions. However, I doubt  the

increase  in the price of cigarettes can be effective

in  discouraging  smoking. Notwithstanding  the  fact

that the Government has been making efforts to advise

and  urge  people against smoking and the mass  media

have   long   ceased   carrying   advertisements   on

cigarettes and tobacco.











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>





the number of smokers has not decreased but tends  to

increase instead. Increase in the price of cigarettes

has  a very marginal effect on its demand because the

demand  for  cigarettes  is  highly  price-inelastic.

Therefore,  the people will continue to pay  for  the

higher  prices  and will instead economise  on  other

expenses.  For  example,  if  they  save   in   their

marketing  by  cutting down on more nutritious  food,

their  health  may be affected in  the  long  run.  I

believe a more effective way to discourage smoking is

to  educate the people on the grave health hazards of

smoking, and this can be done through the mass  media

and in the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning now to tax concessions, I would say

that the general public is pleased to learn that  the

Government  is very generous in granting certain  tax

concessions  at a time when more revenue is  required

to  cover  the  high expenditure. However,  a  closer

examination of the tax concessions shows that only  a

very  small fraction of the people stand to  benefit,

and  the  majority of them are from the upper middle-income group. In particular, the concession on estate

duty  will not benefit the lower-income group at all.

Only  people in the upper middle-income group  and  a

minority  in  the lower middle-income group  who  own

houses valued at more than $100,000 will benefit. For

these  people, paying $8,837.50 in estate duty for  a

$200,000 house is not a problem at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in taxation seem to affect the `have

not'  and not the `have'. Both the rich and the  poor

consume  cigarettes and intoxicating  liquors.  Thus,

the  increase  in taxes for these items  will  affect

both  groups  of people equally. On the  other  hand,

those who will gain from the tax concessions are  the

rich.  For  the rich, the increase in the tax  burden

due  to increases in taxes for cigarettes and liquors

is  offset  by the gain in tax concessions.  However,

for  the poor there is nothing to offset their  extra

tax  burden.  Thus the gap between the rich  and  the

poor will widen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may have noble objectives in giving

the four tax concessions. For example, the concession

in  estate  duty  is  introduced  to  encourage  home

ownership,  the  tax  concession on  offshore  income

derived from Asian Dollar Market operations is  given

to  further develop Singapore as a financial  centre,

and  the  tax  concession on income from  reinsurance

business  is to take advantage of our ideal  location

and  good  business infrastructure so as  to  develop

Singapore  into  an important centre for  reinsurance

business. Such objectives are good for the country as

a  whole  and  I  am  not against  them.  What  I  am

concerned  is  that the Government,  being  too  pre-occupied  with  these  objectives,  may  neglect  the

welfare of the lower income group and the poor.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance concluded

his Budget Statement with the remark, "The weather is

getting  fine and fair and our Ship of  State  is  in

good  shape." I cannot agree more with him about  the

condition  of  our Ship of State  but  I  am  not  as

optimistic as he is with regard to the weather ahead.

In  fact,  the  Minister did hint of  impending  dark

clouds  in  the  horizon which could  jeopardize  his

forecast, although he did not elaborate on them.  But

I  think it is necessary to mention the problems  and

not just the prospects; and to point out the possible

danger  spots  in the year ahead so that Singaporeans

would not be caught unaware if a situation turns  for

the worse and a crisis develops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has indicated that the

Republic  is  likely to achieve a growth  in  GNP  of

between  6  and  8%.  In  his calculation,  I  wonder

whether   certain  factors  have  been   taken   into

consideration.  Our  economic  growth  is  tied  very

closely  to  the  performance of the OECD  countries.

Hence, it is in our interest to take note of a recent

report in The Economist which states that, "there are

reasons  to  suspect  that prospects  for  the  world

economy  are  not  as mildly rosy  as  the  consensus

predicts."  The  OECD countries are  only  likely  to

achieve growth











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



rates  of  between 0 and 7%: Japan 7%,  U.S.  4 1/2 - 5 1/2%,

Germany  2 1/4 - 5 1/2%, France 4%, Britain 1 1/2% and  Italy 0%.  And even these expected performances have to  be

measured  against  the  effects  of  certain  events,

including  growing  unemployment in  Western  Europe,

continuing  high inflation, economic  strain  between

the   EEC   and   Japan.  slowdown  in  the   oversea

investments and the most severe winter in the history

of the U.S. Further, there is the prospect of another

increase in the oil price. According to the President

of  OPEC. the two-tier price system may not hold  but

any  compromise solution would be "somewhere  in  the

middle"  between the 10 plus 5% decreed by eleven  of

the OPEC members and the one time 5% raise imposed by

Saudi  Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates.  Another

complicating factor is the Arab-Israeli conflict  and

the  commitment  of  the OPEC  countries  to  provide

assistance  to  the  Arab  confrontation  states.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have mentioned these matters  merely

to  reiterate the need for caution in our expectation

of  high  economic  growth. Our  economic  future  is

determined  not  only  by  the  Government  financial

policy but also by the political, social and economic

developments in the world at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister mentioned in his Budget Statement the

"modest beginnings in ASEAN economic cooperation" and

he  gave  the  examples of the five ASEAN  industrial

projects and the Preferential Trading Arrangement.  I

am not quite certain what the stage of implementation

of  each of these projects is; nevertheless. I am  in

full support of all these efforts. However, there  is

one  area of ASEAN activity which the Minister failed

to  mention, namely, ASEAN's economic relations  with

other countries, in particular the industrial states,

namely, the U.S., Japan and the EEC. According  to  a

recent  study, the ASEAN countries in  1974  took  up

only  2.9%  of  the world trade: the ASEAN  countries

exported  83% of the world's natural rubber,  80%  of

its  palm  oil. 68% of its' tin and 67% of its  copra

and  coconut products. In that year, 61 .9% of  their

total  exports and 57.5% of their total imports  were

with the industrial countries. Thus, it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



would  seem  to  me  that  there  is  scope  for  the

expansion  of trade between ASEAN and the world,  and

that  there is need to consolidate and expand ASEAN's

trade with the industrial states.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I welcome the ASEAN initiatives

to  hold  separate discussions between  the  regional

organisation  and the United States,  Japan  and  the

EEC.  The  reality of economic life of ASEAN  is  the

fact   of   interdependence  between  them  and   the

industrial  states. ASEAN depends on  the  industrial

countries  for capital. technology and equipment  and

the  industrial countries depend on ASEAN for primary

commodities   and   certain  manufactured   products.

Besides   consolidating  trade  with  the  industrial

countries,  ASEAN  should explore  other  markets  in

other  parts of the world, including West Asia, Latin

America  and  South and East Asia. On this  point,  I

would  like to support the Minister's appeal  to  the

manufacturers, traders, businessmen and if I may add,

bankers,  to  devote  more  efforts  to  develop  new

markets  for Singapore's products. Within the region,

the recent initiative of the Government in concluding

preferential tariff arrangements with the Philippines

and  Thailand  should  provide the  impetus  for  the

expansion  of  intra-ASEAN trade.  According  to  the

study  mentioned  above,  the overall  intra-regional

trade in 1974 amounted to only 13% of the ASEAN total

trade.   I   am  certain  that  with  the   Singapore

initiative  and  the  move towards  liberalising  the

present  intra-ASEAN trade arrangements.  Intra-ASEAN

trade  would improve, and this would benefit all  the

members  of  ASEAN. This would be in  line  with  the

ASEAN  strategy  to develop collective  and  national

resilience  to  meet  the  problems  confronting  the

states in ASEAN.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noticed that the Defence

Ministry has the highest allocation for the financial

year  1977-78, and this may lead critics to  question

the need for such expenditure for defence I think the

need for a viable defence system for the Republic  is

imperative   in  view  of  the  uncertain   political

developments  in the region, and the Government  must

shoulder the responsibility



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>





to maintain a level of defence sufficient to meet any

eventuality.  And  as  far  as  the  expenditure   is

concerned, it is high in terms of per capita GNP, but

it  should  be  pointed out that,  in  terms  of  the

absolute   amount  and  the  size  of  the   military

manpower,  the Republic spends the least for  defence

and  has  the  smallest military force in  comparison

with  other countries including all the ASEAN states,

This  is  evident  if we examine  the  Tables#  below

showing  the  comparison of defence expenditures  and

military  manpower of the ASEAN states for the  years

1972  to 1976. In view of this fact, there should  be

no   hesitation  on  anyone's  part  to  support  the

expenditure for the Ministry of Defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the small tax

increases  on  tobacco. cigarettes  and  intoxicating

liquors  will  achieve the objective of  discouraging

the  habitual  smokers and drinkers  from  continuing

these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



undesirable  practices.  To derive  more  revenue,  I

suggest the Minister should look into the possibility

of   imposing  new  or  increased  taxes  on  certain

entertainment    establishments,    especially    the

nightclubs.  Such  an imposition will  not  only  tax

those   who  can  pay,  namely,  the  rich  tourists,

businessmen  and executives on expense  accounts  but

hopefully,  it  will  also  deter  Singaporeans  from

frequenting such places.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to join my colleagues in

the  House in supporting the Motion standing  in  the

name of the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>5.26 p.m.





<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the 1973 oil embargo and

the  quadrupling of oil prices brought about in  1974

and  in  1975  world  economic recession,  production

decline and trade stagnation. There was a widespread



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



decline  in the economic growth of advanced countries

in  the  world,  in some cases there  was  even  zero

growth.  Although there were signs of  recovery  from

the  world economic recession. in the first  half  of

1976  there  was  fear amongst the  major  industrial

countries  that too rapid a recovery might spark  off

another spate of inflation resulting in their  taking

preventive  measures. Consequently, there was  slower

economic  growth in the second half of 1976.  Against

this  background it is encouraging to note  that  the

Minister  for  Finance  has reported  a  7%  economic

growth  in 1976 in his Budget Statement announced  on

the 28th of last month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the war the sophisticated but

high profit new industries like the oil industry, the

petro-chemical  industry and the electronic  industry

in  the advanced countries have been fully developed.

As  a  result  of rising costs of raw  materials  and

energy  coupled  with the growth in  population,  the

costs  of production have mounted and because of  the

growth  in  population consumption has been  greater.

With  this  trend there is going to be a shortage  of

raw  materials  if  there is  no  recycling  of  used

materials.  So  it will be quite impossible  for  the

advanced  countries to reach a double digit  economic

growth  in the years to come. It will also  be  quite

difficult  for  Singapore to  achieve  fast  economic

growth as in the early 70s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past decade there have

been  industrialisation efforts in Singapore. But  in

the earlier stages of industrialisation the programme

was carried out on a smaller scale and the production

was  meant  only  for consumption  in  Singapore  and

Malaysia.  It  had also been based  mainly  on  light

industries,   such   as  food  processing   and   the

production  of  consumer goods. It  is  only  in  the

recent  four or five years that our industrialisation

has entered a new phase, both in terms of capital and

technology.  We  have since made  great  improvements

quantitatively  and qualitatively  and  our  products

have been exported to Southeast Asian countries.  EEC

countries and other parts of the world. But,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>



unfortunately,  the greater part of the  capital  and

factories  in Singapore are in the hands  of  foreign

entrepreneurs. Local entrepreneurs take only  a  very

minor  place in our industries, although the Economic

Development  Board has an office on the promotion  of

joint  ventures.  where it collects  and  distributes

information  and  data  and  renders  assistance   to

prospective investors in joint ventures in  order  to

promote  our  economic growth. But how many  projects

have materialised and are running smoothly under this

scheme?  I  do not know. Local entrepreneurs  do  not

seem  to play a great part under the scheme.  So  our

main  task in the long-term interest of Singapore  is

to  try and encourage more local capital to take  the

place  of  foreign  capital in the  major  industrial

sectors of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no country in the world can remain isolated in

its  economic development by depending solely on  its

resources, natural or manpowerwise. It will also have

to   depend   on   external  sources.  For   example.

industrial powers like Japan and West Germany have in

the  short space of 20-30 years after the War  relied

gainfully  on  the  supply  of  foreign  capital  and

technological knowhow, coupled with the hard work and

the  assiduous  learning of their peoples  to  become

advanced  industrial countries  in  the  world.  Sir,

capital is an important factor in generating economic

development.  Therefore, for our  continued  economic

development,  we must create a favourable  investment

climate for our industries, just as the Minister  has

suggested in his Budget statement a third item of tax

concession to strengthen our position as a  financial

centre  to  attract  more capital  to  stimulate  our

economic  development. Sir, we must also  change  the

traditional   investment   habit   of    our    local

entrepreneurs. We have to inject more  confidence  in

our  local  people for investments in our  industries

and  provide  the  necessary  service  and  safeguard

relating thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more than three years of very serious economic

recession,  even  developed  countries  as  well   as

developing  countries in the world are taking  proper

steps to stimulate their domestic economy and to  cut

down unemployment. So they step up their efforts











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



in  export  in  order  to increase  foreign  exchange

earning. Therefore, competition has been very keen in

the   world   markets.   In   order   to   keep   the

competitiveness of our economy in the world  markets,

we  should improve the quality of our products, raise

our  labour  productivity and cut down on  production

costs.  In  this  way, we will  be  able  to  produce

cheaply  and compete effectively in the world market.

In  addition, we must also launch an offensive to get

into  hitherto neglected markets. including  the  oil

producing countries. There is, therefore, the need to

step  up  a  national export bureau  to  provide  co-ordination  in  our  export activities  and  to  take

charge of all services related thereto such as tariff

exemption. export capital transference, export credit

insurance,      information     collection,      data

dissemination, market research. etc. There should  be

more  incentives  and facilities to be  provided  for

export  promotion. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  should  have

this  national  export bureau to  provide  our  local

industrialists  and traders services and  information

and  data  to  enable them to better  understand  the

potential  world markets so that they will be  better

equipped in their efforts to promote exports. This is

a matter for immediate attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because we have international trade we are

vulnerable  to  changes  in the  world  economy,  and

therefore our industrialists and management  must  be

able  to  make  a  quick  and immediate  response  to

changes  in the world economy. There should  be  more

flexibility in our economy so that we will be able to

weather  through difficult situations that may  arise

in  the  horizon. We should have this  kind  of  able

management personnel who would be able to handle  our

future   commercial   and  industrial   affairs   and

successfully develop further our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the greater economic cooperation

among  the  ASEAN  countries,  there  has  been  more

commercial and industrial development in this region.

Consequently,  there  is  a  greater  need  for  more

capital, industrial aid, managerial and technological

knowhow. consultancy service,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



economic  research  and  other  services.  This  will

further  develop  our financial  and  other  services

enhancing   our  financial  position.  As   technical

training and communication services will develop into

new  dimensions in this world, we should be  able  to

make the best use of our existing infrastructure  and

other facilities in Singapore to assist in the mutual

economic development of Southeast Asia. We can become

a  kind  of financial and service centre or a  factor

for   the  development  of  economic  prosperity  and

political stability in this region. In this  way,  we

will  not  only  be  able to  bring  more  wealth  to

Singapore  but  also  provide  better  life  for  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the total expenditure of the new financial year

comes  to  $5,459  million with a deficit  of  $1,500

million. According to the Finance Minister, from this

figure,   we   have  earmarked  $2,708  million   for

development  purposes, to assist  and  stimulate  our

economic  recovery.  For the new financial  year  the

total  revenue  of  about  $3,362  million  will   be

sufficient  to cover current expenditure. He  further

points  out  that  we  have  already  laid  a   sound

foundation for our long term economic development and

for  a  6  -  8% economic growth rate in  the  coming

financial  year.  I hope that our financial  position

will move ever onward, and I also like to express  my

support   on  behalf  of  my  constituents  for   the

Minister's Budget for the new financial year.



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Kolam Ayer)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, 1976 saw an improvement in  the  world

economy,  a  very encouraging situation  compared  to

that prevailing in 1974 and 1975 when an increase  in

the price of oil had adversely affected the economies

of  not  only the developing countries but  also  the

advanced  countries  of  the  world.  The   rate   of

inflation for 1976 has shown that even countries with

strong  economies,  such as the OECD  countries,  are

still experiencing an inflation rate of about 8%.  In

fact,  there  are  certain countries  which  have  an

inflation  rate  of  30%, such as Egypt,  while  some

other











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



countries   like  Nigeria  even  have  a  frightening

inflation rate which rises to a peak of 40%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we can also see how the industrial

countries  in  the  OECD which  are  experiencing  an

inflation rate of 8% can still achieve a real  growth

rate  of 5%. The United States particularly has moved

one  step  ahead when the Chairman of its Council  of

Economic  Advisers, Mr Charles Schultz,  predicted  a

GNP  growth rate of between 5.5% and 6% for 1977.  It

is certainly our hope that the growth rate in Western

Europe  and  Japan  for 1977 will  also  surpass  the

growth rate for last year because should this happen.

stability  would  be brought about  in  the  economic

situation of the world as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1977 financial statement our Minister

for   Finance  has  predicted  that  "barring   major

upheavals in the world economy, we should be able  to

achieve an annual growth rate of 6 to 8%." This is an

optimistic prediction. In his concluding remarks, the

Finance Minister stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In English]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have weathered severe economic storms in the

last 3 1/2 years. I hope nothing as shocking as the 1973

oil  embargo  and  quadrupling  of  oil  prices  ever

happens  again. The weather is getting fine and  fair

and  our  Ship of State is in good shape The  command

should therefore be "Steady as she goes."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In Malay] Actually, the hopes expressed by the

Minister  represent the universal hope of mankind  at

large.  But  only  the  human  race  understands  how

complex  the human mind is. Human beings  have  spent

billions  of  dollars  on arms for  various  reasons,

including the object of interfering in the affairs of

others and breaching the peace. thereby causing those

countries to resort to no other course of action  but

to  prepare themselves for possible attacks so as not

to be caught napping.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, the former Chairman of the Food

and  Agriculture Organisation of the United  Nations,

Dr Eugene Castro, made a statement. (Dr Eugene Castro

has   no  relations  with  Dr  Fidel  Castro;  should

somebody want to write a book on a comparative  study

of both men. which I think will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



make interesting reading.) In his statement Dr Eugene

Castro  says  that what he is troubled with  is  that

should  this  world be free of war and  there  is  no

chaos, he is confident that the world will be able to

support  10  times the world population of  today  in

respect  of food. This is a statement made more  than

10  years ago and the complex situation of mankind is

still continuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now oil has become a weapon. Industrial

countries like Japan with their economic miracle were

also affected when the price of oil increased in  the

1973-75 period because Japan. for instance, could not

reduce the salaries of its workers so as to strike  a

balance with the increase in the cost of oil imports.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the prediction of the

Finance  Minister about the 6-8% economic  growth  is

very moderate. I think we can accept this cautiously,

extra  cautious  in  fact, or rather  with  `cautious

optimism.'  We  know  that whatever  happens  in  the

United  States,  Western Europe  or  Japan,  it  will

affect  us.  We  also know that the increase  in  the

price of oil will adversely affect us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another matter which is closer to home is that

whether  we like it or not two blocs have emerged  in

this  region. One bloc is the Communist bloc  of  the

Indo-Chinese countries (Vietnam, Cambodia  and  Laos)

and  the other bloc, including us, is ASEAN.  We  can

see that what has been going on in the Thai-Malaysian

border  is  not  a healthy sign. All  these  matters,

including peace and stability in Singapore,  will  be

an   important  factor  in  determining  whether  our

Minister's hopes and predictions will materialise  or

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all these matters should be watched by us

closely,  I feel that other positive measures  should

be  taken. Firstly, our bilateral agreements with the

Philippines and Thailand for a 10% tariff cut  should

be   made  a  reality  and  extended  to  all   ASEAN

countries.  Secondly. having achieved  that,  efforts

should  be made for a similar situation to be created

between  ASEAN on the one hand and Australia and  New

Zealand  on  the  other. I feel that there  are  many

similarities











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



between us that can create better understanding which

in   the  final  analysis  will  benefit  all  sides.

Thirdly,  while  in  the  economic  field   we   must

consolidate  our  strength. we must make  efforts  in

politics  so  that this region, in particular,  could

fulfil  the aspiration of the human race, namely,  to

live  in  peace, in mutual respect for  each  other's

rights and settling problems with peaceful means  and

not  through interference with the affairs of  others

or  through  conflicts or minor  wars,  killings  and

murders. Until now, people are asking whether we  are

good ancestors for future generations to take example

from.  I feel that this question can only be answered

by making self-corrections. We must correct ourselves

first.  All  human  beings should correct  themselves

before  putting the blame on others. I would like  to

quote from a Chinese proverb: "We point one finger at

others  but three fingers are pointing at us."  If  a

Malay were to point at someone in a polite manner, he

would  do it with his thumb. In this manner, we  find

that four fingers would be pointing at our own self.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Government's policy

for this fiscal year.



<br><br>5.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Dhanabalan (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Finance Minister in his Budget Speech summarised  our

basic   strategy   to  meet  the  uncertainties   and

difficulties in the next few years when he said  that

we  need  a  flexible  approach  in  our  development

policy.  Changes  in  the region  and  in  the  major

industrialised countries will require  us  to  change

our  own policies and priorities. The problem is  how

to  get  such  changes in priorities to be  reflected

quickly  and effectively in the actions of the  civil

service  and other public services. During  the  high

growth years between 1968 and 1973. the economy  grew

at  an  average  rate of 15% and  the  manufacturing

sector grew at a rate of 20%. (All these figures  are

in real terms.) It was natural, therefore, that goals

other  than rapid employment creation and high growth

began to gain emphasis. We began to discourage labour

intensive operations and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



laid  greater emphasis on skilled labour and  capital

intensive  industries. We began to be more particular

about  where each type of industry should be located.

We set higher targets and demanded greater margins of

safety  in anti-pollution measures, industrial safety

and health measures and so on. We did such a good job

in  some  areas, for example, in discouraging labour-intensive operations that we now have to put in extra

efforts to convince potential investors that there is

a  change  in  approach and that  any  viable  export

oriented industry will be welcome, With the change in

the  international economic environment  we  have  to

restate  our order of priorities and convey  this  to

potential investors as well as those in the civil and

public  services  who  have  something  to  do   with

investments, be it in manufacturing, construction  or

service activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there is not sufficient appreciation of

the  difficulties  involved  in  achieving  even  the

modest growth rate targetted for 1977. Those who  are

in  the  field trying to attract new investment  know

only   too   well   how  much  times  have   changed.

Unfortunately. the great sense of urgency  and  unity

of  purpose that characterised the administration  up

to  the end of the 1960s and that enabled us to take

such  effective advantage of the boom  years  in  the

international economy seem to have faded away. We now

have  departments and services who are more concerned

with   their   own  immediate  objectives.   If   the

performance  of  such  departments  is  even   partly

measured  by  the  income they generate,  the  profit

motive tends to become supreme. That department  head

who has the wider interest of the economy and who  is

prepared to yield the immediate maximisation  of  his

own objectives becomes known generally as being soft-headed or weak. Moreover, if something does go  wrong

as  a result of his flexibility, those who press  for

the  flexibility will not be around to carry the can.

In  hindsight  when things go wrong  flexibility  can

easily  be  made to appear as stupidity.  Is  it  any

wonder  then  why  some departments stick  firmly  to

their own narrow











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



objectives and are inflexible in their approach?  The

problem  therefore is how to achieve  flexibility  in

administration to ensure that some of the  objectives

that became feasible in high growth years are now  re

examined and modified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me that some instrument must be found

at   a  supra  ministry  level  that  can  weigh  the

different  aspects, set new order of  priorities  and

make decisions when such problems arise. The Economic

Activation  Committee comprising  very  senior  civil

servants seems to be ideal for this. It does not have

any  decision-making powers at present. It should  be

reconstituted   and  delegated  some  decision-making

powers.  The  EAC  can then, on the basis  of  actual

cases  presented  before  it,  formulate  changes  in

approach,  in  emphasis, in order of  priorities  and

override or confirm individual department's views and

communicate  these  to the departments  and  services

concerned  through the decisions  it  makes  on  such

cases.  It  may even be necessary to have a committee

of  two  or three Ministers who can perform a similar

function on those matters which are considered to  be

too sensitive to be delegated down to a committee  of

civil servants. These measures will greatly speed  up

implementation of investment decisions  not  only  in

manufacturing but also in other fields. I think  this

is   very  essential  if  we  are  not  to  frustrate

investment promotion efforts or spend inordinate time

and  effort  trying  to convince  various  government

departments on the need to be flexible when such time

and  effort  should in fact be spent  in  working  on

potential   investors   to   commit   themselves   to

investment  in Singapore. Having with much difficulty

led  the proverbial horse to the water we should  not

be pulling away the trough when it wants to drink.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter that should receive more attention

and which has been touched upon by the Member for Ang

Mo   Kio  is  the  promotion  of  a  class  of  local

entrepreneurs  who  can compete successfully  in  the

international market. Firms controlled and managed by

local entrepreneurs probably account for about 45% of

the  workers  employed and about 30  to  35%  of  the

output



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



and   value  added  respectively  of  the  industries

covered  in the Census of Industrial Production.  But

these firms account for only about 1 5% of the direct

exports, although there are, of course, some indirect

exports. Those who have followed the progress of  our

industrialisation   know  that  very   little   local

entrepreneurship has emerged that is able to  make  a

mark  in the export market. It is quite logical  that

those with ready foreign markets have been the target

of  our  industrial promotion policy. We have rightly

concentrated  on  attracting  foreign  investors.  We

should  continue to do so and make it attractive  for

foreign investors to operate in Singapore because  it

is  to our mutual advantage. But I think that at  the

same  time it is necessary also to build up the share

in  our  export  industries which is  controlled  and

managed by local entrepreneurs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at Hong Kong with an export economy similar

to ours will show how far we lag in the participation

of  local  entrepreneurs in the export  manufacturing

sector. There are reasons, of course, for Hong Kong's

lead  in  this respect. Firstly they had a  group  of

refugee entrepreneurs from China and, secondly,  many

with   potential   to   become   professionals    and

administrators often found that the only  avenue  for

their  talents  was  for them to start  something  of

their  own.  In the next few years. many of  our  own

professionals who have been working in foreign  owned

and  managed firms would have had about 10  years  or

more  experience in their jobs. A few may be prepared

to strike out on their own and set up their own small

manufacturing operations for export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help them to get established? Government

should  study this problem, firstly to  find  out  in

which  areas assistance can be most effectively given

and  set up a scheme to provide such assistance.  The

need  may  be  in  any one of the areas  of  capital.

introduction   to  firms  with  technical   know-how,

training of workers, information about markets,  etc.

I  say  any one of these areas because if a  would-be

entrepreneur  is  lacking in all or  most  areas,  no

scheme  can  help him and in fact the use  of  public

resources in such instances cannot be justified. I am

afraid that











<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



with  the  success we have had in attracting  foreign

investment  this  aspect has been  relegated  to  the

background. I would urge the Ministry of  Finance  to

give the subject more consideration.



<br><br>5.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

on  28th February which was the 11th day of the first

month  of  the  Year of the Snake,  which  was  still

during  the New Year season, the Minister for Finance

brought  a  piece  of  good news  to  the  people  of

Singapore.  Apart  from  tax  increases  on   liquor,

tobacco and cigarettes, there have been no new taxes.

Instead  there  are  four tax concessions.  This  has

enabled the people of Singapore to enjoy another year

without  painful increases in taxes. This shows  that

our  Finance Minister is a person whom we can  trust.

He  is a man who keeps his words of not raising taxes

and he has now brought good prospects for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, people are very sensitive and

alert whenever the Budget is to be presented, because

any new tax will have immediate effect on the people.

Therefore,  on  that day when the Budget  was  to  be

presented, the ROV was crowded with people who wanted

to  pay  their  road  tax or to apply  for  new  road

licences.  Some sensitive merchants were also  trying

to  hoard  tobacco and liquor in order to  make  more

profit  before  new  taxes were announced.  All  this

shows  that the people are quite acquainted with  the

parliamentary process. They are just



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



like frightened birds whenever the budget is about to

be  presented. They are nervous and worried that  new

taxes  will  be imposed. Therefore, the budget  which

was  presented by the Minister has been a  relief  to

the  people.  This  manner  of  budgetting  with  the

welfare  of the people in mind is laudable  and  will

generally be welcomed by the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without doubt the five basic elements of our long

term  development strategy for a sustained growth  as

announced by the Minister five years ago is realistic

and  feasible,  It  serves as  a  guideline  for  our

economic  development  and  points  the  way  to  our

economic  modernisation, We all know that because  of

the  Government's good economic policy and  strategy,

Singapore  has  been  transformed  from  an  entrepot

trading  centre  into  a  productive,  industrialised

country with enough employment opportunities for  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards employment figures. as of June last year

a total of 870,400 people were gainfully employed, an

increase  of  4%  over the previous year  1975.  This

shows  that  we are on the way to economic  recovery,

and this is very encouraging to all of us.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE POOLS (PTE) LTD</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Utilisation of profits)</b></div>





<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a) what

was  the  annual  profit of the Singapore  Pools  (Pte)  Ltd

during  the  past five years; and (b) whether  his  Ministry

will   use   part   of  the  profit  to  subsidize   various

constituency sports clubs to promote sports and games or  to

donate  to  the building funds of new community  centres  in

those constituencies where fund raising is not easy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The net profits of Singapore Pools (Pte)

Ltd during the past five years were as follows:-



<pre>

               FY         Profits

               71/72      $5,740,543

               72/73      $6,873,900

               73/74      $7,216,799

               74/75      $7,140,818

               75/76      $7,444,083



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to using the profits of Singapore Pools to

finance sports and other activities for the public, it is

Government policy and practice to finance Government

expenditures out of consolidated revenues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of sports and recreational amenities is a

part of the overall services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



Government provides to the

people of Singapore. The organisation responsible for sports

facilities and services is the Singapore Sports Council

(SSC) which receives an annual grant from Government to help

it finance its activities. The grant extended to SSC comes

from monies collected as general revenue (including

Singapore Pools) and I consider the present financial

arrangements satisfactory. They have not prevented the full

development of public sports and recreational activities in

Singapore. The SSC itself has been extending financial

assistance to various sports and recreation organisations

which it feels merit support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital grants are provided by Government for the

construction of community centres. These grants are assessed

on  the overall requirement, and there is therefore no need,

and  no  greater  advantage, on  more  than  one  source  of

financing  by Government. Community Centres are intended  to

serve  as  a  focal  point for community  participation  and

involvement  and  partial financing of the  construction  of

community  centres by voluntary public contributions  should

be   encouraged  as  one  form  of  such  participation  and

involvement.
