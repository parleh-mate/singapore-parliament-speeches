In spite of greater assistance measures, such as the increased Public Assistance (PA) and ComCare funding, we still ask, "Can the Government do more?", "Can the Government give more?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not doubt the need for the Government to provide the necessary safety nets and measures for the disadvantaged and I do not deny as well <p align=left>Column:932 </p>that those who are disadvantaged do need the assistance that we should provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;I cannot help but ask if we have lost our sense of responsibility as a community to care for our own.&nbsp; What has happened to social responsibility?&nbsp; Have we lost our social capital that the disadvantaged, ie, the&nbsp;needy, elderly and disabled,&nbsp;are now solely the Government&rsquo;s responsibility?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not certain what message we are taking to the people.&nbsp; Let us leave our poor, elderly, disabled, sandwiched and sick in the care of the Government?&nbsp; Over the past week, the media has covered the plight of the disadvantaged during this Budget debate.&nbsp; It would have been nice to have Singaporeans coming together, stepping forward to ask the Government how they can help.&nbsp; Throughout the debates, there were many in the gallery who listened to the plight of residents who have visited our MPS, and I wonder if there is a little voice in them telling them to be more compassionate and to step forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear the degradation of our values and our social capital, if we continue to expect the Government to take sole ownership of our social inequalities.&nbsp; We are already seeing this shift in responsibility today with regard to how some of us treat our families, parents, siblings, ex-spouses, children, neighbours and so forth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would&nbsp;be nice if we can get the same fervent support for this noble cause as we did for the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) &ndash;&nbsp;the community,&nbsp;the youth, the people and corporate sectors all coming together with the same great enthusiasm.&nbsp; It would be nice if MCYS this time can rally the community to provide the same enthusiastic support for this noble cause to help lift our disadvantaged,&nbsp;above the Government's social safety nets.&nbsp; This is the Singapore that I would like to associate myself with, a Singapore that <p align=left>Column: 933 </p>takes responsibility for our own social issues and inequalities, a Singapore ready with its helping hands.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to continue my speech in Malay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I> ):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20080227/20080227VS_110334.pdf"">Appendix A</a></I> *.]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget takes a holistic approach.&nbsp; It not only helps the people to face the rising costs of living, but it also contains investments for the future, especially for the low and middle-income.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I see this Budget as killing two birds with one stone.&nbsp; At one level, it deals with the current situation.&nbsp; At another level, it takes into account long-term needs.&nbsp; However, in doing so, we have to make sure that the generous and meaningful handouts, like the educational financial assistance and the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme, do not make Singaporeans feel that it is their right to receive them.&nbsp; If not, such handouts will always be expected in the future.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that we look at how these handouts can become more than just an incentive for youths to upgrade their education.&nbsp; For example, the education assistance scheme can be linked to social contributions, ie, youths who want to participate in this scheme can be encouraged to contribute to society.&nbsp; Handouts using this more meaningful approach will help form and instil a culture of a united people for Singapore.&nbsp; It is better than if the Government just gives assistance that only helps to overcome the problem of rising education costs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget also gives assistance in the form of bursaries for university and polytechnic education.&nbsp; It is a correct and timely move, and helps to encourage low-income students to continue their studies to post-secondary <p align=left>Column:934 </p>level.&nbsp; I applaud the Government's move in introducing this scheme by taking into the account the long-term solution to help the needy.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I encourage the Malay community to take advantage of these opportunities to increase their children's education level so that we can see many more of our students at least reaching post-secondary level.&nbsp; Any assistance scheme introduced is wasted if it is not used.&nbsp; It is even worse if the target group does not realise the existence of such schemes.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this aspect, we must have more efforts to increase awareness so that it can reach as many people as possible.&nbsp; Some of the needy and low-income themselves may not follow developments or even read information spread by the mass media.&nbsp; Every one, including the Government, organisations and schools, must help in the effort to spread this information.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By doing so, we can widen the social assistance net and reach the objective to help the poor escape the poverty trap.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

(<I>In English</I>): Mr Speaker, Sir, much has been said about the concerns of the business community with regard to&nbsp;surging business costs following the significant increases in salaries and higher rentals.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our attractiveness as a business hub depends on our ability to manage the cost of doing business here and not let the current rises in cost become a permanent fixture in our economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the cost increases today will take time to correct themselves.&nbsp; For example, leases will generally stand for three years or more, and higher salaries are certainly difficult&nbsp;to unwind.&nbsp; Many employers I spoke to complain that business revenues and workforce productivity have not increased as much as the costs have risen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:935 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the impact of high&nbsp;business costs, particularly rentals and higher salaries, especially when we correlate them to business productivity.&nbsp; We assume that our free market ensures competitive pricing and choice, but a small market and geography like Singapore may result in only few strong players surviving the high costs and barriers of doing business, resulting in uncompetitive prices and fewer choices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I take the retail sector as an example, there are only a few large developers who are able to afford to set up malls in town and in the heartlands.&nbsp; Within those few developers, you would find that their malls may look different, but the shop mix is pretty much the same.&nbsp; One can walk into almost any mall in Singapore and predict the tenants, the same few large, mass market players, whether you are in the city or in the heartlands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smaller players find it hard to survive and set up.&nbsp; Even the large luxury boutiques find it expensive because there is a limit to how much they can grow their top line due to our small market size and yet still cope with high rentals. &nbsp;Consumers then have less choice on the products available and on the costs of goods being offered in the marketplace. &nbsp;This is how many currently describe our retail and shopping scene &ndash; a standard template across all our malls&nbsp;&ndash; few players, not enough variety, and prices are not very&nbsp;competitive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, one does not need to head to Hong Kong or even Japan for good retail therapy. Our neighbouring cities are providing much more across the luxury, mass market and budget brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I compare the scenario to the commercial sector, the situation is somewhat similar.&nbsp; Our smaller businesses also compete with the big boys in terms of office space and <p align=left>Column: 936 </p>industrial parks outside of town, leaving many with little choice but to relocate overseas, while those who cannot put up with the high costs of doing business exit the market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our rising costs today are avoidable, if the Government machinery is working better.&nbsp; For example, when PM announced his vision of a global city for Singapore some years back, MND could have started to release sites so that we could have an adequate supply of office buildings now instead of waiting for two more years for real&nbsp;supply to come on line.&nbsp; I think our marksmanship in this space could be better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the effects of&nbsp;cost of living on the workforce, we should be at the forefront of a low tax&nbsp;rate and higher disposable income regime in Asia, if we are to attract top talents.&nbsp; We should not play catch-up with the likes of Hong Kong, but be at the front.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we include the cost of living in Singapore, in terms of cost of homes, cars, transportation and education, versus some of our competitors like Hong Kong, I do not think our executives and workers actually bring in much more.&nbsp; The impression we received, when the inflation index was at 6.6%, the highest in decades, was&nbsp;as though the Government was caught off-guard.&nbsp; Perhaps,&nbsp;using only monetary policy to control inflation is not working so well and our policies could have been adjusted better because I am certain the scenario of us reaching oil prices of US$100 a barrel was something we&nbsp;would have considered and, as a whole of Government, I think we could have planned better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to be more proactive and strengthen the whole of Government machinery in managing our supply and demand requirements because, if we allow these cost increases, such as office rents and salaries, to creep in and become a structural part of the economy, the high <p align=left>Column: 937 </p>cost of doing business will hamper innovation and choice in our consumer and commercial markets in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final point is that I welcome the Minister's speech that sustainable development remains a key priority for&nbsp;this year's Budget.&nbsp; I urge that when we speak of sustainable development, we should also look at quality growth in GDP and employment, not just in terms of quantity and absolute numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;A major challenge is how we face up to the competition in the region, and the competition that our workers face against foreign talent at various levels from the low-skill jobs all the way to&nbsp;management positions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the corporate scene today.&nbsp; We are not the only ones facing competition from our neighbours. There is stiff competition for talent worldwide.&nbsp; Even the top&nbsp;multinational corporations (MNCs)&nbsp;in the US are competing for global talent, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even in the US today, they now have top foreign talents running their homegrown corporations, such as Indra Nooyi in PepsiCo,&nbsp;Virkam Pandit&nbsp;who&nbsp;runs Citigroup as CEO globally, both of whom were born in India.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the challenge is here at our doorstep.&nbsp;Today, China's large MNCs are led by high flying CEOs with an average age of 47.&nbsp; We are seeing many from their next tier of talents&nbsp;taking up&nbsp;regional positions with our local and multinational corporations.&nbsp; Young, capable and having plenty of drive.&nbsp; Our talent pool is not only small, but the average age of our workforce talents is not getting&nbsp;younger either.&nbsp; So we need to create a win-win situation,&nbsp;developing the right resources and getting the right talent to ensure our survivability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, the issues of the war for talent, innovation and creating high-quality businesses in Singapore are no longer about budget marksmanship,<p align=left>Column: 938 </p> business costs or tax concessions but an issue of our survival as a country and as an economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax rebates on innovation and R&amp;D are a good start to move our companies in the right direction as it is increasingly difficult to compete at the low-end.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to ask: is the Government doing enough to accelerate the capability of our workforce up the value chain?&nbsp; Clearly, we need to leverage on our high quality education system and skilled workforce, by creating more high-value jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, we still need to&nbsp;continue to attract MNCs, or even faster, to attract them&nbsp;to set up leading edge R&amp;D centres here.&nbsp; I have to leave nationalistic sentiment of growing national icons and hubs aside because the window of opportunity may not wait for our research hubs to mature into an established state.&nbsp;&nbsp;But these MNCs and leading R&amp;D centres also need to be supported by a whole industry of innovative growth companies producing higher value-added services. &nbsp;Therefore, the SME sector also needs to play a more important role to produce high-value growth and jobs to make the ecosystem more attractive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could take the engineering and infocommunications sector in Israel as an example, I do not think many companies would find it&nbsp;enticing&nbsp;to set up a&nbsp;high-value business or R&amp;D centre in the middle of a war zone.&nbsp; Despite the instability and security concerns, the country still produces many innovative companies in the engineering and infocommunications sectors.&nbsp; And they have large MNCs,&nbsp;such as IBM and Microsoft, to set up R&amp;D centres because these companies are not only attracted by the wealth of high-quality engineering talent that is available, but also a host of innovative SMEs with the capability and talent to support and provide them with a range of&nbsp;leading edge intellectual properties (IP) and technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we<p align=left>Column: 939 </p> may have some success stories here, but I believe&nbsp;Singapore needs to do more&nbsp;in providing more cutting edge contributors that can make an impact&nbsp;on the global marketplace to make us more relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue I see is that many of our local businesses in the SME segment lack the understanding and capability to exploit the tax schemes and programmes to promote R&amp;D and innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government tries hard within the MTI family. &nbsp;However, they are only able, given their limited manpower resources, to focus on growth companies to enable them to become strong regional and global companies. But, in reality, the majority of our businesses are not even there yet.&nbsp; It takes hard work and resources, otherwise the amount of money spent on grants and growth programmes will not yield the returns on investments that we expect.&nbsp; It will take a lot of hard work on the ground, but I think the Government needs to do it, nonetheless, by providing sufficient manpower and resources to handhold these businesses to help them innovate and exploit the Government&rsquo;s tax rebates and market supply policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure the long-term and sustainable development of our economy,</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>and the long-term employment prospects of Singaporeans, I believe that we will have to keep a close watch and measure our performance in terms of high-value economic growth and the quality of the jobs that we create.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as the Government pursues its strategies of ensuring Singapore's sustained development, I also hope that it&nbsp;measures its progress with as much focus on quality&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the quality of GDP growth and the quality of jobs created&nbsp;&ndash; as we do on quantity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:MISCELLANEOUS-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:VISIT OF INDIAN DELEGATION FROM THE MAHARASHTRA STATE LEGISLATURE--><p align=left>Column: 940<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:VISIT OF INDIAN DELEGATION FROM THE MAHARASHTRA STATE LEGISLATURE:::940--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>VISIT OF INDIAN DELEGATION FROM THE MAHARASHTRA STATE LEGISLATURE<BR></B></span><div><BR>								<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Presence in Gallery--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Presence in Gallery)<BR></B></span><div><BR>			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; On behalf of hon.

The respected <I>Economist</I> magazine marvelled at our ability to generate third world growth rates while maintaining first world economic development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, 2008 will be remembered by posterity as the year of price increases.&nbsp; But I urge the Government&nbsp;to make its mark in 2008 and be remembered&nbsp;for casting a net that covers all Singaporeans and taking a&nbsp;step to roll out out-of-the-box solutions and thoughts to sustain our economy and instil ownership of our beloved Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A special group that this net will reach is the group of Singaporeans who, if given the correct stimulus, can enter the workforce and help themselves <p align=left>Column: 941</p>eventually. I wish to advocate issuing them with a work transport pass.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two months ago, I met an old family friend, in his 70s.&nbsp; He lives in Tiong Bahru and walks six days a week to and fro to PSA in Tanjong Pagar where he works&nbsp;as an odd job worker.&nbsp; I asked him whether there was a direct bus that he could take.&nbsp; He answered that&nbsp;it would be too costly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his age, he relishes a hot drink or soup during lunch, though he may be supplementing that with food and water from home.&nbsp; With a meagre salary of $600 a month, if he wants his hot drink or soup, he will have to walk to work and home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many others like this old friend, whose meagre income would not afford them the luxury of taking public transport except &nbsp; <I>jalan kaki sendiri</I>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<I>zi ji yong jiao zou</I> (&#33258;&#24049;&#29992;&#33050;&#36208;).&nbsp;With rising inflation and higher transport costs, commuting with their legs seems to be the only viable option for many at the bottom of the pyramid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This reminds me of my MPS where, among those who came for help, I have probed into why they are choosy about taking on jobs and would not take on those further away from home.&nbsp; This is what one of them told me:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The salary as an operator is only about $600.&nbsp; I live in Boon Lay and work is in Loyang Changi.&nbsp; I have to take MRT and two buses to get to work. Daily, it costs me $5.72, almost 25% of my daily salary.&nbsp; Cheaper for me to declare I can't&nbsp;work and go on the PA scheme."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we want to truly encourage this group of low income Singaporeans who are at the margin to re-enter the workforce, we need to help them "circulate" around Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;To look for a job you need to go out and find one.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column:942 </p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has introduced many good schemes to incentivise these marginal workers back to work, such as retraining and re-skilling and the Workfare Income Supplement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, we have not reached this group.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give an analogy of their situation.&nbsp; It is very much like a condition of colic that many of us would have experienced some time in our lifetime.&nbsp; The only way to ease the cramp in your stomach because of the built up gas is to get off your butt and move about or, better still, run a few good laps to let go of the gas. We burp the colicky babies and massage their stomachs to help get rid of the gas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we do with this group? &nbsp;They are not moving and continue to fester that wind in the stomach, which when it becomes a time bomb, will stink everyone around.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that looking at the newspapers and going to&nbsp;MPS is not the solution and referral to the job distribution centres sometimes also requires a fair bit of commuting.&nbsp; To incentivise this group to look for a job and take up even a low-paying job, I would advocate for a work transport pass, to be issued to them for so long as they are on the job and their income is below the threshold of $800.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a work transport pass will improve the "circulation" of those at the bottom of the pyramid and benefit them as well as the larger society.&nbsp; This is because we will have more of them finding it meaningful and possible to re-enter the workforce and be less reliant on PA.&nbsp; It is a stimulus that is needed to bring back the zest for work in this group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the heart of Singapore's economic success is its social compact.&nbsp; Since independence, the majority of our citizens, including those at the bottom, have enjoyed a steady rise in living <p align=left>Column: 943 </p>standards.&nbsp; This can be attributed to sound fiscal policies and economic planning.&nbsp;The long-term economic future may be rosy but, for the short-term future, more help is needed for those at the bottom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerging global challenges are putting pressure on the sustainability of the standard of living to which we all have become accustomed.&nbsp; Technological development resulting in the outsourcing of services and processes away from developed countries as well as&nbsp; cheaper IT-driven processes have proven to be a cheaper source of business operations than semi-skilled and unskilled labour.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the immediate term, it will result in widespread job losses and income attrition in developed countries and this will hollow out the earning capacity of many semi-skilled and unskilled workers, leaving them stuck at the bottom rung.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, emerging sectors, such as hospitality,&nbsp;will provide some jobs but, at the same time, the IRs could prove to be a double-edged sword.&nbsp; More money coming into Singapore could have the effect of pushing up the cost of living and those at the bottom will be hit the hardest.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the sooner we help this group to help themselves, the better off it will be for us all lest they add on to the increasing pool of PA recipients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A policy framework to deal with the problem of wage stagnation at the bottom rung and a rising cost of living may be one of the biggest challenges that Singapore has faced to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to reconcile our response with our tradition of non-welfarism.&nbsp; At the same time, the challenges that are confronting us today are very different in terms of their shape or magnitude from those that have confronted us before.&nbsp; We need to be creative and innovative and to<p align=left>Column: 944 </p> focus upon areas such as fine-tuning the Workfare provision, the retirement benefits, and developing a well-integrated continuing education and training system.&nbsp; Help does not&nbsp;just come in the form of financial subsidies and incentives, it also comes in the form of opportunities and special help for the bottom of the bottomest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is equally important to remember that most other advanced economies are facing the same problem.&nbsp; Fortunately, as a country, we have the human capabilities to deal with the issue.&nbsp; Also, unlike the UK and many of the European countries, we do not have an existing debilitating welfare infrastructure nor have we nurtured a welfare-centric culture. Whatever approach we adopt, it can be designed from scratch or, to put it another way, from the centre outwards.&nbsp; We can customise it and make it compatible with work incentives and human capital investment.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to propose a few out-of-the-box solutions and thoughts.&nbsp; I call them out-of-the-box because they may not be the norm of the Government's way of doing things or thinking.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first point I wish to raise is about improving connectivity in our transportation.&nbsp; How do we ensure that whilst battling with road congestion through more ERP gantries and hikes, there are adequate interim measures put in place to facilitate connectivity from one point to another point?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many private operators have put up feeder buses to link MRT stations and bus terminals to shopping hubs.&nbsp; It is in their commercial interest to do it, so as to bring the shoppers to the shopping hubs by creating convenience and accessibility.&nbsp; This in turn benefits the commercial operators.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private condominiums operate scheduled free shuttle service from their<p align=left>Column:945 </p> condominiums to nearby MRT stations. Alexandra Hospital also operates a shuttle service from the hospital to an MRT station.&nbsp; These shuttle services provide the convenience with better connectivity for those who rely on public transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has never really felt a great need for such intervention as&nbsp;arrangements such as these are purely premised on commercial motivation.&nbsp; However, I would venture to say that such connectivity is very much part and parcel of our transportation infrastructure that the Government should look into providing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, traffic congestion around schools can be improved if there were shuttle services to take students from and to the MRT stations, bus interchanges and major transport routes to and from schools.&nbsp; This could be the tipping point for&nbsp;students to use public transport more frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government so wishes to encourage and&nbsp; switch the mindset of the entire nation, to commute by public transportation, then, as in the words of the Minister for Transport, seamless commuting from point to point is the answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As an interim measure to prepare Singaporeans to take public transport, I urge the Government to introduce more shuttle bus services to link up terminals and stations to educational institutions, retail hubs, heartlands and private estates.&nbsp; These could be implemented straightaway without having to wait for the completion of the major transportation network.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point, Sir, is on how&nbsp;we can&nbsp;have a better communication process through an information databank.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has introduced many good schemes to help Singaporeans. Although many of these schemes were well published in full in the mainstream <p align=left>Column:946 </p>newspapers and communicated through&nbsp;channels including grassroots dialogues, many on the ground&nbsp;still cannot grasp the&nbsp; key intention of the schemes.&nbsp; With so many schemes rolling out, one after another, many are confused with what they are eligible for.&nbsp; Try asking any grassroots leader or MP who is charged with disseminating information and the mechanics of such schemes, and I can say the majority will not be able to tell&nbsp; from the A to Z of such schemes, unless you are the author.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the most zealous of grassroots leaders trying to help a resident will be greeted with information overload.&nbsp; And this explains how some join the complain camp&nbsp;&ndash; because if you cannot win them, you better join them. So&nbsp;the complaints will fester and the misunderstanding of the good intentions of the Government gets more serious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is wrong with the current communication process and what can be done to improve it? Our newspapers are very good at reporting a scheme in great details. For example, the recent announcement of the transport policy by Minister Raymond Lim was well covered in the <I>Straits Times</I>.&nbsp; The report was a very comprehensive summarised version of the complete policy paper.&nbsp; It was a useful reference for those who wish to study transportation policy but the message to many readers was that they have to pay more to commute.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what is needed is to customise the message for a targeted audience instead of a message for all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain this further. For example, if a resident approaches his community leader to find out his eligibility under the means test or the Budget handout or the&nbsp; policy guidelines applicable to him under the CPF lifelong plan, the resident cannot expect to have a very helpful answer from his community leader unless the community<p align=left>Column: 947 </p> leader was involved in the formulation of the policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is needed is an information databank that can extract a subset of specific information and rules of schemes that are relevant and applicable to the personal profile of the enquirer.&nbsp; The process sieves out the relevant information needed.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if I wish to find out more about my CPF contributions, Medisave and lifelong policy, I would go to a specific website.&nbsp; I would key in my name and NRIC number.&nbsp; I will be prompted to key in other profile as needed, such as my birthday, gender and income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer will return with specific information applicable to me in that age group.&nbsp; It will tell me all about the status of my CPF account, the Minimum Sum and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not need to plough through the information that is not applicable and that does not concern me.&nbsp; It can also tell me the level of subsidy that I am entitled to under the means test if I wish to know my subsidy eligibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; This information data bank will complement the general information that is disseminated through the mass media.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have the media that reports the macro stuff of the policy or scheme; we have the cartoon brochures to simplify, explain and clarify.&nbsp; But we do not&nbsp;have the customised individual information that you and I and the man on the road would want to know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the Government should start looking into a department that will make communication of such information better understood by Singaporeans so that we reach out to every nook and corner.&nbsp; Depending on volunteer grassroots leaders to do the job of outreach is not enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example is the ComCare Scheme.&nbsp; It is not simply dishing out<p align=left>Column:948 </p> money to those who step forward.&nbsp; We need to comb out many who are still in&nbsp;hiding because they would not or do not know how to step forward.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it is timely to bring in the professional marketers, campaigners and counsellors to do a better job.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point is about inflation and our food supply.&nbsp; Sir, inflation is likely to increase relentlessly despite the slew of strategies that the Finance Minister has announced.&nbsp; With food prices going up, the hardest hit will undoubtedly be those who can least afford these increases&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;lower income families with little produce substitution choices.&nbsp; If they are already eating chicken instead of pork or mutton, will they be left eating vegetables and rice if the price of chicken or mutton increases any further?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will switch to frozen food, but to what extent will frozen food bring down food prices before price increase catch up with frozen food?&nbsp;&nbsp;For how long can the Government ensure that the frozen food stockpile will stabilise food prices for a while and that our neighbours, whom we depend on for some basic food items, will not take this opportunity to squeeze us further, further aggravating our vulnerability as&nbsp;a country?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, imitation is the highest form of flattery.&nbsp; Our closest neighbour has recently declared that they will be following in our footsteps&nbsp;&ndash; our tried, tested and proven method of growth.&nbsp; I, however, fear the day that the politics of envy replaces the politics of imitation.&nbsp; What is worrisome is when our neighbours decide to further increase the price of their food supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our Government prepared for such an eventuality, and how could such a scenario be countered?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the fourth point is about our future.&nbsp; As Singapore moves towards our target population of 6.5 million, we are <p align=left>Column: 949 </p>increasingly faced with the question of what type of society do we want our children to grow up in.&nbsp; As urban congestion rears its ugly head, the slogan&nbsp;'gracious society' is no longer a platitude:&nbsp; it is an urgent call to arms.&nbsp; Unless we step up efforts to make this a reality and change our attitudes and adjust our way of living, growing up in a city of 6.5 million will be almost intolerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our ideal tolerance level should be on par with the Japanese: even in <I>sashimi</I> packed subway trains, tempers seldom flare, and a business-like but not unfriendly amiability is the defining characteristic of that country.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the longer term, the Finance Minister has shown the way to cope is to build up our capabilities and&nbsp;a resilient Singapore.&nbsp; The key to this is retention.&nbsp; MM Lee recently asked: where have all the bright and young Singaporeans gone?&nbsp; Perhaps we could solicit more feedback from the yearly 1,000 students who study overseas and decide not to return to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The renowned magazine, <I>The Monocle,</I> and a survey commissioned by the Hub Culture recently ranked Singapore the 17th city in terms of liveability.&nbsp; Singaporeans used to seeing Singapore at the top of international charts were shocked: why are we a paltry 17, far behind 10th placed Hong Kong?&nbsp; Why, when we rank as one of the top three places in the world to do business, are we so far down the charts in liveability?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are hard questions about the soul of Singapore we have to ask in the years ahead: is the key to loyalty merely economic, or is there something more to encouraging our best and brightest to stay?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A look at the Hub Culture indices provides an interesting insight into why we only rank 17 in liveability. The survey <p align=left>Column: 950 </p>ranks cities according to 'innovation, change and vibe'. &nbsp;Under the section on Singapore, the survey highlights the Government's good efforts in 'innovation at the macro level and providing economic security'.&nbsp; However, it still begins the section by the familiar caveat: 'Singapore might seem boring'.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be that despite the Government's best efforts, our citizenry still feels uninvolved in the success, growth, and vibe of our country?&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be that the more our Government does, the less our citizenry feels engaged and involved?&nbsp; Perhaps it is time to consider engineering an engagement innovation with the young, and allow change to occur organically, from the ground.&nbsp; Encourage community bonding, independent thought, social vibrancy, but let people on the ground take the lead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Singapore merely a transit hotel to our very own sons and daughters? &nbsp;The key difference between a home and a hotel is the amount of control you have over your surroundings. &nbsp;In a hotel, the management has the final say, although the customer comes first.&nbsp; In contrast, a man's home is his castle.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give Singaporeans involvement, and attachment will form. Give them ownership of the country's destiny, and they will stay for life.&nbsp; That is the key to making Singapore a home.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the solutions and thoughts on the&nbsp;four points I have raised are not going to come out of the mill just like that.&nbsp; Indeed, to be Singapore number one, means weaving all the disparate threads of our social, economic, and political policies into a unifying theme that will keep our country ahead.&nbsp; More important than staying ahead is the question of how we want to live.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore cannot be number one in all economic indicators, and still have<p align=left>Column: 951 </p> unhappy citizens with poor quality of life or feeling dissatisfied or feeling the lack of opportunities.&nbsp; What do we do then?&nbsp; Well, Singapore must continue to strive in its pursuit to be number one in liveability, graciousness, consideration and compassion, as I have highlighted in my speech. &nbsp;The litmus test for all Parliamentarians and Singaporeans to use is this: what type of society do we want our children to grow up in?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is by no accident that we won the bid to host the YOG.&nbsp; The entire spirit of the nation has propelled this flight this far.&nbsp; It has to do with a sense of pride and ownership.&nbsp; We have not lost them all and we must continue to kindle them.&nbsp; With this most important of indicators in mind, we can then truly say that we have arrived.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the motion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.38 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, my esteemed colleagues who have spoken in the last two days have covered most of the topics.&nbsp; As I was listening, I pondered upon what is the most important question for Members of this Chamber to consider, ie, what are we doing today so that the need for all these social welfare schemes that we are all requesting for can be lessened?&nbsp; We should not be asking for more and more social welfare schemes.&nbsp; We should be asking how can we reduce the number of social welfare schemes, and what individual policies has the Government made now to reduce the reliance on all these social welfare schemes for the people.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we measure the well-being of a nation?&nbsp; How do we measure progress&nbsp;&ndash; GDP growth, mean income, family, inflation control, control of consumer price<p align=left>Column: 952 </p> index, how inclusive as a society that we are.&nbsp; I think there are many, many measures.&nbsp; And I reiterate again&nbsp;&ndash; what are we doing today so that we need less of social welfare schemes?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was no 2% GST hike last year, will the price of the luncheon meat remain at $1 and not increase from $1 to $3?&nbsp; Will the prices of wheat, rice, other food items, transportation cost and rental not increase to current levels?&nbsp; Will the oil price, which is an important proxy and critical link to energy prices and inflation, remain at last year's price?&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer is no. We are not immune to the global inflationary pressures, as we import all our food, energy needs and sand as well.&nbsp; There will still be increase in prices and there will be inflation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We approved the 2% GST hike in this House last year and we must not forget why the GST hike was proposed in the first place. The aim is to revamp our tax structure to better equip the Government with additional resources in the future to tackle the widening income gap and provide resources for wealth redistribution through schemes such as Workfare Income Supplement, and the key words here are&nbsp;"in the future".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, yes, the Government struck lottery, a big prize.&nbsp; But compared to Hong Kong, we only got third prize.&nbsp; They got first prize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the key question we need to ask is: what has the Government achieved last year?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government collected $1.4 billion in GST but returned $865 million, in terms of Growth Dividends, and that is&nbsp;62% of the GST collection.&nbsp; In actual fact, the real&nbsp;increment for the Government for GST is only 0.8%, which means it is from 5% to 5.8%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the Government return this amount of $865 million?&nbsp; It is not uniform, it is not equal.&nbsp; It is targeted and <p align=left>Column: 953</p>it is tilted in favour of the lower and&nbsp;the middle-income groups as well as the elderly. &nbsp;The lower and middle-income groups gain more from the GST rebates.&nbsp; Now, consistently, they also gain more from the proposed Growth Dividends that are about to be paid out if this House approves the Budget for 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also concerns as to why there is such a large discrepancy in the 2007 budget estimates.&nbsp; But I must say that I am happy that the Government is in a strong fiscal position of $6.4 billion surplus rather than in a $0.7 billion deficit.&nbsp; If the Government had estimated a $6.4 billion surplus and ended up with a $0.7 billion deficit, I think we will be very worried.&nbsp; I think this House has much to cheer rather than to accuse the Government of coming out with the wrong estimates.&nbsp; If we are wrong, Hong Kong is wrong as well.&nbsp; They are four times above their estimates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the looming uncertainties in the global financial markets as well as dark clouds in the horizon, I join in the echoes of my fellow parliamentarians to welcome the prudence of the Government for keeping some surpluses for additional contingencies if the need arises.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, at the same time, I urge the Government to be bold in rendering assistance to low income families to help them to become resilient again.&nbsp; The key word here is "resilient".&nbsp; Do not, because of fear of breeding dependency or possible abuse, be paralysed into inaction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building a resilient nation starts with building a resilient family. Although the Budget 2008 has provided for almost every individual, ie, the students, the taxpayers, the working adults, average&nbsp;Singaporeans, the elderly and even the rich dead, there is no mention of the family.&nbsp; Strengthening the unity of the Singapore family is the antidote and the prophylaxis to many of the social ills of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like the Government<p align=left>Column: 954 </p> to re-examine this and see how&nbsp;we can&nbsp;strengthen the family structure better through fiscal policies.&nbsp; The current tax rebates and&nbsp;incentives given&nbsp;are mainly targeted at individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways that we can look at is enhanced childcare subsidy for lower and middle-income families.&nbsp; Through our work in the constituency, we have come across many low income young families with a single breadwinner.&nbsp; The non-working spouse may stay at home to take care of&nbsp;two,&nbsp;three, or sometimes four&nbsp;children.&nbsp; The option for the non-working spouse to work to supplement their family income is attractive but is not a practical one, as the childcare charges for their children can be higher than their income.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, childcare cost is not low.&nbsp;&nbsp;It ranges from&nbsp;$400 to $800 a month (averages about&nbsp;$650).&nbsp; And the $150 subsidy&nbsp;offers little help to the lower income group, who can probably earn between&nbsp;$800 and $1,000 if they go out to work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sums do not work well&nbsp;for these workers.

The same amount is given to a mother who earns $800 as a factory worker and sends two of&nbsp;her children to a $500 per month void-deck childcare facility&nbsp;and&nbsp;to an executive mother who&nbsp;earns a five-digit&nbsp;salary per month and who can afford&nbsp;a $1,500 per month&nbsp;up-market pre-school/childcare facility&nbsp;in town.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current $150 childcare subsidy can be revamped to tilt in favour of the lower and middle income groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;higher subsidy is given, I believe it will <p align=left>Column: 955 </p>entice the&nbsp;non-working spouse in low-income families to the workforce.&nbsp; It&nbsp;will also help to elevate their household income. Their children will also benefit from more structured pre-school education programmes and social interactions in the childcare facilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the proposed means testing in healthcare, and&nbsp;the additional housing grant of HDB, this is not the first time we are introducing differential subsidy and grant, which&nbsp;is provided according to socio-economic needs.&nbsp; And, in this case, targeted assistance can be delivered to those who need it most.&nbsp; It will encourage and enhance their resilience for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will revamp the childcare subsidy scheme to make it more attractive for the lower and middle income non-working spouses who are staying at home to care for their children to join the workforce.&nbsp; It&nbsp;will&nbsp;increase their total household income and over time enhance their resilience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point regarding family.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the middle income group has been offered 20% tax rebate and that has been tilted towards the lower middle income group (those who are earning less than $150,000 per year).&nbsp; But this is for the individual.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the Government can consider the breadwinner, the family man who has to support the children as well as elderly parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been calls in this House to review the child relief as&nbsp;well as the enhanced child relief scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The relief for children was last revised in 1998.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was raised from $1,500 to $2,000 for the first to the fourth&nbsp;child.&nbsp; It has been 10 years now.&nbsp; With rising costs and&nbsp;inflation, I hope the Government can revisit the child relief scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 956 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, the relief for the elderly was last revised in 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was raised from $4,500 to $5,000 for children who support elderly parents living with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;For parents who are not staying with their children, the tax relief remained at $3,500.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to increase both the children and parents&nbsp;tax relief to affirm the importance of the family in the Singapore society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have raised the issue on home-makers which I&nbsp;had&nbsp;raised it in 2007.&nbsp; The&nbsp;"stay-at-home spouse"&nbsp;could&nbsp;be&nbsp;"mum",&nbsp;and in some case&nbsp;"dad".&nbsp;&nbsp;Their contributions to the family must be recognised and appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are team mates working in the paddock of an F-1 race.&nbsp; So they are unsung heroes.&nbsp; However, they are also&nbsp;a very vulnerable group.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;the ones who will be most affected&nbsp;in the event of a family discord or divorce.&nbsp; They receive no pay, no CPF, and no Medisave.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Government to&nbsp;review the current policies and propose measures to provide for the future of the home-makers.&nbsp;&nbsp;If left alone, they will be the ones who are left out in the CPF LIFE scheme.

Mind you, that was 2006 figure; the 2007 figure, I am sure, would be&nbsp;higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the&nbsp;MTI <I>Economic Survey</I> in 2007,&nbsp;overall labour productivity fell by 0.9%, down from the 1.5% gain in 2006.&nbsp; And in the last quarter of last year,&nbsp;overall labour productivity fell even at a more alarming rate at 3.7%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity in business continued to fall, posting a 5.0% decline in 2007;&nbsp; in manufacturing sector, declining by 3.2% in 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;If our productivity is dropping, then the question we need to ask is:&nbsp;&nbsp;what is supporting the economic expansion?&nbsp; Is the economic expansion&nbsp;possible because of&nbsp;increase in foreign labour?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we continue with the over-reliance on foreign workforce to secure good economic growth in the future for Singapore?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 958 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would urge the Government to take a look again at our productivity.&nbsp; To look at means and measures on how we can raise our productivity to propel&nbsp;our economic growth instead of relying on foreign labour.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the proposed incentives to spur R&amp;D and innovation may increase productivity,&nbsp;I hope the Government can devise measures and&nbsp;to encourage and reward increase in&nbsp;productivity in the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The levy on skill re-training seems to me like running contrary to this productivity drive.&nbsp; Currently, only for workers who are earning less than $2,000, the employers need to pay a skill re-training levy of&nbsp;1% of their gross salary, which means that employers spend $20 per worker if the salary is $2,000.&nbsp; And there is some motivation for the employers now to want to train the workers so that they can raise the salary to above $2,000,&nbsp;of course, provided productivity increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, the employers need not pay the levy on skill retraining after that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the revision of the upper ceiling now from $2,000 to $4,500, I am afraid that&nbsp;will only&nbsp;discourage employers from sending&nbsp;their employees to retraining.&nbsp; So I hope that the Government take&nbsp;a look at it and provide some other incentives so that re-training is possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened to see that the Government is topping up the Life-long Learning Fund&nbsp;to encourage life-long learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a right step towards a resilient nation, a resilient community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed subsidy for part-time degree programmes at the three publicly-funded universities and the UniSIM for Singaporeans who had not previously benefited from a Government-subsidised undergraduate education is a boost for diploma holders who wish to upgrade to a degree.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 959</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have&nbsp;received an email from one&nbsp;of my residents asking me to put forward this request in Parliament, one of which I have brought up before.&nbsp; Can the Government allow the use of individual CPF to pay for their part-time degree courses?&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, can the 40% tax relief on school fees of part-time degree courses at&nbsp;approved universities be transferred to the parents or elder siblings who are actually paying and&nbsp;supporting their school fees?&nbsp;&nbsp;And I like his ending statement in his email to me.&nbsp; I quote:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"With the influx of foreign workers into our country, we have to ensure that the sons and daughters of our own land be among the top 50th percentile in earnings of our workforce.&nbsp; We are not asking to be the top,&nbsp;but we should not be at the bottom."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not here pushing for a <I>bumiputra</I> policy in Singapore, but I think it is worthwhile to re-look at how our Singaporean workers can gain&nbsp;more from the re-training.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last point which I would like to touch on is on climate change.&nbsp; With the increase in oil price hitting a three-digit level now, there will be increase in energy costs and I do not think the costs will come down further.&nbsp; It augurs well for Singapore and it makes sense for us to save energy.&nbsp; And the Government had articulated the importance of tackling climate change during the ASEAN meeting last year. Likewise, the same message was echoed at the Bali meeting that we need to speed up the&nbsp;efforts on tackling climate change and there is an urgent need to do so, although we recognise that being a little red dot, even as we stop producing any CO2, we are unlikely going to change the direction of climate change.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I think the green revolution can start from the little red dot.&nbsp; I hope the Government, through its&nbsp;fiscal policy, can initiate some changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the <p align=left>Column: 960 </p>reduction in supplementary tax for diesel-powered passenger car which meets the stringent Euro IV emission standards, the Budget is truly silent on the issue of climate change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest something simple, which is for the Government to consider&nbsp;introducing a green car COE&nbsp;category and that amount can come from the current COE amount.&nbsp; I am not asking the Government to put more cars onto the road now.&nbsp; It does not need any further Government funding but with green car COE, the market will decide and over time the number of green cars on the road will increase.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our nation progresses and we achieve happiness and prosperity, we should be more resilient.&nbsp; There should be less and less need for social schemes, such as Workfare Income Supplement, ComCare, Medifund, Eldercare fund, etc,&nbsp;and many of&nbsp;the funds that were quoted by Mayor of North-East CDC, CPR, etc.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;ponder,&nbsp;now that&nbsp;we have more and more of these programmes, are we truly progressing?&nbsp; Are we&nbsp;truly resilient as we introduce more of these programmes?&nbsp; I understand that we definitely need them now.&nbsp; But I would still again urge Members of&nbsp;this House as well as the Government to ponder over what more we can do now so that the need for social programmes can be reduced in the future.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Similar phenomenon was seen in Singapore as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I told the resident, at the end of the day,&nbsp;the key question for this House is how do we look forward.&nbsp; When the family breadwinner came back and said, "I strike the lottery", you should&nbsp;not, in the first place,&nbsp;be asking, "Why did you strike the lottery?"&nbsp; You should be asking, "How are we going to use the lottery money?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you going to say, "Let's go to a&nbsp;restaurant.&nbsp; Let's go and have a holiday and splurge it all."?&nbsp; Or are you going to put some of this money now to buy insurance for your child, to make sure that education is provided for, or to put some into medical insurance as well to<p align=left>Column: 962 </p> make sure that medical needs are taken care of? I think we should not miss the point.&nbsp; The real issue now is what we can&nbsp;do now to make sure that there will be less and less need for all these social welfare programmes in the future.&nbsp; Look forward and not look backward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take&nbsp;a break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 1.35 pm.<p>&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: right" align="right">&nbsp;</p><p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: right" align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></p><p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: right" align="right"><i>1.05 pm</i> <i>until</i> <I>1.35 pm.</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><I>Sitting resumed at 1.35 pm</I></p><p align=left>Column: 962<p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</B></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES--><!--END_COL_TITLE:TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES:::962--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>TIME LIMIT FOR SPEECHES<BR></B></span><div><BR>								<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Suspension of Standing Orders--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>(Suspension of Standing Orders)<BR></B></span><div><BR>			 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the consent of Mr Speaker and the general assent of Members present, Question put and agreed to.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the proceedings on the item under discussion be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 48(8) in respect of the reply to be made by&nbsp;the Minister for Finance.&nbsp;&ndash; [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:BUDGET-->      					<!--TITLE_NAME:DEBATE ON ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT--><p align=left>Column: 962<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:DEBATE ON ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT:::1000-->											 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align="center"><strong>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Finance (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all Members who have spoken and supported the Budget.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will address the main issues of the Budget Debate in this round up speech. Members had also raised many specific questions related to the programmes of <p align=left>Column: 963 </p>the various Ministries which will be addressed at the Committee of Supply sessions.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is about our future.&nbsp; It will develop our people and our enterprises - the key drivers of Singapore's long term competitiveness.&nbsp; It will create sustainable advantages for Singapore, through advanced education and training of our people and by spreading the practice of innovation across our economy.&nbsp; Ultimately, as Members have pointed out, growth must translate into a better life for Singaporeans.&nbsp; This Budget therefore is also about creating a stronger and more resilient community, one where every Singaporean has the best opportunity to move ahead, and where we help those most in need to keep up with the rest.&nbsp; It is about ensuring that as we grow, we will leave no one behind.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The debate has thrown up issues that can be summarised in three broad questions:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Is the Government taking too much and giving back too little?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Are we doing the right things to sustain competitiveness?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Are we doing the right things to help Singaporeans in need?</p><p><br><I>&nbsp;Finding the right balance&nbsp;&ndash; basic considerations behind the Budget</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I address these questions, I would like to explain the three key considerations that have shaped this year's Budget:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, what should our overall balance be this year? Should our fiscal stance be expansionary, contractionary or neutral?&nbsp; We have gone for a small overall deficit this year.&nbsp; It is in fact a neutral position in <p align=left>Column: 964 </p>terms of the impact of the Budget on the economy. If we exclude the Net Investment Income Contribution and our transfers to the endowment funds, which are items that have no immediate effect on the domestic economy, the expected budgetary balance is close to zero.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an appropriate fiscal stance because we expect Singapore to see healthy economic growth of 4% to 6% this year. Singapore and Asia&rsquo;s fundamentals remain strong. Positive trends on the domestic front, such as a strong pipeline of manufacturing investments and construction projects will also keep the economy going. Our unemployment is at record low, and many jobs go unfilled.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we had an overheated economy, we should be going for a significant Government surplus this year. However the economy is not overheated, although specific segments of the economy, especially in the office space market, have been facing shortages and rapidly rising rentals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we were headed for a recession this year, we should be going for a larger deficit. On current indications, this is unlikely to be the case.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second consideration is&nbsp;&ndash; what should be the balance between measures aimed at short-term relief for rising costs and long-term competitiveness?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget goes for a balance between providing short-term benefits to Singaporeans and building up capabilities for longer term competitiveness and social resilience.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, Singaporeans will receive $2 billion worth of short-term benefits (comprising Growth Dividends, Personal Income Tax rebates and the GST offsets that were announced last year but continue to run this year). But we will also <p align=left>Column: 965 </p>provide a roughly equal amount&nbsp;&ndash; $2.2 billion&nbsp;&ndash; to build up longer term capabilities and help Singaporeans with future financial security (comprising the PSEA top-ups, CPF Bonuses, Medisave top-ups and tax incentives for businesses[1]).</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%"><p>[1] This includes the Fixtures and Fittings Allowance, the R&amp;D tax allowance, further tax deduction for R&amp;D and R&amp;D Incentive for Start-up Enterprises (RISE).</p><BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of this, we are putting aside $2.4 billion in the endowment funds and the National Research Fund to cater to longer term needs.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the balance we have struck between meeting short term needs and keeping our eye focused on the much larger challenges that we face over the longer term&nbsp;&ndash; sustaining our economic competitiveness and our social compact.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third consideration is, what is the right balance between benefits to households and businesses?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this Budget, we have provided more significant benefits to households. We know they are facing a challenge in the near term with the rising cost of living.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By providing direct assistance now, we are preventing a spiral of wages and prices from developing, which will affect competitiveness and growth. It is in the interests of businesses that we do so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we are also providing further incentives for businesses on top of last year&rsquo;s major moves.&nbsp; We made significant permanent cuts in corporate taxes for businesses last year, which they will start benefiting from this year in terms of significantly lower tax bills. Large companies and small.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not possible to do more for both the short term and the long term, and to give more to both households and businesses. If we did this, it would mean running a larger deficit, in other words an<p align=left>Column: 966 </p> expansionary budget at a time when the economy is not in recession, when unemployment is very low and where costs are still rising. Doing so would only over-stimulate the economy, precisely what some Members have accused the Government of doing.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A balance has to be struck. This is how the Budget has been shaped&nbsp;&ndash; to strike the best balance between competing needs, and doing what is best for Singapore, not just for one or two years, but for many years. We have put something aside for the future.&nbsp; Or as Dr Ong Seh Hong said, &ldquo;putting aside grain for times of scarcity&rdquo;.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, therefore, this Budget aims to provide the right balance for an economy which continues to enjoy good growth, but is exposed to significant global uncertainty in the year ahead.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While inflation is causing immediate concerns, because it erodes spending power, this is not a crisis. People have jobs. Our surplus sharing must be seen in this context. We are not in a crisis.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the global economic outlook is less certain this year. The financial markets in US and Europe have been affected by the problem of sub-prime loans, now in fact a broader credit crunch, and there are worries of a recession in the US.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have retained the flexibility of being able to respond if the economy takes a significant turn for the worse, which we do not presently expect.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now address the key questions that have been brought up in the debate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><I>Is the Government taking too much?</I></p><p><br><I>Reasons for the surplus</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many MPs have questioned the exceptionally large underestimate of last<p align=left>Column:967 </p> year&rsquo;s revenues.&nbsp; Were we too conservative?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our basic approach in the Budget is to use the best information available at the time. This is what we did last year, when we estimated at the start of the year that GDP growth for 2007 would be 4.5% to 6.5%. This was also in line with private sector forecasts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, for the property market which accounted for over $3.5 billion extra revenues beyond what we had projected. I will go into some detail on stamp duties because several Members had raised the issue of why our stamp duties turned out to be grossly underestimated and also because it was the largest swing factor in last year&rsquo;s Budget.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Chart 1*] Mr Gautam Banerjee asked why we had expected stamp duty collections in 2007 to be lower than 2006. At the time of the Budget in February last year, we had estimated 2006 stamp duties to total $1.5 billion. On the basis of information we had, we projected the same level of stamp duties in 2007.&nbsp; This was because 2006 was itself already an exceptional year.&nbsp; In fact, the subsequent data for Fiscal Year 2006 based on actual collections for January to March (the data comes out after our Budget), which increased sharply, took the total stamp duty collections to $2 billion, more than the $1.5 billion estimated at the time of Budget.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we had assumed further price increases in 2007 for the property market, just as the private forecasters did, no one anticipated the surge in volumes of transactions that took place.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1103-1104.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was also considerable uncertainty at the time of last year&rsquo;s Budget as to the extent to which the pick up that was taking place<p align=left>Column: 968 </p> at the luxury end of the market would spread to the rest of the property market.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our stamp duties projections for 2007 were nevertheless significantly above historical collections&nbsp;&ndash; more than double that of 2005.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even then we were wrong; stamp duties significantly exceeded expectations, especially because of the surge in transaction volumes.&nbsp; But should we have based the Budget last year on optimism that was unsubstantiated at the time?&nbsp; And should we now for this year&rsquo;s Budget be optimistically assuming the same volume of transactions as last year?&nbsp; I think it would be quite imprudent for us to do so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree fully with all the Members who urged us to improve our budget marksmanship.&nbsp; I can assure Members that we do not set 'soft targets' for ourselves, just so we can exceed them.&nbsp; In fact, over the past 10 years (FY1998 to FY2007), we have over-projected revenues for six years and under-projected revenues for four years.&nbsp; Last year, we under-projected.&nbsp; But we are not inveterate conservatives in fiscal forecasting.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, forecasting will remain inherently imprecise, especially because we are a city economy that is fully exposed to the swings in global economy and the vagaries of our own asset markets.&nbsp; So, as Dr Loo Choon Yong cautioned, we cannot expect too much prescience in the budget planning process.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hong Kong too faces this challenge.&nbsp; It now expects to run a fiscal surplus exceeding HK$116 billion (S$21 billion) for last year, compared to an originally projected surplus of HK$25.4 billion.&nbsp; Just to put this in perspective, they started the year expecting a surplus of 1.6% of GDP and they ended with a revised figure of 7.2%&nbsp;&ndash; in other words, they exceeded<p align=left>Column: 969 </p> their original estimate by 5.6% of GDP.&nbsp; This is just like in our case, where the final budget outturn exceeded the original estimate by 3% of GDP.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should add that the Government is not alone in finding economic forecasting a challenge.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim cited Citigroup&rsquo;s comments about the mistakes we had made in budgetary estimates last year. But Citigroup&rsquo;s own projections of GDP growth at the time of the Budget last year were in fact the same as ours&nbsp;&ndash; 5.6%, which was midway between the Government&rsquo;s forecast of 4.5% to 6.5%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some private forecasters did expect more rapid growth for last year, while others were more conservative.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the difference between Government and private forecasting of the economy is that we have to set out our plans for the whole country on the basis of our forecasts.&nbsp; This is why we have to try to use the most realistic assumptions when we set out our plans, rather than use the most optimistic assumptions, in the hope that they will come true.&nbsp; I am sure most Members would agree that this is the prudent and sensible thing to do.</p><p><br><I>&nbsp;Should we have raised the GST?</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of you including Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Mr Gautam Banerjee, Ms Eunice Olsen and Ms Sylvia Lim concluded from last year&rsquo;s large surplus that we made a mistake in raising GST.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim in particular said that we raised GST without compelling reasons, and that we could instead have relied on other revenues to fund our expenditures.&nbsp; Let me explain why this would have been the wrong approach.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, GST was not a revenue raising measure for 2007.&nbsp; GST was raised so that we could introduce the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), a permanent<p align=left>Column: 970 </p> scheme, not just one-off, to help lower income Singaporeans.&nbsp; The GST increase also enabled us to reduce the Corporate Income Tax rate significantly &ndash; by 2% points to 18%. Further, the GST increase was essential for putting in place a stronger revenue structure to fund the increased expenditures that we decided we have to undertake in the next five years and beyond.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These include substantially increased healthcare expenditures and investments in continuing education and training.&nbsp; But it was not just our social expenditures that we were expanding, and which are being primarily funded by our GST, but much beyond that:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp; Infrastructural investments&nbsp;&ndash; the next eight years of spending in this area will be three times more than the past five years;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; R&amp;D;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; Housing rejuvenation;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp; Refreshing our downtown; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v)&nbsp; And further reductions in income taxes to stay competitive, should they become necessary.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our GST increase, together with the planned revisions in the rules for drawing on Net Investment Income, will provide the revenues for us to make these investments in our future.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, for 2007 itself, the GST increase was revenue neutral and had no impact on our surplus position.&nbsp; Total collection from the additional 2% GST amounted to around $1.4 billion.&nbsp; This was in fact equal to the GST offsets plus the WIS which we paid out in FY2007 alone (this is not counting future years of GST offsets and WIS).</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 971 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, by introducing the GST increase at a time when economic growth is healthy and our revenue position still strong, we were able to fully offset its impact on the cost of living for most Singaporeans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, lower and middle income Singaporeans have received significant net benefits as a result of the GST increase last year.&nbsp; This is because they pay only a small portion of the GST, but receive the bulk of the GST offsets.&nbsp; The bottom 20% of resident households paid only 5% of the total GST collected.&nbsp; The next 20% (in other words, from the 20th to the 40th percentiles) paid 7%, and the subsequent 20% (in other words, from the 40th to the 60th percentiles) paid 10%.&nbsp; Adding up, this means that the bottom 60% of all resident households contributed less than 25% of total GST collected.&nbsp; This is because upper income Singaporeans, as well as tourists and foreigners, account for the bulk of our GST collections.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us now look at what Singaporean households are getting back.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Chart 2*]&nbsp; The chart plots the additional GST paid by each of the household quintiles (in dollar terms) against what they have received in FY07 from the GST Offset package and WIS.&nbsp; As you can see, households in the bottom 60% are getting back much more in terms of offsets than additional GST paid.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the bottom 20% especially, it is quite significant.&nbsp; In 2007 alone, the GST offset package plus WIS is five times more than the GST they paid.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, given that the GST increase was an essential part of our strategy for funding future expenditures, it would have been quite unwise for us to wait until we have run out of revenues before raising the GST.</p><p><br> <p align=left>Column: 972 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last thing we should do is to wait until there is an economic downturn, households are facing financial difficulties, and the Government is facing declining revenues before we raise the GST, because then we would be unable to provide a full offset for Singaporeans.&nbsp; We should never try to game this &ndash; to wait until the last minute to raise revenues, or to roll back the GST increase now because we had a good year of surpluses, in the hope that we can raise it again later&nbsp;&ndash; as suggested by both Mr Gautam Banerjee and Dr Loo Choon Yong.&nbsp; We could do that if Singaporeans were simply shareholders in Singapore Inc.&nbsp; But they are citizens, and the Government&rsquo;s job is to anticipate their future needs, put in place the finances that allow us to meet these needs and help Singaporeans with the changes that are necessary by providing them offsets to help them adjust.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internationally, too, the trend continues, of moving away from direct taxes on income to indirect taxes on consumption.&nbsp; Even in Hong Kong, which today enjoys very strong revenues, professionals and the serious money know that the GST would eventually be necessary in order to sustain their revenues and make the investments they need for the future.&nbsp; Hong Kong&rsquo;s strong surpluses today are largely due to buoyant stamp duty and land sales collections.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Hong Kong Financial Secretary stated in his Budget Speech this morning, &ldquo;revenues from land premium and stamp duties together will account for about one-third of total government revenue for 2007-08.&nbsp; This is the highest contribution that these relatively less stable revenue sources have made to total government income since 1997&ndash;98.&rdquo;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up, we made the right decision to raise the GST last year and put in place a strong and stable revenue position for the future.&nbsp; We introduced it<p align=left>Column: 973 </p> at a time of good economic growth, although no one expected growth to be as strong as it eventually was.&nbsp; Doing so allowed us to provide substantial offsets to lower- and middle-income Singaporeans, and to put in place the WIS as a long-term programme of income support for our low-wage workers.&nbsp; The 2% increase in GST also did not contribute to the fiscal surplus in 2007.</p><p><br><I>Is Government giving back too little?</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now examine the question of whether the Government is giving back too little.</p><p><br><I>Transfers are too small compared to our surplus</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Seng Han Thong said that the amounts we are giving out this year are significant.&nbsp; However, several MPs referred to feedback that this year&rsquo;s surplus sharing package (at $1.8 billion) is small compared to our surplus of $6.4 billion last year.&nbsp; Could we not have afforded to give more, for example, through S&amp;CC rebates and property tax rebates, as Mr Inderjit Singh suggested?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to clarify, the special benefits that we are providing to households through this year&rsquo;s Budget amount to $2.8 billion.&nbsp; This is because, in addition to the $1.8 billion that comprises this year&rsquo;s surplus sharing package, we will in fact be giving $1 billion of benefits that were previously announced as part of the GST Offset Package.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, it is useful to put in perspective the $6.4 billion estimated surplus for 2007.&nbsp; It is, in fact, not large by historical standards, relative to the size of the economy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Chart 3*]&nbsp; The surplus is a turnaround from the deficits we have been running in recent years.&nbsp; But at 2.7% of GDP, it is in fact not large<p align=left>Column: 974 </p> compared to the budget surpluses we were running in the 1990s.&nbsp; There is no assurance that we will continue to run significant surpluses and we do not expect to.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why, while we have provided a substantial package of benefits in the $2.8 billion that we are providing to households this year, we are also setting aside resources for the endowment funds that are dedicated to the long-term social expenditures that are necessary for Singapore and for R&amp;D.&nbsp; By doing so, we are ensuring that long-term needs such as Medifund, Eldercare and continuing education obtain a secure stream of funding, independent of the ups and downs of the economic cycle.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In total, therefore, when we take into account the amounts set aside for endowment fund top-ups as well as for surplus sharing, we will be spending $5.4 billion. This is a large sum we are putting aside to meet the needs of Singaporeans, both for the immediate term as well as for the future.</p><p><br>&nbsp;<I>Are we doing the right things to sustain competitiveness?</I></p><p><br><I>&nbsp;Rising business costs</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many MPs, including Mr Inderjit Singh, Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Gautam Banerjee, Mr Michael Palmer, Ms Penny Low and Mr Edwin Khew have spoken up for local businesses and SMEs.&nbsp; They were concerned that this Budget has not done enough for them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local costs are rising because the economy is doing well and there is increased competition for resources, especially labour and industrial and office space.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh attributed this to what he said was the Government's 'grow-at-all-costs' policy, which he says<p align=left>Column: 975 </p> had overheated the economy and has been the cause of our inflation in business costs and prices of consumer goods, including even food.&nbsp; In other words, the problems faced by businesses and households are the result of a flawed growth policy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It made for very entertaining listening, but it was in fact Inderjit's analysis that is flawed. The Government has not pursued a 'grow-at-all-costs' policy as Mr Inderjit Singh suggested.&nbsp; We &lsquo;went for growth&rsquo; not by over-stimulating the economy with fiscal spending (because our budgets have been fairly balanced, and indeed in surplus last year as some Members have complained), but by making Singapore more competitive by building up our capabilities, keeping taxes competitive and investing in infrastructure.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our whole approach has been to enable our people and businesses, as both Ms Lee Bee Wah and Mrs Josephine Teo have pointed out, so that we can take advantage of opportunities for growth when external conditions are good.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why, for example, we cut corporate taxes last year, which Mr Inderjit Singh in fact strongly supported&nbsp;&ndash; although we did not cut Personal Income Taxes, which he had called for and continues to call for now.&nbsp; We wanted to provide the best conditions for our enterprises to seize opportunities and grow, not just for one or two years, but over the long term.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that growth will be volatile&nbsp;&ndash; strong in some years and weak or even recessionary in other years. We cannot avoid these cycles because it is part and parcel of being a global city.&nbsp; But we have to take advantage of the opportunities when external conditions are favourable so that the good years can offset the down years when the global cycle turns.<p align=left>Column: 976 </p>This is how we assure Singapore of healthy long-term growth through good years and bad.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our economy has grown at an average 5% over the past 10 years.&nbsp; But this is only because we grew rapidly in the last four years, by close to 8% on average.&nbsp; If we had not had this strong growth in recent years, we would not have made up for the very weak growth in earlier years and would in fact have performed below the economy's potential over the last 10 years.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another reason why we should be prepared to take the opportunities when they come.&nbsp; The significant opportunities come in cycles&nbsp;&ndash; chemical crackers, once every seven to eight years.&nbsp; When they are ready to invest, and we say no, they go elsewhere.&nbsp; If we miss them, we miss the whole cycle.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And we lose not just one investment.&nbsp; We lose the whole cluster&nbsp;&ndash; the critical mass necessary for the industry to be in Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could have rejected leading manufacturing investors or turned away financial sector players when they wanted to expand in Singapore, in the name of avoiding rapid growth.&nbsp; Would Singapore today have been better off if we had done so?&nbsp; Would food be more affordable? I am sure most Members would agree that Singaporeans would be worse off today if we had adopted that path.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh had in fact claimed that our growth policies had led to lower-income Singaporeans being worse off.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is plainly wrong.&nbsp; It is precisely the rapid growth that we have seen in the last few years that has turned things around for our low-income households and allowed them to enjoy positive growth in real incomes after the very difficult period<p align=left>Column: 977 </p> they went through in the earlier part of this decade.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last two years, our strong economic growth has increased the number of employed persons amongst lower-income households.&nbsp; And as Ms Cham Hui Fong pointed out, 2007 was also a good year for low-wage workers because we had the lowest retrenchments since 1994.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why the bottom 20% of (non-retiree) households saw their incomes grow by 5% in 2007 in real terms (over 7% in nominal terms).</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is before taking into account the substantial Government transfers to the lower-income group which has further boosted their incomes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our SMEs too have been better off because Singapore has grown well in the last few years.&nbsp; Many of them are involved in the domestic market rather than exports and their businesses have picked up because of the strong growth in Singaporeans' incomes.&nbsp; Costs are higher, but so is the overall demand for goods and services.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach, therefore, is to provide the conditions for Singaporeans and our companies to succeed and to grow over the long term.&nbsp; We will help our companies to move up the value chain so that they are more competitive in a higher cost environment, and help our people to acquire the skills and competencies they need to earn a good living.&nbsp; In the short term, however, we address the bottlenecks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key constraints that we face today are that of labour and space.&nbsp; To ease pressures on the tight labour market which MPs like Ms Penny Low and Ms Lee Bee Wah have asked about, the Government has allowed more flexible access to foreign manpower:</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 978 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp; MOM has increased the quota for mid-skilled foreign manpower (S pass holders) from 15% to 25% in January 2008.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; The Dependency Ratios (the number of foreign workers companies can hire for every local worker) have been raised for the manufacturing, services, construction, process and marine sectors from January this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Office space, on the other hand, has seen a serious shortage&nbsp;&ndash; much of it due to the rapid expansion in the financial sector in 2007, when it grew by 17%.&nbsp; Businesses have found rapid rises in rentals unsettling.&nbsp; I have set out in the Budget the measures the Government is taking to address the temporary shortages in office space until the large supply of new office space comes on-stream in 2010.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Industrial rentals too have risen significantly.&nbsp; Since the resumption of the industrial Government Land Sales programme in 2003, MTI has been putting out an orderly release of industrial land, which will result in a significant supply coming on-stream in the next year or so. This will be close to twice the quantum of industrial space added in the last two years, and is expected to ease tight occupancy rates and relieve pressure on rentals.</p><p><br><I>&nbsp;Land sales policy</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that the Government was responsible for driving up property prices because we have had a land sales policy that has sought to time the release of land to get the best price for Government, instead of providing a steady long-term release of land.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our land sales policy has been a responsible one that is market-led.&nbsp; We ensure that enough supply is made <p align=left>Column: 979 </p>available to meet basic demand through the Confirmed List, and let the market decide whether it wants to develop more sites through the Reserve List. No one anticipated the strong surge in demand for office space in the last two years coming right after the 2002-2004 period, when market conditions were very weak.&nbsp; In fact, some owners were converting their office space to other uses then [2].</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%"><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><font size="2">[2] Between 2001 and 2004, there was a net conversion of around 120,000 sq m of office space to other uses.</font></p><BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh said that the Marina Bay Business and Financial Centre (BFC) could have been released for development two years earlier.&nbsp; I think everyone in town would like to take this view with the benefit of hindsight.&nbsp; But let me remind Members that when the Government was actively planning the sale of the BFC site in 2003, the feedback from the industry was very negative. Nevertheless, the Government went ahead to make the site available for sale on the Reserve List in 2004.&nbsp; The site was eventually sold in 2005, after much marketing.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh and Ms Jessica Tan also suggested that we give rebates to businesses to address their short-term cost pressures.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had indeed done so back in the past, such as 1999, 2001 and 2002.&nbsp; That was however in response to economic downturns rather than problems caused by strong economic growth. Businesses then were suffering because of weak demand rather than rising costs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today's situation is very different.&nbsp; The economy is expanding.&nbsp; Providing rebates would not solve the imbalance of supply and demand, which is the source of the problem. In fact, it might even accentuate the problem.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an environment of strong demand for rental space, it is quite possible that <p align=left>Column: 980 </p>the outcome of Government giving tax rebates on rental costs will drive prices up further, because it would stimulate demand for rental space without adding to the supply of space.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real solution is to relieve the bottleneck in supply, which is what the Government has been seeking to do.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI will also be addressing the issue of rising business costs and supply constraints at their COS.</p><p><br><I>Providing an attractive tax environment</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to ensure that Singapore remains the best place for businesses to start, grow and mature. We have provided an attractive tax regime for all our companies, having made decisive moves in last year's Budget when we reduced the Corporate Income Tax rate from 20% to 18%, and enhanced the Partial Tax Exemption scheme to benefit SMEs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's further tax moves to promote productivity and innovation will complement the reduction in headline rates that we announced last year.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) The Fixture and Fittings Allowance together with the R&amp;D incentives will cost us a total of $380 million every year.&nbsp; Of this, about $150 million will go to SMEs&nbsp;&ndash; much more than Mr Inderjit Singh's estimate of about $50 million. This is on top of the $160 million that SMEs will benefit from the Corporate Income Tax rate cut and partial tax exemption changes that were announced last year, which will take effect this year. So that makes a total of $310 million for SMEs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Chart 4*] These incentives will make Singapore one of the most compelling locations for companies to start, grow their companies and engage in R&amp;D activities.&nbsp; A company with about a million dollars of profits&nbsp;&ndash; in other words,<p align=left>Column: 981 </p> still an SME&nbsp;&ndash; and which spends 1.5% of its turnover on R&amp;D in Singapore would have an effective tax rate of about 6%.&nbsp; This is comparable to that in Ireland despite their much lower headline tax rates, and much lower than that in Hong Kong.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is our focus&nbsp;&ndash; we will provide a conducive and attractive tax environment for companies to build sustainable competitive advantages through innovation.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1105-1106.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But it will take time.&nbsp; As Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Ong Kian Min, Dr Amy Khor and Ms Denise Phua have pointed out, we will have to nurture an entire culture of innovation, especially among our smaller companies.&nbsp; There is a lot of work ahead in spreading the message amongst all our companies and helping them to take advantage of the incentives we have provided.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not have to be in the high-tech sector.&nbsp; Mr Gautam Banerjee had asked about this.

Workers who attend re-training continue to receive subsidies of up to 80% of course fees (for older workers, 90%).&nbsp; This is regardless of whether they attend courses by themselves or are sent by their companies.&nbsp; This year, the Government has made it easier for individuals to obtain tax relief for the cost of re-training and has also agreed to fund up to 40% for part-time degree programmes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ILA concept is an interesting one which we will study.

Many&nbsp;Members such as Dr Teo Ho Pin, Ms Ellen Lee, Mr Ong Ah Heng, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Mr Zainudin Nordin, Ms Indranee Rajah and Dr Mohd Maliki Osman spoke passionately about the less privileged groups, particularly:</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Lower-income groups who are fearful that the growth in their wages will not keep pace with inflation;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) The sandwiched middle class who often have dependents, both young and elderly; and</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) The elderly retired and the disabled, who have no regular source of income.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that we should be concerned about each of these groups. Our whole approach has been designed to help these Singaporeans in a sustainable way.</p><p><br><I>Increases in the headline inflation rate</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have all seen the latest January CPI numbers, which show inflation at 6.6% compared to January<p align=left>Column: 985 </p> 2007.&nbsp; MTI has explained the reasons for this increase, which largely have to do with the unusually low level of prices in January last year.&nbsp; (In particular, there were one-off factors such as the S&amp;CC rebate that was given in January last year, but not in January this year.&nbsp; The schedule for S&amp;CC rebates has been changed so that the rebate was given in December 2007 instead.&nbsp; Fuel prices were also at a two-and-a-half year low in January last year).</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's forecast of inflation remains at 4.5% to 5.5% this year.&nbsp; As I mentioned in the Budget Speech, we expect inflation in the first half of the year to be higher before declining in the second half of the year, due to the wearing off of one-off factors such as the GST increase.</p><p><br><I>Helping households</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained in the Budget Speech, however, we cannot avoid global inflation, but we are mitigating its effects.&nbsp; Our efforts to diversify our food sources and our policy on the Singapore dollar exchange rate have helped mitigate the effects of inflation.&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Liang Eng Hwa have supported this move to diversify our food sources to build resilience of our food supply and encourage competition among suppliers.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also helping Singaporeans directly.&nbsp; First, by helping them own their homes, which provide a large hedge against inflation.&nbsp; This is why, as we have explained before, although the revision in the Annual Value of homes has raised the CPI number, it has no impact on most Singaporeans.&nbsp; The 95% of Singaporeans who own their homes are not affected by inflation in the rental market, which is especially worrisome if you are a retiree household.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the AV revision simply recognises the fact that HDB flats have<p align=left>Column: 986 </p> become more valuable.&nbsp; It does not mean that homeowners are worse off.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, by helping needy Singaporeans directly.&nbsp; Because we had a large surplus last year, we have been able to provide a substantial package of benefits directly to Singapore households.&nbsp; It will in fact exceed the cost of living increases that most lower and middle-income households will experience.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Chart 5*] I will show three examples that describe typical households.&nbsp; The first example shows a 2-room HDB household comprising a retiree elderly couple.&nbsp; The total amount that 2-room retiree households spent last year would have been about $980 per month on average, or $11,900 per year. This year, their total spending could go up by about $650 for the year because of inflation (this assumes the top end of the forecasted inflation range of 4.5% to 5.5%).&nbsp; However, they will get around $3,100 in benefits from this year's surplus sharing package and the GST offsets that they continue to get&nbsp;&ndash; more than four times their increase in cost of living.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is a typical 4-room household&nbsp;&ndash; a couple with two children, one in secondary school and the other in Polytechnic. Their total increase in expenditure due to inflation in 2008 is about $2,200, and they will receive around $4,100 in benefits from the 2008 transfers&nbsp;&ndash; almost twice their cost of living increase.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third example is a 5-room household&nbsp;&ndash; a family with two children (one in primary and one in secondary school) and one grandparent. Their total expenditure arising from inflation in 2008 is about $3,100, and they will receive around $4,400 in benefits from the 2008 transfers&nbsp;&ndash; more than their cost of living increase.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 987 </p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These illustrations, I have to emphasise, are before taking into account the increased wages that working households would experience in a growing economy.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's package of measures has therefore helped to offset the impact of higher prices on most households. This will have to be taken into account by the National Wages Council (NWC) when it considers its recommendations later this year.&nbsp; It will not be in the interest of either businesses or households if we end up with a spiral of wages and inflation chasing each other.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inflation resulting from higher food and energy prices means we are indeed seeing some impact on the living standards of consumers, and on the profit margins of companies.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as Dr Lim Wee Kiak pointed out, the only real solution is to raise our productivity.&nbsp; Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also said that the only lasting way to help low-income Singaporeans cope with rising costs is to improve their employment prospects through training. If we try to remedy the problem caused by inflation by pushing up wages to catch up, or by companies pushing up prices to maintain profits, we will end up chasing our tail.&nbsp; The only reliable and sustainable way to address this problem is for both workers and companies to improve productivity, so as to justify a higher standard of living for ourselves.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to other suggestions from Members on how we could mitigate the impact of inflation.</p><p><br><I>&nbsp;Zero-rating GST on essentials</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh and Ms Sylvia Lim had asked if we could exempt GST on certain essential items to help the lower-<p align=left>Column: 988 </p>income group.&nbsp; I had explained fully in last year's Budget Debate why this is not a good idea, especially not for lower-income Singaporeans. It is still not a good idea today.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument to zero rate essentials has always had great emotional appeal.&nbsp; As Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out, lower- income groups spend a higher percentage of their incomes on essentials compared to&nbsp;the higher-income groups.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons why exempting essentials from GST is not an effective way of helping the lower-income groups:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) First, most of the GST revenue collected on essentials comes from the higher income households and foreigners.&nbsp; They contribute the bulk of GST on essentials, just as they do for all other types of expenditure.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) Second, the bulk of consumption by the lower income is not on essential items, but on other items.&nbsp; As I showed in the Budget Debate last year, the eight most commonly cited essential items make up only 5% of the expenditures of the bottom 20% of households.&nbsp; Even if we take all uncooked food into account, it is only one-eighth of the expenditures of a typical household in the bottom 20% of the income ladder.&nbsp; And if we add their spending on public transport and utilities, the total comes to around one-quarter of their expenditures.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1107-1108.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it is far better for the lower income groups that we help them directly in a targeted manner and allow them to decide on how best to use the assistance we provide for their household expenditures. Exempting GST on essentials will benefit mainly richer Singaporeans and foreigners and leave less to be provided to lower-income households.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exempting certain items from GST is also not cost free. It will mean the need<p align=left>Column: 989 </p> to impose higher GST rates on other items over time, in order for the GST to generate the same amount of revenues as before. This is in fact what has happened in several other countries which have exempted essentials from GST. It will affect Singaporeans across the board if we were to do that, including those in the lower-income groups.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sum, it is far better that we provide help to lower-income Singaporeans directly, so that we can target the assistance and provide help in much larger quantums.</p><p><br><I>Government fee freeze</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Michael Palmer gave a long list of price hikes Singaporeans have faced on the ground.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh says many were factors that Government should have watched and prevented, including even prices of certain non-Government entities. I notice their lists were remarkably similar to a blog posting that has been making its rounds for quite a while now.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me clarify that, taken as a whole, Government taxes, fees and charges, other than GST itself, contributed only 0.1 percentage points to the 2007 CPI inflation of 2.1%. If we look at the January 2008 numbers, the Government related contribution (excluding the GST increase) was also about 0.1 percentage points out of the total CPI inflation of 6.6% [4].</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%"><p class="MsoFootnoteText" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">[4]&nbsp;This includes Government charges in the transport sector, ie, ERP, road taxes, COE and ARF.&nbsp; It does not include taxi fares, bus fares and MRT fares which are charged by private companies, not the Government. The latter contributed 0.15 percentage points to 2007 average inflation and 0.5 percentage points to January 2008 inflation. Electricity and gas tariffs which were also not included above contributed negative 0.1 percentage points to the 2007 average inflation and positive 0.3 percentage points to the January 2008 inflation.</span></p><BR></div></P></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We announced a one-year freeze on Government fees starting from July last year when the GST was raised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have decided to extend the Government fee freeze till end of 2008 to provide further reassurance to Singaporeans, at a time of rising prices.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will include fees charged on all Government-provided services (for exam<p align=left>Column: 990 </p>ple, school fees, ITE and polytechnic fees, charges in public carparks, and all licence fees).</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulatory charges, such as those in the transport sector and the development charges applied in the property market, will not be frozen. They must continue to serve the purpose of regulating demand. (For example, the increase in ERP charges which has to be seen together with the decreases in road taxes and Additional Registration Fees that comprise part of the Land Transport Review).</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government fee freeze has not applied to fees charged by non-government entities, such as the universities, restructured hospitals and town councils. These entities have to make their own decisions on whether or not they will raise fees. I would however urge the town councils to consider holding their S&amp;CC charges unchanged this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the universities, fee increases have been announced, but they apply only to first year students in 2008. They will face a once-off 4% increase in fees this year, with no subsequent increase over their next three years in university. So, the once-off 4% increase works out to only 1.6% a year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, while we have to allow our universities to raise fees from time to time, so that they can cover their cost and raise their quality, what the Government is doing is extending further support to lower as well as middle-income students.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have lent their strong support to this move. Dr Ong Seh Hong had also asked why the new MOE bursaries for polytechnics only applied up to the 50th percentile of household incomes, whereas the university bursary was being extended to the 66th percentile.&nbsp; The reason is because <p align=left>Column: 991 </p>polytechnic fees are already much more heavily subsidised by the Government.&nbsp; Polytechnic students therefore pay relatively low fees of $2,100 per year, which are about a third of the fees that university students pay.&nbsp; Moreover, polytechnic students up to the 80th percentile are also able to take loans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are extending the Government fee freeze for the whole of this year.&nbsp; However, we cannot do so indefinitely. We should not change our basic practice of charging realistic fees so we are not faced with ever increasing subsidies on public services.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the only way we can provide the quality services that people want, whether in healthcare or other areas.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If fees are not priced realistically, someone else will have to end up paying for the cost; which means taxpayers in general.&nbsp; Not only that, but there will be over-consumption of public services that are provided either for free or on a highly subsidised basis. This is what has happened in many developed countries and is why they end up with extraordinarily high taxes to compensate.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the case in the Nordic countries, for example, where education and healthcare are free. Denmark&rsquo;s top marginal personal tax rate is 59% and their VAT (which is their GST) is 25%.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our practice of charging realistic fees on public services is what allows Singapore to keep our total taxes, fees and other charges collected from the population, at one of the lowest levels in the world [Chart 6*].</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach is working well &ndash; a low overall tax burden, realistic fees that only users of the public services pay, plus financial assistance targeted at the poor. This is how we will continue to provide<p align=left>Column: 992 </p> the quality services in health, education and other areas that matter to Singaporeans, including our lower- income Singaporeans.</p><p><br><I>Addressing the needs of all Singaporeans</I></p><p><br><I>Disabled</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several MPs have also made points about groups they feel deserve more attention, especially the disabled and women. Let me deal briefly with each of these in turn.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ahmad Magad, Ms Denise Phua and Dr Teo Ho Pin are concerned with how we are helping the disabled.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS will be addressing this more fully in its COS. Let me however say from a budgetary perspective that we are substantially increasing our spending to provide better support for the disabled.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between FY2007 and FY2011, Government expects to spend up to $0.9 billion on disability programmes such as funding on special education (SPED) schools as well as SPED classes in mainstream schools. This also includes various MCYS programmes for the disabled.&nbsp; This is double what we spent in the previous five years.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of this, MND and MOT will be spending about $200 million over the next five years on barrier-free access - in our public housing estates and in public transport&nbsp;&ndash; and to encourage private building owners to retrofit their buildings with basic accessibility features for the disabled.</p><p><br><I>L-Bonus</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members like Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Mr Ang Mong Seng, Dr Amy Khor, Mdm Cynthia Phua, Prof. Kalyani, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mdm Halimah Yacob have highlighted the special challenges <p align=left>Column: 993 </p>facing women, especially housewives who do not have much in their CPF accounts and who face the prospect of outliving their husbands. We agree this is an important issue which everyone should address.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housewives were one of the reasons why we decided to offer the L-Bonus to those who wish to participate in the CPF-LIFE scheme but who have less than $40,000 in their Minimum Sum.&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor had asked about what contributions this group of CPF members would have to make in order to receive the L-Bonus.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will extend the full L-Bonus to those whose balances are below $40,000, as long as they have at least $20,000 in their Minimum Sum. As they have smaller balances, however, they must be prepared to receive lower monthly payouts than those with $40,000 or more would receive.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also offer the L-Bonus to those whose balances fall below $20,000, but on a pro-rated basis, if they wish to participate in LIFE. If they top up their accounts to $20,000, they will be able to qualify for the full L-Bonus.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L-Bonus will therefore provide strong incentive for husbands, children and other family members to top up the accounts of our housewives. It applies across all income groups.&nbsp; And this is also why we have also enhanced the tax relief given to those who top up their family members' accounts so as to encourage those with middle incomes and above to do so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the L-Bonus is not itself the solution to the problem of low balances of housewives. I think Members will agree that Government&rsquo;s role should not be to substitute for the responsibility of husbands and children to provide for their wives and mothers.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 994 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The topping-up of housewives&rsquo; accounts will require concerted effort in education and persuasion.&nbsp; NTUC is already moving.&nbsp; As Mdm Halimah said, it has embarked on a programme specifically aimed at encouraging husbands to top up their wives&rsquo; accounts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there will be some CPF members who have low balances and limited family support. The CPF-LIFE scheme may not be the best way to help them if they have trouble meeting even immediate retirement needs. We will have to find other ways of helping them.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lease Buyback Scheme, which will enable elderly people to monetise their HDB flats to provide them with more retirement income, will be a significant measure for the low-income aged.&nbsp; Minister Mah will be addressing this more fully during the MND COS.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Ng Eng Hen will be addressing comprehensively the issues Members have raised with regard to CPF-LIFE during the MOM COS.</p><p><br><I>Design of surplus sharing system</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been suggestions on how we can improve on the way we share our surpluses.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Ong Kian Min and Mdm Halimah Yacob suggested using other means of approximating wealth so that we do not penalise needy families living in bigger HDB flats or, in a few instances, in private property.&nbsp; One suggestion was to look at the number of dependents living in the household.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that home type is only a proxy for the household&rsquo;s wealth and it is an imperfect proxy.&nbsp; But it will be both difficult and extremely intrusive to design a national scheme that takes into <p align=left>Column: 995 </p>consideration the profile of needs of every household.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, however, families with more dependents do get more benefits.&nbsp; This is because of the PSEA we have given to young Singaporeans as well as the additional Growth Dividends and Medisave top-ups that we have given to older Singaporeans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will however be cases of families who do not qualify under the criteria but who are truly in need.&nbsp; This is why we have provided additional funds to the CCCs and CDCs, self-help groups and the VWOs.&nbsp; They are in the best position to assess the needs of such families in detail.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fair and workable approach&nbsp;&ndash; to apply simple, consistent criteria at the national level, but provide targeted assistance at the local level for those who need more help.</p><p><br><I>Addressing the widening income gap</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the challenge of a widening income distribution which many Members, including Dr Lily Neo and Mr Zainudin Nordin, have spoken about.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As set out in both last year&rsquo;s Budget and this year&rsquo;s Budget, this has to be a key concern for Singapore. As Dr Lily Neo puts it, if those at the bottom end of the income ladder stagnate, or see declining living standards, Singapore&rsquo;s social compact will be at risk.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we have embarked on major new initiatives in the last two years to help our lower-income workers with their income, their savings, their job prospects and the upgrading of their skills.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workfare is a major addition to our social security system&nbsp;&ndash; it will give those<p align=left>Column: 996 </p> at the lower end of the workforce a strong incentive to find a job, stay employed and save for their future. But as Ms Cham Hui Fong pointed out, Workfare should not be the end game for any worker. Our objective should be to help our low-wage workers up-skill and graduate out of WIS.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs, including Mdm Halimah Yacob, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, had suggestions on how to improve the Workfare scheme, including broadening its reach amongst informal workers. Mr Inderjit Singh also suggested raising the WIS ceiling and increasing the quantum of payouts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WIS is a new scheme&nbsp;&ndash; the first payments were only made in January this year.&nbsp; We should not be changing the basic parameters so quickly. The current ceiling of $1,500 captures the bottom 30% of the working population.&nbsp; In fact, the scheme was targeted at the bottom 20%, but was extended up to 30% so that there would not be a sudden fall off in benefits for those at the margin.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need more time to see how well the scheme is working and whether it should be refined. We have committed to review the scheme by 2010.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><BR><hr width="50%">*Cols. 1109-1110.<BR></div></P></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that Workfare is not simply a means to supplement the income of low-wage workers.

It is a highly progressive fiscal system, despite our very low rates of tax on the middle and upper-income groups.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore system is one that provides targeted help for the needy, while keeping the overall tax burden low so that we reward work and enterprise.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Chart 7*]&nbsp;The&nbsp;next chart shows what households pay to the Government in taxes and receive from the Government in benefits this year.&nbsp; However, it does not include our housing, healthcare and education subsidies which are in fact much more significant for lower-income households.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members can see that up to the 40th percentile of households, Singaporeans are getting a positive net transfer from the Government this year. This means that these households are getting back more than they are paying to the Government.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Households in the second decile, in other words from the 11th to 20th percentile, will obtain a net transfer from Government that is equal to about 25% of their incomes this year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, while the bulk of Government revenues come from the top 20%, the burden on them is not high. The top 10% pays to Government about 13% of their income on average, including not just personal income tax, but also motor vehicle tax, foreign maid levy, property tax and GST.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even after this year&rsquo;s surplus sharing benefits, and after the GST offsets are fully paid out in 2011, there will still be the permanent scheme of Workfare to support lower-income families. In net<p align=left>Column: 998 </p> terms, the bottom 20% of families will still receive a positive net transfer from Government after the GST offsets have run out.</p><p><br><I>Conclusion</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the most important debate in the last two days has been about the basic ethic that we want to sustain in our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all aspire to help and uplift the less fortunate members of our society.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong made an impassioned speech. He says that the Government is only concerned about not eroding the work ethic, rather than caring for Singaporeans, and so we tend to provide the bare minimum to Singaporeans in need such that they have just enough to survive.&nbsp;&nbsp; His description does not square with the reality of Government interventions to support the lower-income group.&nbsp; Through Workfare, through our housing subsidies, through our CPF subsidies and top-ups, through the support we provide the poor with Medifund and the many flexible schemes that ComCare offers, we are providing substantial support for lower-income Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp; His desire to see nobody left behind is noble and shared by us all.&nbsp; But his exhortation that we should ignore waste, ignore deadweight loss, ignore disincentives to work is reckless.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Chew Chu Ching pointed out in his <I>Zaobao</I> column today, commenting on Mr Siew Kum Hong&rsquo;s speech, &ldquo;if a country does not care about creating wealth at all, it is big question whether it could survive in the real world." [Chart 8*] The cartoon accompanying his commentary expresses it more pithily.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be able to help the poor, we must first create wealth, grow our GDP and provide every incentive for Singaporeans to strive and work to improve their lives and that of their families.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 999 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If our policies harm that, for the noblest of reasons, we will be in serious trouble, as many other countries have found. Instead of helping the people we all want to help, we will be doing worse for them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real issue is how we can keep our economy productive and vibrant, and how we can keep our society resilient and caring, not just now or for a few years, but for many years to come. Will it be achieved by Government giving more and more and handing out more and more goodies, which MPs like Mr Sam Tan, Dr Ong Seh Hong, Mr Baey Yam Keng and Dr Lim Wee Kiak cautioned against?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Chua Mui Hoong put it in yesterday&rsquo;s <I>Straits Times</I>, &ldquo;it is timely to recall that the Finance Minister is not the God of Fortune, and that not all calls for spending have merit. Even if there is a $6.4 billion surplus&rdquo;.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our basic philosophy has been and must remain what Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, Dr Lily Neo, Ms Lee Bee Wah, Mrs Josephine Teo and Dr Lim Wee Kiak expressed &ndash; we must keep alive the incentive for every Singaporean to strive and maximise opportunities to do better for themselves and their families.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget has given Singaporeans something to tide over their present difficulties. But far more important is what we are doing to help every individual upgrade himself through education and training, to stay in a job and keep advancing his skills, and to save for retirement.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have embarked on new initiatives, and there is much more work ahead. We will stay focused on this central task. As Mdm Halimah Yacob summed up, it is what we have to do so that this continues to be a place where everyone has the<p align=left>Column:1000 </p> opportunity to fulfil his dreams through hard work and can look forward to the future with hope.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the philosophy which will keep Singapore going through good years and bad, which will ensure that prosperity will last more than&nbsp;three generations, as Mr Seng Han Thong hoped. And above all, which will make this a society where every Singaporean can be proud that they are playing their part, not just by doing better for themselves, but by contributing to Singapore.

This issue of integration is not new.&nbsp; It is something that has existed for many centuries.&nbsp; Three years ago, my secretary gave me a book on Alexander the Great.&nbsp; She obviously thought&nbsp;I did not have enough to read!&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexander the Great was a Macedonian.&nbsp; He pushed forward out of Macedonia and Greece towards Asia, conquered Persia and pushed towards Afghanistan.&nbsp; But he had a&nbsp;problem with integrating his Generals.&nbsp; In the course of it, he also wanted to retire some old Generals.&nbsp; His troops rebelled.&nbsp; He had to calm them down, which he finally did.&nbsp; Then, he sat down and had a dinner.&nbsp; And the first ring around the dinner were the Greeks, followed by the Persians.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I read that, I was thinking this sounds exactly like an Inter-Racial Confidence Circle to me.&nbsp; The idea that in 300 BC, this issue of integration was something that posed a challenge at that time was remarkable because it is an issue that we still face today.&nbsp; On the ground, there are concerns by Singaporeans about integrating with foreigners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1003 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I would just like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister about the status and what efforts we have made and the progress in the past year.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

some for their own career advancements, some to grow their investments or expand their businesses and some for their children's future.&nbsp; New citizens come from various ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds.&nbsp; As such, it is a challenge for new citizens to first settle down in Singapore, and then bond with fellow Singaporeans in a multi-racial and multi-religious society.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a growing population of new citizens, we need to do more to integrate our population.&nbsp; The setting up of the Integration and Naturalisation Champion (INC) at each constituency is a first step in the correct direction in integrating new citizens.&nbsp; However, feedback from my INC shows that many new citizens do not understand Singapore's history and heritage,&nbsp;do not understand our political system and achievements, and also do not understand our cultures and living habits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to provide resources to support the integration efforts of the INC.&nbsp; New citizens should be encouraged to participate in community activities and play an active role in community bonding and integration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I can understand the rationale&nbsp;for having a higher population than the current, but is 6.5 million the optimum number for the future?&nbsp; The question is: when is this future date?&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that in planning&nbsp;such a population growth, the Government may have adopted&nbsp;an "instant tree" mentality where after setting a goal, we want to achieve it tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have been&nbsp;ramping up the population relentlessly in the last couple of years.&nbsp; It is like we want a tree, but we are not willing for it to grow, for the roots to go down, the tree to go up, and&nbsp;for the ground to adjust.&nbsp; Our "instant tree" mentality is pushing the pace of population growth at unrealistic rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has created a massive strain on available infrastructure, be it trains, property, food centres or&nbsp;our common spaces.&nbsp; Foreigners have also contributed to the fuelling&nbsp;of our property prices, as I mentioned in my Budget speech.&nbsp; Infrastructure will take time to build.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not disagree with our policy to bring in talented foreigners here, but I cannot<p align=left>Column: 1005 </p> agree with opening up the floodgates and letting in so many, so quickly. We should have planned on a much more gradual increase of population in line with our ability to absorb and sustain it.&nbsp; And what if we got the 6.5 million number wrong and perhaps&nbsp;that it should be 5.5 million?&nbsp;&nbsp;We might&nbsp;then have overdone things and making it difficult for us to reverse if we try to bring in so many so quickly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that we slow down the intake, be patient about when we want to achieve the desired optimum population level. This way, we could also have managed our infrastructure growth better, adjusting the supply to match demand for homes, cars and&nbsp;our common spaces better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another problem with such influx is that&nbsp;with many foreigners here,&nbsp;we are creating the issue of integration. I spoke about this last year.&nbsp; Society needs time to adjust and to absorb the newcomers, and the newcomers need time to make themselves feel at home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we do not keep this trend in check, we may be closer to the New York&nbsp;or the London model, with many groups coming with all sorts of values, with everyone covering their own space.&nbsp; This may likely compromise our social cohesion that we cannot compromise on.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Exciting City of Opportunities</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, I particularly like the strategic intent of the Budget where the Finance Minister spelt out how his Budget would "create new advantages and fresh opportunities for Singapore in a competitive world".<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He rightly acknowledged that infrastructure is only the enabler and the key to our success will be our people and our enterprises.&nbsp; In the Finance Minister's words, and I quote, "whether we hold our<p align=left>Column:1006 </p> place in the top league will ultimately depend on whether our people and enterprises are top quality, in every job and business they do".&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree more with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty-six years&nbsp;ago, I moved to Singapore from London because I saw Singapore as a city of opportunity.&nbsp; Today, it continues to be one, but 20 years from today, will Singapore still be a city of opportunity?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that while competition to be a city of opportunity is getting more intense, with rapidly growing cities in Asia and other parts of the emerging world, challenging established leaders such as London and New York, Singapore has what it takes to be a leading long-term player in the premier league of global cities, but this is not without its challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes me confident about Singapore's future and what are some of the challenges we are likely to face going forward?&nbsp; My confidence in Singapore's future stems from the fact that we have chosen the right strategy.&nbsp; Our ambition is clear, we want to be a global city, that is, a centre of commerce, finance and investment, a magnet that attracts companies, entrepreneurs and others engaged in global business and trade.&nbsp; We have set ourselves a target to have a disproportionately high share of corporate headquarters located in Singapore and we know that as a country, we have to offer distinct advantages for doing business in a global economy.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the 20th century, conventional indicators, such as port capacity and manufacturing capabilities, together with physical size, would have been used to define a city of opportunity.&nbsp; While still significant, such indicators have given way in the 21st century to technological factors such as broadband<p align=left>Column: 1007 </p> availability and telecommunications infrastructure and to cultural characteristics such as diversity.&nbsp; These changes suggest that in addition to being a global city in the conventional sense, a city of opportunity in the 21st century must offer more.&nbsp; But what?&nbsp; PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Partnership for New York City undertook a study to find answers to that fundamental question.&nbsp; The results of this study, which was published in 2007, found the requirements and features of 21st century cities of opportunity have changed&nbsp;&ndash; and will continue to change&nbsp;&ndash; in areas that impact new economy competitiveness and attractiveness:&nbsp; areas ranging from intellectual capital and transportation assets to such fundamental requirements as safety and security.&nbsp; These new indicators and variables, according to the study, better reflect what it takes to succeed in a vibrant knowledge economy.&nbsp; This is good news for Singapore because it plays to our strengths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, Singapore is well into its journey of developing into a global city of opportunity.&nbsp; Some years back, we took some key strategic decisions on diversifying our economy, making it more broad-based and less dependent on a few major economies such as the US and Japan.&nbsp; Today, we have a growing service and knowledge economy to complement our high-end manufacturing base, our global schoolhouse initiative is beginning to have an impact and we have made bold moves to boost the leisure and tourism sector with iconic investments in lifestyle assets, such as the two Integrated Resorts and the Sports Hub, not to mention our museums, art galleries and our world-class National Library.&nbsp; Hosting events like the F1, the APEC meeting next year and the Youth Olympic Games in 2010 will add to our credibility as a global city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what are the challenges we are likely to face if we are to avoid relegation<p align=left>Column: 1008 </p> from the premier league of global cities?&nbsp; My biggest fear is that when the Government is faced with domestic issues and concerns, perhaps brought about by an economic downturn, it may change course and slow down our efforts to become a global city of opportunity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a small nation state like ours, to slow down in the race is almost as good as dropping out. We simply cannot afford to take the foot of the gas pedal, thinking that we can always come back at a later stage to forge ahead of an increasingly competitive field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the needs of our heartlanders are very important, but we must not forget the pressing need to attract top talent and top quality enterprises to drop anchor in Singapore.&nbsp; We need a Budget for the common man as well as a Budget for the other stakeholders in our global city of opportunity.&nbsp; We need to address bread-and-butter issues for the less well-off as well as attract and retain the finest chefs for our world-class restaurants.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I submit to you that the future of our country will depend on how passionate we are in wanting to develop Singapore into an exciting global city of opportunity for not only our home-grown Singaporeans, but also for our expatriate population, some of whom may well sink their roots here.&nbsp; For Singapore to remain a city of opportunity, we must remain first and foremost a global city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the consequences of globalisation is that talent is very mobile and is not constrained by national borders.&nbsp; Consequently, many of our talented Singaporeans are now living and working overseas.&nbsp; This trend is likely to continue, even increase.&nbsp; In the private sector, we find that our most talented young Singaporeans are hungry for overseas experience, attracted not only by the learning opportunities, but by the buzz, excitement and lifestyle of cities<p align=left>Column: 1009</p> such as London and&nbsp;New York.&nbsp; Many of them are not in a hurry to come back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we need to remain connected with them and eventually, woo them back home, or, at the very least, we should&nbsp;encourage them to be good ambassadors for Singapore in their adopted home countries.&nbsp; The Government has already recognised this and has started on some worthy initiatives, but more can be done perhaps in partnership with the private sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mindset and aspirations of young Singaporeans also need to be considered in the talent development programmes that the Government operates including its very successful overseas scholarship schemes, which are presently accompanied by long periods of bonding back in Singapore.&nbsp; Set formulas like these&nbsp;have worked in the past but may not be successful today unless we tweak and refresh them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The optimal population size of Singapore has been debated before. Regardless of whether it is 4.5 million, 5.5 million or 6.5 million, one thing is certain&nbsp;&ndash; based on our low birth rate, the bulk of any future demographic growth will have to come from overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to yesteryears, our "expatriate landscape" has changed.&nbsp; Singapore is not merely attracting the doctors, scientists and expatriates who belong to the financially privileged group. &nbsp;There is a growing group of "middle income" foreigners, often described as "expatriates on local terms" because they enjoy little or no fringe benefits.&nbsp; The reason why they are here is that Singapore can offer them good career opportunities, an attractive lifestyle with the charm of a multi-cultural society, top&ndash;class education and recreational facilities for their children and a safe and secure environment.&nbsp; They find that most Singaporeans are warm and friendly and<p align=left>Column: 1010 </p>they feel safe and welcome even though they are a minority.&nbsp; After a while, some of them become Permanent Residents. Several years later, they may find themselves so well integrated into the life in Singapore that they decide to become new Singapore citizens.&nbsp; A happy story so far.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, they face some dark clouds and anxiety&nbsp;on the horizon.&nbsp; Like other Singaporeans, this group is also affected by spiralling housing rentals and rising costs of living.&nbsp; The inflation rate is high which is eating into their income and curbing their purchasing power.&nbsp; They are frustrated with the long waiting list to admit their children to international schools.&nbsp; But they also have another big&nbsp;concern,&nbsp;that is,&nbsp;how will they be perceived by Singaporeans in the long run?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, our economy has experienced a good run but what if we have a slowdown and our employment opportunities dip?&nbsp; Will Singaporeans perceive foreign talent as a threat or a catalyst for economic recovery?&nbsp; Will the issue be played up and as a result our foreign imports feel less than welcome?&nbsp; Does our education system give sufficient mention to the contribution of our foreign imports? Do our schools teach our children and youth to appreciate the contribution of this group of potential Singaporeans?&nbsp; Do we dare to be more generous in our fiscal policy to attract and retain foreign talent?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst our economy is still performing well, we should proactively do more to address the needs of our imported talent and seek to retain them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I do not pretend to have the solutions to this potentially tricky issue which will almost certainly resurface at some stage in our political and social agenda.&nbsp; What I do know is that we<p align=left>Column: 1011 </p> should pay more attention towards attracting talent to Singapore and address the issues that deter them from settling here.&nbsp; We should also help our home-grown citizens appreciate the role and contribution of our foreign residents and help these non-citizens to integrate into Singapore society.&nbsp; This is a sizeable group of people. If they have a good life and contribute more to Singapore, collectively, we will all have a better life.&nbsp; If they do not find it meaningful to live in Singapore, we will all lose in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I would ask the Government to step up its efforts to attract and retain talent, both home-grown and foreign.&nbsp; Otherwise, our efforts to build the infrastructure for a global city will be futile.&nbsp; Without quality human capital, who will give us this global dimension, this excitement, diversity and vibrancy that is essential for Singapore to be a global city of opportunity?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Immigration</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, our Prime Minister announced in his 2006 National Day Rally speech about promoting our immigration programme overseas and further attracting foreign talent to our shores.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we welcome foreigners who can contribute to our society, we also need transparency in our immigration policies.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Department of Statistics, foreign population has crossed the one million mark and has seen a 14.9% increase from a year ago, compared to 9.7% increase in the previous year. This represents the highest jump in at least seven years. Singapore is the fourth most densely populated country in the world with over 6,000 people per square kilometre.&nbsp; With the swift growth of the urban population, there could be an augmented strain on our<p align=left>Column: 1012 </p> city's resources, facilities and services.

As it stands, the Circle Line will not be ready till 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The City of Toronto, Canada, with a population of 2.48 million people is fairly similar to Singapore in terms of area mass at 630 square kilometres.&nbsp; It is already beginning to show signs of growing pains, such as traffic congestions and an inaccessible public healthcare system.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister: will the rate of foreigners coming to Singapore continue to increase?&nbsp; And, if so, what are some of the necessary steps we have to take to ensure our services&nbsp;&ndash; infrastructure, health, education and transport&nbsp; &ndash;can cope?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Housing prices have escalated due to market forces. And according to today's <I>Today</I> article, foreign students are already starting to feel the effects of the rising prices. The <I>Straits Times</I> has also reported that there is&nbsp;a shortage with the number of places in international schools as a result of the increase in expatriate population. I would like to ask the Minister if we are moving at too fast a pace.&nbsp; And are we giving our services and infrastructure enough lead time to cope with population increase from immigration?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from infrastructure, another area of concern is our social and community integration.&nbsp; Social integration does not only include economic integration but also cultural integration.&nbsp; It requires an open society where there is acceptance of differences.&nbsp; In the same 2006 National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister also commented that there are Singaporeans who may have reservations about immigrants and that they are worried about the competition that comes with them.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how the Government intends to cultivate <p align=left>Column: 1013 </p>integration and an inclusive environment with the expected number of immigrants. Will Singaporeans be able to identify with them and vice versa?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we are focused on luring and recruiting foreign talent, we may lose our own at the same time if we are not balanced and prepared in our approach. With the rising cost of living and the widening income gap, Singaporeans will feel the pressure squeeze and be tempted to flee abroad as already evident with the rate of approximately 1,000 people leaving per year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore needs foreigners, but Singapore will always need Singaporeans.&nbsp; I hope the Government will be able to allay our concerns with regard to our immigration policies.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Social Integration</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, Singapore is aiming for a population of 6.5 million.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;at last year's Committee of Supply, I talked about the three key strategies of tackling our population challenges: promoting marriage and parenthood, engaging overseas Singaporeans, and encouraging immigration.&nbsp; This year, several Members have spoken on the issue of immigration and raised questions and suggestions on how to attract and retain foreign talent without weakening our social cohesion and eroding our national identity.&nbsp; These are important matters and I want to thank all Members who have spoken on these matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I shall focus on this particular area of our population challenge.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Gautam Banerjee talked about Singapore being an exciting global city of opportunities and the need to attract and retain talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to be a great city&nbsp;of opportunities if we do the right things, and do it rationally.&nbsp; Indeed, in order to stay competitive in this global economy, Singapore must be a great place to live, work and play for both Singaporeans and foreigners.&nbsp; Only when people are confident and comfortable with their living environment, will they consider major decisions such as getting married and raising children.&nbsp; Similarly, for those who have just come here, such an environment will strengthen their resolve and commitment to call Singapore "home".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans today enjoy good infrastructure, reliable healthcare services,<p align=left>Column: 1015 </p> clean air and water, and an efficient transportation system.&nbsp; We invest in our people, giving top priority to education.&nbsp; We have the Esplanade, and the Integrated Resorts and&nbsp;Sports Hub are to come.&nbsp; We have staged many international conferences, such as the IMF/World Bank Summit, the Shangri-La Dialogue, the International Bar Association Meeting and, most recently, the Singapore Air Show Aviation Leadership Summit.&nbsp;More such events&nbsp;will be staged here.&nbsp; The world's first Formula&nbsp;One night race will take place in Singapore in September this year.&nbsp; We also succeeded in our bid to host the inaugural Youth Olympics.&nbsp; That such major events are held here reflect the trust that people have in our ability to deliver what we promise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has been cited by various international surveys and articles as one of the best places to be in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp; The UK's <I>Telegraph</I> carried a glowing testimonial on 28th November 2007 on the "buzz" and excellent infrastructure here.&nbsp; Last year, the ECA International named Singapore as the best city in the world to live for Asian expatriates, while&nbsp;Mercer Human Resource Consulting ranked Singapore as one of the world's most liveable cities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans I met abroad have also told me that they have learnt to appreciate Singapore more now that they are based overseas.&nbsp; Some of them have come back to Singapore after spending many years in other countries.&nbsp; They returned home for the economic opportunities in Singapore, the high quality of education for their children, and because they miss their families and friends.&nbsp; We must continue to engage them.&nbsp; Following the very positive responses from the 6,000 overseas Singaporeans who turned up at the inaugural Singapore Day in New York last April, we will be organising Singapore Day <p align=left>Column: 1016 </p>2008 in Melbourne this October.&nbsp; This event will allow Overseas Singaporeans in Australia a chance to get updated on the many exciting developments in Singapore, and rekindle and renew their connections with home and friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now, Singapore is a talent magnet for many.&nbsp; However, the global competition for talent is very intense.&nbsp; Whether we like it or not, those who are capable and talented will be drawn to places&nbsp;where there are&nbsp;better opportunities and where they feel welcomed. &nbsp;And if Singapore does not welcome them, they will simply look elsewhere and they will then compete against us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Singapore last November, he applauded Singapore's "&#26080;&#22681;&#25991;&#21270;", or "no walls culture".&nbsp; He said that China had benefited from an open policy and likewise, "a small country like Singapore becomes big only when it embraces the world".&nbsp; His views were echoed recently, just&nbsp;a few days ago, by the <I>Renmin Ribao</I> (&#20154;&#27665;&#26085;&#25253;), which congratulated Singapore on our amazing capacity to take on major projects and bring in global talent in spite of our small size. &nbsp;If a big country like China can see value in opening its doors to the world, what more this "little red dot"?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since broadening the immigration criteria in 2004, we have seen an average of 52,500 PRs and 12,800 new citizens granted every year.&nbsp; Last year, we had 63,600 PRs and 17,300 new citizens.&nbsp; In comparison, we had just 760 more babies last year compared to 2006.&nbsp; While the increase is heartening, we are far from raising our total fertility rate back up to replacement level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locals alone are not enough to meet our manpower demands. Contrary to Mr Inderjit Singh's suggestion that the rate of immigration is too fast and unrealistic, we<p align=left>Column: 1017 </p> still need more people to sustain our economic growth. Mr Banerjee is right to say thatwe must not slow down our ability to attract foreign global talent, just because some&nbsp;people feel uneasy about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, when 236,600 jobs were created, many companies had to turn to foreigners to fill the positions.&nbsp; For example, the financial and business services sector saw a net employment growth of 65,000 jobs just last year.&nbsp; While the majority of the jobs were filled by locals, we had to make up the shortfall with global talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of businesses and investment opportunities have passed us by, simply because we are facing such an acute shortage of manpower and office space.&nbsp; Once lost, these businesses may not come&nbsp;back to Singapore, as they have gone&nbsp;to places where there are opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have heard Mr Tharman speaking on this earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, as a small city state with no other natural resources, we need others to join us, become part of us, and contribute to our community.&nbsp; However, Singaporeans must remain as the core of our population.&nbsp; We do not want to be like some Middle Eastern countries, where non-resident foreigners far outnumber the indigenous population.&nbsp; For Singaporeans to remain at the core, we must have more babies and encourage more suitable&nbsp;immigrants to become Singapore citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh, Ms Eunice Olsen and&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo have also raised concerns over whether we can cope with the influx of immigrants in such a short time.&nbsp; I understand their concerns and I agree with Mr Singh and Ms Olsen that we must plan ahead to ensure&nbsp;effective and efficient use of land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, we have done well in this area, and we will do more.&nbsp; We had the Minister for Transport&nbsp;talking about expanding our roads and rail<p align=left>Column: 1018 </p> infrastructure, and MND will provide more space for Singaporeans, in terms of greenery, parks and housing. Singapore's excellent living environment has become our competitive advantage to root residents and attract investments and talent.&nbsp;&nbsp; MND is confident that, with creative planning and technology, Singapore can accommodate a larger population without compromising the quality of our living environment.&nbsp; While there will be trade-offs among different land use options, we can meet the needs of a larger population if we plan and invest ahead now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few Members mentioned the 6.5 million population as a target.&nbsp; Let me stress that 6.5 million is not&nbsp;a population target.&nbsp; We have never set that out to be a population target.&nbsp; What we have said is that it is a planning assumption, and&nbsp;we will&nbsp;build up our capacity to accommodate more people should the need arise.&nbsp; Our long-term population may well be&nbsp;less than 6.5 million.&nbsp; What is important is that&nbsp;we must be able to sustain a viable and diverse population, one that can help us to continue to grow our economy and preserve our Singaporean way of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address the Members' specific call for greater social integration.&nbsp; Like Singapore, many other developed countries compete aggressively for talented people from around the world in order to increase diversity and augment the population.&nbsp; However, they have paid less attention to the integration of the newcomers into the local society.&nbsp; This has resulted in clashes and disputes between communities in countries such as Australia, France and even the United States.&nbsp; Such problems can also arise&nbsp;in&nbsp;Singapore if we do not make the effort to integrate our immigrants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I think we have fared better than most other countries.&nbsp; Our&nbsp;migrant roots have, in a way, enabled us to be more understanding and welcoming<p align=left>Column: 1019 </p> towards newcomers, but we should not be complacent.&nbsp; There are some Singaporeans who still harbour unwarranted fears and insecurity.&nbsp; Instead of being fearful, we should be more confident of ourselves and our future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Singh suggested that we have been opening the floodgates and letting in too many foreigners.&nbsp; We need to distinguish between long-term immigrants and the more transient foreign&nbsp; labourers in Singapore.&nbsp; Many of the latter are here because of the demand created by the resurgent economy in the past few years.&nbsp; They help us fill the jobs in industries where there are not enough Singaporeans.&nbsp; Indeed, without them, the problem of inflation that Mr Singh highlighted earlier, might worsen, as our companies still struggle to fill jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether they are long-term migrants wishing to make Singapore their new home or transient workers helping to keep our industries buoyant, we must be more understanding and accommodating to those who are here to contribute to our economy.&nbsp; We should welcome them.&nbsp; We do not gain from adopting a closed-door policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But integration is a two-way street.&nbsp; Integration of people takes time and it is a never ending process. &nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah just now mentioned the example of the time of Alexander the Great.&nbsp; Those Singaporeans whose parents were immigrants will remember how long it took for their parents to fully integrate into Singapore's society.&nbsp; As we achieve economic progress, we can also do better to cultivate a more gracious and accommodating society.&nbsp; Just as the Chinese saying goes, <I>qian li zhi xing, shi yu zu xia</I> (&#21315;&#37324;&#20043;&#34892;, &#22987;&#20110;&#36275;&#19979;), we must take the first step towards this goal.&nbsp; This is what Minister Mentor meant when he wished for Singapore to reach the level of <p align=left>Column: 1020 </p>Austria in 10 to 15 years, ie,&nbsp;to reach their quality of social graces, culture and lifestyle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locals and newcomers must reach out to one another, to bridge gaps and narrow differences, and to build on our shared beliefs and vision.&nbsp; There is no scientific formula for integration.&nbsp; It is about people-to-people relations; we must encourage integration everywhere&nbsp;&ndash; in schools, at the workplace, in the neighbourhood and the larger community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo, Ms Indranee Rajah and Dr Teo Ho Pin asked for an update on our efforts to integrate new citizens. &nbsp;Let me now elaborate our efforts in this area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school environment is a natural setting for close daily interaction between our young immigrants and Singaporeans. Through the formal curriculum and co-curricular activities, our schools help students to better appreciate Singapore's history, culture and community, and give them opportunities to learn and play together.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education has recently set up a unit to enhance the integration process in our schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have many immigrant teachers and students who have adapted well and are contributing in our schools. &nbsp;Teachers like Mr S. Ponnalagu from India who not only teaches the Tamil language but is also an active grassroots member at his Residents&rsquo; Committee (RC).&nbsp; Another teacher, Madam Zhou Liang, was so impressed with the environment and security in Singapore that she took up Singapore citizenship in 2006.&nbsp; There is also Mr Simon Charles Reynolds, an Assistant Director with the MOE.&nbsp; Originally from Britain, he became a PR more than 15 years ago, married a Singaporean and they have three teenage children&nbsp;- all Singapore citizens.&nbsp; Among the students, Sri Thiri Tun from Myanmar and Kim Jin Ju from South Korea, are<p align=left>Column: 1021 </p> Head Prefect and Prefect respectively at Yu Neng Primary School.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workplace is another important platform for integration.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are already several ongoing efforts by companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told that PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) tries to familiarise its foreign staff with the local culture and make them feel at home. Only last week, they were treated to a Chinese New Year "<I>Lo Hei</I>" lunch and given insights into the significance of tossing the "<I>yusheng</I>".&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does PwC do this?&nbsp; I think the answer is quite simple&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;an integrated and motivated workforce is a more productive one.&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of such initiatives cannot be underestimated.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>4.00 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see more employers&nbsp;follow PwC's&nbsp;lead and organise such programmes for their staff. For employees, whether Singaporeans or new immigrants, I hope they will put in more effort to get to know their colleagues better; they can easily do this at corporate events like the year-end function, during after-office drinks or even over a simple meal at lunch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, I am encouraged by the many integration initiatives involving locals and&nbsp;newcomers themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Teo has mentioned, the People's Association&nbsp;initiated the Integration &amp; Naturalisation Champions (INCs) programme, to reach out to newcomers and engage them in local activities.&nbsp; Since&nbsp;November last year, the PA has appointed 690 INCs to spearhead integration efforts in the 84 constituencies. The focus is on reaching out to&nbsp;foreigners and helping them integrate through community activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also heartened to see many Singaporeans, such as Mr Richard Hoe and Mr Bob Shaw, who have taken the<p align=left>Column: 1022 </p> initiative to reach out to new immigrants.&nbsp; Mr Hoe engages new citizens and PRs through fruit parties and dragon-boating activities in Punggol East while Mr Shaw organises cricket matches in Marsiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;The PA will soon introduce a host of family programmes whereby foreigners will be paired with local families to enhance mutual understanding and integration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, many immigrants reciprocate by being involved in community and grassroots activities. There are 900 PRs here who are volunteers at&nbsp;our grassroots organisations, including Englishman Mr Anthony Fulwood of Bukit Panjang, Chairman of Zhenghua INC Committee; and recently-naturalised citizen, Mr A Swaminathan, who is the Secretary of Jurong Green CC Indian Activity Executive Committee.&nbsp; For them, lending a hand is their way of giving back to the community which once helped them settle into life in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local community organisations, such as the Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations (SFCCA) and Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (SCCCI), have also stepped up efforts to integrate new immigrants through activities in their areas of interest. &nbsp;The SFCCA is organising a seminar with new Chinese immigrant clubs during the Chinese Cultural Festival next month to discuss how new immigrants can better integrate into and contribute to our society.&nbsp; New immigrant associations, such as the Kowloon Club, Tian Fu Club and Hua Yuan Association, worked with the SFCCA to host a Chinese New Year's Eve Reunion Dinner earlier this month for Singaporeans and new immigrants.&nbsp; The Kowloon Club also joined in the <I>Chingay</I> procession for the first time this year.&nbsp; Efforts are also underway by our Indian community leaders to reach out to and integrate the Indian immigrants into our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1023</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome and support more of such ground-up initiatives.&nbsp; It is through such efforts that we can promote greater interaction, understanding and, ultimately, integration of locals and newcomers.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to work together to break down barriers and dispel unwarranted biases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, attracting immigrants to Singapore is and will remain a key strategy for our long-term growth and prosperity.&nbsp; As Singapore becomes even more globalised and cosmopolitan, more foreigners will want to come&nbsp;here to live, work, study and play, with some settling down permanently&nbsp;to eventually make Singapore their home.&nbsp; So let us open our doors, minds and hearts. We must work together, be welcoming to new immigrants and help them integrate into our community.&nbsp; There is a need for mutual acceptance, adjustment and respect.&nbsp; We can then live as one harmonious family to create&nbsp;even greater possibilities for ourselves, our children and&nbsp;future generations to come.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Macpherson)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

When an election is called, the country is in a state of transition.&nbsp; The nation's leadership has completed an old term, a contest begins for a new term.&nbsp; If any disruption should occur during the election process and the election is not seen to be carried out to its satisfactory conclusion, then it will affect the legitimacy of the new leadership and be even detrimental to the overall confidence level in our society.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since our independence, we have gone through 10 general elections and three presidential elections.&nbsp; Every one of them was conducted smoothly.&nbsp; But I do not think we can therefore conclude that future elections will always be uninterrupted like before.&nbsp;I can think of<p align=left>Column:1024 </p> the possibility of disruption caused by natural forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Climate change is causing chaos in the weather patterns in many parts of the world.&nbsp; We here have seen severe storms in recent years, leading to roads become impassable to traffic due to floods and fallen trees.&nbsp; If this should happen during the critical period of 11 am to 12 noon on Nomination Day, and some would-be candidates cannot get to the nomination centres on time, thus leading to their disqualification, it would certainly be seen as unsatisfactory by all the political parties and the voters too.&nbsp; Similarly, should severe weather occur on&nbsp;Polling Day and many voters cannot go to vote, it would also lead to undesirable outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A disruption can also be caused deliberately by hostile elements.&nbsp; It can be in the form of a localised bomb hoax or a major terrorist attack.&nbsp; Individual neighbourhoods or large areas of Singapore may have to be cordoned off during the election time affecting the smooth movement of&nbsp;candidates, election agents, officials and voters, and the conduct of election activities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Prime Minister's Office whether it has contingency plans to deal with the disruption to the smooth conduct of an election and whether rules will be introduced to take into account such disruptions should they occur to ensure that law and order pertaining to the election will be quickly restored and upheld, and be seen to be upheld.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I ask the PMO to be more voter-centric to include these Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I also saw in the last General Election the predominant use of traditional media and methods, such as the hard copy newspapers, brochures, TV, radio, posters on selected lamp posts and <I><I>garung</I> guni</I> type lorries and loudhailers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is one of the most plugged-in and Internet-savvy countries in the world,&nbsp;a world&nbsp;of&nbsp;blogs, SMSes, podcasts, webcasts&nbsp;and vodcasts.&nbsp; The benefits of new media are an extensive reach and access, anytime and anywhere.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir,&nbsp;I want to thankMr Matthias Yao, Ms Lee Bee Wah and Ms Denise Phua for their comments.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Lee Bee Wah suggested that the Prime Minister's Office do an overall review of the electoral system and processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has always been done after every General Election (GE). &nbsp;Following the 2006 GE, I appointed a Committee to review the conduct of the election, including issues concerning overseas voting. I will highlight the more significant changes and improvements that will be implemented for the next election.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas voting was conducted for the first time in the 2006 General Election. With more Singaporeans going overseas to work, study or to be with their immediate family, we now have a significant diaspora of overseas Singaporeans. &nbsp;They would want to have an opportunity to vote at a General Election.&nbsp; That being so, the Government will further liberalise the criteria to enable more Singaporeans overseas to qualify to vote while maintaining the spirit of the law that only those who continue to keep their links back home should be entitled to vote.&nbsp; The Government has decided to shorten the residential period requirement from the current two years out of the last&nbsp;five years,&nbsp;to&nbsp;30 days out of the last&nbsp;three years before the cut-off date for the registers of electors.&nbsp; This will be the only residential period requirement for an overseas Singaporean to meet in order to vote.&nbsp; An overseas Singaporean who meets this residential period requirement must also maintain a local address with the Immigration&nbsp;and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in order for him to have his name included in a constituency's register of electors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1027 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members mayask, why 30 days out of the last three years?&nbsp; We believe that it is reasonable to expect overseas Singaporeans to come home to visit their families and friends for at least 30 days over a three-year period, giventhat most citizens working abroad would have an average of 21 days of annual leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that they will spend at least half of their leave at home in Singapore.&nbsp; A three-year period is also considered a reasonable base period to use for the computation of the residency requirement.&nbsp; This is a good balance between a one-year period, which can be perceived as too tight, and the current five-year period.&nbsp; The 30 days out of the last three years residency requirement, together with the need for an overseas Singaporean to maintain a local contact address with ICA for his name to be entered into a register of electors, will ensure that the eligibility for overseas voting is extended to only those Singaporeans who maintain links to Singapore.&nbsp; All overseas Singaporeans who wish to vote will just need to fulfill this single, new and more liberal residency requirement, regardless of&nbsp;why they are overseas.&nbsp; There will no longer be any separate eligibility for SAF personnel, Government officials and Government scholars on full-time service or full-time study overseas, Singaporeans employed overseas by approved International Organisations, and their immediate family members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the registers of electors were last revised in early 2006, we learned that the United Kingdom (UK) has a law requiring foreign residents from the Commonwealth countries, for which we are one,&nbsp;to register themselves in their electoral registers.&nbsp; As a result, some Singaporeans residing in the UK have unwittingly found their names appearing on the UK electoral registers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1028 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our election law currently disqualifies Singaporeans as electors if their names are entered in the electoral registers of other countries.&nbsp; The rationale for this provision is to exclude any citizen who could be a potential participant in the political process of a foreign State. &nbsp;However, our law does not make any distinction between those who volunteer to be included in the foreign electoral registers and those who are included as a matter of course. &nbsp;The latter has become prevalent in foreign States facing a&nbsp;declining voter registration trends in the&nbsp;recent years.&nbsp; Our provision will be refined to remove this disqualification for overseas Singaporeans who, by reason of their residency status in a foreign country, find themselves included involuntarily in that&nbsp;country's&nbsp;electoral registers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the current registration process for overseas electors requires an applicant to submit a completed and signed registration form, either by hand or registered post, to any overseas registration centre or to the Elections Department directly, within a 21-day period.&nbsp; This registration procedure will be simplified.&nbsp; The Elections Department will provide for online registration via the Internet, and eligible voters can use their SingPass to authenticate their identity in place of their signature.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The Elections Department may ask them for supporting documents for verification. This online facility will make it more convenient for Singaporeans, especially those who are overseas, to apply to restore their names on the Registers of Electors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of such online facilities for registration of overseas voters and the increased use of <p align=left>Column: 1029 </p>information technology and systems in the backend processing will enable transaction and processing time to be significantly shortened.&nbsp; The registration period for overseas voters can therefore be longer than the current 21 days.&nbsp; The registration period will be extended to the date when the writ of election is issued.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, every overseas elector is assigned an overseas polling station to cast his vote.&nbsp; This assignment is done at the time of registration.&nbsp; To cater for situations where voters return to Singapore or relocate to another country, overseas electors will be allowed to deregister or change the assigned overseas polling station at any time, up to when the writ of election is issued.&nbsp; This will allow changes to be made in time for updating&nbsp;the registers&nbsp;for the Polling Day.&nbsp; It will not be advisable to allow changes when the election period has already started, as it will pose a lot of operational difficulties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we try to have more overseas polling stations to allow more Singaporeans overseas to access to vote overseas, the selection of a city for overseas polling must take into account several factors.&nbsp; Firstly, there should be a critical mass of Singaporeans living in the city and country.&nbsp; Secondly, the city must have Singapore Government managed facilities which enable the officials to exercise operational command and control, bearing in mind that it is not Singapore.&nbsp; Thirdly, in order to ensure that we are able to optimise our limited resources, the city and country should not be nearby where Singaporeans can travel back to Singapore to vote on the Polling Day with relative ease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on these considerations, the cities where we can site overseas polling stations are those where we have Consulates or Missions.&nbsp; So far, eight cities where overseas polling stations can be set up in our Missions are Canberra,<p align=left>Column: 1030 </p> Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, London, Washington and San Francisco.&nbsp; We will now add New York to the list.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua asked about&nbsp;voter education and especially helping the elderly take part in the election process.&nbsp; The Elections Department will take a proactive approach to educate our voters.&nbsp; A mix of electronic services and traditional media channels, such as the Internet, mobile phone platform and mass media like the newspapers and TV will be used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the election period, educational brochures on what are required of the voters in order to cast their votes, and the "Do's" and "Don'ts" of the voting process will be mailed to every household.&nbsp; Softcopies of the brochures will also be emailed to overseas Singaporeans who have registered themselves as overseas voters.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, educational videos explaining, in simple language, on the voting procedures on Polling Day and how the secrecy of vote is ensured throughout the whole election process will be produced for television broadcast, video streaming from the Elections Department website and for distribution to community centres, community clubs and RCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Department will also study the various locations where polling stations are conducted so that they are easily accessible even by those who need help because they have physical disabilities or they are old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, from the next election, the&nbsp;Elections Department will engage a professional call centre operator, operating 24 hours during the election period, to handle queries from local and overseas voters in the four official languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To supplement the call centre during the election period, members of the public<p align=left>Column: 1031 </p> can also go to or phone up the community centres for any queries on the election.&nbsp; They can also visit the Elections Department website for information and e-services, send an email to the Elections Department's Feedback Account&nbsp; or send an SMS using their mobile phones to check on their voting eligibility and the location of their assigned polling stations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah called for better interface between&nbsp;candidates and election agents.&nbsp; Sir, the Elections Department&nbsp;&nbsp;will improve its customer interface with candidates and election agents during different phases of the election.&nbsp; According to feedback and enquiries received by the Elections Department at previous General Elections, it is clear that some candidates and agents are simply not sure about how certain rules and procedures operate and how they govern the election activities.&nbsp; To help them better understand such rules and procedures, the Elections Department will produce a guide for candidates and their agents.&nbsp; The guide will be made available on the Elections Department website and will also be printed in&nbsp;booklet form for distribution.&nbsp; However, I must stress that this guide is only a "guide" and not a legal authority or document.&nbsp; While we try to provide as much accurate and useful information as possible in the guide, the publication is not a substitute for the law.&nbsp; Candidates and their agents should refer to the Parliamentary or Presidential Elections Act and the relevant regulations for a detailed description of the law and seek advice from the lawyers, when necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Elections Department will also enhance its e-services to allow candidates and&nbsp;election agents to perform certain transactions online as far as practicable and allow them to download softcopies of the relevant forms which they need to use during the election from the Elections<p align=left>Column: 1032 </p> Department website.&nbsp; In addition, it will also improve the application software on the "CD-Registers of Electors" that candidates can buy.&nbsp; Improved version will contain more user-friendly features, such as allowing the user to save all entered information for subsequent editing.&nbsp; More forms will be added to it, such as forms to apply for certificates from the Malay Community Committee, the Indian and Other Minority Community Committee and the Registrar of Political Donations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To tighten the procedures and workflow for accepting and tracking submissions from candidates and election agents, the enhanced computer system will capture applicants' data upon receipt of the applications.&nbsp; This will ensure that the applications are processed in good time.&nbsp; The system will also print out acknowledgement receipts for all submissions received.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Matthias Yao asked about contingency planning in dealing with the scenarios he sketched out although none has happened in past elections.&nbsp; I am pleased to say that the Elections Department has started to identify possible threats such as natural calamities or other circumstances that may disrupt the conduct of elections during nomination, polling and counting activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp; Elections Department would develop appropriate plans and measures to deal with each of them.&nbsp; And when these are ready, it would be presented to Parliament in the form of an amendment in the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current election laws and regulations do not cater for crisis&nbsp;situations, such as adverse weather or bomb&nbsp;hoax.&nbsp; The Elections Department officials have a very limited range of&nbsp; responses to deal with any such contingency adequately.&nbsp; Legislative amendments will therefore be required to enable the Returning Officer to relocate<p align=left>Column: 1033 </p> the venue of an election activity or to defer the activity deadline by either abandoning or restarting the activity or suspending and resuming the activity later.&nbsp; This will give us the flexibility to respond to contingencies that could disrupt time-sensitive election activities on&nbsp;Nomination Day and Polling Day, while protecting public safety and ensuring the integrity of the election process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Elections Department will consult the Attorney-General's Chambers on the legislative changes to effect these improvements.&nbsp; When ready, the Amendment Bills will be presented to Parliament for approval.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In doing so, we of course increase the purchasing power of Singaporeans when spending overseas and paying for imports,&nbsp;and I guess we all feel a bit richer because of the stronger dollar.&nbsp; However, we also realise that we can only use the exchange rate as a monetary policy up to a&nbsp; certain extent as too strong a Singapore dollar might make our exports and hence our economy uncompetitive.&nbsp; And MAS has acknowledged this reality in reply to a parliamentary Question some years ago.&nbsp; Can the Minister please share with the House whether this monetary policy can continue to work to combat rising imported inflation given the need to keep our exports competitive?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, is MAS thinking of using other tools such as&nbsp;managing the interest rate in addition to the exchange rate as a more effective monetary policy?&nbsp; For example, in US, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve,&nbsp;or the Fed, which is effectively the Central Bank, equivalent to MAS here, has used the interest rate tool actively to manage the US economy to<p align=left>Column: 1034 </p> fight inflation and also to help with&nbsp;credit&nbsp;and liquidity issues.&nbsp; Is this the right time to consider such an addition to Singapore's monetary policy?&nbsp; This could give us an additional tool to manage inflation and overheating or stimulate the economy when necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at the micro level, with the interest rates that have been so low for the past years, the Singapore dollar looks like the Yen today where for many Singaporeans, savings are actually diminishing.&nbsp; At the end of every year, the savings are shrinking, not growing, as a result of this low interest rate regime.&nbsp; So, by managing the interest rate, perhaps, we can also help manage this problem that many Singaporeans are facing.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Should the&nbsp;Singapore dollar be allowed to appreciate at a faster pace to cope with imported inflation?&nbsp; But how far can the Singapore dollar rise without eroding the export competitiveness of the local export?&nbsp; What are the criteria used to balance competitiveness and social discontent with regard to inflation management?&nbsp; Is it the view now that the balance will tip to the latter in view of the fact that most people on modest fixed incomes have little margin to adjust compared to businesses?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Inderjit Singh asked whether the exchange rate as the lever of our monetary policy is effective and whether or not we ought to consider interest rate as an additional lever.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1035 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore chose exchange rate as&nbsp;the main tool of our monetary policy because this is the most appropriate given the structure of the Singapore economy.&nbsp; Singapore economy remains one of the most open economies in the world.&nbsp; As&nbsp;Members all know, total trade amounted to some 350% of our GDP last year and we maintain a very high degree of openness to our capital flows.&nbsp; Studies by MAS over the years have shown that consistently, the exchange rate has a more significant impact on growth and inflation than interest rate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked why not have the interest rate as an additional tool.&nbsp; Once we have a very open capital account, the monetary policy can only influence either the interest rate or the exchange rate, but not both.&nbsp; So, take the example that Mr Inderjit Singh raised that, currently, the interest rates are very low.&nbsp; If you try to have an exchange rate at a certain level and&nbsp;you still want to raise the interest rate, what will happen is that you will attract a lot of inflows of foreign capital and your exchange rate will then strengthen far beyond what was the intended level.&nbsp; So you cannot have both.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given our exchange rate policy regime and our openness to capital flows,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Because of the trend appreciation of the Singapore dollar as a tool to contain inflation, this tends to result in low domestic interest rates, and this has been the case historically and, in fact, it is a good environment for business and economic growth.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1036 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, interest rates in Singapore are historically about 1% to 2% or sometimes even 3% below US interest rates, given the trend appreciation of the Singapore dollar.&nbsp; Let me just say that&nbsp;what Mr Inderjit Singh said, that&nbsp;we have been in a negative interest rate environment for some years now, is not accurate.&nbsp; In fact, up to the middle of last year, our inflation rate was very low and it was lower than our interest rates.&nbsp; It was only since late last year, as the nominal rates declined in Singapore following the drop in the US interest rates, that real interest rates have also come off and that we face this negative interest rate phenomenon.&nbsp; But our experience has shown that negative interest rates in Singapore have typically been short-lived and reflect cyclical factors, such as&nbsp;slowing growth and the higher consumer prices in the global economy.&nbsp; In fact, when we measure real interest rates against longer-term inflation expectations, we will see that these have not fallen as significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo asked similar questions and whether this is the appropriate stance.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained, this is the balance that we have to strike between tackling inflation and also not hindering our export competitiveness.&nbsp; She asked whether or not we would allow the Singapore dollar to appreciate at a faster pace.&nbsp; As hon. Members know, in our last policy review in October 2007, MAS increased slightly the slope of its policy band, allowing a slightly faster rate of appreciation of the Singapore dollar.&nbsp; At that time, already there was heightened uncertainty in the external economic environment, including the financial markets, and MAS' response was to counter the inflationary pressures that were already building up.&nbsp; So the MAS exchange rate policy stance has therefore helped to keep inflation low by dampening some of the higher import costs.&nbsp; But we must be clear that we cannot insulate ourselves completely from the effects of higher global prices.&nbsp; It is <p align=left>Column: 1037 </p>important to recognise that there is a limit to how fast the Singapore dollar can appreciate without hurting our growth and, eventually, causing employment and wages to fall.&nbsp; MAS will continue to monitor the price and cost developments in our economy very closely.&nbsp; In the next scheduled policy review in April, MAS will be carefully reviewing the macro-economic conditions and will then determine the most appropriate policy, going forward.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Although it is not an accurate reflection on the value and benefits older workers bring to the workforce, general sentiments among organisations still tend to view hiring of older workers as having more constraints than those of a younger workforce.&nbsp; While I acknowledge the importance of talent renewal and infusion of new skills, public services in some countries, eg, Canada, have faced a significant loss of institutional knowledge and experience with the retirement of their public servants.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To manage talent successfully, organisations must recognise that their talent strategies cannot rest solely on their top performers.&nbsp; Different things make different people of ages and gender want to work and remain in the organisation.&nbsp; Hence, there should be also added capabilities and encouragement to develop different solutions for this segment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister:&nbsp; The Civil Service has been a forerunner in many innovations and leading practices and is one of the largest employers in <p align=left>Column: 1038 </p>Singapore, hiring more than 60,000 workers.&nbsp; What measures has the Civil Service taken to attract older talent as well as to encourage them to stay on or to retire later?&nbsp; Apart from encouraging the hiring and retention of older workers and rehiring of older workers, have there been programmes to recognise and reward the value provided by an experienced workforce?&nbsp; What has the trend been for the Civil Service in terms of hiring and retraining of older workers in the last year and how effective have the programmes been?&nbsp; In the constant challenge of getting talent and to provide opportunities for greater workforce participation, what is being done in the civil service to enable the elderly to stay in their jobs and, more importantly, enjoy their work as well?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefits include more than just having&nbsp;a larger workforce participation or accommodating employees' needs.&nbsp; Organisations, employers and society will benefit.&nbsp; There are many examples to show that organisations that have the ability to align work structures and practices with the needs of employees remain a significant source of&nbsp;de-stress for employees and their families and contribute to increased commitment and performance for companies.&nbsp; That said, the ability to do this will make our concept of working longer not just a reality but a success, and I would like to really hear what the civil service could help in doing this.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I thank Members who have raised various suggestions on how we can improve our service delivery or adopt good practices in the public service.&nbsp; A number of Members have spoken about this during the main Budget debate.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service has, over the years, placed strong emphasis on its people.&nbsp; Some Members have touched on Government scholarships and the need for current public sector leaders to keep in touch with the ground.&nbsp; Our scholarship schemes have worked well to provide a steady inflow of able and committed young persons into the civil service.&nbsp; We also have programmes to ensure that our officers, including those who have been on scholarships,&nbsp;better appreciate the issues and needs of ordinary Singaporeans.&nbsp; This has enabled us over the years to maintain the high quality of our people, of the civil service as a whole, and to develop effective and forward-looking policies for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible employer, the public service has, over the years, placed strong emphasis on equipping our people with the skills not only for their current jobs but, wherever possible, for future challenges as well.&nbsp; This includes looking at ways to enhance the employability of our officers.&nbsp; This is of particular importance and relevance for older workers.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah and Ms Jessica Tan have both asked for an update on the hiring and re-hiring of older workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public service recognises the value of older workers.&nbsp; National re-<p align=left>Column: 1041 </p>employment legislation will come into effect in 2012.&nbsp; As a large employer, the public service will be at the forefront and be ready for this two years in advance, by 2010.&nbsp; To achieve this, the Public Service Division has been working closely with our&nbsp;partners in the unions along two broad fronts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we encourage public sector agencies to view older workers as a strategic manpower resource.&nbsp; Given our ageing population, there will be an increasing pool of older workers and retired public officers with a wealth of experience which we can tap on.&nbsp; We are studying how we can better attract and retain older workers, for example, by identifying jobs that can be performed more effectively by older workers or by introducing work arrangements that are more attractive to such workers, to enjoy themselves, as Ms Jessica Tan said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we are preparing managers, supervisors and the officers themselves for re-employment.&nbsp; There is a need to engage and equip older workers to manage their careers at different life stages.&nbsp; We need to encourage these officers to continually upgrade and equip themselves with relevant skills to remain employable.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the civil service has introduced the Employability Skills System as a core training programme for junior officers, and we reward them through the Training Incentive Scheme when they attain national-level certification.&nbsp; We are also redesigning jobs and providing training for our Corporate and Operations Support officers to make best use of their full potential.&nbsp; We want these officers, many of whom are older workers, to have skills that are relevant to the public service and the marketplace of the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSD has, therefore, worked closely with the unions to identify possible improvements and changes in our Ministries and statutory boards to <p align=left>Column: 1042 </p>enhance the employability and employment of older workers.&nbsp; For instance, there are jobs where the industry experience of mid-career recruits or institutional knowledge of retired staff can be an asset.&nbsp; The Ministry of Manpower is one good example.&nbsp; It is tapping extensively on the experience of mid-career recruits for jobs related to occupational safety.&nbsp; It has also re-employed retired staff with specialist skills to mentor and guide young officers dealing with labour relations.&nbsp; Public sector agencies which are involved in exporting their capability in areas, such as civil service reforms, financial budgeting and urban planning, are also increasingly tapping on their retired personnel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mdm Halimah has noted, PSD is also currently working with three pilot agencies&nbsp;&ndash; the Ministry of Education, the Singapore Police Force and the Ministry of Manpower&nbsp;&ndash; to establish the processes needed to ensure a smooth implementation of the civil service re-employment policy by 2010.&nbsp; Together with the unions, we have carried out focus group discussions with&nbsp;the three pilot sites to engage&nbsp;and better understand the concerns of our workers about&nbsp;re-employment.&nbsp; Many are open to being re-employed.&nbsp; A number would like&nbsp;less demanding jobs upon re-employment.&nbsp; Many also expressed a preference for more flexible working arrangements, such as part-time work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The larger Ministries, like the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Education, have organised pre-retirement planning seminars for their retiring officers and teachers for some years now.&nbsp; This is a good practice which we are extending to the rest of the civil service.&nbsp; PSD has worked with the Civil Service College and NTUC to provide pre-retirement planning courses to help public officers think ahead and plan for their lives after retirement, and the first batch of participants from the pilot sites attended the pre-retirement<p align=left>Column: 1043</p> planning course in November and December last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, the results of our efforts to hire older workers have been modest but it is still early days.&nbsp; In 2007, 368 officers in their 40s&nbsp;were recruited into the civil service.&nbsp; This is an increase from the average number of 270 per year from 2004 to 2006.&nbsp; Similarly, 360 officers above 50 years old were recruited in 2007, which is an increase from the average number of 207 per year from 2004 to 2006.&nbsp; So we are recruiting officers in their 40s and 50s and, if you add the two numbers together, that is 728 last year.&nbsp; Not insignificant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the recruitment of older workers&nbsp;aged 40 years and above comprised about 13% of the Civil Service&rsquo;s total recruitment in 2007, which is higher compared with 10% in 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also made some progress in re-employment in the Civil Service.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, the number of officers who were re-employed at age 62 years was about 57% of the number of officers who retired at age 62. This is a 4%-point increase compared with 53% in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, many retired officers are engaged on short-term assignments on a contract-for-service basis.&nbsp; So this is beyond the 57%.&nbsp; More than 1,100 retired officers were hired on this mode in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PSD will continue to push ahead with our efforts, taking guidance from the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah also asked for an update on work-life initiatives in the Public Service.&nbsp;The public service recognises that enhancing employees' work-life <p align=left>Column: 1044 </p>harmony would lead to better individual and organisational performance.&nbsp;Every public agency now has a Work-Life Advocate and a Work-Life Ambassador.&nbsp;The Work-Life Advocate is a champion who takes steps to ensure that good work-life practices are in place in the agency.&nbsp;In&nbsp;a Ministry, this appointment is held by the Deputy Secretary and in the statutory board, typically by the Deputy CEO.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Work-Life Ambassador is an officer whose main job responsibility is to promote and facilitate the day-to-day work-life programmes in his agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such programmes could be as basic as helping officers to improve&nbsp;their communications with their staff so that there are less misunderstood instructions, less stress and thereby easing their workload.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Centrally, PSD will also set up communities of practice to share best practices across Ministries. Today, civil servants can already opt for several forms of flexible work arrangements like part-time work and tele-commuting. We will explore how we can fully utilise such flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our employees also have to play their part. Supervisors need to learn how to build a supportive work environment. We have also introduced training programmes to help our officers prioritise work and personal demands.&nbsp; There will also be programmes to help enhance individual resilience in meeting life challenges as well as to build the supportive work environment with co-workers. And we will welcome suggestions from Mdm Halimah and also from those who have experience in the private sector on the issues of employing older workers and getting a better work-life balance.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; We still have some time before "guillotine".&nbsp; Do Members have any clarifications to make?</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><p align=left>Column: 1045 </p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> Sir, I have requested for the Government to consider providing English and Chinese language courses for new citizens.&nbsp; Maybe these courses should be conducted at the CCs so that the new citizens can learn these languages for communication and bonding.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Currently, our CCs do conduct courses for all kinds of foreign languages and I will&nbsp;certainly ask the PA to consider organising courses for those immigrants who need to beef up their English or Mandarin.

So, that is quite a lot of people who we re-employ.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that some of the statutory boards, even with workers at the lower levels, they have redesigned jobs and were&nbsp;able to re-absorb them into other kinds of work, for example, technicians and those who are doing various kinds of maintenance work.&nbsp; I believe the NParks Board and&nbsp;the National Environment Agency&nbsp;have also been quite successful in re-employing many of the older workers and redeploying them in other jobs.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo:</B> Sir, I did&nbsp;also&nbsp;ask about&nbsp;the reward and recognition, not so much reward, but more&nbsp;recognition, because the Civil Service, as I have mentioned earlier, sets the tone as a forerunner in&nbsp;terms of the<p align=left>Column: 1047 </p> best practices and&nbsp;it will really be good if we talk about&nbsp;re-hiring of the older workers, not just in numbers, but in their contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned earlier, there is this perception that older workers tend to be a more difficult workforce to manage.&nbsp; But actually, they do bring a lot of values and benefits to the workforce as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think profiling them and bringing some of that up to public knowledge will also be a help to the rest of the organisations.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> That is a good suggestion which we will certainly see how we can take up.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member):</B> Sir,&nbsp;yesterday, I mentioned about the bond and asked&nbsp;whether we would review&nbsp;the bond since it discourages&nbsp;people, especially people from families with wealth, who can afford to go overseas on parents' scholarship.&nbsp; Can we make our scholarship bond&nbsp;less unattractive?&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made two suggestions.&nbsp; One is to reduce the length to three years and, secondly, to make it&nbsp;a bond to Singapore, not just to the Government service.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> I have some difficulties, I must admit, Sir,&nbsp;understanding Dr Loo's suggestions.&nbsp; If a&nbsp;young person comes from a family of wealth and he wishes to go away and study at a top university somewhere else, and he has not quite decided whether he wants to join the public service, then really he is not a very strong candidate for a scholarship, and he can go on his own.&nbsp; So shortening the bond overall for everyone, just because there may be a few people from wealthy families who want to go away and study and want a scholarship, but do not want the bond, does not seem to me to be addressing the key issue that we have here.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1048 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we want&nbsp;are young people who are committed to the public service, prepared to come in and do something with their lives which&nbsp;are useful.&nbsp; They feel that what they want to commit their lives to is not necessarily the bottom line of a particular company, or to enrich the shareholders of a particular company, but to enrich the lives of Singaporeans as a whole, to contribute something to Singapore.&nbsp; These are the people that PSC interviews&nbsp;very carefully and brings them in.&nbsp; These are the people who have no difficulty in committing themselves to a bond - bright, able, young Singaporeans.

There is no good reason why the public service should be providing scholarships, especially for wealthy people who do not have an interest in serving the public service, to go away to study, come back and work in the private sector. That does not seem to be meeting our objective. What we do need is to ensure that we have a continual flow of dedicated young people who are prepared to come into the public service, so that there is a constant flow of people who come in and can maintain the very high quality Civil Service that we have, which really provides the undergirding and&nbsp;foundation upon which the private sector in Singapore can function in the way that it does, and enable Singapore to remain as competitive as it is.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><p align=left>Column: 1049 </p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Sir, the Minister&nbsp;gave&nbsp;a description for the Work-Life Ambassador&nbsp;and&nbsp;Work-Life Advocate.&nbsp; I was hoping that the Minister could go beyond that and actually give us an insight as to what really has changed, in terms of providing greater work-life balance in the&nbsp;Civil Service as a result of the appointment of these&nbsp;Work-Life Ambassadors and Advocates. Obviously, the appointment of the Ambassadors and&nbsp;Advocates is meant to be reflective of certain changes &ndash; value systems,&nbsp;training of supervisors, managers, and other areas.&nbsp;I am afraid that I do not get a sense of that other than the description of what the scheme is about. I would appreciate an elaboration on that.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> Sir, I would say that work-life balance in a Ministry or any organisation is about as much as creating the right environment and the right approach and attitude as it is about programmes and specific activities.&nbsp; You can organise a lot of activities in a work setting but actually you may be taking away employees from their families, which is exactly what they want to do. We may organise a lot of training and again, you may be taking the employees away from the families and the other things that they want to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;That may not necessarily be contributing to a good work-life balance.&nbsp; So I think awareness is probably the single most important thing amongst the supervisors as well as the employees themselves, that they strike a balance. We see four quadrants&nbsp;in a work-life framework that guides all these initiatives - self, work, family and friends, and community.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self is about achieving personal well-being, encompassing body, mind and spirit. Work is about having purpose, meaning and challenge of work, a career that provides recognition, reward, professional development and continuous learning.&nbsp; Family and friends are about developing and strengthening significant <p align=left>Column: 1050 </p>relationships that include family, friends and significant others.&nbsp; And community is about developing a whole person through corporate and personal contributions to society. So we see this on a multiple dimension. Different organisations have different work tempos and work rhythms.&nbsp; What we are doing now is that we are asking the Ambassadors and the Advocates to see how best they can fit this in with the employees that they have.&nbsp; They also have different employee profiles. Some have a large number of older workers, some have a large number of younger workers, some have workers who are professionals, some have workers who are doing jobs at a technical or simpler level. So there are different requirements in each organisation.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> Sir, a question on overseas voting.&nbsp; At last year's COS, I raised the issue of overseas voting as well.&nbsp; And one of the matters which I asked the Prime Minister's Office to consider was whether it is possible for the overseas voters to vote earlier so that their votes could arrive in time to be mixed with the local votes on polling day. DPM Wong mentioned that the Elections Department would look into&nbsp;its feasibility&nbsp;and&nbsp;implications.&nbsp; My concern is that in some of the single seat constituencies especially, the number of&nbsp; overseas voters could be as low as two people.&nbsp; So there may be some concern about anonymity.&nbsp; I wonder whether the Elections Department has actually evaluated whether it is feasible to get the overseas voters to vote earlier, so that their votes can be counted together with the local votes.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Because if they vote, say, three or<p align=left>Column: 1051 </p> four days before the actual polling day so that their votes can arrive in time for&nbsp;counting on the same night after polling closes, it would mean that they will have four or five days of listening to campaign speeches or watching at what goes on in Singapore from overseas, and they may not have enough information to form a conclusion.&nbsp; It would not be fair to expect them to vote so early before polling closes.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue that we now face is the situation that Ms Lim described,&nbsp;in the case of a constituency&nbsp;with very few overseas&nbsp;Singaporeans voting&nbsp;in that particular constituency.&nbsp; I am not sure whether the situation will hold for a long time, especially when more Singaporeans go overseas.&nbsp; There may be such situations.&nbsp; One possibility would be, for example, for us to see how to put aside some votes in Singapore that will be mixed up with the overseas votes if the number is&nbsp;really that small.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will know that early enough.&nbsp; But, again, it will also mean a delay in the announcement of the results of those constituencies.&nbsp; So there are many implications of deciding on an early overseas voting for Singaporeans who are overseas.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I have explained many times in this House before why we have a serial number behind the ballot paper.&nbsp; The reason is very simple.&nbsp; When there is a dispute, eg, there are more votes counted than there are voters in a particular constituency, then we know ballot papers have been stuffed into the ballot boxes.&nbsp; We can then trace every number and see where the extra ballot papers came from.&nbsp; If we do not have that system, and I am sure Mr Low and Members here would have also read that in some countries where they do not have such a system, they find more ballot papers than the voters.&nbsp; I am sure we do not want to have that kind of situation here.&nbsp; So, we ensure&nbsp;the integrity of the ballot paper by having a serial number at the back of the ballot paper.&nbsp; But there is no way of tracing the votes, unless the court so orders when there is a dispute in terms of the vote.&nbsp; For that, one has to petition the court to open the ballot&nbsp;boxes in order to check the ballot papers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On educating voters on vote secrecy, that will be done.&nbsp; I can assure Mr Low that we will do that.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><p align=left>Column: 1054 </p><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is also one of our most important competitive advantages up there with our political stability and our educated workforce.&nbsp; It is a principle we should hold dear and strive to enhance.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to address two key aspects of our legal system.&nbsp; The first relates to the business law regime which supports Singapore's financial sector and the commercial dealings that underpin our economy.&nbsp; The second relates to the personal or criminal law which affects all of us as individuals and contributes to our social environment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the first aspect, and as mentioned by Dr Teo, the comprehensive report was issued last year by a committee under the distinguished chairmanship of Justice V K Rajah, Judge of Appeal.&nbsp; I should disclose my personal interest as a member of that committee as well as being a partner in a law firm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report covered the entire spectrum of legal services and made far-reaching recommendations in many areas, <p align=left>Column: 1057 </p>including the liberalisation of our legal profession.&nbsp; This calls for the introduction of two vehicles for international law firms to practise Singapore law - an enhanced joint law&nbsp;venture (JLV) and qualifying foreign law firms (QFLF).&nbsp; These recommendations have been accepted by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do we need to allow foreign practices into the Singapore legal market, which has traditionally been the preserve of our local firms?&nbsp; This is to attract foreign lawyers to Singapore and to anchor those already here even more firmly&nbsp; -&nbsp; all to swell the pool of intellectual capital within our shores, the better to service the mega deals that are becoming common place here.&nbsp; But then, why do we not simply allow any foreign law firm to set up here and advise on local law?&nbsp; The answer lies in the integral role that the law plays in the fabric of our society.&nbsp; Our well-regarded legal system rests not just on the law books but on the whole panoply of judges, state counsels and private practitioners.&nbsp; If we were to allow foreign firms to practise here totally without restriction, we would see,&nbsp;over time, that our local law firms would weaken before the greater economic muscle of international law firms who could hire away their best lawyers, and they would slide to become second or third tier firms.&nbsp; This has quite a deleterious impact on our legal profession - to give just one example on the quality of our judges.&nbsp; We draw our judges from the local firms</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>because we need judges who are not only proficient in the law but steep in our culture and beliefs and embracing the values of our multi-racial society. Weaker law firms mean fewer outstanding candidates to become our judges.&nbsp; So the key is to strike a balance between liberalisation and liberalising too fast. This is to allow our homegrown firms some scope to adapt and&nbsp;upgrade themselves to compete with the very best foreign firms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1058 </p><p>5.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The devil, as usual, lies in the details. The Ministry has rightly formed sub-committee to oversee the implementation of these recommendations. One key task would be to identify the target group of foreign firms which should be encouraged to partner local firms in forming joint law venture and the sort of firms which should be allowed to go on their own as a qualifying foreign law firm. This is my suggestion. Enhanced joint venture should be targeted at the very largest international firms&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;those with extensive branch networks -&nbsp;which aim to capture a substantial share of the legal market, both here and in the region. They should be encouraged to link up with&nbsp;the local partner to their mutual benefit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The international firm will benefit from the local firm's contacts and highly educated workforce. The Singapore firm will benefit from the extensive know-how and infrastructure support of the international partner.&nbsp; In the process,&nbsp;our Singapore lawyers get to learn from the best international practices and gain exposure to cutting-edge transactions in the region. Some of these lawyers will leave our shores but a good number will stay here&nbsp;and the upgrading effect on them can&nbsp;only serve our country well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The qualifying foreign law firm structure where the foreign firm does not need to have a local partner should be aimed at those firms whose main objective is to follow their clients to Singapore, rather&nbsp;than to compete for local or regional clients.&nbsp; Typically, it would be those servicing the international investment banks, hedge funds and the like, but not trying to grow their presence beyond that. To attract those law firms here and in turn make the environment more conducive for the financial institutions,&nbsp;they advise that&nbsp;they should be allowed the greater freedom of flying solo without having to pair up with the Singapore law firm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1059</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning now to the other aspect of the laws governing the individual. Our criminal justice system has rightly attracted widespread praise for its rigour, efficiency and the results it has delivered over largely crime-free Singapore. Yet, it has its blocks and it is hoped the upcoming review of the Criminal Procedure Code will seize the opportunity to clear these away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Dr Teo, I am referring to the dearth of protection given to accused persons in terms of getting copies of the statements they have given to the Police during investigation and also getting access to legal counsel. The absence of strict rules relating to discovery in criminal proceedings means that all too often a statement is sprung upon the defendant at or shortly before the trial.&nbsp; For an accused who has&nbsp;undergone a lengthy investigation, given several statements, it might be almost impossible to recall in detail everything that was contained in the&nbsp;statement signed maybe a year ago. After all, which of you in this House would consider it fair to sign a document and not get a copy of it. Yet, that is the system that prevails in our Subordinate Courts. In the High Court, they have adopted the procedure of giving an accused copies of his own statements, which makes the dichotomy of practice all the harder to justify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area where we can surely improve on is giving&nbsp;an accused person access to legal counsel. Again, many of us have seen televised legal dramas where the accused refuses to answer any questions before he sees his lawyer. Well, that would not get him very far in Singapore and probably rightly so. In some countries, the scales are so tilted in favour of&nbsp;an accused that murderers can walk free on a technicality. We should not aspire to that model. But that does not mean we cannot impose some time&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1060 </p> period, say, one to two weeks for the Police to complete their investigations and then let the accused see his lawyer. Provision can be made for extending that period in more complex cases by applying to a judge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what we have now is&nbsp;accused persons who are questioned for several weeks or even months without ever seeing a lawyer. No one wishes to hamstring our law enforcement agency so that they cannot carry out their duties efficiently. But it is necessary to maintain a proper balance between the interest of the individual and the State. It is possible to introduce these measures and still maintain our sparkling enforcement record with additional effort and discipline. It is feature of a civilised society that rules of fair play prevail, and if one needs an economic reason, it contributes to the overall attractiveness of Singapore as a place to work and live.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Review of the Dip Sing Course and Criminal Procedure Code</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Madam,&nbsp;the recent Report of the Committee to Develop the Singapore Legal Sector chaired by Judge of Appeal V K Rajah stated, and I quote, "the Committee received anecdotal feedback that the Dip Sing Course has outlived its utility and that some Dip Sing students find the course to be unproductive because it often repeats the content of courses already taken overseas."&nbsp;The Report was spot on about the anecdotal evidence.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In November last year, the Temasek Society, a UK-based Singapore students&rsquo; society, invited Mr Lim Siong Guan, Dr Lim Wee Kiak and myself to speak to about&nbsp; 400 Singaporean students in London. After the forum, at least one dozen law students from different faculties in the UK told me that they wanted to return to Singapore to practise law at some point in their careers, but<p align=left>Column: 1061 </p> that the Dip Sing Course was a major disincentive to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the students indicated that the Dip Sing requires them to repeat subjects they have already studied. Secondly, Dip&nbsp;Sing, being a one year full-time course, delays their pay cheque by one whole year. The students I spoke to indicated that they were better off taking up a training contract in a London-based law firm. This view was held even though a training contract would require them to take the one-year full time Legal Practice Course.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears that having to do the Dip Sing Course in order to qualify at the Singapore Bar has the negative consequence of discouraging &nbsp;the overseas law student-turned-lawyer from returning to practise in Singapore. There is a solution to this -&nbsp;remove the Dip Sing requirement. Therefore, I ask, would the Ministry of Law be open to removing the Dip Sing requirement for returning law students? Instead, returning law students could undergo training more relevant to practice, along the lines of the Vocational Training Course recommended in the V K Rajah Report. By fusing the Dip Sing and the current Practical Law Course into a one year VTC or Vocational Training Course, the affected law student (a) broadens his knowledge of local law by studying areas which he has not studied before and are, in fact, relevant to his future local practice; and (b) receives his first pay cheque, it seems, six months quicker (compared to the current system). This will go a long way to help meet the demand for locally qualified practising lawyers in Singapore. To this end, can Ministry of Law allocate resources to this proposal?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a separate note, the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill was passed &ndash; it constituted a thorough review of the Code and will go a long way to ensure the law <p align=left>Column: 1062 </p>punishes new, innovative crimes with appropriate sentences and an up-to-date fine structure. However, to allow the amended Penal Code to have its full effect, it must be complemented with up-to-date criminal procedure. To this end, can Ministry of Law allocate resources to ensure the CPC review is completed expeditiously?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Supply of Lawyers</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Madam, the supply of lawyers in Singapore is an issue which has vexed this House for a number of years. In 1993,&nbsp; restrictions were imposed on who may practise law in Singapore,&nbsp;eg, a minimum Second Class Lower Honours from NUS or a minimum Second Class Honours or Upper Honours from a list of 15 UK universities. The rationale given then was&nbsp; a need &nbsp;to check the growing numbers of lawyers which could lead to a misallocation of valuable manpower resources, result in&nbsp;the creation of an over-litigious society and lower the standard of practice. Specific universities were identified to ensure quality control.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But like our family planning policy, these measures proved too effective. In 2001, Members of this House highlighted the growing shortage of lawyers in Singapore. That same year, the Minister for Law informed this House that based on projections concerning the size&nbsp;of Singapore population and the growth of the economy, there would&nbsp;likely be an increased&nbsp;demand for lawyers in the next 10 years. So over the next few years, the qualifying criterion was relaxed to allow more to qualify,&nbsp;eg, the top 30% of some Australian universities, the top 40% of&nbsp; four US universities. But the problem did not go away. Despite the perception that lawyers earn a good living,&nbsp;reasons such as job stress and long hours kept&nbsp;law graduates away from the profession or hasten their departure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1063 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in the period 2001 to 2006, while the population and the economy grew, the number of legal practitioners actually fell from 3,524 to 3,476. More worryingly, most of those leaving were young lawyers. So, far from growing in numbers, like the rest of the general population, lawyers were not replacing themselves. Recently, we have further relaxed the rules. Now, &nbsp;graduates from the selected universities who meet a lower academic standard will qualify, provided&nbsp;they have engaged in work of a legal nature for at least three years. Sir, these changes are welcomed but we need more immediate measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, law firms are finding it extremely difficult to recruit. Big firms are seeing high turnover despite paying record salaries. Many medium and small law firms do not even receive applications. Some cannot even find pupils. The situation will be aggravated when we open our doors to foreign law firms to practise Singapore law. It will not just be the private practices that are affected, the drain will affect the Legal Service as well. Ultimately, those who remain will face even greater stress and longer working hours. I suggest we do away with these qualifying criteria. The many exceptions and qualifications have made them too cumbersome. Besides, to use a person's academic results to determine his ability to practise is a blunt and sometimes unfair instrument.&nbsp; There are many good lawyers now in private practice who may not have qualified under the current criteria. Others have spent enormous resources getting a degree but cannot realise their dreams of becoming a lawyer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These criteria can also be counted as intuitive. It may make more sense for a person to go to an Australian university of a slightly lower standing to ensure he gets into a top 30% instead of a top-notch university&nbsp;where he faces more <p align=left>Column: 1064 </p>competition. In that event, how are we better off?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, if the quality of lawyers is a&nbsp;concern, we should have better control of the admission criteria. Why rely on foreign university to determine who gets in and who does not? We can do that by a simple mechanism of setting appropriate standards for&nbsp;our Practical Law Course. The PLC focuses on matters more practical and relevant to the practices of&nbsp; law. Its examinations can be the sole gatekeeper and be set at a standard which separates the wheat from the chaff. Those who have&nbsp;the quality should have no concern.&nbsp; This will also be a second chance for those who did not do well enough in the university examinations.&nbsp; And we can also do away with the Diploma in Singapore&nbsp;Law (Dip Sing) Course&nbsp;at the same time. By this simple mechanism, we will be able to address the issue of supply and quality more directly and immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a unique proposition. The New York Bar examinations are well known for its high standards, the failure rate is high and they make no apologies for that.&nbsp; It is, therefore,&nbsp;no coincidence that&nbsp;passing the New York Bar is seen in the US and in many parts of the world as the gold standard for US lawyers. There&nbsp;is no reason why our local Bar examinations cannot be a standard bearer for quality as well, not just in Singapore but for Asia. At the time when we are trying to promote our legal services and the use of&nbsp;Singapore lawyers globally, this mark of quality will be an advantage.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Review of Criminal Procedure</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Madam, there are two best practices from developed countries which I believe should be adopted to strengthen our criminal justice system. The first is the video recording of statements and confessions taken by Police from accused persons. This<p align=left>Column: 1065 </p> practice is in place in Australian states, the UK and several states in the US. Having video recording has&nbsp;proven to be good for both the prosecution as well as&nbsp;the defence. For the prosecution, it protects police officers from groundless accusations that they mistreated the suspect or did not accurately record what the suspect said.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Video recording in other countries was found to have saved lots of Police and court time as more accused persons decided to plead guilty after watching the video recordings. For the defence, video recording helped to ensure that there was no mistreatment of the accused during the statement recording and that the record accurately reflected what the accused said.&nbsp; The technology for video recording is now relatively accessible and inexpensive. If adopted, this practice will encourage all to maintain high standards in law enforcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the second aspect is that the Ministry should provide a legal framework for comprehensive pre-trial disclosure of evidence.&nbsp; The issue is one of fairness.&nbsp; Currently, our Criminal Procedure Code already puts an obligation on the suspect to disclose his defence early&nbsp;when he is under investigation and he is warned that if he does not disclose it, the Court is less likely to believe him.&nbsp; The prosecution should likewise disclose early what evidence it has, whether it intends to use the material or not.

As we sign more international instruments, we could be involved in more related disputes.&nbsp; The apparent trend is: Singapore will be increasingly engaged in international law matters. &nbsp;How does the Minister see the place of international law within our legal infrastructure?&nbsp; Are there sufficient local lawyers to handle international law matters?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A superficial comparison shows that Malaysia's International Affairs Department has 50 federal counsels, while Singapore has 15.&nbsp; Apparently, our FTA activity exceeds Malaysia's.&nbsp; Are sufficient resources allocated to supply enough advisors for periodic FTA reviews?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, an elite Euro-American tribe of international lawyers monopolise litigation and arbitration.&nbsp; In the long term, we must avoid over-reliance on expensive foreign counsel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1067</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, international law was Euro-centric, serving the colonial agenda; in today's plural world, it must serve the interests of all, not the few.&nbsp; As a clear majority in multilateral forums like the UN, small states have a voice in shaping a just international order.&nbsp; Singapore must have her piece of the pie.&nbsp; We do not presume to spread a <I>Lex Singapura</I>; only to defend our sovereign interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distinguished Singapore lawyers were involved in matters like drafting UNCLOS.&nbsp; However, we need to develop a new generation of international lawyers&nbsp;&ndash; who knows, one day a Singaporean might sit on the World Court or International Law Commission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we best channel resources to develop local international law expertise?&nbsp; I raise a few points for the Minister to consider.&nbsp; First, IAD officers may be better placed to cultivate specialist knowledge by being assigned to divisions handling specific issues, like trade or boundaries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, international legal information could be made more accessible, promoting transparency.&nbsp; Like legislation, treaties concluded with other states could be made available online for free, through a regularly updated database.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we should promote continuing international legal education.&nbsp; The Law Society now has an International Law Committee, demonstrating growing interest within the profession.&nbsp; Aside from holding expert seminars, international lawyers could be trained by facilitating internships in international organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, academia has a role to play; subjects like banking law are affected by international anti-terrorist measures; legal education is thus deficient, without some international law knowledge. Today, our<p align=left>Column: 1068 </p> law schools offer a menu of specialist international law subjects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Symbiotic linkages between practitioners and academics could be explored, to ensure that practical and aspirational mindsets engage.&nbsp; IAD could conduct student workshops on topics like obstacles in negotiating FTAs, providing real world insight and career inspiration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, to broaden our perspectives as global citizens in a global city with a global hinterland, the IAD could promote public outreach by providing basic international law information on its website, such as what treaties are, and how treaties serve the national interest.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This clearly shows the need for such free legal advice at the community.&nbsp; Many residents cannot afford to engage a lawyer to represent them for matters such as divorce, personal protection, claims or dispute settlements.&nbsp; As a result, many have not resolved their problems and are suffering in silence.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing accessible and affordable legal advice and information is instrumental to exercising human rights.&nbsp; Very often, the lower income or working class people are at a disadvantage when faced with legal issues.&nbsp; Many have been conned into purchasing dubious consumer products or services, property transactions, investments, renovation works or involved in family and neighbour disputes.&nbsp; Without proper legal advice, most of them do not know how to exercise their rights and take legal action to safeguard their interests and also to eradicate these conmen or dubious&nbsp;companies from operating in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1069 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, we need to provide more protection to the vulnerables in our society,&nbsp;especially the elderly, children and the ill-informed.&nbsp; More public education programmes on legal rights should be conducted to protect these vulnerables so as to prevent them from being abused or cheated.&nbsp; I would urge the Ministry to identify common&nbsp;legal issues faced by Singaporeans and take preventive measures to prevent the re-occurrences of such problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, I wish to ask the Ministry the following questions:&nbsp; (1) What are the Ministry's plan to expand the Community Legal Clinics to provide <I>pro bono</I> legal services for Singaporeans, especially the heartlanders?&nbsp; (2) What is the profile of cases handled at the Community Legal Clinics at North West and South East CDCs; and (3) What are the public education programmes conducted by the Ministry?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The gap between those eligible for legal aid and those that can afford private legal representation in court is widening considerably.&nbsp; The legal clinics run by the Law Society are well patronised.&nbsp; The problem is that the lawyers at these clinics can only advise the people they see but cannot represent them in court.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal costs continue to rise.&nbsp; An uncontested divorce costs about $3,000.&nbsp; The total cost of a divorce and ancillary matters can exceed $10,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal aid cases can be generally divided into two categories.&nbsp; The first concerns all types of monetary claims.&nbsp; The second category includes matrimonial proceedings, adoption, accident claims, claims for outstanding salary and probate matters.&nbsp; The cases in the second category are usually unavoidable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1070 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I realise the means test was only reviewed last year, I propose having different means test for different types of cases.&nbsp; For example, where cases concern the second category, the means test can allow for higher limits, particularly where disposable capital is concerned.&nbsp; $10,000 in disposable capital can be the total cost of a divorce.&nbsp; Where monetary claims are concerned, eg, a claim for a debt, lower limits may be imposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I also ask the Minister to clarify the scope of the discretion exercised by the Director of Legal Aid where an applicant does not satisfy the means test and the types of situations where such discretion will be exercised in favour of the applicant?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They deal with disputes which are more relational in nature, including between family members, neighbours and even among friends.&nbsp; As long as they are not legal or commercial in nature, CMCs will deal with disputes when both parties agree to attend them voluntarily or when referred to, say, by the court, Police or an MP.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless the parties are referred by the courts, neither party is obliged by law to attend a CMC session.&nbsp; In this instance, I believe there is an implementation issue.&nbsp; While the agreement, when signed, states specifically its binding nature, ensuring compliance to what was agreed has proven onerous, especially when one or both parties have not entered into agreement in good faith.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1071 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There must have been many disputes that have been carrying on for so long that both parties must have felt aggrieved enough to need a third party to mediate.&nbsp; I believe, therefore, that the CMC is a good initiative that will enable disputing parties to avoid the long legal and costly route and a mechanism that allows a third party to objectively mediate the parties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many hon. Members, I have encountered neighbourhood disputes that have gone through the CMC process but have not resolved itself.&nbsp; Residents continue to come to&nbsp;the meet-the-people sessions (MPS)&nbsp;to complain about their neighbour, despite having agreed to take active steps to minimise or resolve their differences at the CMC.&nbsp; Often, their squabbles inconvenience their other neighbours or continue to bear on the town council staff and the Police to intervene.&nbsp; Some of my grassroots members even express their scepticism of the institution because of cases like this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this represents the minority of the successful cases handled by the CMC.&nbsp; It has however prompted me to ask the Minister the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How many cases have the CMC handled so far and are there indicators to show that they have become more accepted as the preferred means to resolve non-legal disputes?&nbsp; (2) How effective has the CMC been in handling these disputes?&nbsp; How does the CMC measure effectiveness?&nbsp; (3) After 10 years, is it timely that the Ministry review the CMC and its processes vis-a-vis its effectiveness, the need to compel attendance, mechanisms to ensure compliance to agreed resolutions, the need to involve grassroots or third parties to follow up and counsel or oversee resolution after agreement has been signed at CMC session?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1072 </p><p><I>State Land</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;there are a number of plots of land with a sign that says, "State Land.

Please exercise caution and be responsible for your own safety."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Ministry how much of these land and properties have been released for such use?&nbsp; What forms of use have been allowed by SLA and how well have they been utilised?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it possible for SLA to allow a mechanism for a more proactive demand-initiated request for designated State land or property to be developed appropriately by social enterprises for community use?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the SLA allow social enterprises or commercial ones to develop, operate and maintain large tracts of undeveloped State land for large scale development for purposes that are non-profit and for the public to use at&nbsp;very affordable fees?&nbsp; There could be many developments that will not require large infrastructure builds that could be suitable for temporary use, namely, perhaps&nbsp;lawn bowling club,&nbsp;wood ball&nbsp;course,&nbsp;an adventure trail or even golf course for the public.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Sydney, for example,&nbsp;where I lived for three years,&nbsp;there were many no-frills and open-to-public walking-golf courses<p align=left>Column: 1073 </p> which offered good exercise and recreation for students and children, housewives and the retired.&nbsp; There were also parks that had facilities donated as a symbol of responsible corporate citizenship dedicated to youths and young children.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar):</B> Madam, I thank the Members who have spoken.&nbsp; They have raised several issues.&nbsp; I will respond to the comments made on legal services sector and the Report of the&nbsp;Committee&nbsp;headed by Justice V K Rajah, which includes the points raised by Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Alvin Yeo, Mr Hri Kumar and Mr Christopher de Souza.&nbsp; I will also touch on the points raised by Prof. Thio Li-ann.&nbsp; My colleague, the Senior Minister of State, Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee, will respond to the other questions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Alvin Yeo made some broad comments on the Report of the Committee, chaired by Justice V K Rajah.&nbsp; In responding to the suggestions and comments that they made, may I recapitulate why we accepted the recommendations of that Committee.&nbsp; We did so because we considered that it was in our national interest to do so.&nbsp; And why is it in our national interest to do so?&nbsp; Mainly&nbsp;because of three important reasons.&nbsp;The first is that it will help meet the needs and demands of our economy which has become more diversified and broad-based.&nbsp; As more and more international companies establish their presence in Singapore, the demand for corporate legal services in Singapore has continued to grow.&nbsp; In fact, our financial institutions, and even MAS, have fed back to us the need for increased legal services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason is because of the changing nature of the global legal landscape.&nbsp; Globalisation has led to an exponential increase and change in the volume and the types of international<p align=left>Column: 1074 </p> cross-border legal work, spearheaded largely by the rise of China and India.&nbsp; So we need to seize the opportunities and position ourselves as a centre for legal services to benefit from these changes.&nbsp; As a focal point between India and China, as well as Europe and US, we are a convenient locale for legal services, including international arbitration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason concerns attracting talent and keeping our own talent.&nbsp; We have to remain attractive for foreign talent and also ensure that we do not lose the cream of our own talent.&nbsp; By liberalising, our legal services, we think, will be enhanced</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

By liberalising, we offer them the same work opportunities and work exposure which will be available in global cities elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked about our key performance indicators.&nbsp; We will measure ourselves by how well we have achieved our objectives.&nbsp; Of course, this is not easy to do, because some aspects may be measurable and some not.&nbsp; For example, in 2007, our legal sector contribution stood at&nbsp;0.5% of our GDP.&nbsp; I think we can do better than this.&nbsp; But, of course, growth is always subject to vagaries of the general economic situation.&nbsp; We will regularly monitor&nbsp;feedback from the key economic sectors on how well our legal sector is or is not able to support the development of these sectors.&nbsp; In short, we will look at a combination of quantitative as well as qualitative indicators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will we implement the Report?&nbsp; We have three Implementation Sub-<p align=left>Column: 1075 </p>Committees:&nbsp; the first, concerning the liberalisation of the legal services sector; the second, on legal education and professional training; and third, recommendations concerning the legal profession.&nbsp; They will look into the details of the implementation and, where necessary, propose amendments to the legislation, especially the Legal Profession Act.&nbsp; Some may not require legislation in order to implement.&nbsp; We hope to have the legislation ready sometime later this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be implementing two new schemes:&nbsp; the Enhanced Joint Law Venture (EJLV) scheme and the Qualifying Foreign Law Firm (QFLF) scheme mentioned by Mr Alvin Yeo.&nbsp; The EJLV scheme will be available in the second half of this year, once our legislation has been amended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offer greater breadth and scope of legal services, we will award five QFLF licences by the end of this year through a Request for Proposals process. &nbsp;Some time will be needed, of course, to consult properly with various stakeholders, such as the legal profession as well as the industry; to put the necessary legislation in place;&nbsp;we need time to call for tenders, examine the various tenders and conduct the necessary interviews.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Alvin Yeo made several suggestions, for example, that the EJLV scheme be targeted at the very large international firms, and the QFLF be aimed at those firms whose main objectives are to follow their clients to Singapore rather than to compete for local and regional clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Law Ventures scheme has always been a priority for us, since its commencement in&nbsp;2000. Some have been successful.&nbsp; On the other hand, many foreign law firms have told us that they do not wish to participate in the joint<p align=left>Column: 1076 </p> ventures.&nbsp; They prefer autonomy and independence of action.&nbsp; But joint ventures are an excellent way for local firms to upgrade and acquire new skills.&nbsp; That is why, when we announced the EJLV scheme in December recently, we decided to go a step further than the recommendation in the Report.&nbsp; Potential joint venture parties may, in fact, propose to the Law Minister and the Attorney-General for permission to shape their EJLV scheme in a way that they prefer,&nbsp;to broker better arrangements for themselves to prosper in the long term.&nbsp; We may&nbsp;be prepared to consider it. &nbsp;I think the local law firms have a key role to negotiate with and offer an attractive enough deal for the international foreign law firms to forge a fruitful win-win partnership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have yet to firm up the details of the QFLF scheme.&nbsp; But I want to emphasise that the structure will be based on an assessment of what would bring the greatest benefits to Singapore in terms of supporting the needs and demands of our economy - that is why I said the national interest is paramount -&nbsp;and in terms of positioning ourselves to benefit from the tremendous growth in international and cross-border work, and the need to attract and retain top talent in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will look at the details of the proposals, but some of the things which we will look at are whether they will increase offshore law work from the region,&nbsp;whether they will increase the legal expertise and transactional skills of Singapore lawyers, especially in areas such as private banking, intellectual property and corporate law, and&nbsp;whether these foreign law firms will promote the use of Singapore law in international transactions - just to give Members an indication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the schemes come into operation, we will review them in 18 to 24 months' time with a view to further <p align=left>Column: 1077 </p>liberalisation at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, a calibrated approach&nbsp;&ndash; only five firms initially&nbsp;&ndash; and several areas of law practice will be ring-fenced.&nbsp; Because it is a calibrated approach and the changes will be gradual, I expect our Singapore law firms will be able to rise to the challenges and competition, and I think, in the longer term, they will be stronger for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin asks for the measures to increase the supply of lawyers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the Government has put in place several measures. &nbsp;These include the recommendations in August 2006 from the Third Committee on the Supply of Lawyers chaired by the former Attorney-General Mr Chan Sek Keong, such as setting up the second law school, increasing the intake of students for the NUS Law Faculty, allowing Singaporeans and PRs who graduated from recognised overseas law schools with Second-Lower degrees to practise law upon fulfilling certain conditions, and enabling Singapore law firms to recruit outstanding lawyers from abroad under a special scheme to practise limited Singapore law.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the recent broad ranging recommendations in Justice V K Rajah's Committee Report.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Management University School of Law has been set up.&nbsp; It has taken off with an intake of 120 students.&nbsp; This, together with the increased intake for the NUS Law Faculty from 220 to 250, will result in an almost 70% increase in the number of law graduates in two to three years' time.&nbsp; So, to the question whether we should set up another law school, I would say, let us see how this develops because the decision to set up another law school would be premature at this stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hri Kumar has asked for more immediate measures to address the current shortages.&nbsp; He was comparing the various steps to our family planning<p align=left>Column: 1078 </p> population.&nbsp; But I will ask him to look at it in a different way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we took incremental steps shows that we were attuned to the changing needs of the marketplace and we made adjustments whenever it was necessary.&nbsp; Yes, while we may need more lawyers, I would like to stress that it cannot be at the expense of quality.&nbsp; The 1993 controls have ensured that we have a sound crop of lawyers in this generation.&nbsp; We need to continue to maintain high standards in the admission of lawyers to the Singapore Bar as we adapt to the changing needs of our economy.&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar makes a fair point. &nbsp;I agree that we must not be too rigid to the extent of denying ourselves exceptional candidates who ought to be admitted to the Singapore Bar, given the need for more numbers of lawyers.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he knows, we introduced the Second-Lower Scheme less than two years ago where we will give consideration to Second-Lower graduates and, under that scheme, we have seen a total of 18 applicants who have applied, 14 of whom were admitted last year.&nbsp; Justice V K Rajah's Committee has recommended shortening the three years' required work experience and we are prepared to consider that. With that change, we anticipate a larger number of entrants to the Bar through this method.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further, the Ministry of Law&nbsp;has also reviewed our exemption policy.&nbsp; Under our current policy, we only recognise law degrees from scheduled universities of UK, Australia, New Zealand and USA.&nbsp; They must be on a full-time basis and must have attained a certain standard in their degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;MinLaw has reviewed this issue and, together with the Board of Legal Education and the Attorney-General's Chambers, we agreed that there is a further need to review how our current policy could be fine-tuned even further so as to maintain our high standards&nbsp;and not&nbsp;exclude deserving candidates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1079 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus is that we can treat such candidates in the same way as Singaporean graduates who have come home with Second-Lower degrees from scheduled universities.&nbsp; With the same proven work record, the Board of Legal Education may interview outstanding candidates, and we are prepared to consider them for admission to the Singapore Bar under the various exemption schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also highlight that the local law firms should take advantage of the special scheme under the Rules and the Legal Profession Act, which allows foreign lawyers who have worked for a local firm for one year practising offshore work, to then practise Singapore law in prescribed areas, such as banking, finance, corporate and other areas of legal or regional work, after passing a qualifying examination administered by the Board of Legal Education. &nbsp;There is an examination scheduled to take place this June.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to sum up, we have had many changes to enhance talent within the legal industry.&nbsp; Let us see how these changes work, and refine it as we go along.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Christopher de Souza and Mr Hri Kumar talked about the various requirements, including the Diploma in Singapore Law course (DipSing), and Mr Hri Kumar talked about the bar examination.&nbsp; I shall give consideration with the Attorney-General's Chambers to their suggestions, ie,&nbsp;what they said about the Practice Law Course, the DipSing, and the idea of a local bar examination.&nbsp; I am not able, of course, today to give a firm indication of what the changes will be.&nbsp; But let me say that Solicitor-General Walter Woon is heading the Committee which will implement the recommendations concerning matters affecting the Vocational Training Course and the whole area of professional <p align=left>Column: 1080 </p>training.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many operational details are involved in this exercise, and a comprehensive and holistic approach will be taken by Mr Walter Woon's Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Hri Kumar's proposal for a bar examination, this was in fact envisaged by Justice V K Rajah's Committee, which said: &nbsp;"The Committee believes that, eventually, it will become necessary to impose a second gatekeeper to entry into the law profession as the number of law graduates increase."&nbsp; I also highlighted this long-term goal when I announced the Government's acceptance of the Report last December.&nbsp; Now that we have two law schools, and many routes of entry&nbsp;&ndash; scheduled universities, Australian universities, and so on&nbsp;&ndash; and more of our students are coming from these universities from abroad, I think this will be a sensible direction to go in the longer term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, since we are restructuring pupillage, rethinking the Board of Legal Education's structure, bringing in Vocational Training Contracts, and so on, let us get these changes in place first, and we will be better placed to move in that direction later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin talked about the conduct of lawyers and the mechanisms for promoting professionalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo must have had in mind the recent publicity over a few high profile cases of misconduct. &nbsp;The Solicitors' Accounts Rules were significantly tightened in 2007 by the Law Society.&nbsp; The question one may ask is whether the new cases actually exploited loopholes in the amended&nbsp;rules.&nbsp; Of course, our rules must be practical, workable and at the same time&nbsp;adequate.&nbsp; The Chief Justice has pointed out at the Opening of the Legal Year that one option may be to completely bar lawyers from holding clients' monies. At the same time, he noted that such a change would radically <p align=left>Column: 1081 </p>alter a conveyancing system which may have a serious effect on the efficiency of the property market and, therefore, this requires careful thought and he has appointed a Judge of Appeal,&nbsp;Justice V K Rajah, to head a working committee to look into this matter and consult various stakeholders, and to consider the desirability and feasibility of introducing this or any other schemes to deal with such problems.&nbsp; He has given him&nbsp;three to five months to study the problem and make recommendations.&nbsp; Let us wait for the recommendations of this Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also say <I>apropos</I> the discipline of lawyers,</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>that it will be enhanced by some changes which have been proposed by&nbsp;Justice V K Rajah's Report.&nbsp; There will be firm adherence to stipulated timelines at every step of the disciplinary process. The current four-member Disciplinary Committee will be reduced to a one-man Disciplinary Tribunal.&nbsp;That tribunal will consist of a Senior Counsel,&nbsp;retired Judge or&nbsp;Judicial Commissioner of the Supreme Court appointed by the Chief Justice. I think all these changes are designed to cut delays and ensure a more effective disciplinary process for lawyers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me finally touch on Prof. Thio Li-ann's points about developing international law expertise. Basically, she has urged us to pay attention to&nbsp;developing&nbsp;local international law expertise. Let me say that the Government is paying attention to this.&nbsp; I myself have had discussions with the Attorney-General and officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we do so not because of comparisons with Malaysia, ie,&nbsp;they have so many Federal Counsel&nbsp;and we have so few. For that matter, if we compare the Foreign Service, Malaysia has over 100 overseas diplomatic missions and our<p align=left>Column: 1082 </p> Foreign Service has only 45.&nbsp;So we are&nbsp;not in a numbers game.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we pay attention to this issue, it is because of the reasons that she mentioned, ie, that increasingly, there is greater and greater involvement of international law.&nbsp; We have more conferences and forums where our delegations have to be sufficiently familiar with issues of international law so as to effectively participate in those conferences and meetings. And, of course, there are new emerging areas of international law, a good example being climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should also&nbsp;add,&nbsp;in parenthesis, that we are not developing local international law expertise because otherwise we would have to hire foreign counsel for cases like Pedra Branca. Nearly every country in the world, as far as I know, which has a case before the ICJ or other international tribunal hires&nbsp;foreign counsel, not because of any aspersions&nbsp;on their local lawyers, but for the simple reason that these foreign counsel have appeared before these tribunals regularly and have pleaded before these courts.&nbsp; And, therefore, it is important to use their services.&nbsp; Let me say that, for example, in the Pedra Branca case, much of the legal work, ie, the getting&nbsp;up and the drafting was, in fact, done by the Singapore legal team.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the International Affairs Division (IAD) in the AG's Chambers is a lean outfit. But let me say that having worked with them over&nbsp;many years on many issues, I can say that they are a very dedicated and competent group, able to address issues of international law of immediate concern to us by prioritising and optimising their resources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spoken to the Attorney-General and he has informed me that IAD will be expanded and given more resources. And also,&nbsp;it will develop its expertise further <p align=left>Column: 1083 </p>and form pools or clusters of expertise in different areas of international law and practice. And there is a programme to emplace them and work closely with other agencies, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Indeed, a&nbsp;scheme of attachment of IAD officers to MFA was already initiated a few years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her point about academia, yes,&nbsp;our talent pool is small.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be prepared to enlist the services of legal luminaries in academia, as well as in the private sector.&nbsp; I know that the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General are fully supportive of this. I am also glad to say that the Ministries and the statutory boards have also recruited officers who are lawyers, many of whom have background or training in international law.&nbsp; In fact, MFA has some 30 or so foreign service officers who are law graduates.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, let me say that the Law Faculty of NUS, Attorney-General's Chambers and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working together to set up a Centre for International Law. This Centre will be the focal point of our common efforts to build a hub in international law.&nbsp; Hopefully, it will bring together academics, legal service officers, diplomats and private sector lawyers to leverage on the experience and expertise already available in Singapore.&nbsp; I hope that the teaching and research will not just be wholly theoretical,&nbsp;but will contain a substantial dose of practical experience.&nbsp; We envisage that the Centre will concentrate initially on areas where we have some comparative advantage, like law of the sea, aviation law, international trade law and ASEAN law. This is just an indicative list.&nbsp; We will have more details later on.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Madam, Dr<p align=left>Column: 1084 </p> Teo Ho Pin, Mr Palmer and Mr Masagos' cuts generally involve the issue of "access to justice".&nbsp; It is&nbsp;to facilitate access to justice that we continually review the legal aid means test and established the Community Legal Clinics (CLCs) and Community Mediation Centres (CMCs).&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) keeps a close watch on the means test to ensure adequate access to justice to those of limited means.&nbsp; That is why we have amended the test several times, the last one only being in July last year.&nbsp;Arising from this amendment, an applicant with, say,&nbsp;a dependent wife and two children, will now qualify for legal aid if he earns less than $2,600 a month.&nbsp; Before the revision, he had to earn less than $1,900.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last July, we also gave the Director of Legal Aid greater discretion to help special cases who fail the expanded means test but were deserving of legal aid.&nbsp; Mr Palmer asked under what circumstances. One example is if a person suffers hardship because he suddenly loses his job and requires urgent legal help, the Director now has the option to consider his income for the preceding six months, instead of the past one year.&nbsp;Another example is when a person is afflicted with a sudden physical or mental incapacity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer suggests that we should apply a different means test for different types of cases.&nbsp; Madam, the means test is a measure of whether a person is in a financial position to obtain legal help on his own.&nbsp; It would not be right to draw a distinction between the different types of action he is faced with. Otherwise, we may end up in an incongruous&nbsp;situation where a person who seeks legal aid for different types of actions, such as a divorce and&nbsp;a commercial claim where he is the defendant, will be provided legal aid for the divorce but not the claim, when he actually requires help for both.&nbsp;To him, both actions may be "unavoidable". This<p align=left>Column: 1085 </p> would&nbsp;be difficult for the person seeking legal aid to understand, let alone accept.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing so&nbsp;also means that we are giving priority to certain types of cases, deeming them as more deserving of help.&nbsp; This is hard to justify. The principle ought to be to ensure that there is access to justice to deserving individuals, based on the means test and the merits test, regardless of the nature of their cases. We see no compelling reasons to move away from this approach which has served us well all these years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Palmer mentioned the high cost of divorce cases.&nbsp; I have actually responded to this by setting&nbsp;up a Family Relations Chambers in 2006 to help estranged couples, at no cost, to resolve their disputes in a non-adversarial setting. &nbsp;The resolution rate at 88% has been encouraging.&nbsp; This process helps the parties to arrive at a global resolution of the divorce and ancillary matters.&nbsp;When they go for uncontested divorce before the Family Court, I believe that party-to-party costs are&nbsp;capped between $1,500 and $1,800, thus making it more affordable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on the CLCs.&nbsp; To provide greater access to justice and inform Singaporeans of what the law is, we now have the CLCs. At last year's COS, we announced we will launch two Community Legal Clinics to provide an avenue for members of the public to obtain basic legal advice.&nbsp; In September, two such Clinics started operating in North-West and South-East CDCs.&nbsp; MinLaw is happy to partner the Law Society, Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) and the CDCs.&nbsp; I thank&nbsp;Mayor Teo and Mayor Yao for their support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Clinics are doing well. Public response has been good. Over the last five months, volunteer lawyers at the clinics have helped more than 850 people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1086 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; for the profile of cases handled at the CLCs, matters include claims and personal loans, family matters such as divorce and separation as well as employment matters.&nbsp; Mr Palmer notes that lawyers at the CLCs can only advise the people they see,&nbsp;but cannot represent them in court. This is why the CLCs have established a system where they will inform parties whom they think are eligible for legal aid about what is available at the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) and help them to file their claims.&nbsp; In addition, some are referred to the Family Service Centres or the Law Society for follow-up action.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I must say that the response from the law firms has been good.&nbsp; Seventeen of the largest firms have come on-board.&nbsp; Altogether, about 200 lawyers, including some Senior Counsel, are doing this,&nbsp;including some from Mr Palmer's firm and also firms of other Members who are here, and also involving some of the students from SMU and NUS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo asked about the Ministry's plans to expand the CLC programme to cater especially for heartlanders.&nbsp; In fact, the two CLCs are already reaching out to all Singaporeans wherever they live.&nbsp;Users come not just from the two CDCs involved, but I believe that 60% of the users actually come from the rest of Singapore. So, we will continue to monitor the situation and expand if the need arises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Dr Teo that there is a need for the public to know more about the law. This is being done through the CLCs. When they come, in fact, they are also informed about the law, their rights and obligations,&nbsp;but I think more can be done and I believe that more is being done, both by Government as well as by private sector bodies.&nbsp;So, for example, I know the Law Society has been actively organising a bi-annual Law Awareness Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is&nbsp;a very good outreach on<p align=left>Column: 1087 </p> the ground,&nbsp;reaching out to Singaporeans.&nbsp;Last year's topics were very topical:&nbsp;gambling, consumer credit, family charter, and employment.&nbsp;DPM and I have been helping them when we can, either with advice or with our presence at these functions. And books are also available:&nbsp; <I>"You &amp; the Law"</I> by the Singapore Association of Women Lawyers (SAWL).&nbsp;The Consumer Association of Singapore&nbsp;has also put out this information&nbsp;on their website.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree, however, that more can be done.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;especially the more vulnerable Singaporeans should be apprised of what they can do,&nbsp;where they can turn to, should they need help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On CMCs which Mr Masagos talked about, MinLaw set these up about&nbsp;10 years ago to promote community mediation as a flexible, cost-effective and a conciliatory&nbsp;means for Singaporeans to resolve social, community and family conflicts outside the adversarial court system, thereby also avoiding legal cost. All these form a&nbsp;matrix of measures put in place so that those who need legal help, short of going to the Court, at least there are other processes where they can turn to first, which are cost-effective.&nbsp; And I am happy to say that largely, the CMCs have achieved this role.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How effective is it?&nbsp; Ten years on, the CMC has dealt with more than 3,400 community disputes with an overall success rate of 75%.&nbsp; It handled 534 cases last year, compared to 120 in 1998 when it first started.&nbsp; As importantly, in terms of effectiveness, it is not just the cases that are settled,&nbsp;but getting the parties to come and talk about it face-to-face, I&nbsp;think that is also a measure of effectiveness because it helps parties understand each other better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1088 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a need to amend the law to compel attendance and ensure compliance with mediated agreements?&nbsp; In fact, we have been studying this issue carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, it is a question of how far, as a matter of policy, the&nbsp;State should&nbsp;be involved in getting Singaporeans to resolve their social and community conflicts through mediation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current approach is to distinguish between cases that have escalated to the courts and those which have not.&nbsp; In the first situation, the courts can require the parties to go for mediation. For cases that&nbsp;have not reached the courts, we keep mediation voluntary rather than&nbsp;make it mandatory from the outset.&nbsp; To complement this, we have strengthened the voluntary framework to ensure that more cases are appropriately channelled to mediation, for example, through&nbsp;advice given by the Police or by having grassroots leaders, under a Persuaders' Scheme, to visit the parties and encourage them to go for mediation.&nbsp; I will consider Mr Masagos' suggestion to involve these grassroots leaders also in helping the parties keep the peace pursuant to the mediated agreements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: should we make mediation mandatory once an application has been filed at the CMC, ie,&nbsp;pre-court?&nbsp; Like I have said, mediation is essentially a voluntary process.&nbsp; But having thought&nbsp;about it, I am prepared to consider the option of introducing some pressure on the party who is invited to attend a mediation session by the CMC.&nbsp; We will explore the possibility of, for example, inserting&nbsp;a provision that allows a Magistrate to take cognisance of a party's earlier refusal to attend mediation at the CMC as a factor in assessing the reasonableness of the parties' actions and in determining how to deal with the Complaint, should a Magistrate's Complaint be lodged subsequently.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This may incentivise the parties to at least <p align=left>Column: 1089 </p>come for mediation and give the process a boost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether there is a need to amend the law to strengthen compliance by parties to their mediated agreements, I do not think this is necessary. A settlement arrived at by the parties at a CMC mediation session&nbsp;is already binding on them and enforceable in civil courts as a contractual agreement if it is written down, signed by all the parties, and the document itself contains a statement specifying its binding nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, now, to the next series of cuts which is on CPC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every country has to find the right balance in its criminal procedures and investigation processes between enhancing the public interest in solving crimes expeditiously and protecting the rights of the accused person. This is especially so in the realm of criminal law which reflects society's norms. So, to Dr Teo Ho Pin who asks how our Criminal Procedure Code or "CPC" compares with other jurisdictions in terms of transparency and protection of individual rights, my response is that, on the whole, our criminal laws and processes have worked well for us.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why Singapore scores highly in international polls for "legal framework" and "safety and security". Singaporeans also have confidence in our courts, prosecution and enforcement agencies.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though our system is generally working well, as in all things, we fine-tune its features, where necessary. This is why, for the first time in 40 years, the CPC is undergoing a comprehensive review. Dr Teo and Mr Christopher de Souza asked how the review is coming along. We are targeting to move the amending Bill in Parliament later this year. Areas reviewed include matters such as the pre-trial discovery process, bail <p align=left>Column: 1090 </p>procedures, composition of offences, the jurisdiction of the courts and powers of the appellate courts. As the CPC is an important piece of legislation with more than 400 sections, we want to be as thorough as possible in reviewing it.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assure Mr Christopher de Souza that just as we gave a lot of thought and resources to the Penal Code amendments, we will give as much to the CPC. He is right that a good Penal Code needs a good procedure framework to back it up. When the amendments are ready, we will consult key stakeholders such as the Law Society and the Courts, and we will also consult the GPC.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now address the specific points made by Members.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo, Mr Alvin Yeo and Ms Sylvia Lim refer to the pre-trial discovery process. Actually,&nbsp;as&nbsp;lawyers know, there are already existing procedures to facilitate disclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we intend to refine the process. We are still finalising the details, but, generally, we are looking at formalising a statutory framework where the prosecution will formally inform the defence of its case against the accused person. For now, our thinking is that this will include matters such as the list of witnesses, a list of exhibits relevant to the facts in support of the charge and the accused person's statements to be adduced by the prosecution, amongst other things. Then, as per current practice, there will be mutual disclosure as the defence will be required to indicate, amongst other things, its challenges to the prosecution's case. Thereafter, the prosecution will serve on the defence all relevant statements made by the accused person. This process will facilitate the crystallisation of the material issues before the trial commences.&nbsp; I believe that this statutory framework will inject greater transparency into the process to improve it.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1091 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, on the point of access to counsel, Mr Yeo argues that accused persons should have earlier access to counsel. We have debated this issue in the House before.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the CPC already provides a safeguard because it requires every accused person to be brought before a Magistrate without unreasonable delay and, in any event, within 48 hours of his arrest. If Police wants to remand an accused person longer than 48 hours, it has to make out a case to the Court which will make a ruling based on the information and facts before it.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police applies the guiding principle that an accused person should be allowed to consult counsel within a reasonable time and as soon as practicable. Further, there is in place a robust monitoring system to ensure that investigations are completed expeditiously so that remand would not be applied for unnecessarily.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police has conducted a study that shows that more than 90% of the persons arrested were released within 48 hours of arrest, and would have been able to consult legal counsel thereafter. So, in fact, the vast majority of arrested persons have early access to counsel as only 1% of all such persons were remanded beyond a week, well within the one to two weeks mentioned by Mr Yeo. This 1%&nbsp;involved more complex cases such as murder which require extensive investigations. Let me assure the House that Police only applies for remand when absolutely necessary. Indeed, there have been instances when Police applied to the Court for accused persons to be brought back to the Court for an earlier mention date when investigations were completed before the end of the remand period.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeo mentioned remanding an accused person for months without <p align=left>Column: 1092 </p>access to counsel. I think he says this so that I can correct the misperception, perhaps held&nbsp;by laymen on the ground that this is so.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because this is not the case. Remand for the purposes of investigation is not equivalent to keeping the accused in custody. An accused person may be in prison for a period before trial due to other reasons such as the failure to furnish bail, or he may be in remand for psychiatric examination at IMH. Under these circumstances, I would expect that he would have access to counsel already.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heeding calls for Police to grant earlier access to counsel, Police initiated a pilot in March 2006, to refine its internal processes. In August last year, a procedure was then formalised where remanded accused persons can meet their lawyers earlier, ie, towards the end of the one-week remand period, on condition that the accused person did not discuss the case with his lawyer. So this approach strikes a balance between allowing counsel an opportunity to meet his client and upholding the principle that there should be no interference with Police investigations. The Law Society has been informed of this formalised process. The point, therefore, is that Police has moved on this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the next topic, recording of statements.&nbsp; Ms Lim advocates&nbsp;the&nbsp;videotaping of police interviews of suspect persons.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all,&nbsp;I reiterate my point that especially for criminal&nbsp;law and processes,&nbsp;we must find our own path -&nbsp;strike the right balance between protection of&nbsp;the public interest and&nbsp;protection of the&nbsp;rights of accused persons. So what&nbsp;may work in the US, I am sure many Singaporeans will say, please do not import it here. And also in other countries, videotaping has been introduced for different reasons, one of which is loss of public confidence in the police. In UK, there were the Birmingham<p align=left>Column: 1093 </p> 6 and Guildford 4 cases which led to the introduction of videotaping. So too in Australia, with the Justice Woods' Commission of Inquiry in New South Wales.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason often cited for videotaping of police interviews is to guard against Police abuse. A key point, however, is that videotaping the interview is not a foolproof solution if the concern is that confessions made by accused persons may not be voluntary. This is because he can allege that the threat was made, or that the inducement or promise was held out to him before the tape, if it is audio recording, or the&nbsp;video recorder was turned on. So the use of videotaping may actually make it even harder to disprove such allegations as they lend a veneer of respectability to the process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put things in perspective, an accused person's confession statement, if any, is only one component of a range of evidence that the Police will usually adduce to prove its case. In addition, as Ms Lim knows, we have an established process called the "<I>voir dire</I> " or "trial within a trial" where the Trial Judge will review the evidence to assess if a confession statement was made voluntarily, or was made as a result of an "inducement, threat or promise". And, indeed, with this safeguard in place, there have been instances when confession statements have been thrown out.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the crux of the matter lies in whether Singaporeans have trust and confidence in our legal system and our Police Force. On both counts, this is the case. Our criminal justice system is reputed for its clean administration, impartiality and efficiency, and the public has trust and confidence in our Police Force.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So taken as a whole, I would say that&nbsp;there is no need to implement videotaping of police interviews. Ultimately, the <p align=left>Column: 1094 </p>bottom-line is for the suspect to "tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth". He should do so even without any videotaping.</p><p><br><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>The last cut is on&nbsp;land, by Mr Masagos.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that SLA has done much to open up&nbsp;the use of State land for community purposes, in part&nbsp;also because of prompting by Members&nbsp;in this&nbsp;House every year at COS.&nbsp; So, 284 parcels of vacant State land are now open to the public, free of charge, for casual community and recreational activities, a substantial increase from the 153 sites when this initiative was launched in 2003. I think many of these lands are in Members' constituencies. Activities on these lands include soccer and kite-flying. Over the past year, SLA has levelled and improved the condition of these lands.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signs on these lands,&nbsp;as&nbsp;Mr Masagos has mentioned,&nbsp;have&nbsp;actually&nbsp;evolved from "No Trespassing"&nbsp;&ndash; which is very foreboding &ndash; to "Enter at Your Own Risk" &ndash; still quite unfriendly to some people.&nbsp;So feedback came to me and to MinLaw and now we&nbsp;have replaced the "Enter at Your Own Risk"&nbsp;signs with friendlier signs that basically say you can come but when you&nbsp;use the field, be careful, because&nbsp;it is not entirely&nbsp;safe for all sorts of activities, it is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;perfect field, it has been improved, but be careful. Actually, SLA went the extra mile because they also made the field more level by compacting it.&nbsp; So they have done that.&nbsp; In fact, the public can just go there, it is&nbsp;for casual use and there is&nbsp;no need to&nbsp;book.&nbsp; They can&nbsp;go there for&nbsp;their weekend soccer, kite-flying, and&nbsp;it is&nbsp;on SLA's website as to where the fields are.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA also issues licences to grassroots organisations, at subsidised rates, for their constituents to use State lands. 131 such lands are in use as football fields, street-soccer pitches, and so forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another initiative launched last year was where private and public sector organisations<p align=left>Column: 1095 </p> actually come on board and adopt the&nbsp;field.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think&nbsp;Mr Masagos' point is to involve the private sector organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if the field is next to your company's premises, your workers use it after work, adopt it. But, of course, it is not exclusive but you take care of it, so&nbsp;that there is some sense of stakeholding and togetherness in this.&nbsp;And the FAS went off the block early by&nbsp;doing it for&nbsp;Farrer Park.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Mr Masagos' suggestion to accommodate greater private sector participation, SLA welcomes proposals from commercial organisations interested in partnering non-profit organisations and Government agencies to use State land and buildings for social and recreational purposes with the support of a champion Ministry. This is similar to SLA's rental of State buildings directly to voluntary welfare organisations (VWOs) and private entities for social uses, on the request of supporting Ministries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, currently there are 54 State properties being used in this way, the number having grown considerably since the 1990s.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have received positive feedback on these measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;SLA tells me that they will continue to be proactive and make available more&nbsp;State land and premises for community use.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B> We still have some available time for clarifications.&nbsp; Do any of the Members wish to seek clarifications?&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee:</B> Madam, can I just put a question to the Deputy Prime Minister?&nbsp; We are talking about the supply of lawyers and inevitably much resources would possibly be allocated into training lawyers and providing for more lawyers.&nbsp; In the course of their career, they would also be turned into judges as well.&nbsp; So I was wondering whether there are plans<p align=left>Column: 1096 </p> for the Ministry to consider training judges, in a sense, because I think we have a large pool of judges in the Subordinate Courts and sometimes there would have been some&nbsp;remarks being made as to the disposition of judges or that they may&nbsp;lack certain qualifications.&nbsp; And in contrast with the appointment of High Court Judges,&nbsp;they are drawn from the profession and usually the top lawyers get drawn in.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make sure that we do become a legal hub and uphold the high quality of the judiciary, perhaps something could be done to improve the training and the qualifications of the judges, particularly when they are the ones who are in the frontline with the public.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Jayakumar:</B> I would appreciate it if she were to give me some specifics of the negative feedback.&nbsp; But the general feedback I have had about our judiciary, both of the Supreme Court&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Subordinate Courts, has been nothing but positive.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is&nbsp;feedback of specific instances, then, of course,&nbsp;I will&nbsp;channel it to the&nbsp;Attorney-General and the Chief Justice who are in the&nbsp;Legal Services Commission, which in turn has oversight over all aspects of the legal service, including the appointment of Subordinate Courts judiciary.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:&nbsp;</B> Are there any further clarifications?&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Madam, some clarifications for the Senior Minister of State.&nbsp; Firstly, on the issue of pre-trial discovery.&nbsp; I know the Ministry is working on</P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a framework. I wonder if the Senior Minister of State could clarify, in terms of the timing of the disclosure of&nbsp; the accused person's statements to the counsel or to the accused himself, what kind of timeframe are we looking at, how much in advance of the trial is the disclosure going to be done. Secondly, in terms of statements which are not incriminating, in other words, they are<p align=left>Column: 1097 </p> exculpatory statements where the accused explains his non-guilt or why he did certain things which make him not responsible, would those exculpatory statements also be disclosed to the defence in due time before the trial?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, on the issue of videotaping, I think Assoc. Prof. Ho would also know that&nbsp; it is not in every case that the Police has evidence other than the confession to convict the accused. And the law stands that a confession itself can alone be the basis of a conviction. So, it is extremely incriminating if the statement is positive in police terms. A lot of weight is given to the statement and, hence, I do not quite understand why the Ministry is not willing to consider video recording because it would at least be an accurate record of what happened during the statement-taking process, whether the contents came from the accused's mouth or were paraphrases, for example, by the investigating officer because he felt it was more appropriate. Because certain nuances in the language can be very important, can be given much weight during the&nbsp;trial itself. So, I do not quite understand why the Ministry is resistant to this idea.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Madam, as I prefaced my remarks just now, we are still looking at all the details in the CPC.&nbsp; Since Members have asked, I have given a&nbsp;sketch of what is to come. Personally, &nbsp;in terms of the details, I think it will be premature to give the details here; otherwise you will say it is already cooked. We are actually cooking it, we want to consult our stakeholders. But, certainly, in terms of timelines, we will look at what is a fair timeline because here the point is to inject greater transparency.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not work if the prosecution tenders its case to the defence too late for the defence to even prepare its case.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1098 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point is about exculpatory statements.&nbsp; Again, we are looking at the entire situation.&nbsp; But what we are considering is&nbsp;after the defence has submitted its case to the prosecution,&nbsp;the prosecution will tender to the defence&nbsp;all relevant statements of&nbsp; the accused.&nbsp; So it could very well include these exculpatory statements. Like I have said, even now exculpatory statements are taken into account by the prosecution.&nbsp; There is nothing to hide because in framing the charge or in deciding whether to charge the accused, all these will form the entire matrix of evidence that will&nbsp;come before the Public Prosecutor when he exercises his discretion whether or not to charge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On videotaping, like I have said, the context is important. Why did&nbsp;other countries introduce videotaping?&nbsp; The context is really loss of confidence in the police and public outcry to get the police to show what it is doing. In the context of Singapore,&nbsp;I think this is not the case.&nbsp; In any case, as I have said, even if the accused challenges the confession statement, its validity or its voluntariness,&nbsp;there is an established process where this can be verified or indeed thrown out by the Courts as has happened.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the more serious cases, eg,&nbsp;murder, my understanding&nbsp;is that it is not likely&nbsp;that prosecution will proceed just on a confession statement.&nbsp; And certainly in recent years, because of &nbsp;forensic science and the ability to cull evidence from different sources, this is seldom the case.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer:</B> Madam, just two issues. The first one is on the pre-trial discovery process, whether the Senior Minister of State is considering providing consequences for failure to give pre-trial discovery. Will there be any specifications?&nbsp; And the second point is this.&nbsp; I believe he mentioned something about the Police introducing a trial process<p align=left>Column: 1099 </p> where the lawyer was allowed to see his client in remand before the end of the week, on condition that the accused did not discuss the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit puzzled because I cannot see any other reason why the accused would want to see his lawyer but to discuss the case. Could&nbsp;he clarify on these two points?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Again on the CPC, we are looking at the details and my understanding is that&nbsp;there will be provision for consequence if there is non-disclosure of documents.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other point, &nbsp;it is a movement on the Police's part. We do not go all the way, as in other countries. But, in good faith, we have opened up the process so that the accused person at least would have sight of his lawyer and the accused person would know that a lawyer is helping him.&nbsp;We want also to avoid a situation where the accused discusses his case with his lawyer. That may constitute interference with the investigation, because coaching can take place. That is something that we do not want to happen.&nbsp; The presence of the lawyer will be a calming factor for the accused. And basically, like I have said, the requirement is for the accused to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, and we go on the premise that the Singapore Police Force will not tolerate rogue officers and will be very hard on those who do wrong and abuse the process.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should let the system run, a system which has worked.&nbsp;For access to counsel,&nbsp;the Law Society has been informed. We have had a pilot, and we decided this can happen and this will happen for a very small minority of cases, 10%.&nbsp; In fact, only 10% of arrested persons remain in custody&nbsp;beyond 48 hours and 1%&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;one week. But, now, towards the end of one week, even though investigations may not be fully<p align=left>Column: 1100 </p> completed but nearing completion, instead of the&nbsp;one-week remand period being taken to the full, Police is at least prepared&nbsp;to consider letting the accused know that he has counsel and letting counsel see him.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
