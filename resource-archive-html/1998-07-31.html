<div align="center"><b>(Loan commitments and disbursements)</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Ong Kian Min -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether

local  businesses are facing financial difficulties as a  result

of  banks and other financial institutions tightening credit and

cutting  back  on  credit facilities;  (b)  how  much  has  been

disbursed  so far out of the $2 billion loan line set aside  for

the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme; (c) whether this amount  is

sufficient  to  meet  the  needs of  businesses;  and  (d)  what

additional  steps  are  being or can be  taken  to  prevent  the

situation  from deteriorating.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry whether his Ministry will (i) provide statistics on the

number of small and medium-sized

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>

enterprises  (SMEs) which have applied for the Local  Enterprise

Finance  Scheme  as well as the number of SMEs which  have  been

granted  approvals for the Scheme for 1997 and January  to  June

1998; (ii) consider relaxing the qualification criteria for  the

Scheme  so  that  it can be more accessible to local  SMEs;  and

(iii)  be  implementing other initiatives in the near future  to

ensure the SMEs' immediate survival and continued growth.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  there  has been an  increase  in  the  amount

disbursed under the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme and, if  so,

what  is  (i) the number of companies and the amount  disbursed;

and (ii) the percentage of successful applicants, on a quarterly

basis  from  the first quarter of 1996 to the second quarter  of

1998.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry,  in view of the economic crisis faced by many  of  the

Small  and  Medium-Sized Enterprises, whether he  will  consider

allowing  those  who  have  taken  out  loans  under  the  Local

Enterprise  Finance  Scheme to restructure their  repayments  to

ease their cashflow.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Question No. 1, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,   may I have your permission to  answer  Question

Nos. 1 to 4 together as they are related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> In March 1998, the Government enhanced

the  Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) for a period of  two

years with a top-up of $360 million to the LEFS loan line making

it  a  total  of $1.1 billion.  This is to help ease the  credit

squeeze on our SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LEFS enhancements have benefited our local companies.

In the second quarter of this year, the amount of loan committed

increased by 28% to $157 million compared to the second  quarter

last year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



Members  may  wish to refer to Tables (Cols. 739-742)  1  and  2

which  have already been distributed.  The enhancements made  to

short-term loans, through an increase in risk sharing  and  loan

quantum,  were  well received, especially for  factoring  loans.

For  April to June 1998, factoring loans approved increased from

$6  million to $41 million, an increase of 650% (See  Table  1),

compared to the corresponding period last year.  However,  there

was  a  drop  in machinery loans as manufacturing companies  are

cautious about expanding in the current slowdown.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980731/19980731-HA-0690739.htm">Tables - SUMMARY OF YEAR-ON-YEAR COMPARISON: APR-JUN 97 AND 98 FOR NUMBER LEFS LOAN APPROVALS AND LOAN AMOUNT and LEFS APPLICATIONS APPROVED AND AMOUNT DISBURSED (JAN 96 - JUN 98) (Cols. 739-742)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1998, as part of the off-Budget package, the

Government  has  further increased the  LEFS  loan  line  to  $2

billion.  As at June 1998, total loan commitments stood at $1.49

billion,  of  which $630 million have been disbursed.   Table  2

shows   the  number  of  loan  applications  approved   by   the

Productivity and Standards Board.  The number has increased from

1,698 in 1996 to 1,981 in 1997.  It was 889 in the first half of

this  year.   I  do  not  have data  on  the  approval  rate  by

participating banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to industry feedback, my Ministry is currently

studying further enhancements to the LEFS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked if restructuring of loan repayments

is  allowed  under LEFS.  Such a practice is already  in  place.

PSB  and  EDB  do  allow companies with healthy order  books  to

restructure  their loans based, in the first  instance,  on  the

participating banks' assessment of the credit worthiness of  the

company.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Could the Minister

kindly  give the corresponding figures for the total  number  of

those who applied for the loans?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, the figures given in Table 2 refer

to   loan  applications  approved  by  PSB.   PSB  receives  the

applications after they have been processed by the  banks.   The

data that we have at present pertain only to those collected  by

PSB,  ie, when the loan applications have been processed by  the

banks for their credit-worthiness they are then submitted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>

to  PSB  for  final  approval.   The  figures  for  applications

received   and  approved  by  PSB are almost  identical  because

almost  every  loan application that finally  comes  to  PSB  is

approved.  But what we are interested in is the approval rate by

the  banks and for that we have to collect the data.  I  do  not

have the data at present.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I notice from the figures in Table 1

that  there was actually a drop in the number of approvals  even

though  there was an increase in terms of the dollar  amount  of

loans  approved.   It  seems to me a  bit  odd  that  there  was

actually  a  drop  in the number of approvals because  the  LEFS

scheme is meant to help the SMEs and one would expect that there

would be an increase in the number of approvals unless of course

there  was  a  drop  in  the number of  applicants.   Could  the

Minister kindly explain the drop in the number of approvals?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> If Members will refer to Table 1, it is

true  that  the  total  number of loan applicants  approved  has

dropped from 455 for the second quarter of last year to 423  for

the  second  quarter  of  this year.   Although  the  number  of

approvals has decreased the total quantum has increased by  28%,

as I mentioned just now, from $123 million to $157 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members were to look at the details, the increases are

mainly in the short-term loans.  For example, factoring loans,

the number of applications approved has gone up from 10 to 59

and the quantum has gone up from $5.5 million to $41.3 million.

Similarly, for working capital loans, the number of applications

approved has gone up from 2 to 11 and the quantum has also

increased.  On the other hand, the loan applications approved

for factory loans have gone down because there were fewer

applications.  As I explained in my answer, companies are now

cautious about expanding.  Despite the more generous terms we

are giving now, such as larger quantums of loans and larger

fixed assets qualifications for applying under the scheme, the

actual approval rate has gone down for factory loans.  In other

words, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>

machinery  loans,  it has actually gone down for  that  quarter.

People  are  still finding out about the scheme and we  have  to

publicise it further.  We are hoping that eventually there  will

be  some  adjustments.  But in the short-term area,  I think  we

have made some significant improvements.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> I do not

know  whether this question should be asked of the Minister  for

Trade and Industry because it concerns the banks' tightening  of

credit.   Has  the Government any plans to help the  first  time

home buyers who now find that they are in grave danger of losing

their homes?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, the question is out of order.

It is not relevant to the Question that has been asked.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what I said, Sir. Is there any

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Dr Wang Kai

Yuen -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry, to explore

additional  non-traditional export markets for local  Small  and

Medium-Sized  Enterprises (SMEs), whether the Trade  Development

Board will consider organising more trade missions and providing

more generous support to encourage these SMEs to participate  in

these trade missions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Question No.

5, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Trade Development

Board  (TDB)  has  promoted trade with  non-traditional  markets

since  the  1980s.   The Board has accelerated its efforts  this

year.  For  FY98, TDB plans to mount 22 trade missions  to  non-traditional  markets.  Some of the missions  already  undertaken

this  year  were  to  Mexico, Finland, the Baltics,  Kazakhstan,

Azerbaijan   and  East  Africa.  To  date,  45  companies   have

participated in these missions.  In the coming months, TDB plans

to  organise  missions to Eastern European,  African  and  Latin

American  countries.  Some 120 to 150 companies are expected  to

be involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) has

programmes  to  help  SMEs seek out business  opportunities  and

establish   strategic  partnerships  with  companies   in   non-traditional markets.  Under its Business Connect Programme,  PSB

has  facilitated business matching between our  local  SMEs  and

companies in Chile and Australia, for example.  Currently,  2600

companies  have registered under the programme.   650  companies

have  benefited  from such business matching activities.   There

are  plans  to  work  with  TDB  to organise  business  matching

missions to newer markets in Latin America and South Africa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TDB has allocated additional funds to support companies in

their promotional activities this year.  It is estimated that an

additional  $10 million will go towards assisting and supporting

companies  in  their  overseas market and  business  development

activities.   Activities that are eligible for  support  include

participation   in   missions  and  fairs,  brand   development,

establishment of overseas marketing offices, overseas  franchise

development and direct marketing.

<div align="center"><b>MALAYSIA'S PROTECTIONIST MEASURES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Impact on Singapore's economy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry (a) whether there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>

will  be any significant impact on Singapore's economy when  the

Malaysian  government  block  Malaysian  businesses  from  using

Singapore's  ports; and (b) whether such protectionist  measures

which  the  Malaysian government is planning breach any  of  the

World Trade Organisation agreements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from The media reports,

it  is unclear has reported intentions by some quarters in  what

measures (if any) Malaysia will take to pass legislation to curb

Malaysian businesses from using Singapore ports.  The details of

the  proposed  legislation are not available.  If  the  measures

which  run  counter to international rules and  agreements,  are

imposed, Singapore will not hesitate to bring up the matter with

the relevant Malaysian authorities and with international bodies

such as the World Trade Organisation.  This is in line with  the

free trading philosophy we subscribe to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any measure taken will impact both Malaysia and Singapore.

Businesses  operate most efficiently in an open and fair  market

place where they are free to make procurement decisions based on

the competitiveness of services and supplies.  Businesses should

be  free  to  decide  which port to use on the  basis  of  their

commercial needs and considerations.

.        Singapore and Malaysia's economies are closely linked and

complementary  in  many ways.  Malaysia has  traditionally  been

amongst  Singapore's largest trading partners and top investment

destination.   Together,  Singapore  and  Malaysia   provide   a

platform   for  a  number  of  MNCs  to  undertake   distributed

manufacturing   to  capitalise  on  the  different   comparative

advantages of our two countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any move to discourage Malaysian businesses from using

Singapore  ports  will  hinder bilateral trade  and  investment.

Manufacturers  who  have  invested  in  Malaysia  and  MNCs  who

undertake distributed manufacturing in both countries will  face

higher operating costs and constraints on their operations. This

must affect the flow of new investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Our ports serve s diversified markets extending to as

far  as  countries like India and Australia. Customers  use  our

ports because it they provide good value for money.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, a Malaysian Minister

has  been  quoted as saying that we stole the business of  their

port.  Is there any rational basis for such a statement?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The statement is completely baseless.

The  companies and shipping firms use our ports because  of  the

large  number  of shipping lines that call here, the  efficiency

and the competitive rates.  So it is a free choice and there  is

no question of our stealing business from them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Is the Minister satisfied

that,  in  the event that Malaysia should go ahead and legislate

requiring  their  exporters to use their  own  port  instead  of

Singapore ports, we will not be adversely affected?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> If Malaysia does so, there will surely

be some impact on Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What is the impact?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The impact will also be on Malaysia,

because  they  will find it is more difficult  to  export  their

goods and services and there could be delays, higher costs,  and

so on.   Our port will be able to meet up to new challenges that

come its way.



As  I  explained in my answer, this will affect the  operations,

both  in  Malaysia and Singapore, because there  are  companies,

especially  MNCs, which have factories in, for  example,  Johor,

Penang  and  elsewhere which are linked to Singapore  companies.

They  are  supplying parts and components to Singapore companies

and  vice-versa.   Similarly, they need to  ship  goods  to  the

international markets.  So if they do that, it is going to  hurt

them as well as us.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Could the Minister elaborate

what  recourse  is available to Singapore should  the  Malaysian

government's  action  come about and it is found  to  contravene

international  trading agreements?  And also have we  undertaken

such recourse in the past vis-a-vis Malaysia?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, as I have explained in my answer,

we  have to wait and see what measures, if any, are taken.   And

if they contravene the international

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>

agreements like those under the WTO, then we will have  to  take

up  the  problem with the Malaysian authorities as well as  with

WTO.   Offhand, I cannot recall any past instance, but I am sure

we have taken action if there were cases.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I am sure if the

blocking  of  the  usage  of  ports  in  Singapore  goes  ahead,

Singapore  businessmen who are doing business in  Malaysia  will

find  it  very uncompetitive to remain in Malaysia.  If that  is

the  case,  can I ask the Minister if he is prepared  to  assist

these  businessmen  relocate out of  Malaysia  into  other  more

suitable areas?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, that is a definite possibility.

Besides  locating in Johor, they could locate, for  example,  in

Batam,  Bintan  or  maybe  even Thailand.   So  I  am  sure  the

businessmen,  both  the locals in Singapore as  well  as  multi-nationals,  are  observing the situation and if things  get  too

difficult to operate, they have to make the adjustments.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister   how  can  the  Government  and  people  of  Singapore

repudiate   the  untruth  brandished  callously   by   Malaysian

political  and  government leaders about what we  are  doing  in

Singapore, about our port and that we are stealing business from

them.   How  can  we remonstrate with our neighbours  that  such

preposterous accusation, untruth, foolishness will further delay

the  restoration  of international confidence  in  the  regional

economies  and hurt our regional economic recovery?   The  world

has eyes and ears and the world can think.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, an obvious channel is through the

mass  media.   I  think Members may be aware, for example,  that

yesterday  there  was  an  article in  Business  Times  by  some

shipping  association pointing out the errors and  fallacies  of

the  Malaysian  approach.   We want  to  take  a  very  rational

approach to the whole issue.  We are good neighbours with  them.

We  want  to  cooperate  with them.  But  they  must  know  that

whatever  action  is taken will hurt both parties.   So  I  hope

Members,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>

if  they have opportunities, will also air their views and  this

could  be carried in the mass media, not only by the local press

but internationally.

<div align="center"><b>APPOINTMENT OF BANKING OMBUDSMAN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  the  Government  will consider  the  appointment  of  a

Banking  Ombudsman  to  make  banks more  accountable  to  their

customers.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, there is no need to appoint a Banking Ombudsman.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking is a competitive industry in Singapore. 153 banks

operate  here.  Of these, 34 are full licensed banks,  including

22  foreign-owned banks.  They provide a full range  of  banking

services  for  domestic consumers.  Another 13 restricted  banks

focus on wholesale banking services for corporate customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers are free to use any bank. If they are

dissatisfied  with  the services of one,  they  can  take  their

business  to  another bank.  There are enough  banks  to  choose

from.  It is therefore in the interest of banks to service their

customers well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS requires all banks to uphold high standards of

professional  conduct, so as to preserve the  integrity  of  the

financial system as a whole.  The Association of Banks has  also

issued  a  Code  of  Conduct  for banks.   This  Code  sets  out

standards of good banking practice and aims to maintain  a  fair

relationship between banks and their customers and confidence in

the professionalism of banks.  Consumers who feel that they have

been improperly treated by a bank can bring their complaints  to

the  ABS.  The ABS helps consumers resolve their grievances with

banks.  The system has worked well.  Besides the ABS,  consumers

can also take their complaints to the Consumers' Association  of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I wish to ask

the  Deputy  Prime Minister whether it is true, as mentioned  in

recent press reports, that the banks

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>

have   been  deliberately  curtailing  their  loans  unduly   to

customers  or  unfairly forcing them to top-up on the  value  of

their collaterals pledged.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, banking is a

business,  not  a social service.  Banks have to  act  on  sound

commercial  considerations.  They cannot afford to extend  loans

which  are  imprudent, or fail to recover loans  which  are  not

performing.  Otherwise they will undermine their own  viability,

lose  money  and run into serious trouble, as recent  events  in

several Asian countries have vividly shown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and MAS cannot persuade banks to extend

loans  which  in  the  banks'  judgement  are  not  viable.   If

Government  were to intervene, it would be obliged to compensate

the banks should the loans eventually prove irrecoverable.  Then

we  would be no different from any of the other countries, whose

governments have sought to influence lending decisions of banks,

and brought their banking systems to the brink of collapse, with

banks  carrying a very high burden of non-performing loans,  and

requiring  government  resources,  in  other  words,  taxpayers'

money, to bail them out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, neither has the MAS required banks to

curtail  lending  or call on their customers to  top-up  on  the

value  of collateral pledged on their loans.  These are  matters

for the banks to decide on, based on the merits of each loan and

good  banking practice.  However, banks should take a long  view

of  their  customers'  prospects and needs,  rather  than  over-reacting  to  the immediate mood of the economy.   A  bank  that

expands  loans  recklessly in good times  and  contracts  credit

unthinkingly in bad will soon acquire a bad reputation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association of Banks has recently advised its members

not  to  take  a  short-term  view of  the  viability  of  their

customers'  businesses, or to pull back  loans  that  are  being

regularly serviced.  Banks can be expected to be cautious in the

current  slowdown in the Singapore economy.  But  if  all  banks

were to pull

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>

back loans precipitately, even to good borrowers, the quality of

their loans as a whole will suffer.  It is not in their interest

to see this happen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence to date does not show that the banks are

contracting  credit  excessively.  The  total  volume  of  loans

outstanding has shrunk slightly since the start of the year, but

this is mostly because the demand for new loans by companies and

individuals has fallen.  Loans outstanding in June 1998 were  2%

below  the level in December 1997, although they were 5%  higher

than  the  level a year ago, in June 1997.  Banks have continued

to  accept  new loans.  Among the major banks, both foreign  and

local,  the value of new loans accepted as a percentage of  loan

applications was about 87% over the last three months.  In  June

1998  it  was  actually 105% but that is a  statistical  anomaly

because of the lag between applications and acceptances, and 87%

is higher than the level of 1997 when only 60% of new loans were

being  accepted,  or in the middle of last year  when  64%  were

being accepted before the economic slowdown.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall volume of bank loans also remains high. The

ratio  of loans to deposits in the banking system averaged  108%

over the last three months.  In June 1998, it was 107%.  This is

below  the peak which was 115% at the end of last year,  but  it

remains above the levels seen at any time in the last 10 years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister,

when  he  says customers can complain to the ABS, is  he  saying

that  the  ABS  has  the power to adjudicate  on  the  complaint

between the bank and the customer, and the bank has to abide  by

whatever decision the ABS makes?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The ABS may not have legal powers but

it has considerable persuasive powers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that the Committee

appointed to inquire into banking practices has complained about

the  relatively  low  ranking of Singapore banks  in  regard  to

openness  and  competitiveness as compared with  foreign  banks?

And is the Minister aware

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>

that  in  many  of  these other countries, there  is  a  banking

ombudsman  who has power to adjudicate on complaints  which  the

bank  has  to  accept whenever he makes a decision  against  the

bank?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure of the

relevance  of  the first half of the Member's statement  to  the

second  half.  Some countries have banking ombudsmen.  There  is

one  in the United Kingdom.  There is one in Australia which  is

similar.   There  is  one  in Canada which  is  different.   The

British  one has powers to award compensation of up to œ100,000.

The  Australian one has powers to award compensation  of  up  to

$150,000  but it is binding on the bank only when the  applicant

accepts  the decision of the ombudsman.  In Canada, neither  the

customers   nor   the  banks  are  bound  by   the   ombudsman's

recommendations.  So there are various arrangements in different

countries and we have to find a form which suits Singapore.   We

have not found an inadequacy of persuasive powers a problem.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the DPM has

mentioned  that the ABS has a Code of Conduct.  To my knowledge,

this  is not a public document.  The ABS has never released  it,

and  this  makes it difficult for the boundaries to be known  to

consumers.   Would the DPM say that the ABS would  release  this

Code of Conduct for transparency purposes?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The ABS is not a Government

organisation, but we will certainly put this proposal to them to

consider.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Does the Minister appreciate that the

customers  vis-a-vis  the  banks  are  in  very,  very   unequal

positions?   The bank is a mighty institution and  the  customer

may  be a small account holder.  What is the great objection  to

appointing  an ombudsman who would look into the  needs  of  the

small  account  holder if he has a complaint?  Does  he  realise

that  in  England, these services are provided free  to  account

holders?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, an ombudsman is not a

solution to every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>

problem,  and  England  is not the model  for  every  aspect  of

Singapore's  society.   We  are  ourselves,  we  have  to   find

mechanisms  which work and not encumber ourselves with  formulas

which  look  good on paper but may or may not work in  practice.

Even in England, the ombudsman does not have full powers on  all

matters.  For example, he cannot deal with the issues which have

to  do  with the bank's commercial judgement, whether or not  to

provide  a  loan,  unless  there has been  maladministration  or

unfair  treatment.  I have not heard complaints that banks  have

treated  customers unfairly in Singapore on a very large  scale.

If the Member is aware of such cases, perhaps he can bring it up

to our attention and we will certainly look into the matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in good times the

banks  are flushed with money and they encourage their customers

to  borrow.   In Singapore's case, they do borrow  to  buy  real

estate property.  It was reported in yesterday's papers that  in

1985

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, I am coming to it. The loans made

by  banks to property purchasers were about $10 billion and this

amount  has  in  fact  grown to about  $64  billion.   With  the

downturn  of  the  economy, it would look  like  many  of  these

property purchasers would have to either top-up or, if they  are

unable  to top-up, pay higher monthly interest.  They will  have

to fork out ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, are you making a speech? Can you

get  to the point?  If you are not asking a question, I will ask

you to resume your seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All right. It would appear that many

of these property purchasers would have to sell their properties

under  forced  sale.  Is the Government, in the  absence  of  an

ombudsman, just going to stand by and see this happen?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether a person

takes a loan or does not take a loan is a personal decision.  If

he  had  gone to the bank to take a loan, that means he did  not

buy  an  HDB  flat.   He had bought a private  property,  and  I

presume  that he had made his own calculations, and  he  has  to

look  after himself.  I would not be surprised if the volume  of

housing loans has increased dramatically since 1985.  The number

of  private  properties  has  gone  up,  the  value  of  private

properties  has gone up even now compared to 1985, and  if  bank

loans  had  not  increased, I think our system would  have  been

malfunctioning.  So these matters are private decisions  between

the  banks and the borrowers.  As I explained, even in countries

where  you  have an ombudsman, lending decisions are really  the

bank's  prerogative,  not the ombudsman's prerogative.   If  the

ombudsman has to decide that you may call back this loan or  you

may  not  call back that loan, and the ombudsman says  that  you

cannot  call  back the loan and the loan turns sour,  who  pays?

The  bank or the ombudsman?  Is the ombudsman a rich man or does

he have the government standing behind him?  So it is not such a

simple matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson I draw from the data which Mr Chiam cited is

that we have to be very careful not to over expand credit during

times  when  the property market is hot and there is  a  certain

euphoria and heady whiff in the air, and everybody feels this is

the chance, the bankers feel these are safe loans, the borrowers

feel  this  is a sure chance to make money, let's go.   This  is

why,  in  1996, we set a limit of 80% of the value of a property

on  mortgage loans, and which is why even now, despite many very

strong  appeals  to  the  contrary,  we  have  not  lifted  this

requirement,  and  I  hope  Mr Chiam will  support  us  in  that

resolution.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my issue is that this is the real

situation. It has already happened and a big amount of loan  has

been given out by the banks and, also, very likely many of these

loans  would be recalled because there are house purchasers  who

are  unable  to pay.  So my question is: is the Government  just

standing by and watching these many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>

poor  purchasers having to go bankrupt?  As it is already, 1,000

of them have gone bankrupt.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have just explained

that  the  Association of Banks has advised its members  not  to

take  a  short  term view of the viability of  their  customers'

businesses  or  to  pull  back loans that  are  being  regularly

serviced.   I am sure the Association would not mind me  telling

the  Member  that,  in terms of housing loans,  what  they  have

suggested  to  the  banks is to consider not requiring  top  ups

where  the term loan repayments are current, and to look  at  it

case  by  case and support customers who have viable businesses,

and  help them to weather the current difficult environment.   I

think these are for banks to decide.  If the bank wants to  pull

back  a loan because the customer is not servicing, and we  tell

the  bank, "No", do you take on the responsibility?   I  am  not

prepared to take on the responsibility because I would  have  to

come  here  and ask Members to vote money which may  be  in  the

billions  of dollars, in the case of Japan, US$600 billion.   We

should  go  to the banks not to rescue a bank, but to make  sure

the  whole  banking  system does not  collapse,  and  the  whole

economy does not collapse.  I would rather not have to make such

a request of Mr Chiam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister, if I heard him correctly,

says that, even in England, it does not work in practice to  the

full  satisfaction of the customers or something to that effect.

Has he made a study of how it works in practice in England?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member misheard

me.   I  never said it did not work in practice in  England.   I

have  no idea whether the customers are fully satisfied or  not.

I  imagine that there will always be some customers who are  not

fully satisfied.  What I did say is that, in England, there  are

certain  things which the ombudsman's office cannot  deal  with,

and  one  of  them  is  complaints about the  bank's  commercial

judgement whether or not to provide a loan.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the current economic situation is due primarily to

a  fall in external demand as domestic demand accounts for  less

than 30% of total demand.  As our GST rate at 3% is already very

low,  suspending  GST  is  unlikely to  affect  domestic  demand

significantly.  Suspending GST would also result  in  a  revenue

loss  of  about $2 billion a year.  Even if we need to stimulate

the  economy  by  $2 billion a year, the money would  be  better

spent  in  helping  specific groups and  areas  rather  than  by

lifting the GST across-the-board.

<div align="center"><b>(Extension to residential properties)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether   (i)  the  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial   and

industrial  properties  announced  as  part  of  the  off-Budget

measures  can  be extended to residential properties  since  the

property tax of 12% applies to all properties with the exception

of   owner-occupied  property;  and  (ii)  the  Government  will

consider  expediting  its  re-assessment  of  annual  values  of

property in order to reflect significantly lower market prices.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the property tax

rebate  is  intended  to ease the cost of  doing  businesses  in

Singapore.   It  is  therefore granted only  to  commercial  and

industrial properties, and not to residential properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of re-assessment of annual values, IRAS has

in  fact  already  expedited the review of  private  properties.

Since  January  1998, about 47% of the private  properties  have

already  been reviewed.  The balance of private properties  will

be reviewed before the end of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>

this  year.   In the meantime, property owners can  also  inform

IRAS  if their new rents have fallen below the annual values  of

their  properties, so that a review of these properties  can  be

done earlier.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that if perhaps the

Government, at this present juncture, grants a rebate to private

property owners also, that might help them in their difficulties

with the banks which are asking them to top up the loans because

of the high mortgage rates?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Of course, any rebate given in

whatever  form would help individuals.  But I have said  earlier

that  our objective, at this stage, is to help businesses reduce

operating costs so that they can remain in business and  provide

jobs.  This is our focus.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Am I to understand that the Government does

not propose to do anything to help these home buyers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I have not said that we do not

intend  to  do  anything, but we have to  select  the  time  and

opportunity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> When?

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS TO ACCELERATE INCREASED PUBLIC SPENDING</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether the Government will (i) provide specific details on  the

current  and  planned infrastructural projects to be accelerated

to  increase public spending; and (ii) consider relaxing certain

registration   requirements  stipulated  by   the   Construction

Industry  Development Board or downsizing large-scale  projects,

thereby widening the opportunities for more local contractors to

tender for these projects.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> This question is in two parts. I

will address the first part.  In my Ministerial Statement on off-Budget  measures, I have given some details of the  key  sectors

and  specific development projects for which the Government will

release  an additional $670 million in FY98. This sum  comprises

$460 million to speed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>

up  existing  development projects or to start  new  ones,  $125

million for assistance schemes for companies, and $83 million to

increase  civil service recruitment.  I will now  highlight  the

main  projects  which will receive substantial  disbursement  of

funds under the off-Budget package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional spending on education accounts for the largest

share of $282 million, or about 42% of total disbursement.  This

includes,  in  the  area  of  IT development,  $22  million  for

enhancing  CAD-CAM facilities in the polytechnics,  $22  million

for  upgrading  computer facilities in NTU, and $30  million  to

incorporate   IT   in  primary  and  secondary   schools   under

construction.  Another $38 million goes to accelerating on-going

campus  development at NUS and NTU, while $28  million  goes  to

speeding   up  the  acquisition  of  equipment  for  NUS.    The

recruitment of more teachers will cost $70 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional spending on economic infrastructure this year

includes  $50  million  to  assist  the  commercial  rollout  of

Singapore  One,  $22 million to put in basic infrastructure  for

industrial land sales, $15 million to develop Chinatown  as  the

first  Thematic Zone under the Tourism 21 Plan, and $13  million

to further speed up the Jurong Island reclamation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $31 million is set aside to put in place the

necessary  basic infrastructure in HDB new towns such  as  roads

and  drains.  Some $36 million will be spent to speed up  public

sector   computerisation  efforts  to  upgrade  the  operational

capabilities of our uniformed services in the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs.   In  addition,  another $13 million  is  allocated  to

recruit  more  officers  for our civil  defence  force,  police,

prisons and immigration departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional funds have also been allocated to help our

workers  and  companies tide over this difficult  period.   This

includes  an additional $80 million for the Economic Development

Assistance  Scheme,  $20  million in interest  subsidy  for  the

enhanced Local Enterprise Financing Scheme, or LEFS, $20 million

for the Skills Redevelopment Programme, and $5

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>

million  for TDB trade promotion and facilitation programmes  to

help   our  retailers  and  companies  with  overseas  marketing

efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second part of the question, the request is for

information  on  the  CIDB's programmes.   The  registration  of

contractors by the Construction Industry Development Board is an

integral   part  of  the  Government's  tendering   process   to

objectively  evaluate a contractor's capability and capacity  to

take on projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three years, local construction firms performed

quite   well   clinching  about  63%  of  total  public   sector

construction contracts in value terms, or 94% in terms of number

of  projects.   There are more than twice the  number  of  local

contractors  compared to foreign contractors in the $50  million

and  above registration category of G8. In the last year  alone,

the  number of local construction firms registered with CIDB had

risen  by  9%, from 1,361 to 1,485, with the number  in  the  G8

class increasing from 61 to 65.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, foreign contractors' competitive edge in large

projects stems not from just doing the construction work, but by

being  able  to  provide  a  total solution  or  package,  which

includes  integrating  both design and  technological  know-how.

They  offer  alternatives  and win clients  over  with  superior

solutions, which save time and costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relaxing the registration criteria is not the solution to

the current problem.  It will not shift the competitive edge  of

foreign contractors over our local contractors in tendering  for

high value projects above $100 million where the local share  of

contracts awarded is significantly lower.  Instead, it will lead

to  keener competition and cause more construction firms to  get

into  difficulties, which is not beneficial to the  construction

industry  at this time.  Besides this, relaxing the registration

requirement  could  compromise the objective  of  ensuring  that

firms  tendering for jobs of different sizes have  the  capacity

and  capability to execute them satisfactorily.   The reputation

and  credibility of the registration system as a  guide  to  the

firms' capacity and capability has been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>

painstakingly built up over the years, and we should not  change

the criteria just to try and suit economic circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's suggestion to downsize large-scale projects as an alternative way to widen the opportunities

for  more  local contractors to tender for the projects,  CIDB's

record shows that most of the above $100 million projects won by

foreign  contractors were private sector projects.   The  public

sector  projects  won by foreign contractors were  mainly  those

where the capabilities lie with the foreign contractors, such as

for  the MRT line projects.  Downsizing projects would generally

require  large contracts to be broken down into smaller parcels.

Apart from losing the economy of scale and lower prices achieved

in  large contracts, the public sector agencies would also incur

higher  overheads to manage a larger number of smaller projects.

Nonetheless,  my Ministry will encourage public sector  agencies

to study and consider such project downsizing where feasible and

where  there is likely to be minimal impact on procurement  cost

and administrative overheads.

<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Manpower how many

Central  Provident Fund (CPF) account holders will need to  seek

other sources of funds to service their home mortgage loans when

there is a 5% or 10% reduction in the employer's contribution to

CPF.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, Question Nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 are

on  the  same subject.  May I have your permission to take  them

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at the end of May

1998, 524,006 active CPF members are withdrawing CPF savings  to

service monthly housing loan instalments.  Of these, 101,914 CPF

members  (or  19.4%) are withdrawing the full  amount  of  their

monthly contributions to service mortgage repayments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously stated that the Government has no

intention to cut the employer's share of CPF contributions  this

year.   I would like to reassure hon. Members that this is still

the  position.   However, if the situation continues  to  worsen

next  year,  we  may  have   to  consider  a  reduction  in  the

employer's CPF contribution rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who have to seek alternative source of

funds  to service their mortgage loans is not just dependent  on

the size of the CPF reduction.  It is also related to the amount

of  savings  that  the CPF member already  has  in  his  or  her

ordinary  account.   Some  of  these  savings  can  be  used  to

supplement  the  monthly  contributions  to  meet  the  mortgage

repayment.   Furthermore, the distribution of a CPF cut  amongst

the  Ordinary, Special and Medisave Accounts will also  have  an

impact  on mortgage servicing by CPF members.  These are  issues

which  will be carefully studied when it is necessary to make  a

CPF cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When CPF contributions were cut in 1986, several assistance

schemes were made available by the Government, in particular, to

help home-owners with their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>

mortgage  repayments.   For those with HDB  housing  loans,  HDB

extended the loan repayment period and allowed conversion of the

loans  to  easy-payment schemes such as the  ballooning  scheme.

Those  with  no  income or had used up their CPF balances  could

also  apply  to defer payments for up to a year.  The Government

also  offered bridging loans to those with private housing loans

to  service.  These were given at a special rate of 0.1%   above

the  CPF  interest  rate.  Home-owners who took  bridging  loans

could  repay  either  in  cash  or  through  their  future   CPF

contributions  over  10  years.   Similar  assistance  will   be

considered if we need to make a CPF cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell

the  House how many CPF members have sufficient funds to service

their  mortgage  repayments if there is a CPF cut  in  the  near

future?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained in my

answer,  that would depend on how much we have to cut.  It  will

also depend on how much savings the individual CPF member has in

his  Ordinary Account, and it also depends on how we spread  the

cut  on  the different accounts.  CPF members would, of  course,

know  that  whatever savings they have in their Special  Account

could not be used for any other purpose.  If, in fact, it  is  a

crisis  situation and we have to make a change,  we  could  even

consider  allowing  some of them to use part  of  their  Special

Account  savings.  These are all questions that have got  to  be

carefully  considered when we come to the point  of  considering

such  a move.  I think it is premature at this stage for  me  to

give Members figures of how many people will be affected because

there are so many imponderables here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to the Minister, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Notwithstanding what the Minister said in

his  last statement, could he give us the figures for those  who

have   withdrawn  up  to  90%  and  95%  of  the   full   amount

respectively, so that we can get an idea that if,  let  us  say,

the CPF is cut by 5% or 10%, how many will be affected?  Because

the  Minister did say that 19.4% are withdrawing up to the  full

amount.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, as I stated in my answer, 101,914

CPF  members are withdrawing the full amount.  I do not have the

figures  of  people who are withdrawing 95% or 90%.   And  as  I

said,  even  if we have the figures, it would still not  reflect

the  actual  scale of difficulties faced by CPF members  because

the  cut  can  be spread in a number of ways, depending  on  the

actual  circumstances.  And how they will be  affected  is  also

linked, as I said earlier on, to how much existing savings  they

have in their Ordinary Accounts.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL RETRENCHMENT BENEFITS FUND</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  the Government will consider (i) setting up  a  Central

Retrenchment  Benefits  Fund in which individual  companies  are

required  to  maintain  an  account  with  the  Fund;  and  (ii)

requiring companies to contribute a certain amount to  the  Fund

yearly  from  their  profits for the purpose  of  ensuring  that

workers  who  are  retrenched and are eligible for  retrenchment

benefits will get the payment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the setting up of a

Central  Retrenchment Benefits Fund is not a sound  proposition.

By  requiring companies to set aside part of their profits every

year,  we  will  be  tying up their financial  resources.   This

requirement  will  also affect the cash flow  of  companies  and

weaken  their  ability to seize new business opportunities.   To

establish such a Fund now when the economy is slowing down,  and

may  even  go  into recession, could hasten the demise  of  more

companies.  So instead of doing good, it may end up causing more

workers to lose their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore not in favour of the proposal to set up a

Central  Retrenchment Benefits Fund.  This,  however,  does  not

mean  that  workers are not paid retrenchment benefit when  they

are  laid  off.  In fact, retrenched workers with a  minimum  of

three  years'  service  are eligible for a retrenchment  benefit

although the quantum of payment varies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>

from company to company and depends on the financial position of

each  company.  For workers with less than three years' service,

it is also not uncommon for their employers to grant them an ex-gratia   payment   to  help  them  tide  over  their   immediate

difficulties before they secure an alternative job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the current economic difficulties, I urge

all companies with excess manpower to consider retrenchment as a

last  resort.   They  should seriously explore  alternatives  to

retrenchment, including sending their employees for training and

skills upgrading with Government's financial support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, nowhere in the Question did I

suggest  that  a Fund should be set up now.  Does  the  Minister

agree  that  workers  will get very little  or  no  retrenchment

benefit  if a company goes under and the proceeds from the  sale

of the assets are insufficient to meet the claims of its secured

creditors?  In that case, the workers will get nothing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second supplementary question: does the Minister agree

that the situation of retrenched workers under the circumstances

getting very little or no retrenchment benefit is the result  of

the  Government failing to establish a mechanism to secure  such

payments  in  advance, whether by benefit  or  whatsoever,  when

times  are  good?  And when times are bad and if a company  goes

under, the retrenchment benefit goes down the drain as well.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I thought the Member asked whether

the  Government will consider setting up a Central  Retrenchment

Benefits  Fund.   So  I presume that he is  asking  whether  the

Government would consider setting up such a Fund now, is it not?

If  he raises a Question at this point in time, that means he is

asking whether the Government would do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to his supplementary question, what happens if a

company is in liquidation and has no substantial assets  to  pay

retrenchment benefit?  Even if we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>

a  law  to  provide for retrenchment benefit to be paid  or  the

quantum  is stated in the law, if a company has no assets,  then

there is nothing that can be done.  The company is bankrupt.  It

has no assets.  So there is no way that we can force the company

to cough up retrenchment benefit for workers that are now out of

job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that the situation of some workers who

are  retrenched  with little or no retrenchment benefit  is  the

result  of  the  Government not doing anything to protect  their

interest  in advance.  I think that is quite wrong, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.   The  law  has provided for the employees with  more  than

three years' service to be eligible for retrenchment benefit and

the  trade unions have certainly acted on this provision because

they   have   ensured  that  in  their  collective   agreements,

retrenchment benefit is clearly spelt out and the practice today

in  the  unionised  sector  is for retrenchment  benefit  to  be

calculated anywhere from two weeks to a month for each  year  of

service.   Companies that are retrenching workers and are  still

in  a  sound  financial  situation very often  comply  with  the

provision  for  retrenchment  benefit  within  their  collective

agreements.  So it is incorrect to say  that the Government  has

not   looked  after  the  needs  of  workers  with   regard   to

retrenchment benefit.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, whilst I appreciate the Minister's

answer  that  it  may  be wrong to burden  companies  with  more

payments  at  this particular time, has the Ministry  considered

setting up a retrenchment fund and transferring some of the huge

amount  of  monies that the Government has collected by  way  of

foreign worker levies, and the Ministers also giving up  a  part

of their salaries to put into this retrenchment fund?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the foreign worker levy

is  collected for a totally different purpose.  It is a means of

moderating  the  demand for foreign workers, in particular,  the

lower skilled foreign workers.  As to Government setting up such

a  retrenchment  fund, whether it is from fees and  levies  that

Government has collected from elsewhere

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>

or  even  from  cuts  in  Ministers' salaries,  I  think  it  is

appropriate  for  me  to  point out  to  the  Member  that  such

retrenchment  funds  set  up  elsewhere  have  very  often   not

delivered the results that they have been set up for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read to Members the assessment which was made by the

Japan Institute of Labour.  This was carried by the Japan Labour

Bulletin  which was published in March this year.   This  is  on

their  assessment  of  the national unemployment  benefits.   In

Japan, since the early 80s, they have established  an employment

insurance scheme with the help of the government.  I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, since 1994, the scheme has been in the red due to

the   worsening  employment  situation  in  Japan.   Given  this

situation,  the  Central Employment Security  Council  has  been

studying ways to reduce the national treasury's contribution and

to  revise the employment insurance scheme in order to  keep  up

with  changes in the industrial structure and the ageing of  the

population.'



So,  what  it says here is that a country, with Japan's economic

resources  and trillions of dollars of reserves,  is  unable  to

sustain a national employment insurance scheme in order  to  pay

unemployment benefits to out-of-job workers.  Do you think  that

a  country  like Singapore, with the limited resources  that  we

have, would be in a position to do better?  The real solution is

to ensure that we continue to achieve steady economic growth and

that  new  jobs will be created so that retrenched workers  have

the  opportunity  to  take on these new  jobs.   And  where  the

retrenched  workers are unable to fulfil the skill  requirements

of  the  new  employers, then the Government  will  come  in  to

provide the necessary support, including funding, so that  these

workers' skills can be upgraded or they can be retrained to take

on these new jobs.  That is the only permanent and real solution

to the problem of unemployment and retrenchment.

<br><br><div align="center"><b>Statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, Members are aware that the Malaysian Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>

has  announced  that their Customs, Immigration  and  Quarantine

(CIQ)  facilities  will  remain at  the  Tanjong  Pagar  Railway

Station,  even though Singapore had told them on many  occasions

that  they could not remain there after Singapore relocates  its

CIQ  to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint (WTCP) tomorrow.  Members

would  have also read the press statement issued by the Ministry

of  Home  Affairs  yesterday evening, and  reported  in  today's

newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at our last meeting on 29th June this year, I informed

this  House  that  Singapore's CIQ  at  Tanjong  Pagar  will  be

relocated to the new facilities at WTCP on 1st August  1998.   I

said  that  we  had first informed Malaysia of our intention  to

move  to  Woodlands  in  1989  and had  repeated  this  on  many

subsequent  occasions.  We told them that once  Singapore's  CIQ

moved to  Woodlands, the administrative arrangements for them to

exercise CIQ functions at Tanjong Pagar would cease.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that sitting on 29th June, I had also stressed that the

relocation of Singapore's CIQ to Woodlands and the cessation  of

Malaysia's  CIQ at Tanjong Pagar did not affect  the  status  of

Malayan  Railway  Land,  which  is  subject  to  the  Points  of

Agreement (POA).  Indeed, this issue of relocation of our CIQ is

completely different and separate from the POA and the status of

the  Malayan Railway Land or the Tanjong Pagar Railway  Station.

The  Ministry of Law's press statement of 8th July 1998 repeated

this position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Government's insistence to continue

conducting  immigration clearance at Tanjong Pagar  has  serious

consequences.   They will be doing so without  legal  authority.

If  they  endorse  passports of rail passengers travelling  from

Singapore to Malaysia, it would be unauthorised and contrary  to

the  proper sequence of immigration clearance.  Under  Singapore

law, this would create irregularities in the passport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore explain the full background of the CIQ

issue, so that Members

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>

will   know   that   the  Singapore  Government   has   expended

considerable effort and has made many proposals to  Malaysia  to

resolve this issue, in a way which would not disrupt the  smooth

operation   of   train   services   from   1st   August    1998.

Unfortunately, Sir, these efforts have not been successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision to relocate Singapore's CIQ to the Woodlands

Checkpoint was not a sudden or surprise move.  It goes  all  the

way  back  to  1989,  when we decided on  our  move  of  CIQ  to

Woodlands  in order to check the smuggling of drugs, to  prevent

entry  of  illegal  immigrants as well  as  to  deploy  our  own

manpower  more  efficiently.  In November 1989, as  I  was  then

Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  I briefed  the  Malaysian  Deputy

Minister for Home Affairs, Dato Megat Junid, of our plan to move

our  CIQ and the rationale for our decision.  Slightly more than

two  years later, I wrote to him again on 1st  February 1992  to

inform  him  that,  "The  Development  masterplan  for  the  new

Woodlands  Checkpoint, which includes clearance  facilities  for

train passengers and cargoes, is now ready."  He replied on  3rd

March 1992, and said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have passed the information to the Hon. Prime Minister

who is also the Minister for Home Affairs Malaysia."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, our two Prime Ministers touched on this matter in

their correspondence.



In  a letter of 4th April 1992, Prime Minister Mahathir wrote to

PM Goh, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We understand why you would want to have Customs and

Immigration checks at Woodlands.  In fact, we feel that it would

be   more  convenient  for  both  countries  to  have  the  same

checkpoint in Woodlands."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th April 1992, Prime Minister Goh replied to Prime

Minister Mahathir, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This can be done. I have asked Jayakumar to include

facilities for Malaysia's customs and immigration at Woodlands."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this agreement between the two Prime Ministers,

the Ministry of Home Affairs briefed Malaysian officials in June

1992 on the details of Singapore's plan to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>

relocate its CIQ to the Woodlands Checkpoint.  We informed  them

what  facilities could be made available to them if they  wished

to co-locate their CIQ at Woodlands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 20th September 1993, the Malaysian Government

officially informed Singapore that they had decided to co-locate

their CIQ with Singapore's at Woodlands Train Checkpoint.  Dato'

Halim  Ali,  then  Deputy Secretary-General 1 of  the  Malaysian

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, wrote to the Singapore Ministry  of

Home Affairs, and he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish to inform you that the Malaysian Government has

decided to locate the operation of the Malaysian Immigration and

Customs  at  Woodlands Checkpoint together with  Singapore's  to

facilitate  immigration and customs clearance of passengers  and

goods  entering and leaving Malaysia by rail through  Woodlands,

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore therefore proceeded to plan the construction

of  the  Woodlands Train Checkpoint on the basis that Malaysia's

CIQ  would  co-locate with Singapore's CIQ  at  Woodlands  Train

Checkpoint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost four years later, on 11th June 1997, the Malaysian

Government wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs stating that it

had  changed  its  mind and had decided to  retain  its  CIQ  at

Tanjong  Pagar.  The letter was signed by Dato Ghazzali  Sheikh,

Deputy Secretary-General 1, of the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign

Affairs.   It  gave no reasons, although considerable  work  had

been  done  by  Singapore in planning and  construction  of  the

Woodlands  Train Checkpoint on the basis of co-location.   After

Malaysia  had  rejected co-location, Singapore then reconfigured

the   Woodlands   Train  Checkpoint  building  to   serve   only

Singapore's needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd July 1997, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore,

replied  to  the  Malaysian Government that since  Malaysia  had

rejected  Singapore's offer to co-locate its CIQ  at  Woodlands,

once  Singapore's  CIQ moved to Woodlands their  CIQ  could  not

remain at Tanjong Pagar because of two reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it will create serious operational problems for

both countries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Malaysian officials would be operating without

the  presence of Singapore officials to lend their authority and

powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note from what I have said that Malaysia had

been  given notice more than a year ago that once we  moved  our

CIQ,  their CIQ could not stay in Tanjong Pagar.  Since Malaysia

had  rejected Woodlands and we had told them that they could not

stay in Tanjong Pagar, this meant they had to relocate their CIQ

to their own territory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd February 1998, Singapore officials informed

Keretapi  Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) at a meeting that Singapore

agencies  would operate at Woodlands  Train Checkpoint from  1st

August  1998.   KTMB was also requested to be ready  to  operate

from  there  on  1st  August 1998.  On  25th  March  1998,  KTMB

confirmed,  and I quote, "as far as KTMB was concerned,  it  was

working towards 1st August 1998 to be operationally ready."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th April 1998, Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore,

officially  wrote  to  Dato Ghazzali  Sheikh  of  the  Malaysian

Ministry  of Foreign Affairs to inform the Malaysian  Government

that  Singapore would commence its CIQ operations  in  Woodlands

from 1st August 1998.  In its letter, MHA stated, "In accordance

with  the  letter  of  2nd July 1997, (previous  year's  letter)

Malaysia  is  requested  to cease its  Immigration  and  Customs

clearance of rail passengers and rail cargo at the Tanjong Pagar

Railway  Station  by 1st August 1998.  Malaysia should  relocate

its rail CIQ operations within its own territory."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th May 1998, Malaysian officials met with their

Singapore counterparts to discuss the matter.  At this  meeting,

Dato  Ghazzali Sheikh asked Deputy Secretary of the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs,  Mr  Tan Boon Huat, whether  the  option  of  co-location at Woodlands Train Checkpoint was still open.   Mr  Tan

reiterated that since Malaysia had rejected co-location in their

letter of 2nd July 1997, the offer had lapsed.  Furthermore, the

Woodlands Checkpoint had since been built without provision  for

Malaysian CIQ facilities.  Mr

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>

Tan  also  explained that Malaysia would have to  move  its  CIQ

facilities  out of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station by  1st  August

1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th July 1998, at Malaysia's request, officials from

both  sides  met in Singapore.  At this meeting, the  Malaysians

claimed  for the first time that Malaysia had a legal  right  to

retain    their   customs   at   Tanjong   Pagar.    Singapore's

representative  from the Attorney-General's  Chambers  disagreed

with   this   legal  claim.   For  Malaysian  Immigration,   the

Malaysians  conceded that there was no enabling  legislation  to

allow them to operate in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore officials stressed that Malaysia's CIQ could not

remain at  Tanjong Pagar because there was no legal basis for it

to  do  so.   Moreover, this would pose operational difficulties

and  result  in  an  illogical sequence of passenger  clearance,

which  is  not in accordance with international practice.   This

improper  sequence  of clearance would cause problems  in  crime

investigation  and  prosecution and also raise  difficult  legal

issues  of  proof.  Singapore informed the Malaysians that  they

had to move their CIQ to Johor Baru.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian officials did not dispute that the sequence

of  immigration clearance would be illogical if its  immigration

operations  remained at Tanjong Pagar when  Singapore  moved  to

Woodlands.    However,   they  proposed  that   Malaysia   grant

conditional  immigration clearance in advance at  Tanjong  Pagar

which  would not be valid until followed up by a final clearance

by  Singapore Immigration at Woodlands.  Singapore informed them

that this suggestion for advance clearance was not practical, as

it would not resolve and address the basic issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sides met again on 17th July 1998. Since Malaysia

claimed  a  legal right for their Customs to remain  at  Tanjong

Pagar,  but  Singapore  did  not  agree  with  their  claim,  we

requested  Malaysia to forward detailed written legal  arguments

within three months for further study by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>

Singapore's Attorney-General.  Officials from the two  Attorney-Generals' Chambers would then meet to clarify the legal position

on the basis of which Malaysia claimed that it has a legal right

for  its  Customs  to continue operating in  Singapore.   As  an

interim  arrangement,  Singapore would allow  Malaysian  customs

officers  to  operate at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station,  and  we

would  station  Singapore  officials at  Tanjong  Pagar  Railway

Station to lend their authority to Malaysian customs officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards immigration, Malaysia now also argued that

despite  the  absence  of  any specific  legislation,  Malaysian

Immigration  had  a  legal  basis to operate  at  Tanjong  Pagar

Railway  Station,  on  the  basis  of  acquiescence  and   state

practice, which was backed by international law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore disagreed. For Malaysia to locate its

immigration  control  post  in  Singapore  is  actually  not  in

compliance with Malaysia's own law.  Under Malaysian law,  Johor

Bahru  railway  station is gazetted as the  immigration  control

post for persons travelling from Singapore to Malaysia by train,

and  not Tanjong Pagar Railway Station.  Indeed, they could  not

gazette  Tanjong  Pagar Railway Station as it  is  in  Singapore

territory.   In  fact, this is confirmed by the  endorsement  or

chop  on  passports of passengers boarding the train at  Tanjong

Pagar,  which  clearly  states that  the  Malaysian  Immigration

Control Point is in Johor Bahru.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Singapore agreed that Malaysia could make its

case  on immigration arrangements in the written arguments  that

it had agreed to present within three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after claiming the right under law to have their CIQ

remain  in Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, Malaysia said  at  the

10th and 17th July 1998 meetings that they would now like to co-locate  with  Singapore at the Woodlands Checkpoint.   Singapore

did  not  agree.  We explained that when Malaysia  rejected  co-location  last year on 11th June 1997, Singapore had decided  on

physical arrangements that made no provision for Malaysia's CIQ.

Furthermore, we decided that it was best

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>

that   the   respective  CIQ  arrangements  be  regularised   in

accordance  with international practice by each  country  having

its  own  CIQ in its own territory as is the case for road,  air

and sea transport and travel between Singapore and Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We informed Malaysia at the meeting of 17th July 1998 that

if it needed more time to relocate its immigration operations to

Johor  Bahru, Singapore would, as an interim arrangement,  allow

Malaysian  Immigration  to board outgoing  trains  at  Woodlands

Checkpoint and clear passengers onboard the train after they had

been cleared for exit from Singapore.  Our officials also handed

over an Aide Memoire explaining this to the Malaysian delegation

at the meeting.  The Malaysians rejected the option of clearance

on  the  train.  However, Datuk Abdul Kadir Mohamad,  Secretary-General  of the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requested

for   some  desks  on  the  Woodlands  Checkpoint  platform  for

Malaysian  immigration clearance.  Our officials did not  accede

to his request.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after that meeting on 17th July 1998, Datuk

Kadir  told  my  Permanent Secretary BG  Tan  Chin  Tiong  in  a

telephone  conversation that it was not practical for  Malaysian

Immigration officials to conduct checks onboard the  trains,  as

it  would mean reducing KTMB's current train schedules by  half.

Based on our own calculations and experience, this was not true.

However,   I  wanted  to  resolve  this  issue.   Therefore,   I

authorised  my  Permanent Secretary to  tell  Datuk  Kadir  that

Singapore  had agreed to his request for desks at the  Woodlands

Checkpoint   passenger   platform  for   Malaysian   Immigration

clearance,  as  an  interim  arrangement.   BG  Tan  Chin  Tiong

conveyed  this  by telephone to Datuk Kadir on 19th  July  1998.

Datuk  Kadir replied that it was good that Singapore had offered

to  allow Malaysia a few desks for its immigration clearance  at

Woodlands as this would make Malaysian Immigration more orderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was clear that we had settled on interim

arrangements  for both customs and immigration.   Singapore  had

gone to considerable lengths to do so.  On 24th

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>

July  1998, Singapore's Acting High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur

handed over an Aide Memoire and press statement to the Malaysian

Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs, placing on record  these  interim

arrangements which had been discussed and settled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs

issued  a press statement, claiming factual inaccuracies in  the

MHA press statement, and denying that Malaysia had agreed on the

interim  arrangements described by Singapore.  It denied  asking

for  desks  on  the Woodlands Checkpoint passenger platform  for

Malaysian  Immigration.  It claimed that Malaysia had  requested

for  space  inside the Woodlands Checkpoint building.  Moreover,

the  Undersecretary (Southeast Asia and South  Pacific)  at  the

Malaysian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Arshad  Hussain,  was

quoted in Bernama as saying:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All we are asking for is co-location inside the Woodlands

Train checkpoint as [in] the original plan."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th July 1998, MHA issued a press statement expressing

puzzlement and surprise that Malaysia had disputed the MHA press

statement  of 24th July 1998.  In the statement, MHA  said  that

Singapore  had  worked  on  the basis  that  both  Malaysia  and

Singapore  wanted smooth train operations when  Singapore  moves

its  CIQ  to Woodlands Checkpoint on 1st August 1998.  That  was

why  Singapore had responded positively to Datuk Kadir's request

for   a  few  desks  on  the  passenger  platform  at  Woodlands

Checkpoint  for  Malaysian  immigration  clearance.    Singapore

therefore did not understand why Malaysia now claimed that there

was  no agreement on interim arrangements for Malaysia's CIQ  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I subsequently met Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah

Badawi  during the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in  Manila  on

25th July 1998.  Minister Badawi and I had worked closely before

whenever  we had bilateral problems.  He requested a meeting  to

see if we could resolve the impasse.  Minister Abdullah Badawi's

main  concern  was  that  the interim  arrangements  offered  to

Malaysian Immigration should be "functional and presentable".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>

He agreed with me that Malaysian Immigration could not remain at

Tanjong  Pagar  after 31st July 1998, because  the  sequence  of

immigration  clearance  would  be  illogical  and  contrary   to

international practice.  He also agreed that there would  be  no

co-location  of Malaysian Immigration with Singapore Immigration

inside the building at Woodlands Checkpoint.  On this basis,  we

agreed  to instruct our immigration officials to meet  again  as

soon  as possible to work out interim arrangements for Malaysian

Immigration  at Woodlands Checkpoint which would  be  functional

and  presentable.  Following my meeting with Minister Badawi,  I

issued a short press statement summarising these agreed points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore immediately followed up by inviting Malaysian

Immigration  officials to a meeting in Singapore  on  28th  July

1998.   The  Malaysian officials agreed to come  down  for  this

meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the evening before the scheduled meeting, Prime

Minister  Mahathir  who  was  then in  Namibia,  was  quoted  in

Bernama, saying that Malaysia would not shift its CIQ facilities

in  Singapore from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands.  He was  reported

to have said to accompanying Malaysian journalists, and I quote:

"That's our stand and we will stick to it."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malaysian delegation which attended the meeting on

28th  July 1998 did not do so with an open mind to resolve  this

issue conclusively.   The talks broke down because the Malaysian

officials insisted that Malaysian Immigration should be  located

within  our  Woodlands Checkpoint building, notwithstanding  the

understanding  between Minister Abdullah Badawi  and  myself  in

Manila.    The   officials   said  that   otherwise,   Malaysian

Immigration would remain at Tanjong Pagar.  Singapore  officials

repeatedly  assured  them that functional and  very  presentable

interim  arrangements would be set up for Malaysian  Immigration

at  the  Woodlands  Checkpoint.  But  the  Malaysian  delegation

refused to consider them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, Singapore even proposed that the immigration

booths  on  the platform could be air-conditioned to  make  them

more comfortable.  The facilities would be even more presentable

and  functional than those at the Tanjong Pagar  platform.   The

Woodlands  Checkpoint  platform is 10 metres  wide,  wider  than

Tanjong  Pagar  which  is  only 8 metres,  but  which  currently

accommodates both Malaysian and Singapore Immigration  clearance

facilities  without difficulty at Tanjong Pagar.  The  Malaysian

delegation, however, insisted that this was unsatisfactory,  but

gave  no reasons for this even though they are already operating

on the platform at Tanjong Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore delegation reminded the Malaysians that if

the  Malaysian  Immigration  remained  at  Tanjong  Pagar  after

Singapore Immigration moves to the Woodlands Checkpoint  on  1st

August  1998,  the  sequence of immigration clearance  for  rail

passengers  departing Singapore would be illogical and  contrary

to international practice.  Malaysian Immigration would cease to

have  any  authority to clear immigration at Tanjong Pagar  once

Singapore Immigration is no longer at Tanjong Pagar to lend them

their authority.  The Malaysian delegation, however, refused  to

consider our position.  Instead they abruptly ended the  meeting

and left.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, let me sum up by expressing my regret

that  the extended discussions with Malaysia to work out interim

arrangements for the Malaysian CIQ have broken down.  As Members

can  see, Singapore had gone to considerable lengths and made  a

series  of  proposals  and compromises  to  resolve  the  issue.

However,  Malaysia  has changed its position  again  and  again.

First,  in1993  they said they wanted to co-locate  with  us  in

Woodlands.   Then  in  1997 they abruptly  changed  their  mind,

rejected co-location and said they would stay in Tanjong  Pagar.

Then in talks between officials this year, they claimed they had

a  legal  right  for their CIQ to stay in Tanjong  Pagar.   Then

after  claiming  this legal right to be at Tanjong  Pagar,  they

said that they wanted to go back to the "original plan" to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>

co-locate  at Woodlands.  Then finally, Prime Minister  Mahathir

said they would stay in Tanjong Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that we have been consistent and tried to

be  reasonable  and helpful at every stage of our dealings  with

the  Malaysians  on  this issue and we have made  the  following

concessions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, after they rejected co-location, our position was

that their CIQ should be located in Malaysian territory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then claimed legal rights to stay at Tanjong Pagar.

We  were  prepared  to hear their legal arguments,  and  pending

resolution   of  the  legal  issue  we  agreed  as  an   interim

arrangement to let their Customs operate temporarily at  Tanjong

Pagar  and  we would post our officers there to lend them  legal

authority

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clearance by their Immigration, when they

refused to relocate to Johor Bahru and claimed a legal right  to

operate  in  Singapore,  we offered to allow  their  Immigration

officers  to  board  trains at Woodlands  Checkpoint  and  clear

passengers on the trains en route to Johor Bahru, as an  interim

measure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Malaysia argued that this did not give Malaysian

Immigration  enough  time to clear all  passengers,  we  offered

Malaysian Immigration the option of clearing passengers on board

stationary  trains at Woodlands Checkpoint but  after  Singapore

had cleared passengers for exit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia said this was unorderly, might upset train

schedules,  and  asked  for  desks on the  Woodlands  Checkpoint

platform.  We agreed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then expressed the concern that the desks were not

presentable.   So we offered to assist Malaysian Immigration  by

setting  up  airconditioned booths at the Woodlands  Checkpoint.

But at the final meeting on 28th July, they insisted on location

inside the main building, otherwise they would remain at Tanjong

Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, our High Commissioner in Malaysia presented

an Aide Memoire to

the  Malaysian  Foreign Ministry in Kuala Lumpur  stated,  inter

alia, the following, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rail passengers will face following difficulties if

Malaysian  Immigration  insists on  executing  their  duties  at

Tanjong  Pagar Railway Station after 31st July 1998 without  any

legal authority:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Malaysian Immigration officers performing immigration

functions  at  Tanjong Pagar will be acting  without  any  legal

authority.  All endorsements made by them on Singapore passports

will  be unauthorised and improper.  The sequence of immigration

clearance  will  also  be  contrary to  international  practice.

Accordingly,  questions of serious irregularity in the  passport

will arise under Singapore law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As the sequence of immigration clearance is illogical

and   contrary  to  international  practice,  foreign   national

passengers  exiting  from Singapore with such  unauthorised  and

improper  endorsements on their passports may face  difficulties

at Singapore Immigration checkpoints.



Travellers who enter Singapore by rail from Johor Bahru will not

be   affected  as  they  are  following  the  correct  order  of

immigration clearance, exit granted by Malaysian Immigration  in

Johor and entry granted by Singapore Immigration in Woodlands."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysian Immigration's insistence to clear entry into

Malaysia at Tanjong Pagar railway station after 31st July before

Singapore  has cleared them for exit from Singapore  will  cause

inconvenience to rail passengers.  The interim arrangements that

Singapore  had offered for Malaysian Immigration in  Singapore's

Aide  Memoire  of  24th  July 1998 after discussions  with  both

Foreign   Ministers   in  Manila  would   have   avoided   this.

Unfortunately, Malaysian officials have rejected  these  interim

arrangements and abruptly ended the 28th July 1998 meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia has not informed Singapore exactly how it

intends  to  proceed  after  31st  July  1998,  after  rejecting

Singapore's proposal of airconditioned counters on the Woodlands

Train  Checkpoint  and  insisting that  their  Immigration  will

conduct  clearance at Tanjong Pagar.  Singapore regrets that  it

has  to issue a travel advisory to inform rail passengers of the

inconvenience   and  difficulties  that  they   will   face   if

Immigration officials persist in granting passengers entry  into

Malaysia at Tanjong Pagar before Singapore clears them for  exit

at Woodlands.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that the

continued positioning of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>

Malaysian Immigration officials at Tanjong Pagar is going to  be

a legal and sovereign issue.  Is there any plan for Singapore to

stop them from operating at Tanjong Pagar as from tomorrow, Sir?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, going by press reports of the last

few days, Malaysian politicians have been saying that this is an

excuse to force Malaysia out of Tanjong Pagar and that Singapore

will take over ownership of the land at Tanjong Pagar.  In other

words,  if the Malaysians should vacate Tanjong Pagar, Singapore

will  use  that  as an excuse to take over the land  at  Tanjong

Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is, operationally, as from tomorrow, when

passengers  board  at  Tanjong Pagar  and  reach  our  Woodlands

Checkpoint, what action would the Minister take in view  of  the

fact that their passports would now not be regularised?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to ask the Minister whether the far-fetched Malaysian legal

position  and  claims would in fact mean that it is  undermining

our  own  sovereignty as a country and that the  Malaysians  are

taking for granted our goodwill and patience on this matter.   I

also  want  to  ask the Minister what would be the  Government's

position if a question is asked whether the Woodlands Checkpoint

building  is  spacious and large enough and whether  some  space

could  still be found for Malaysian Immigration officers  inside

the building.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

two  questions.   First,  I would like  to  know  what  are  the

difficulties  that  the  Malaysians are facing  with  regard  to

locating  their  CIQ  within their own territory.   While  these

talks  are  going on and they realise that the talks  may  break

down,  have  they made any preparation on their CIQ arrangements

or  use  their own platform within their own territory  so  that

they  can  cater  for  an  alternative in  case  co-location  in

Singapore cannot be agreed upon?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is whether there has been any

request from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>

Malaysians,  since  the  talks have been  reaching  a  difficult

stage, asking for deferment on our part on the implementation of

the movement of CIQ from tomorrow.  And if Singapore were to  be

given  this  request, will it be possible for us to accommodate,

given  that  we  already  have plans to  move  our  own  CIQ  to

Woodlands?

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, in today's Straits

Times,  it  is  reported  that,  "Singapore  should  not  decide

unilaterally  on the relocation of CIQ facilities  from  Tanjong

Pagar  to  Woodlands."  It was mentioned by UMNO Vice-President,

Dato  Sri  Najib Tun Razak.  I take it that Dato Sri  Najib  had

said  that we should not move to Woodlands.  In other words,  he

is  actually  questioning why we should move to  Woodlands  from

Tanjong  Pagar, thereby creating all these troubles and  issues.

May I have the Minister's comments, please?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, just now the

Minister  mentioned  that  the legal  right  that  Malaysia  has

towards  the  Tanjong Pagar land is accepted.  If  that  is  the

case,  there  may be a view taken as to why, if Malaysia  has  a

legal  right over the Tanjong Pagar land, it cannot operate  its

CIQ  there, as it is supposed to have the right to do  so.   Can

the Minister explain why therefore Singapore authority is needed

in that particular situation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Two clarifications, Sir. First, why

was  the Malaysian rail CIQ allowed to operate at Tanjong  Pagar

station  in the first place, since we are an independent nation?

Secondly, as an independent nation, why should we allow  another

country's CIQ, that is, Malaysia, to locate at Woodlands,  which

is  our land and  the Government has agreed earlier on?  Why  do

we  not  ask  the Malaysians to locate their CIQ at Johor  Bahru

train station?  They have a train station there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the

suggestion by Mr Low.  My question to the Minister is this.  Why

did  we first of all agree to allow their CIQ in Woodlands  when

there was an agreement to move in fact in September 1993?   Then

there was a change of heart.  What the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>

Malaysian  PM  is  asserting is tantamount to  extra-territorial

rights.   Singapore is a sovereign nation and  we  cannot  allow

that.   I  would like to have this clarification.  I would  like

the  Singapore Government to convey to the Malaysian  government

that  they  cannot  have  any extra-territorial  rights  in  our

country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister what is the title

that the KTM has to the land in Tanjong Pagar?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Two questions, Sir. The first is: what

is the difference between operating on the platform of Woodlands

and  operating within the Woodlands Checkpoint?  And the  second

point  is,  he mentioned about a travel advisory.  What  exactly

would  that  mean  for  those holding  Singapore  passports  and

Malaysian passports, respectively?

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, PM Mahathir is reported

to  have said that for agreements between Malaysia and Singapore

to  be  binding,  they have to be ratified by  his  Cabinet  and

Parliament.   This  cannot  be right because  if  Ministers  and

senior   civil  servants  cannot  bind  their  own  country   to

agreements signed by them, the question is how, in international

law,  should binding agreements be signed.  The second  question

is,  Sir, Malaysia is reported to have argued that there  is  an

agreement  to allow them to have CIQ at Tanjong Pagar  and  that

this document has not been terminated.  Is this correct, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I do not

understand why Malaysia claims that they have a right to stay in

Tanjong  Pagar as the piece of land belongs to them.   If  their

argument is correct, it means that if Singapore Government  owns

a  piece  of land in Johor Bahru, we can move our CIQ  to  Johor

Bahru too.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister  whether it is necessary for the Government to  gazette

the  Woodlands  Train  Checkpoint as  mandatory  for  all  train

passengers to clear their immigration at that point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, two issues. One is regarding non-Malaysians entering

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>

Singapore by train.  Basically, what it means is that they  will

be  entering  Singapore  illegally  since  they  have  not  left

Malaysia.   So  the  travel advisory is for Singapore  citizens.

How   do   we  advise  foreigners  who  are  entering  Singapore

illegally?  The second issue is that he mentioned that  the  CIQ

facilities in Tanjong Pagar would be illegal from tomorrow.   So

will we have any enforcement action to stop them from performing

their  duties?   Are  we going to arrest them  for  doing  their

duties illegally in Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, several questions were asked. Let

me  answer  them, perhaps not in the order that  was  asked.   I

think  Prof.  Chin  Tet Yung and one other MP  asked  about  the

status  of  the land, whether it is their land and  what  rights

ensue from it.  And I believe Mr Jeyaretnam also asked about the

title.   I am advised by the Attorney-General that Malaysia  has

the  legal  title  to the railway land.  It operates  a  railway

service on the land through KTM.  Under the terms of the leases,

the  railway  land is not intended to be used as a CIQ  station.

Malaysia in fact does not claim and has no sovereignty over  the

railway land.  It has legal title to the land in the same way as

an   individual   has  title  to  a  land.   However,   customs,

immigration and quarantine functions are State functions  which,

under international practice, have to be carried out only  by  a

State in the territory where it has sovereignty.  One State  may

not  carry out such functions in the territory of another  State

without  the consent of the latter as it infringes the sovereign

rights of the State, and I believe, two Members, Mr Rai and  Low

Thia Khiang, alluded to that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between railway operations on the one hand

and  CIQ  functions  is  that the railway  function  is  not  an

essential  or  inherent State function.  It  is  a  facilitative

service.  It is not an intrusive function.  CIQ functions are by

their very nature State functions which can only be carried  out

in  the territory in which the State has sovereign rights or  in

the  territory of another State if it is done by the consent  of

the latter.  To argue that Malaysia may perform CIQ functions at

Tanjong Pagar railway station because it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>

provides  a  railway service is actually like arguing  that  any

international  airline is entitled to perform CIQ operations  at

any  international airport other than its own home port, because

it provides an airline service.  Obviously, this cannot be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Chng Hee Kok asked whether this is

an  attempt  on Singapore's part to force them to  move  out  of

their Tanjong Pagar station and for the Singapore Government  to

take  back the land.  My answer to that is that it is completely

incorrect.   This  is because, as I have said in  Parliament  on

several occasions, last year as well as again this year on  29th

June, the CIQ issue does not in any way affect the status of the

Malayan  Railway  land or the status of their  railway  station.

These  matters  are  subject to the Points of  Agreement  (POA).

This  was also reiterated in the Ministry of Law's statement  of

8th  July  when the Ministry of Law stressed that the relocation

of  Malaysian CIQ operations from Tanjong Pagar is a  completely

different and separate issue from the POA, and separate from the

status  of the Malayan Railway land in Singapore or the  railway

station  in Tanjong Pagar.  What happens to the railway land  at

Tanjong  Pagar  is set out in the POA which I went  into  detail

last year in this House.  The POA sets out the agreement for the

redevelopment of Tanjong Pagar land on a 60:40 basis, 60% to the

Malaysian  government.   The terms of  the  POA  bind  Singapore

because  it  is a binding agreement.  On the 17th  July  meeting

between  the  officials, in fact, the Malaysian  officials  told

Singapore that they understood clearly that the CIQ and the  POA

are  different issues.  Therefore, because the CIQ  issue  is  a

very  different matter, there is no question of Singapore taking

Tanjong Pagar land back as that matter is covered by the POA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked: why do we not take action to

prevent  the Malaysian immigration from being physically present

at  Tanjong Pagar?  I think Members will note that we have taken

a  reasonable and consistent approach to this matter.  They have

claimed a legal right for both customs and immigration.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>

On immigration, there is no specific enabling legislation.  They

claim  that  they have a right based on acquiescence  backed  by

international  law.  We have said that we will give  them  three

months  to  present  their  legal  arguments,  and  we  have  no

objection to them being physically present at Tanjong Pagar, but

the important point is this.  Even if they can establish such  a

legal right which we dispute, it does not follow that they  have

a right to clear people for entry into Malaysia at Tanjong Pagar

before  such  people  have been properly  cleared  by  Singapore

Immigration for exit from Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked about the question of locating

outside  the platform, inside the building, and so on.   Let  me

answer  by saying, first, that they had rejected co-location  in

1997.  After they rejected co-location in 1997, MHA reconfigured

it  for Singapore's own use.  But while we sort out their  legal

claim,  what  we  really want to put in  place  are  interim  or

temporary facilities to ensure smooth functioning on 1st August.

In  fact, as I said, the facilities we are prepared to cater  on

the  platform  will be far more presentable and functional  than

what  they  have  at Tanjong Pagar station.  In  fact,  we  even

suggested to them that there could be air-conditioned booths  on

the  platform.  But why not inside our building?  Apart from  it

being  configured for our own use only, the fact  is  that  they

have  changed their minds so often on the CIQ issue, how can  we

be  sure that once they are inside, they would not claim that we

have   agreed  to  co-location  and  claim  the  right  to  stay

permanently.   We,  therefore,  think  that  it  is  best   that

Malaysian immigration be at the platform at Woodlands Checkpoint

so   that   there  can  be  no  doubt  that  these  are  interim

arrangements for three months during which they must  show  that

they  have a legal right to be at Tanjong Pagar.  Therefore,  it

is  best  for both sides to avoid such misunderstanding and  any

future  new problems by their moving inside Woodlands Checkpoint

and  not moving out later, claiming that this has become a legal

right,  as  they claim that they have a legal right  to  Tanjong

Pagar.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked: why can they not shift to Johor

Bahru?   What  are the insurmountable obstacles?  I  think  this

question  should actually be asked of the Malaysians.   We  have

asked  the  Malaysians.  We have not got any answer because  the

station  is  there.  They are using the station for checking  of

incoming passengers.  Yesterday's press statement and as I  have

said  today,  in fact, Johor Bahru railway station  is  gazetted

under  their  law  as  the  control  post  for  immigration  for

passengers going to Johor Bahru.  It is under their law.   So  I

am afraid I am unable to give an answer to that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has there been any request to defer the implementation from

1st August?  There has not been such a request.  But how will it

be  possible  for us to consider such a deferment when  we  have

given them such ample notice?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has hit the nail on the head when he

asked  that  as a sovereign nation, why can they not operate  in

Johor  Bahru.  Somebody else asked whether is it not a violation

of  sovereignty  to  insist to operate  in  Singapore.   I  have

answered the question when I spoke about the nature of the land.

The  basic principle is: these are State functions which, if you

insist  on  exercising in the territory of another  country,  it

must be on the basis of consent.  That is the cardinal principle

in international practice and in international law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked about agreements being ratified and

so  on.   I  think he is referring to the Points  of  Agreement,

whether  the statement that agreements are not agreements  until

and  unless  they have been ratified by Cabinet and  Parliament.

Or did I misunderstand him?

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Malaysians

refer  both  to  the  Points of Agreement and  the  exchange  of

letters   between  the  Secretary-General  and   the   Permanent

Secretary that they do not count.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It is not altogether clear to us when the

statement  was made that agreements and documents signed,  other

than  by Heads of States, are not binding, it is not clear  that

reference is to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>

agreements  other than the POA.  But whatever the case  may  be,

these  are questions of law and there is a proper way to resolve

these  issues.   As  Members know, despite our initial  position

that  they  must move, when they claim a legal right,  we  said,

"All  right, let us sit down, exchange the legal arguments, sort

out between the two Attorneys-General".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the POA, I have already said in Parliament on a previous

occasion that there is a divergence of legal views on this.  The

Malaysians  have taken the view that the POA is  operative  when

they  decide  that they wish to vacate Tanjong Pagar.   We  have

taken  the view, and we think we are right in law, that the  POA

became  operational on the day it was signed by the  then  Prime

Minister Lee Kuan Yew on behalf of the Singapore Government  and

Finance Minister, Mr Daim Zainudin, signing clearly on behalf of

the  Government of Malaysia.  But since there is this divergence

of view, we have proposed that this legal dispute be referred to

arbitration  or the International Court of Justice, and  Members

would  have read that the come back to that is that there is  no

need to go to the International Court of Justice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not

answered  my  question  on how the Malaysians  were  allowed  to

operate at Tanjong Pagar in the first place.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The short answer to that is that this goes

back  to some years back.  We allowed them to operate when  they

made  a  request, but there is one very significant point  which

all  of us must know, that when we allowed them to operate,  our

authorities were present at Tanjong Pagar.  In other  words,  we

lent  them legal authority.  We allowed them to be there so long

as we were co-located with them.  And because we were co-located

with  them,  our  Customs officers and our Immigration  officers

were  there to lend them legal authority.  Because they have  no

legal  authority to exercise functions of arrest and  so  on  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number two. The logical sequence was not a problem.

Passengers who were to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>

board a train had to clear Singapore Immigration first and  then

clear  Malaysian Immigration.  So those are the two main reasons

why  we  have  permitted and allowed the state of affairs.   But

once  we  move  to  Woodlands, (a) they do not  have  the  legal

authority, and (b) the logical sequence will be totally contrary

to international practice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my

question.  Let me rephrase the question.  As from tomorrow, will

Singaporeans  boarding at Tanjong Pagar infringe any   Singapore

law?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the precise answer to the

question  cannot  be given today because we  do  not  know  what

exactly  the  Malaysian immigration are going to do  at  Tanjong

Pagar.   They have not told us how they intend to do or whatever

they  are going to do at Tanjong Pagar.  And until we know that,

we  are  unable to determine what exactly is going to happen  to

the  passengers or to the passports of the passengers.  That  is

why  we  have said yesterday that obviously because the  logical

sequence  is completely askew, passengers may face difficulties.

What  exactly  are  these difficulties  they  will  have  to  be

determined only after tomorrow.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, the Minister has

answered  my question.  But I am just wondering and  this  is  a

very  practical question.  On 1st August, a train  leaves  Johor

Bahru and it comes all the way to Tanjong Pagar.  The passengers

must seek clearance from the Malaysian authorities.  They cannot

leave Tanjong Pagar.  So they have got to take the train back to

Woodlands, get clearance from the Singapore Immigration and then

they  can leave.  That is what I understand, or do they have  to

stop at Woodlands?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I have already said that for passengers

coming  in from Malaysia and Johor Bahru into Singapore,  we  do

not envisage any problems because the logical sequence would  be

complied  with,  namely, clearance for exit in  Malaysia,  Johor

Baru, and clearance for entry at Woodlands in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> That means they must stop at Woodlands

when they come in.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Of course, yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we

relocate the CIQ to Woodlands tomorrow, does it mean that we are

withdrawing the recognition of extra-territorial rights  on  the

part of the Malaysian Government to operate their CIQ facilities

in Singapore? If we do withdraw the recognition of these rights,

does  it  therefore  mean that they are operating  illegally  in

Singapore?   And if they are operating illegally  in  Singapore,

what  action  will the Government be taking in  respect  of  the

illegal operations?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thought I have answered that question.

In  my  speech,  I  have already said that if they  were  to  do

certain  things,  it  would  not  be  authorised  and  would  be

improper.   But  in answer to one other question,  I  said  that

because  we  have  agreed to consider the legal  arguments,  and

given the period of three months, it is not a question of taking

action  against  their  presence  in  Tanjong  Pagar  but,  more

importantly, a question as to what exactly they are going to do.

Will  it  result  in  an  insistence on clearing  passengers  at

Woodlands for entry into Malaysia when they have not got out  of

Singapore?   In  other  words,  the  passengers  are  still   in

Singapore when they are said to have entered Malaysia.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I do not understand. The question

was, if they decide to do that, which is not legal, are we going

to stop them?  Are we going to arrest them for doing so?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the question of gazetting is to

insist  that train passengers must stop at Woodlands  Checkpoint

for  immigration  clearance, and if  they  do  not,  they  would

therefore be violating our law.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> That gazette notification has already

been made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Inderjit Singh's question, I think we should not jump

the  gun, pre-judge and pre-determine exactly all the series  of

measures.   Let  us  take things one step at a  time,  which  is

exactly what we have been doing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask, by way of

clarification,  because it is still not clear  to  me  from  the

Minister's  answer to my question.  He says the Attorney-General

says  KTM has a legal title.  What is the title?  Is it freehold

or leasehold?  May we know what the title is?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have all the

details  here.   There are several leases, and  it  is  quite  a

complicated issue.  If Mr Jeyaretnam is interested, I could give

a  more  detailed  answer subsequently on the exact  network  of

various  leases concerning different parts of the  land.   There

are many different leases concerning different parts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in view

of  the uncertainty and confusion over this matter, and the risk

that  Singaporeans  may be caught violating  Singapore  laws  or

Malaysian  laws,  could we advise Singaporeans to  avoid  taking

KTM?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> An important point that I have made today

is  that  we  would  not know what is happening  tomorrow.   And

because we do not know what is happening tomorrow, we cannot say

with  certainty  under  what  kind of  circumstances  would  any

Singaporean be violating the law tomorrow.  So I think  we  will

<br>2.40 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had informed this House on 19th November last year that

Government would be amending the law to make it easier  for  en-bloc sales to take place.  The current position is that a single

owner,  for  whatever reason, can oppose and  thwart  the  sale.

Government   has  received  many  appeals  and   feedback   from

frustrated  owners  whose  desires  to  sell  their   flats   or

condominiums  en-bloc have been so thwarted. As a result,  these

buildings  cannot  take  advantage of enhanced  plot  ratios  to

realise  their  full  development potential,  which  would  have

created  many more housing units in prime 999-year leasehold  or

freehold  areas for Singaporeans.  A secondary benefit  is  that

these  developments, especially the older ones, could have  been

rejuvenated through the en-bloc process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that the law would be amended to remove the need for

unanimous consent.  I highlighted the fact that such a  practice

would not be peculiar to Singapore, as it already exists in some

American  and Canadian states. I emphasised that in  land-scarce

Singapore, such an approach was even more imperative as it would

make  available more prime land for higher-intensity development

to  build  more  quality housing in Singapore.  In  fact,  since

then,  Hong  Kong  has also passed legislation  along  the  same

lines.   In  February this year, also in this House, I  outlined

the  main  features  of  the  new  scheme.   In  particular,   I

highlighted  the fact that safeguards would be put in  place  to

protect the interests of the minority owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the key features of the proposed new

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Government will not decide which developments are

ready or ripe for en-bloc redevelopment.  The owners will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>

decide that for themselves. There are too many factors at  play,

such  as the age and state of repairs of the development, market

conditions,  sentiments  of  the  owners  and  the  relationship

amongst them.  As announced previously, what the Bill will do is

peg the required majority consent to the development's age - the

majority  owners  must account for at least  90%  of  the  share

values  for  developments less than 10 years old,  and  80%  for

developments 10 years or more. This approach will facilitate the

redevelopment of older buildings.  It is also in line  with  the

approach  in  other countries - Nova Scotia, New  Brunswick  and

Ontario  in  Canada  (80%);   British  Columbia,  Canada  (75%);

Hawaii (80%) and Hong Kong (90%, but where the law also provides

that  the  Chief  Executive  in  Council  may  specify  a  lower

percentage  not  less  than  80% in certain  circumstances).   A

higher  percentage  is  not practical, a  lower  percentage  not

appropriate given the importance of the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current requirement of unanimous consent is untenable.

The case of  Kim Lin Mansions which was recently highlighted  in

the  press brings this out clearly.  Community living, which  is

the  heart  of living in a condominium, all but disappears  when

owners  have to drag out their disagreement in court,  incurring

huge  financial  outlays in the process.  There is  uncertainty;

there  is delay; there is acrimony.   Also, as more developments

age  and incur large upgrading and repair bills, opting for  en-bloc  sale  will increasingly become a viable option.   But  the

existing law which requires unanimous consent makes it extremely

difficult, if not impossible, to realise en-bloc sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the principle of majority rule is evident in other

areas  of  shared  social and corporate life.  Examples  abound.

They  include  decisions  relating to managing  and  maintaining

common  areas  in  condominiums  under  the  Land  Titles   Act;

privatisation  of  HUDC flats;  upgrading works  under  the  HDB

Upgrading  Programme;  voluntary liquidation  of  a  company  or

dissolution of a society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developments with 10 or fewer units will still require

unanimous consent. With

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>

the  small numbers, it is not possible to designate a clear  80%

or  90%  majority.   Even if we base it on an approximation,  it

would  not  be meaningful, as one owner's disagreement  in  such

small  units may constitute a large percentage.  For such  small

developments, the owners should be able to negotiate  and  agree

amongst themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there will be adequate safeguards to protect the

interests of minority owners. These safeguards are found in  the

procedures  as well as in the substantive powers of  the  Strata

Titles Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the procedures. The majority owners

will  first enter into a conditional sale and purchase agreement

to sell to a purchaser, subject to their obtaining an order from

the  Strata Titles Board.  Thereafter, they must give notice  of

the  proposed  en-bloc sale in the newspapers.  They  must  also

separately  serve  notice of the proposed en-bloc  sale  on  all

interested   parties,  including  the  owners,  mortgagees   and

chargees  of  the minority owners as well as on  the  management

corporation.  This notice must be accompanied by a copy  of  the

advertisement published in the newspapers, the conditional  sale

and  purchase  agreement, the valuation report and  the  buyer's

statutory declaration stating his relationship, if any,  to  the

owners.  The conditional sale and purchase agreement must  state

the  price  and  method of distributing the sale  proceeds.  The

majority  owners must then apply to the Strata Titles Board  for

an order of sale, enclosing the documents mentioned earlier. The

minority owners and their mortgagees or chargee would then  have

21 days to file their objections, if any, with the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These procedures will ensure that all relevant parties will

have  adequate  notice of the sale and its terms,  in  order  to

decide whether or not to lodge objections with the Strata Titles

Board.  I should add that no application needs to be made to the

Strata  Titles Board if all the owners agree to  the  sale.   In

other words, application to the Board is not a pre-requisite  to

all en-bloc sales but only when there is no unanimous consent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now elaborate on the role of the Board, in

particular,  how  it acts as a safeguard. The Board  will  first

satisfy  itself that the required consent has been obtained  and

that prescribed procedures have been complied with.  It will not

review   or   intervene  to  determine  the   terms   of   sale.

Essentially, its role is to determine that the proposed sale  is

bona  fide and an arm's length transaction so that the  proposed

sale can proceed.  It will do this by considering the minority's

objections,   the   interests  of  all  the  owners,   all   the

circumstances of the case and the scheme and intent of  the  en-bloc  provisions in the Bill.  The Board will look at the   sale

price,  method of distributing the sale proceeds to ensure  that

the  minority  owners  are treated no less favourably  than  the

majority,  and the relationship of the purchaser to the  owners,

to ensure that there is no collusion.  If the Board decides that

the  transaction  is bona fide and an arm's length  transaction,

the  sale will proceed.  Otherwise, the sale cannot proceed  and

the  majority owners would have to rework their proposal if they

still  wish  to sell en-bloc.   The Board will not  rewrite  the

agreement for the parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will consider, as I have said, all the objections

filed  by  the  minority owners, their mortgagees and  chargees.

Some minority owners may raise objections which are personal  in

nature or peculiar to their own circumstances, eg, he has bought

his  unit recently at a much higher price than that paid for  by

the other owners, or he has spent a large amount on renovations.

Others may raise objections based on sentimental reasons, eg, he

has  lived in the development for a long time and does not  wish

to move out.  The Board will mediate in these situations.  It is

expected  that  skilful mediation will overcome  many  of  these

objections.   If  mediation fails, the  sale  will  nevertheless

proceed  as  long as the transaction is bona fide and  at  arm's

length,  unless there are exceptional circumstances  to  warrant

the Board assuming a more pro-active role; for example, the sale

proceeds are lower than the purchase price he had paid  for  the

unit  or are insufficient to redeem the outstanding mortgage  or

charge on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>

unit.   This is based on the underlying assumption that none  of

the owners in an en-bloc sale should lose out financially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Board's decision will be final. An appeal can be

made to the High Court only on a point of law, or where there is

alleged  irregularity in the process.  Owners will be  precluded

from  applying  to  the court under section 78  of  the  Act  to

terminate a strata development if they are not granted an  order

from  the Board for an en-bloc sale or are unable to secure  the

required   majority  consent,  unless  there   are   exceptional

extenuating  circumstances such as the majority owners  refusing

to  pay for repairs to prevent a building from being unsafe.  In

other  words, section 78 will remain in the Act but is used  for

very specific circumstances.  There will therefore be finality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new scheme will apply to three types of strata

developments:  those registered under the Land  Titles  (Strata)

Amendment Act where the owners own their units and share in  the

common   property,  which  is  the  vast  majority;  those   not

registered  under the Land Titles (Strata) Act where the  owners

own  their  units  and a share in the land but  do  not  have  a

management  corporation framework under the Act; and  those  not

registered  under  the  Land  Titles  (Strata)  Act  where   the

developer still owns the land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal quickly with a few other ancillary

matters.  The first is strengthening of the Strata Titles Board.

The  Bill  provides  for a number of changes to  facilitate  the

expeditious  hearing of applications.  These include  increasing

the number of panel members from 20 to 24; appointing two Deputy

Presidents  instead  of one; empowering  the  Secretary  of  the

Board,  to  be  called the Registrar, to deal with interlocutory

applications  and empowering the Board to allow  any  person  to

represent an applicant before the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other noteworthy amendment, which is not related to en-bloc sales, is that the Board's jurisdiction will be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>

expanded  to  enable  it to have wider powers  relating  to  the

exercise  or  failure to exercise a power,  authority,  duty  or

function imposed by the Act or by the by-laws.  For example,  it

will  be  empowered to hear and settle disputes arising  from  a

breach  or  failure  to perform any statutory  duty  or  by-laws

relating  to  a  strata  development.  Currently,  a  subsidiary

proprietor  or  Management Corporation must apply  to  court  to

enforce  the performance or restrain the breach.  On  the  other

hand, the Board will no longer hear cases on the liability of  a

developer.   Proceedings  against a developer  for  defects  are

based on contract, which is a matter for the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I should add that the new scheme will only

apply  to  strata  developments.  It will not  apply  to  landed

developments.   Strata developments, unlike landed developments,

are founded on the concept of community living, shared ownership

of   common   property  in  designated  values,  and  individual

ownership  of strata title which is essentially air space.   All

these distinguishing features of strata developments support the

new approach based on majority consent for en-bloc sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Bill has attracted considerable public

interest,  Government has decided, as suggested by several  MPs,

both in and outside the House, including the Chairman of the GPC

for  Law  and  Home  Affairs, to refer this  Bill  to  a  Select

Committee.   This  will also enable interested  members  of  the

public to share their views on the provisions of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the

Bill.  At  the  peak  of the property boom,  this  Bill  or  its

underlying  principles  would  have  been  welcomed   by   most.

Minority  subsidiary proprietors who choose not  to  sell  their

property in en-bloc sales would have been dismayed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is controversial. Some say that it is to aid

majority  subsidiary proprietors who stand to  make  substantial

gains when their apartments are sold en-bloc than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>

they  would otherwise not have.  It can also be said to  oppress

the  minority who refuses to sell for whatever reasons,  whether

it  is  to  demand exorbitant prices for their property  or  for

sentimental reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doing nothing will not be the responsible approach in

land  scarce  Singapore.   Whether it  is  the  tyranny  of  the

minority  or  the  oppression of the  minority  is  a  secondary

concern.   The  most  crucial consideration is  in  achieving  a

balance  between the two conflicting needs and  that  there  are

statutory  instruments  in  place to ensure  that  ultimately  a

proposal  for redevelopment fits into and blends well  with  the

long term development plans of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without legislation, the redevelopment of old and

inefficient land use developments is a costly process.  There is

presently  a case in our courts, and the Minister of  State  has

mentioned the Kim Lin Mansions case, on this very issue and  the

legal wrangling is causing owners on both sides of the divide  a

great  deal of money.  This is not taking into account the human

costs  of  uneasy neighbourhoods and of course sleepless  nights

for  some of the owners.  This Bill when passed will go  a  long

way to address this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whatever reason one wants to remain in a home, there is

a  need  to  ensure that the overriding interests of society  at

large must be met.  There must be a mechanism in place to ensure

that  our city-state does not contain pockets of slums and  that

sufficiently old buildings are safe and well maintained.  Having

said that, however, I am of the view that a 10-year old building

is still a new building and using 10 years as a yardstick may be

too  short  a  benchmark.   The stringent  requirements  of  the

Building  Control Department have resulted in much  money  being

invested to ensure that our buildings will withstand the test of

time and more.  It will indeed be a waste of money and resources

if  a  building that is less than 10 years old be allowed to  be

torn  down  and  redeveloped.   It may  also  create  uneasiness

amongst  potential  buyers who cannot be  sure  if  an  intended

purchase will be the target of an en-bloc sale.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I urge the Government to reconsider a

change in some of the details in the Bill.  Hence, as this  Bill

when  passed  will have a substantial impact on  a  majority  of

private  property  owners, I welcome the  Government's  move  to

commit this Bill to a Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;En-bloc sale and redevelopment is an excellent way to

rejuvenate  some  old  estates which are devoid  or  lacking  in

amenities  and facilities.  This complements what is being  done

in  the public sector.  With the Government spending billions of

dollars  in  main  and  interim upgrading programmes  in  public

housing  estates, private housing estates, especially the  older

ones, should be encouraged to do likewise through en-bloc sales.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  in  support of the Bill in principle, and appreciate  the

opportunity  to  express  a  number  of  concerns  that  I  have

regarding  its provisions for en-bloc sales, that  is,  the  new

sections 84A to F.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, property rights in law are traditionally distinguished

from other legal rights because they are of such importance  and

value to those who hold them.  The right to enjoy one's property

and to choose a time to dispose of it is regarded very much as a

basic right of ownership.  People pay higher premiums to acquire

interests  in  land  that allow them to enjoy  such  rights  and

eventually  to pass them down to their successors  in  title  in

perpetuity.  These rights should be overridden only in the  most

compelling circumstances, where the public interest requires it,

and  must  be seen to be manifestly beneficial to the public  in

general,  for example, building infrastructural facilities  such

as roads, MRT lines, stations and airports.  In Hong Kong, where

they  have  a  similar  law  -  the Land  (Compulsory  Sale  for

Redevelopment) Ordinance No. 30 of 1998 - the objective  was  to

redevelop  many of the old estates in Hong Kong through  private

means.   In Singapore, the need to do so may not be so  obvious,

as  many  estates  are fairly new and, in  any  case,  are  well

maintained, as regulated by law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public interest in the proposed law therefore is not so

evident.  It is altogether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>

different  when  what  is  at stake  is  a  purely  economic  or

pecuniary decision.  That is, when the decision to take away the

right  of  ownership, albeit with compensation, on pure economic

grounds alone - such as the redevelopment of an estate that  may

just  be  10  years  old  - to make way  for  a  more  lucrative

development.  It is essentially a private deal, between majority

owners and developers.  In such an instance, there is a need  to

ensure that all minority owners' interests are well protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People acquire property for different reasons - I am not

concerned for those who are acquiring property as an investment,

since  that  essentially  is a matter of economic  compensation,

which  fits  well with the idea of en-bloc sales.   For  someone

else  - let us say a retiree - who purchases a property to  stay

in,  and  who chooses a particular flat in a particular location

to be, for example, near her children or a medical facility, the

idea  of  compensation in pure monetary  terms  may  be  a  poor

substitute.  The costs of relocation, the giving up  of  a  home

that one has spent many happy years -  these are neither easy to

quantify nor easily compensated in monetary terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cynical among us may say that there is a price for

everything - and so there may be, but in reality, I do not  know

how these issues are likely to be dealt with in the Act, despite

the  Minister of State's assurance.  Or whether such issues  can

be  dealt with satisfactorily, no matter what the Act says.   As

it  stands,  the Act gives no guidance on how such  non-material

considerations are to be taken into account, if at all.   It  is

interesting  to  note  in  this  context  that  the  Hong   Kong

legislation referred to earlier mentions, for example,  the  age

or  state of repair of the existing development.  The Hong  Kong

Ordinance  also  requires subsidiary legislation specifying  the

grounds on which an order for sale may be made.  In my view,  it

is  necessary  to enact similar regulations, especially  if  the

decision  is left to the Strata Titles Board.  This is the  next

issue to which I shall now turn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stated that these matters may be brought before the

Strata  Titles  Board, and that the Board will  have  powers  to

mediate,  to  call  for valuation reports and finally,  to  make

orders.   Such orders are binding on minority owners who  object

to  the  sale.   These  are  orders  that  significantly  affect

property   rights.   I  wonder  whether  it  is  not  altogether

appropriate  to  have  an application made  to  the  High  Court

instead of the Tribunal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Land Titles Act, sections 77 and 78, actually

provides for application to the court in relation to a variation

of  strata  subdivision  scheme consequent  upon  damage  to  or

destruction  of a subdivided building, and to termination  of  a

strata subdivision scheme.  Surely, the powers of the court  can

be  extended to cover the matter of en-bloc sales.  This may  at

least  provide  some  comfort  to minority  owners  who  may  be

dispossessed by such an order.  The judiciary is used to matters

involving private parties; the judges are used to quantification

of  damages, including large amounts of damages.  They are  used

to taking into account non-economic considerations, such as pain

and  suffering.  The Strata Titles Board, talented though it may

be  in  property matters, is not used to this type of work.   In

any event, it is in my view imperative that if such a Board were

to decide on this matter, Parliament should ensure that there be

specified grounds on which an order of sale can be made, similar

to that provided in the Hong Kong legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other matters that I should like to draw

attention  to.   The  first, as has been mentioned  by  the  GPC

Chairman,  relates to the 10-year rule.  That is to  say,  if  a

development  is  more  than  10  years  old,  only  80%  of  the

subsidiary proprietors need to agree (or if it is less  than  10

years,  90%).   Sir,  in  the context of estate  development  in

Singapore,  where  estates are generally well  maintained,  this

seems  too early a period to speak of en-bloc sales.   Would  it

not  be a waste of economic resources to tear down a development

that  is  only  10  years  old  or less?   Especially,  if  some

subsidiary owners would like to continue to live in it.  Would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>

this  sort  of  rule adversely affect the maintenance  level  of

estates?   Is  there a commitment, for example, to  upgrade  the

lifts  if  it  were known that a developer has been  eyeing  the

estate with a view to redevelopment?  Again, it would seem  that

more specific regulations are needed to control such a situation

and a review of the 10-year rule should take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I refer to a technical problem, the issue of

notice and objections.  This relates to the safeguards that  the

Minister  of  State  has  just mentioned.   Under  the  proposed

section 84A(1), majority subsidiary proprietors who have secured

a  conditional agreement of sale may apply to the Board  for  an

order  of  sale  to  be  made  out.   Under  section  84A(4),  a

subsidiary proprietor who does not agree to the sale has to file

an  objection within 21 days of the date of notice served in the

normal  case.   The  failure to file an  objection  has  serious

consequences under subsection (6) - the Board is under a duty if

it  does not receive any objection to order a sale!  Nowhere  in

the  section  is  it  provided as to  who  is  to  inform  those

subsidiary  proprietors who have not entered into agreements  of

sale  about  the  application  to the  Board.   Subsection  (10)

provides  for notice by registered post but does not make  clear

who  has the obligation to inform the minority.  Would it be the

Board  or  the  applicants for the order of sale?  Such  matters

have yet to be clarified in the legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that in land scarce Singapore, optimal land

use  is  always a priority.  Yet, for the same reason,  property

interests are so much more important to those who have purchased

them,  especially on the open market.  There is a need therefore

for the Minister to reassure this House, and indeed, the people,

that  encroachment  into the proprietary interests  of  minority

owners  should  be  allowed  only  in  the  most  convincing  of

circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give my qualified support to this Bill and hope that

these issues would be taken up in the Select Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Bill was introduced to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>

facilitate the en-bloc sales of certain property.  I support the

underlying principle of the Bill because I believe that  en-bloc

sales,  if  made  easier,  would  prevent  old  properties  from

degenerating  into slums.  In the last few years  when  property

prices  were  higher  and  plot ratios  in  certain  areas  were

increased,  we  saw  many  condominiums  and  apartment   owners

attempting  to  sell their properties en-bloc.   Some  succeeded

while  others  failed.  Those that failed owed  it  to  the  few

owners  who  held  out for various reasons.   Some  have  noble,

sentimental  reasons, while others just wanted more  money  than

their neighbours.  Those that failed to sell en-bloc have missed

the  boat  for  the time being and are in danger of degenerating

into  slums during the trough of the economic cycle as  many  of

these properties are fairly old.  In a case like this, one could

say  that  we  had  a  tyranny of the small  minority  over  the

majority.   I  sympathise  with  the  majority  of  the   owners

involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In debating this Bill, one cannot do so without going into

the  issue of individual rights over that of society.   Although

one  of  our core values is society above self, in this context,

we  must  look  at what this larger society is, that  self  must

sacrifice  too.   In  the case of private land  acquisition  for

public   roads,  highways,  drainage  or  MRT  lines,  one   can

understand the need for this as the larger society that benefits

would be people one can count in the realm of thousands, if  not

tens  of thousands or hundreds of thousands, who use the  public

facilities.   In  the case of en-bloc sales, the larger  society

that benefits is one's neighbours, maybe 10, maybe 100, who just

want  more  money for their units if sold en-bloc than  if  sold

individually.  The question therefore is: should the  individual

be  made to subsume his interest to that of the society so  that

the latter can make more money?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that money is not the only issue and that

the  main  reason  is  really  to prevent  the  condominiums  or

apartment  blocks  from degenerating into slums.   If  that  was

true, then one could argue that en-bloc sale is not the only way

to prevent this from happening.  One could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>

go  for  upgrading programmes and refurbishment as  in  the  HDB

major  upgrading  programmes.  In this case, under  the  current

law, only 75% of share values in the estate need to approve  for

such  upgrading  to  proceed.  Since  the  larger  society  that

benefits from self-sacrifice is not as noble in the case of  en-bloc  sales of private properties for redevelopment  as  in  the

case  of  acquisition for public projects,  I  contend  that  we

should maintain a balance of individual rights over that of  the

other  neighbours.  The question then is: what is  that  correct

balance?   I  suggest we should then go back to the  fundamental

reason for which this Bill was meant to achieve and, that is, to

prevent the degeneration of old private properties into slums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes that, in the case of properties less

than 10 years old, 90% of the share values would suffice for  an

application to be made to the Board for an order for sale of all

the  lots  in  common  property to  proceed.   In  the  case  of

properties above 10 years old, 80% of the share values  agreeing

would  suffice.  My question is:  are properties  less  than  10

years  old  in danger of degenerating into slums?   To  me,  the

answer  is  obviously  no.  In my view, the  age  of  properties

should  be the key deciding factor here which determines whether

the  individual's  right to hold out should be ridden  roughshod

over.   For  older  properties, the danger of degeneration  into

slums  becomes more real.  In this case, we should give  greater

weightage to the needs of the majority of the other owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that some judgement and subjectivity is involved.

However,  in  my  own  view and judgement, I  propose  that  for

properties  less than 10 years old, 100% of share values  should

still   be  maintained  for  en-bloc  sales  to  proceed.    For

properties  between  10 and 20 years old, 90%  of  share  values

could  suffice, and for properties above 20 years old, then  80%

of share values could suffice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, tearing down of fairly new buildings is a

waste  of  national resources and should not be  encouraged.   I

believe

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>

my  suggestion is more equitable and maintains a better  balance

between  individual rights and the good of the  larger  society.

And  with  this, at least the individual has the peace  of  mind

that  in the first 10 years of the life of his new property,  he

would  not wake up one morning to be rudely told that he has  to

move out, because his neighbours have decided to cash out in  an

en-bloc sale.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as everybody is

aware, the emergence of en-bloc sales in Singapore is mainly due

to  the present Development Guide Plan (GDP), where the usage of

land  is  capable  of  being  intensified  from  that  which  is

currently  being  used.  This Land Titles  (Strata)  (Amendment)

Bill  is meant to facilitate the redevelopment of land for  more

intensified  use,  and I think it covers most  of  the  possible

situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in my opinion, there are two situations which have

been  missed  out and should be considered.  Situation  1.   The

Bill  deals with a case where the subsidiary proprietors of  the

lots  holding not less than 80% or 90% of the share values  wish

to  sell to the purchaser.  But it does not, however, appear  to

deal  with  a situation where one subsidiary proprietor  of  the

lots  already owns 80% or 90% of the share values and wishes  to

purchase  the  remaining  10% or 20%.  If  the  said  subsidiary

proprietor wishes to sell to the purchaser, it would be possible

under  the  Bill to apply to the Board for an order.  There  is,

however,  no  provision to allow this subsidiary  proprietor  to

apply to the Board for an order to purchase the remaining 10% or

20%.   I  feel that the Board, in the spirit of the Bill, should

assist such a subsidiary proprietor.  Of course, some safeguards

must  be  built  in  for  such  a situation,  for  example,  the

appointment  of  two independent valuers or the said  subsidiary

proprietor  must acquire the remaining 10% or 20% only  for  the

purpose  of  redevelopment.  If this situation was not  covered,

the said subsidiary proprietor who meets with objection from the

remaining subsidiary proprietors of the building would then  not

be able to redevelop the land to its fullest potential.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>

This  situation is similar to an en-bloc sale which has resulted

in this Amendment Bill in the first place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only recourse for such a subsidiary proprietor would be

to  sell to a purchaser.   Of course, one can argue that he  can

always  set up a company to be the purchaser, but the  procedure

would  attract more stamp duties, more legal cost, etc.   And  I

feel that the spirit of this Bill should be to facilitate the en-bloc sale and not to collect more revenue for the Government  if

the situation does not require it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situation 2, and this is a more complicated one.

Currently, there are some land developments on sizable plots  of

land in Singapore where the DGP allows for more intensified  use

than  its  current use.  But the intensification is not  to  the

extent that it warrants the demolition of the existing buildings

on  the land, particularly if they are still quite new.  And  in

some cases, due to the layout of the existing development, there

is  no  need to demolish any building and an additional building

can  actually  be erected on the site.  But it  means  that  the

consent of 100% of the subsidiary proprietors of the lots in the

development  have  to  be obtained, and  some  objections  would

definitely be raised.  I would like to ask the Minister  whether

in  such a situation the same approach as taken by the Bill  for

en-bloc  sale can be adopted, ie, if the subsidiary  proprietors

of  the lots in the development holding not less than 80% of the

share  value consent to such a proposal, an application  can  be

made to the Board for an order to allow the proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so far I have spoken about the benefit of

the  majority  of the subsidiary proprietors of the  lots.   The

interests of the minority, of course, cannot be ignored.  I came

to understand that some subsidiary proprietors object to en-bloc

sale  because of their desire to send their children to a school

within 1-2 km or their need to look after their elderly or  sick

parents  nearby  or they have just recently completed  extensive

renovations to their premises.  I see a need for the  Board,  as

defined  in  the  Bill,  to  be  empowered  to  consider   these

intangible

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>

factors in their mediation or arbitration between the  disputing

parties  and  possibly make adjustment to the  share  values  to

achieve an equitable distribution of the values.  It will not be

wise to pass this Bill to facilitate the development of land and

ignore  its  possible detrimental effects on the  other  ongoing

good  policies which are meant to encourage stronger family ties

and  equitable treatment of our people.  As pointed out by Prof.

Chin,  the  Bill is not clear on this.  I would  call  for  more

details on these issues to be addressed in the Select Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in principle, I support the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>LAND TITLES (STRATA) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has successfully managed to remain a vibrant and

efficient  city-state because of our ability to  rejuvenate  and

redevelop  our infrastructure.  In this regard, the primary  aim

of this Bill, to allow changes in its Development Guide Plans to

be  translated into better utilisation of scarce land  resources

and infrastructure can be supported.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Land Acquisition Act that would allow the

Government to acquire land and properties if it is in the public

interest to do so.  Therefore, if it is in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>

public good to acquire residential properties even though it may

be  a building of, say, less than 10 years old, then it must  be

done.   After all, the law provides for compensation  at  market

prices.   I  would  go  as far as to say  that  we  should  also

consider invoking the Land Acquisition Act if property owners or

management   corporations  fail  to  maintain  their  buildings.

Therefore,  the  provisions  to  allow  management  corporations

greater powers to compel owners to maintain their properties are

appropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is another thing to say that neighbours and

other  property owners can now decide or influence whether  they

can  now remain in their house, especially when en-bloc sale  is

justified  purely  on  monetary gains  and  considerations,  not

necessarily for general public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the frustration some property owners feel

when  they  cannot  sell their property en-bloc  because,  under

present law, even a single owner can frustrate an en-bloc  sale.

However,  I cannot accept or understand the extreme some  owners

have  gone to force and intimidate other minority owners to sell

their  properties  en-bloc.   The  opportunity  for  quick   and

substantial capital gains has blinded many of these owners  into

thinking  that  everyone like themselves should decide  to  sell

their houses simply on monetary considerations.  Many give scant

attention  to  other  genuine reasons why some  property  owners

prefer  not to sell their homes despite the potential  for  huge

windfall.   The elderly may not want to move out or be  burdened

by  new  financial obligations.  The unique thing about property

is  that there is only one of its kind.  Another house is  never

exactly  the  same.   There  are  also  genuine  concerns  about

location, for example, nearness and proximity to family members,

school  amenities  and  the  comfort and  familiarity  with  the

general  neighbourhood.  Even on purely monetary considerations,

as different purchasers may have paid different prices for their

property,  the monetary gains to different owners  are  not  the

same. Therefore, owners do not necessarily have the same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>

incentives  and  motivation to sell, especially in  the  current

property market.  What if the minority owners have to sell at  a

loss?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that I think the Strata Titles Board

should be strengthened not only in numbers, as stated in section

87,  but  also in terms of its representation so that the  Board

can  effectively  perform its function  of  protecting  minority

interest.   I  would  urge the Minister to provide  for  clearer

guidelines to assist the Strata Titles Board so that the genuine

interests  of the minority are not sacrificed purely because  of

the  monetary interest of the majority.  It must be on the  onus

of  the  majority  to ensure that every possible  way  has  been

explored  to  protect the minority interest through preferential

purchase  of new apartments on redevelopment sites.   It  should

also  be the responsibility of the Strata Titles Board to ensure

that non-monetary issues and the interest of the minority owners

are  given  sufficient weightage before the Strata Titles  Board

can make an order under section 84A(6) or (7).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, property ownership has a proprietary value which

is   permanent  and  cannot  be  removed  except   for   special

circumstances, for example, by Government Land Acquisition.   As

such,  the idea of Singapore as our home can be promoted because

there  is a sense of permanence to one's neighbourhood and home.

It  may  be bricks and mortars that make a house, but a home  is

about shared experiences, fond memories and emotional attachment

that  can never be equated in monetary terms. These are  matters

that  deserve  very  careful consideration.  Given  the  current

property  market, there is a lesser need for  quick  action.   I

therefore  welcome the Minister's decision to refer this  matter

to  a  Select Committee so that views from a wider cross section

of  the  people can be obtained.  This issue has attracted  much

public   debate.   Clearly,  a  consensus  on  this  matter   is

preferred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that there should exist in Singapore the

recognition that in our homes or friends and our neighbours, our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>

emotional attachment to our neighbourhood are matters which  are

far more important than the windfall gains one can make from  an

en-bloc sale.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

declare my interest as the owner of a strata title lot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. In land-scarce

Singapore,  we have no choice but to maximise land  use  through

proper  land  use planning.  The recent revision and development

of  the  Concept  and  Development Guide Plans  by  URA  clearly

indicates the need to update land use plans in Singapore.   This

is necessary so that we can keep up with changing population and

economic trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill indeed will facilitate better utilisation of land

through en-bloc sales of certain property.  At the same time, it

will   enable   the  Strata  Titles  Boards  to  function   more

effectively  and efficiently for the benefit of  all  subsidiary

proprietors and flat owners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise the following points on the

principles and implications of this Bill.

<br><br><i>Collective sale of property</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 inserts a new Part VA (containing new sections 84A

to  84F) to facilitate en-bloc sales of land within a subdivided

building.  But it only applies to owners of flats or units in  a

strata  or subdivided building or development with more than  10

units  or  flats.   The  clause seems  to  discriminate  against

developments  of 10 units and less.  I hope the  Ministry  could

clarify the need for this requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to be consistent in encouraging en-bloc sales, we

should  remove this requirement and allow all developments  that

are  eligible  for  en-bloc  sale to  make  an  application  for

collective sale.

<br><br><i>Time period requirement for en-bloc sale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill permits owners of 80% share value in a

development  to apply for collective sale if the lots  are  more

than 10 years while a 90% share value is required

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>

for  lots which are less than 10 years.  In principle,  I  agree

that the 80% and 90% share value requirement will facilitate en-bloc developments.  However, the 10-year time period requirement

may result in wastage of resources.  This is particularly so for

developments which are less than 10 years old.  Technically, the

life  span  of  a  building is about 60  years  before  physical

obsolescence  takes  place.  But in  a  fast-pace  society  like

Singapore,  buildings  tend to have shorter  life  span  due  to

economic obsolescence and changing social trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, it is wasteful to facilitate en-bloc sale and

development  of buildings that are less than 10 years  old.   In

fact,  with  the  introduction of  new  building  materials  and

technology,  buildings are built to last much longer.   Thus,  I

hope  the  Ministry will reconsider the time period  requirement

for en-bloc sale application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it would be prudent to specify that

applications for en-bloc sales for developments below  10  years

should  obtain approval from the Minister.  This would curb  any

speculative  developments which may have other repercussions  or

economic implications.

<br><br><i>Distribution of sale proceeds</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the stumbling blocks in en-bloc sale is the

obtaining  of consensus among subsidiary proprietors  or  owners

with regard to the sharing of the sale proceeds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidiary proprietors or flat owners often have differing

opinions  as to the methods of sharing the proceeds.   This  has

indeed  hampered a number of potential en-bloc sales.  The  Bill

has not addressed this problem.  To facilitate en-bloc sale, the

Bill should state clearly the method or formula for sharing  the

sale  proceeds.  Based on past en-bloc sales, the use  of  share

value  has  been  commonly adopted as  an  acceptable  means  to

distribute the sale proceeds.

<br><br><i>Jurisdiction of Strata Titles Boards</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 has removed the jurisdiction of the Strata Titles

Boards to adjudicate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>

disputes  between  management corporations and  developers.   In

practice, management corporations often encounter problems  when

taking  over  new developments from developers.  These  problems

may  range  from  simple  disputes concerning  handing  over  of

relevant  documentation to major disputes  such  as  repairs  of

major   building  defects.   Very  often,  these  disputes   are

technical  in nature and could be either mediated or adjudicated

by  the  Strata Titles Boards.  However, with the new amendment,

all   these  disputes  would  have  to  go  to  the  courts  for

settlement.   As  such, it may create an influx of  cases,  thus

hampering the efficiency of our courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we should expand the jurisdiction of the Strata

Titles   Boards   to  adjudicate  disputes  between   management

corporations which have become common in recent years.

<br><br><i>Composition of Strata Titles Boards</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 increases the number of persons on a panel from

which the Strata Titles Boards may be formed to 24. The increase

of  panel  members from 20 to 24 is probably attributed  to  the

increase  in  the number of strata title developments,  and  the

amendment  in  section 86 which allows parties to a  dispute  to

have a say in the choice of members forming a board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the real estate and construction industry is small, it

may be better to increase the panel members so that the Minister

would  have  more  leeway to appoint one or more  Strata  Titles

Boards to expedite dispute settlement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would suggest that in line with the principle of

appointing  management corporation council  members,  we  should

allow the Minister to appoint a panel of members but subject  it

to  a  maximum of 30 members.  In this way, the number of  panel

members may vary from time to time depending on the availability

of expertise and the number of disputes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Sir, for giving me

this opportunity.

Sir,  I rise to support the Bill and I congratulate the Minister

for  agreeing to send the Bill to a Select Committee.  This  has

been proposed by Members as well as the public, because it is  a

very important question that we are going to deal with, ie,  the

question of property rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, first of all, declare my interest. I am a

practising  lawyer and I am also a member of the  Strata  Titles

Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has limited land supply and it is of utmost

importance  that we utilise this to the maximum benefit  of  the

community.   This  is why the success of Singapore  has  largely

been  attributed  to  the  very  equitable  way  in  which  land

acquisition has worked.  In this particular case, no acquisition

is  being made.  All this Bill hopes to do is to facilitate  en-bloc sales.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one question that has bothered me and

other  Members is this 10-year period.  It is not adequate.   We

should  at  least allow a minimum of 15 years.  I am happy  with

the requirement of a percentage of at least 80%, because I think

that  is  also the practice in other jurisdictions.  Prof.  Chin

also  spoke  about  the Strata Titles Board.   Sir,  the  Strata

Titles  Board is made up of the President, Deputy President  and

two  other members.  In fact, it is better than what you get  in

the  High  Court because in the High Court only a  single  judge

hears  the  matter.   It would also be more expensive  and  time

consuming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other advantage which Members may want to know is that

the Board always tries to mediate.  In fact, I have been sitting

on the Board for more than a year now.  The matters which I have

dealt with have always been settled without going through a full

hearing.  So I would like to tell the Members of this House that

the  Strata Titles Board may be a more appropriate panel because

it  is  made  up  of  people who are not just lawyers  but  also

engineers and architects who appreciate the dispute better.   So

I  hope  Prof.  Chin  would change his  view  after  hearing  my

arguments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been some complaints from members of the

public,  both in the news media as well as some people who  have

approached me.  I know of a case of a retired librarian  in  the

University of Singapore who lives in Holland Road.  Her worry is

that  if her property is put up for en-bloc sale, she would miss

the  company  of relatives who are nearby and other  facilities.

But  I  tell  people who have this problem that  it  is  in  the

interest  of the community at large and especially, in  view  of

the MRT development, that we should allow maximum utilisation of

our  land.   We  have  got  limited land  supply  and  community

interest must take precedence over that of the individual right.

As  I  said earlier, one of the advantages that we have is  that

because we did not enshrine in the Constitution the right to own

property, as some other countries did, we have this development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to another area which I am a little concerned.

Prof.  Chin  has  also  mentioned this.   This  is  new  section

84A(10).  The notice to be given requires only two days' notice.

I  do  not  think that is sufficient.  If you post a  notice  on

Saturday,  the next day is Sunday.  I think we should  at  least

have a minimum of five days' notice.  Another Member also raised

the  question of who is to give notice.  I think that  could  be

easily addressed.  The Registry of the Strata Titles Board would

give the notice where members have not been served.  It could be

a condition that before an application is heard, all the parties

have been served properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area that I am concerned is this. If we do

not change the law and allow, as I have said earlier, the period

of  10  years to stand, then a lot of properties that have  been

developed recently and are in good condition would be torn  down

and rebuilt, which would be an economic loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which I think we should also consider is that

probably the owners of terrace houses in older estates may  wish

to  have them developed if the plot ratio is increased from  two

storeys to three storeys.  Because some of these estates are  in

fact in worse condition than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>

some  of  the  HDB  estates which are better managed.   This  is

something which the Minister may want to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the office of Registrar is being created and I am

grateful  to the Minister for this because, with this amendment,

many applications could be dealt with by the Registrar.  So  the

full  Board  does  not  have to sit.   All  we  require  is  the

Registrar  to deal with applications which are not controversial

in  nature  and  it  would be helpful when the  law  comes  into

existence  to  appoint a Senior Legal Officer as the  Registrar.

At  the  moment, the person holding office is actually qualified

for District Judge.  I hope the practice will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, I would like to assure Members once

again,  my experience over the years is that both parties always

want  to  discuss  the  matter and,  in  fact,  in  most  cases,

mediation succeeds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> I am much obliged, Mr

Speaker.   I  rise to welcome the reference by the  Minister  of

State of this Bill to a Select Committee, which some of us  have

asked.   I think we need to carefully consider the Bill  because

we  are  changing  existing rules and private  rights.   We  are

changing  the ball game.  And I want to share some comments  and

thoughts  with  the Minister, hoping that this will  go  to  the

Select  Committee, based on four topics: first, the question  of

public  interest;  second, the difference  and  balance  between

private  property  and what the Minister  of  State  has  called

"communal living"; third, the safeguards; and fourth, the use of

the Strata Titles Board as opposed to court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on public interest. As many Members have

said,  land  is  a scarce resource and Singaporeans  accept  the

principle  of  land  acquisition  for  public  interest  by  the

Government.   Some,  however, will feel  that  these  amendments

differ on the public interest but instead serve windfall private

profit.  I also agree, as many have pointed out, that there is a

public  interest to protect Singapore's landscape against slums.

However, I urge us just to consider that this concern can be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>

met  much more simply.  Government authorities may issue  orders

to  management  councils of such slummy  buildings  to  maintain

properly or to face court proceedings.  And if they persistently

refuse  or fail to do so, then condemnation orders can be served

or the management corporation may be dissolved.  So I do not see

this  strongly as a matter of public interest.   It  is  more  a

question  of  that  majority in the building of  private  owners

against a minority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly true that under the present law, many may

be  frustrated.   Some  have called  this  the  tyranny  of  the

minority.  I believe the Minister of State used this term in  an

earlier parliamentary sitting when he introduced the outline  of

the  present Bill.  But others did not see this as a tyranny but

rather as a minority simply protecting their rights.  They point

out that the majority is not stopped from selling their units if

they  choose  to  do so.  What they cannot  do  is  to  get  the

windfall  premium by selling en-bloc.  No one is  trapped  in  a

building but they are stopped from selling somebody else's house

under  them.   And I think in this sense, this is a  debate  not

simply  about  efficiency in land use,  about  abstract  rights.

This  is  a debate about the idea of Singapore as our home.   We

have  encouraged home ownership.  We wish that Singaporeans feel

that the nation is their home, their permanent home which no one

can  take  from  them.   Of  course,  this  is  best  served  by

allegiance to the nation as a whole.  At our National Day, I  am

sure many people will feel that allegiance.  But on normal days,

in  our  dreams, in our thoughts, in our hearts, that  sense  of

rootedness  of  home  belongs  to  one's  specific  home,  one's

specific  neighbourhood.  And in many ways I think that  is  why

private property in Singapore has demanded a premium not  merely

for the facilities or the quality - the HDB quality is going  up

all  the  time - it is for that idea that this home is a private

property belonging to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I do not agree that condominiums are about

communal living.  The way I look at it is what is common is very

small.  If we ask ourselves: can somebody

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>

by  vote  at  the management committee invite them to  my  front

door,  I think the answer is no.  If the answer to an invitation

to  the  front door is no, then how can it be that the  majority

can also sell out not just my front door but my whole house from

under me?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to distinguish between this idea of public

interest  and the majority in a private building and,  secondly,

the  idea  of  communal  living  against  the  idea  of  private

property.  As I said also, there is an emotional attachment to a

home  and this is very difficult to translate purely to monetary

terms.  As such, I share the concern many Members have expressed

that  the  conditions  of  a  bona fide  sale  at  arm's  length

transaction  are  simply not enough.  The  attachment  which  an

older  member may feel for his or her home of 20 years would  be

considered   irrelevant   in   this   equation.    This   is   a

monetarisation of emotional attachment and that idea is contrary

to the idea of Singapore as home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many personal reasons for preferring not to sell.

It  includes circumstances like the owner, such as an elderly or

ill person, who may not be able to stomach the idea of having to

pack  everything  and  move.  There is a convenience  factor  of

being  near  to other family members or the school or amenities,

or  to  simply  a  neighbourhood with which  you  are  familiar.

Additionally,   there  are  hard  economic  reasons   for   some

preferring  not to sell.  The purchase price paid  by  different

owners at different times may vary considerably.  For example, a

condominium unit that fetched, say, a quarter million dollars in

1986  or  1987  may cost by 1990 some $400,000, and  then  1994,

perhaps at the height or later, to fetch $1 million for the same

unit,  more or less.  As such, if an en-bloc sale results  in  a

price  of  $1.1 million, say, to all the buyers, the  profit  of

different  owners would differ considerably.  And so  they  have

different incentives to sell.  This is a rational decision,  not

an  emotional one.  This is a hard dollar and cent reason for us

to  help  people hang on to their properties and not  have  them

pried out from their hands.  And, of course, I do not think this

House needs to remember that in the present

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>

market where prices are lower than the peak, it could result  in

a loss.  I am gratified that the Minister of State now says that

we  guarantee that deals do not go through if they result  in  a

loss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my third point that more safeguards are

needed.  I share Prof. Chin's concerns that it is the court  who

is much more appropriate to fathom the mixture of personal loss,

economic  loss, rather than the Strata Titles Board.  And  I  do

not  echo  the sentiments expressed by my fellow NMP Mr  Rai.  I

also  share  the concern that if we are to consider any  factors

put  forward by anyone, this is not in the Bill as  drafted.   I

think  we  have  to  consider this particularly  because,  as  I

understand  them, en-bloc proposals may differ considerably  not

just  in  terms  of price but also in additional terms  such  as

preferential treatment for new apartment once it is built, rent-free  periods - all these differ from deal to deal -  and  there

must  be room for the Board or the court to fully consider these

reasons  as well as the price.  I also noted the Bill,  and  the

Minister of State has emphasised mediation.  But I suggest  that

this  mediation  is  not sufficient because  if  it  fails,  the

majority can still rely on the price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern about the timeframes regarding the 10-year properties and the voting percentages outlined earlier by

the  Minister of State.  I wish to finally close on just  a  few

broader points or suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that when this Bill goes to a Select

Committee, I ponder who would speak for the minority owners.   I

think  the  developers are well taken care of.   They  are  well

organised and can speak with an equal and loud voice.  There has

been  some  anecdotal evidence about Kim Lin Mansions  or  other

isolated  cases.  The Minister has not shared with us  how  much

feedback, how many complaints.  And I would ask that the  Select

Committee go beyond just being open to views but rather seek  to

survey, study and genuinely solicit views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second wider suggestion I have is that the Bill be

better served and the minority interest better protected if the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>

majority  who wish to sell be placed in a fiduciary relationship

to  the minority whereby undertaking the sale, they will take on

duties  to  safeguard the interest of the minority  as  best  as

possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and a more general point I wish the Minister of

State  to put before the Select Committee is that, might it  not

be better not to exchange existing private rights, but rather to

change  them prospectively for land and developments  that  will

now  arise.   This  of  course has the  disadvantage  of  making

different  types of land and making choices more  complex.   But

this  has  the  advantage  of making sure  the  people  who  are

presently  situated in one system of rights  do  not  find  that

system changed to their adversity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I voice my unhappiness

about  the Bill.  A number of other speakers, particularly Prof.

Chin  and  the speaker following him and now Mr Simon Tay,  have

voiced  their concerns which I was going to voice, and so  I  do

not  propose to repeat them.  Suffice to say that I  think  they

are  well-founded  and  these views  must  be  given  sufficient

consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us not make any pretence. This is not

a  case  of a minority or even a single man holding out  against

the  society.  It is not a question of society's interests  that

will be adversely affected if we give way to the man's wish  and

freedom to do what he wishes.  This Bill simply panders  to  the

greed of the developers and the other co-lessees who see, as has

been  said, a way to get rich quickly.  That would appear to  be

the  only  reason  for this Bill.  There is no question  of  any

national  interests coming into this.  There  is,  as  has  been

pointed  out,  the Land Acquisition Act and even there,  let  me

say,  it  is  felt by many that that Act itself is being  abused

from its primary, original purpose which was that it should only

be  used  for national interests; it is used for lots  of  other

reasons now.  So let us not pretend that a minority, even if  it

be a single man, is holding society to ransom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adds another instance to the list that is already

growing in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>

where  the  citizen is coerced.  He is coerced to  do  something

against  his will, against his freedom to do what he  wishes  to

do.   Is  that the kind of society we want in Singapore where  a

citizen is coerced at every turn and corner?  Or is it a society

where  the citizen feels that he is free to make his own  choice

provided of course it does not harm the society at large?  I  am

sure the answer to that must be quite plain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to raise, and that has been

raised by Prof. Chin, is why cannot we allow or ask the majority

of the owners to take their application to court.  What is wrong

with  the  courts  hearing it?  Then at least we  have  an  open

public  hearing.  We will have representations on behalf of  the

minority and we will hear representations from the majority.  In

a  hearing  before the Strata Titles Board, we do not  get  this

openness  and we may not even get a reasoned decision  from  the

Board  when they do come to make a decision.  But the courts  do

have  to give their decision.  So is it not more preferable that

this  matter should be left to the courts?  After all, they  are

vested  with  the judicial power in this country and  we  should

allow  them  to function in the role that they are  intended  to

function and not keep taking away from the courts their function

and  giving  it to statutory boards and civil servants  and  the

like.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My objection to this Bill is on principle. I think it is

wrong  to force one man to give up his property.  I do not  want

to  go  into  the reasons why he may be against the sale.   Some

reasons  have  been  advanced but whatever  it  is,  it  is  the

principle.  Do we rob a man or woman, as the case may be, of his

or  her  freedom  to do what he or she wishes  to  do  with  the

property?  Why is that necessary in Singapore?  As I said, in  a

number of things, citizens are now being coerced.  I think there

should be a limit to this coercion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to join

in this debate.  I am surprised, Sir, that the Government should

succumb  to  the  greed of property owners  and  take  away  the

principle of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>

unanimity  in  regard to en-bloc sales.  In 1987,  at  the  last

major  amendment to the Land Titles (Strata) Act, the Government

held  firm to the principle of unanimity as regards the sale  of

the  whole  development comprised in a Strata Title  plan.   Why

should the Government now make a complete about turn and go back

on its own belief?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the principle of unanimity is correct and

the  Government  should hold on to it.  The principle  has  been

upheld  by  the Government up till now because it believes  that

the  minority interests must be protected.  There will  normally

be  a few people who live in a large block of private flats  who

do  not want to be moved out.  These people are not spoilers  or

people  who  want to hold the other flat owners  to  ransom  and

demand  high prices for their own units.  They just do not  want

to move out whatever the going price is paid to them.  I know of

such  instances in a private development where an  en-bloc  sale

was  proposed.  Each flat owner was offered about $1 1/2 million

as  compensation.  Those flats were first purchased in 1969  for

only  about $27,000 each.  So the price of $1 1/2 million was  a

windfall.  It was like touching a lottery.  But there  were  two

ladies  who refused to sell their units.  Those two flat  owners

did  not ask for more money.  The compensation paid to them  was

not  an  issue.   They just do not want to  move  out  and  live

somewhere else.  Many people of course will call them stupid  or

unable  to  comprehend  them for refusing  such  large  sums  of

compensation  money.   But if we value  freedom  and  value  the

principle  that  one has a right to live where one  chooses  for

whatever reasons, then I believe we can start to understand  the

refusal  of  those  two  ladies to budge from  their  places  of

residence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, one is only forced to move out of one's home in

times  of  war,  or  in  times  of  natural  disaster  like   an

earthquake, or where there is a widespread contagious disease in

the   community,  or  one's  property  is  required  for  public

development.  Other than those instances, I do not think that in

a  civilised  society, one should be forced to be  evicted  from

one's own private property against one's own

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>

will.   The governments of other countries may want to do it  to

their  own  citizens.  But I do not think that we should  follow

them.   If a property owner wants to make money out of  his  own

property, he is entirely free to do so.  But I do not think that

he  has  a  right to drag other residents into his  money-making

scheme if the other residents do not want to have a hand in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a society must have some ideals, some principles to

hang  on to.  If a society has no principles, no ideals at  all,

that  society, for the short term, may prosper but in  the  long

run, it shall surely collapse.  I cannot accept the belief of  a

well-known businessman in Singapore when he said that everything

is up for sale except his own wife.  I am certain we do treasure

certain  things  which  cannot be sold  whatever  is  the  price

offered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expediency as a philosophy is not a good philosophy for our

nation.  The American nation, despite its commitment to business

and  seeming  expedient ways, has endured for  over  200  years,

because  it still holds on to certain sacred beliefs and  ideals

as enshrined in its constitution.  As for Singapore, it must not

throw  all ideals and principles to the wind.  For me, I believe

in the sacrosanctity of my home.  I should be allowed to stay in

it  as  long as I like.  I therefore cannot support a law  which

will  allow  others to force me out of my home all because  they

want is to make more money out of it.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me thank the

many speakers who have spoken.  Since the Bill will be going  to

a   Select  Committee,  I  will  not  address  all  the  points,

especially  the  technical ones which can be considered  at  the

Select  Committee.  However, Sir, I should take this opportunity

to  outline  the  reasons  why the  Government  has  taken  this

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by many Members, the underlying objective of the

Bill  is  recognising land is scarce in Singapore and  the  fact

that  the  plot ratios of many developments have been  enhanced,

there  is  a need to facilitate the realisation of more  housing

units  for Singaporeans.  We are talking in many cases of  prime

areas, freehold, 999

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>

years.   From  the records that are available, some developments

have  yielded  two to three times more units for ourselves,  for

our  children.  So this is a step that we take which  will  have

long term impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as many Members have stated, yes, indeed we are

dealing with property rights that can be sensitive.  But I think

we  have  to  also understand that in land scarce Singapore,  we

should not flinch from taking measures that are necessary  which

will  benefit both Singapore and Singaporeans, which  indeed  we

did  in  the  1960s when we introduced land acquisition.   These

land  acquisition  policies  have facilitated  and  resulted  in

developments that have made Singapore one of the best cities  in

the world.  Of course, some Members may say that the example may

not be quite the same.  But I would argue that there is a public

interest element, not just in land acquisition but also  in  en-bloc  sale.   Let  us not forget that, unlike  land  acquisition

where  a  person's  property  is  acquired,  he  may  lose   out

financially, the distinguishing factor here is that  in  an  en-bloc   sale,  the  minority  owner  would  very  often   benefit

substantially financially.  That is the first point  I  want  to

make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which we should also bear in mind is that,

like I have said in my speech, the new scheme will not apply  to

landed properties, even though one of the Members had urged  for

it  to be applied to terrace houses.  I think the difference  is

fundamental  and this is one point that perhaps Singaporeans  do

not  fully grasp, the legal significance of buying a condominium

where  what  a person buys into is a strata lot.  He  buys  into

common  property.   He  is  designated share  values  in  common

property.    He  has no specific land lot.  He  has  got  strata

rights, essentially enjoyment of the air space where his unit is

located.   So  what the majority want to do, in  effect,  is  to

exercise their rights over the common property.  If there are 99

owners in a 100-owner development, assuming the share values are

equal  and equal area also, what the 99 owners say is, "We  want

to  exercise  our rights to sell this strata development"  where

every owner

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>

who  comes into this development, unlike buying landed property,

knows what he is going in for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, is besides just the legal

nature,  one  cannot understate the fact of communal  living  in

strata  development.   And this is another point, which is  that

Singaporeans  over  time will better understand  what  the  Land

Titles (Strata) Act is all about.  It is a complex Act with  130

sections.   Why?  Because living in a condominium  is  not  just

buying  your  own property and living away from everybody  else.

There  are legal duties; there are legal liabilities.  And  that

is  why  a  management corporation is formed in all developments

with  powers over many areas.  So this is the other point  which

we should note.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have talked about the 10-year rule. Our approach,

as I said in my speech, is not to dictate which developments are

ripe  for en-bloc sale.  We leave it essentially to the  owners.

So  there is minimum intervention, unlike Mr Simon Tay  who  had

asked  why we do not stipulate terms and conditions in the  sale

and purchase agreement.  We take a non-interventionist approach.

I  think  the starting point is that we leave it to the majority

owners.   If  80%-90%,  all  like minded,  all  with  their  own

faculties  to decide what is best, say that this is the  way  to

go,  provided,  of course, the transaction is at  arm's  length,

there is no collusion, then the sale goes ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I just want to clarify that I did not

mean  that  I  was encouraging the Bill to allow stipulation  of

terms  and  conditions.  I was only pointing out that terms  and

conditions in different en-bloc offers do differ, which may then

have to be considered by the Board.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Thank you for the clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, going on this basic objective of creating more space

for Singaporeans, we have decided on the 10-year rule.  Going on

present records, it will not lead to national wastage.   One  or

two speakers had asked whether the 10-year rule, where

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>

the  buildings are relatively new, would lead to wastage at  the

national  level.  From the records, only about  20%  of  en-bloc

developments  have  been less than 10 years.   Nevertheless,  we

also  know  that  there  may be good reasons  why  owners  in  a

development which is less than 10 years would want to  sell  en-bloc.   It  could  be because the plot ratio has  been  enhanced

substantially.  It could be because the development is next to a

vacant  plot  of  land and there is reason to sell  it  so  that

development can be built on a larger piece of land.   Or  it  is

next  to another development which is perhaps also less than  10

years old, but it makes economic sense to sell it together.   As

the  approach  we take is to facilitate en-bloc  sale,  we  have

adopted the 10-year rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew says that this will mean that it goes against

another  objective which is to rejuvenate estates.   That  is  a

secondary objective. In time to come, when estates become older,

I think this will come to the forefront.  But at the moment, the

primary  objective is to help realise enhanced  plot  ratios  so

that many more homes can be created for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big area that we looked at was the role of the

Strata Titles Board.  I think, like I have said in my speech, it

is  an  important safeguard.  The Strata Titles  Board  will  be

enhanced.   There  will be more members.   And  as  Mr  Rai  has

rightly  pointed  out, based on personal experience,  the  Board

comprises  senior professionals in the various fields which  are

relevant  to what the Strata Titles Board will have to  do,  not

decide  on the law, but decide on whether the sale price is  one

where   there  is  no  collusion,  decide  on  the   method   of

distribution, whether it is unfair to the minority owners.   The

composition  of the panel will ensure that this task  is  better

done, rather than a judge sitting in court fettered by the rules

of evidence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, I think Mr Rai again brings it

out  poignantly  is the mediatory role of the Board, which again

a  court will be less suited to do.  In a more informal setting,

the Board takes a mediation role.  That is very critical.  As  I

have said in my speech and Mr Rai, based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>

on  his experience, has also backed up, in many cases, the Board

will  mediate.   In many cases, they will succeed in  mediation.

In many cases, people who may not want to sell, especially those

who  are  not  based on financial reasons, if there  is  skilful

mediation, if the parties, especially the majority parties,  are

encouraged  to give some latitude to the minority owners,  maybe

arrange,  if  a  person  wants to live  in  the  area,  for  the

developer  to give a right of first refusal, so that he  or  she

can  continue  staying in the area, relocation  or  whatever,  I

think many of these problems can be settled.  The Board will  be

much better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I want to say is that I would agree

that  we  should  not  typecast majority  and  minority  owners,

because there are minority owners who may not want to sell based

on  financial  reasons.  Yes, there will also be other  minority

owners  who, because of emotional or sentimental attachment,  do

not  want to move.  Therefore, I would agree that we should  not

fix  them with the term "tyranny of the minority".  When I  used

it   in  this  House  in  the  earlier  debate,  it  is  not  to

characterise  them  with a slur, but to describe  the  situation

where  one  person  saying no will prevent the transaction  from

going  through.   In  this sense, it is one  person's  objection

which  has prevented the realisation of the desires of the  vast

majority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the corollary to that is that we should not characterise

majority  owners, which has been done in this House  by  several

speakers,  that they are greedy, they are avaricious,  all  they

want  is  to  make  money.  I think it is not fair  on  majority

owners, if it is what they are waiting for.  But it does  happen

that  Government's  actions  result in  certain  people  getting

richer, getting a windfall.  So shall we begrudge that?  I would

say  no.   Shall  we facilitate it?  Well, if it  results  in  a

public  interest being met, which is the creation of more  homes

for Singaporeans, a lot of them in prime freehold areas, then  I

will   say  yes,  provided,  of  course,  there  are  sufficient

safeguards,  and  the interests of all parties  are  taken  into

account.   And this indeed is the approach we take in the  Bill,

if you look at the specific

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>

criteria in the Bill  taking into account all the objections  of

the  minority,  all  the circumstances  of  the  case,  all  the

interests of the parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, part of the basic approach is that we know

that  it  would  be  difficult to go away from  basic  objective

criteria.   That is why I said in my speech earlier on  in  this

House, that the primary function of the tribunal would be to see

whether  it  is  an  arm's  length transaction,  bona  fide,  no

collusion  and so forth.  But, at the same time,  there  may  be

exceptional circumstances.  I have mentioned one, which is  that

no party should lose out financially.  If you sell your property

at  a  loss  or you sell your property and you cannot redeem  it

with  the  bank,  then  it will be a ground  for  the  Board  to

intervene.  So let us take that approach and see how  the  Board

works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will go to a Select Committee. So I do not

think  I  need to go into the details.  I want to thank  Members

for   their  many  suggestions.   Some  of  them  are  technical

suggestions to improve the working of the Board, to improve  the

working  of  the  Bill, which can be considered  at  the  Select

Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, the Minister of State seems to base his

main ground on land scarcity in Singapore.  That would appear to

be  the  primary  reason.  Has the Government considered  taking

over  some  of the golf courses?  Do we not have too  many  golf

courses in this country?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this matter of golf courses

is  nothing  new.   Government has defended in  this  House  why

certain  lands  are  designated for golf  courses  because  they

cannot be used for built-up developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br>4.44 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 1998 seeks to give

legislative  effect to the income tax changes announced  in  the

February  1998 Budget Statement.  Opportunity is also  taken  to

incorporate four other amendments to the Income Tax Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes announced in the Budget

Statement.   There are a total of 11 tax changes  which  require

amendment  to the Act.  I have introduced a number  of  new  tax

incentives in the 1998 Budget and they are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a tax concession to promote the bond market;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a tax concession package to help Singapore develop as an

electronic commerce hub;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) tax exemption on income for approved insurance companies

deriving from writing offshore marine hull and liability

insurance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) tax exemption on income derived from uplift of freight

from Singapore;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) one-year accelerated depreciation allowance for

companies  which acquire approved equipment or technology  which

meet  certain  criteria relating to noise and chemical  exposure

levels and, finally,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) a further tax deduction to companies for approved

relocation  and recruitment expenses incurred in the  hiring  of

talent from abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 6, 11, 13, 17 and 20 amend the Act to provide

for these incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced the extension and liberalisation of

several  existing tax concessions.  Clauses 3 to 5, 7,  10,  12,

14, 16, and 21 amend the Act to provide for the following:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) extension of the tax holiday granted to the Singapore

International Monetary Exchange Limited (SIMEX) for another five

years;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) extension of the current 10-year limit for venture

capital  funds  to  enjoy tax exemption on the  gains  from  the

disposal of investments, for a further five years;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) extension and liberalisation of the Tax Exemption

Scheme   for   Syndicated  Offshore  Credit   and   Underwriting

Facilities for a further five years;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) liberalisation of the tax concession for the unit trust

industry; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) removal of the yearly restrictions in the tax deduction

limits for general provisions made by banks.

<br><br><i>Tax Changes Not Announced in the 1998 Budget Statement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the four tax changes that were not

announced in the 1998 Budget Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to tax deduction for donation

of  computer  equipment.   At  present,  companies  that  donate

computer equipment to educational and research institutions  are

allowed a tax deduction equal to the value of the donation.  The

scheme is to encourage companies to donate computer equipment to

these institutions to help them upgrade and maintain the quality

of  information technology training at the forefront.  To enable

other  organisations to also keep pace with the developments  in

information  technology,  I  have  decided  to  extend  the  tax

deduction  scheme to include donation of computer  equipment  to

public   libraries,  community  centres  and  voluntary  welfare

organisations.  Clause 15 amends section 37(2)  of  the  Act  to

provide for this extension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change relates to the promotion of trading of

Singapore  goods and services.  Currently, double tax  deduction

is  granted for expenses incurred in the promotion of  Singapore

goods and services.  As the current

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>

provision  in the Act is rather restrictive with regard  to  the

type and extent of expenses incurred that would qualify for  the

double tax deduction, clause 8 amends section 14B of the Act  to

provide  for more flexibility in order to encourage the  trading

of Singapore goods and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third tax change relates to the tax incentives I

announced  in  the  1995 Budget to promote offshore  leasing  of

aircraft.    Under  the  incentive  package,  aircraft   leasing

companies   that  operate  from  Singapore  are   taxed   at   a

concessionary rate of 10% on their income derived from  offshore

aircraft  leasing.   To  further  boost  the  attractiveness  of

Singapore as a location for aircraft leasing companies,  I  have

decided to extend the tax concession to cover the income derived

by  approved aircraft leasing companies from aircraft management

activities.  Clause 19 amends section 43I of the Act to  provide

for this extension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last change is to improve tax administration.

At  present, the Act requires a person carrying on  a  trade  or

business to issue receipts and maintain records of such receipts

issued for tax purposes.  However, the Act also provides for the

Comptroller  of  Income  Tax to waive  such  a  requirement  for

businesses  such as fast food restaurants where the turnover  is

high  but the value of each transaction is low, subject  to  the

company  being able to satisfy certain conditions.  For ease  of

administration, clause 2 amends section 2 of the Act  to  enable

the  Comptroller of Income Tax to delegate the power to  approve

such   requests  to  the  Deputy  Comptroller  or  an  Assistant

Comptroller of Income Tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].

<div align="center"><h4>COMPENSATION FOR OIL POLLUTION) BILL</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to give effect to the International

Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 (CLC

92) and the International Convention on the Establishment of  an

International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage  in

1992   (Fund  92).   Both  Conventions  were  adopted   by   the

International Maritime Organization.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil

Pollution Damage 1969 (CLC 69) and  the International Convention

on  the  Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation

for  Oil  Pollution Damage 1971 (Fund 71) set the  international

rules  and procedure for dealing with liability and compensation

for  oil  pollution damage. These Conventions  provide  for  the

sharing of the costs of compensation between the shipowners  and

cargo  interests. Compensation is initially paid by  the  owner,

whom  the CLC 69 makes strictly liable for oil pollution damage.

Since  CLC  69  also  generally provides for limitation  of  the

owner's  liability,  additional compensation  is  available,  if

needed,  from the International Oil Pollution Compensation  Fund

(the  1971  Fund),  established under  Fund  71.   The  Fund  is

financed by contributions from importers and receivers of oil.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been a party to CLC 69 for many years. The

existing  1981 Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) Act  implements

this Convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the CLC 69 and Fund 71 have been found to be inadequate

to  meet current levels of claims. In 1992, the IMO adopted  two

Protocols  to amend CLC 69 and Fund 71. The Protocols  primarily

raised  the level of compensation that victims of oil  pollution

can  claim as a result of an oil pollution from ships. Under CLC

92, the limit of compensation has been raised

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>

from  about S$30 million (in CLC 69) to about S$130 million,  or

slightly  more  than four times.  Under Fund 92,  the  limit  of

compensation has been raised from about S$130 million  (in  Fund

71) to about S$436 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of oil imported to and exported from Singapore

has  been increasing steadily over the years. A large number  of

very  large crude carriers (VLCCs) transit the Singapore Strait.

As  the  maritime  traffic  in our  waters  and  in  the  Strait

increases, so too does the risk of a serious pollution incident.

In  fact,  if  Members may recall, such an  incident  did  occur

recently  in October 1997 when two oil tankers collided  in  the

Singapore Strait spilling some 28,000 tons of crude oil into our

waters.  We would like to have a higher limit of compensation in

the event of a serious pollution incident like this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPA consulted various public and private sector

organizations   involved   such  as   the   Singapore   Shipping

Association,  oil  industry, TDB, EDB and  MTI.  They  have  all

supported  Singapore's  accession to  the  Protocols.  Singapore

acceded  to  CLC  92  and  Fund 92 on 18th  September  and  31st

December 1997 respectively.  These will come into force one year

later.   In  other  words, in September and December  this  year

respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our accession to CLC 92 means that Singapore-registered oil

tankers  will have to be covered by insurance against  liability

for  oil  pollution damage for a higher limit  of  compensation.

Further,  tankers calling at Singapore must also be  insured  to

the  same  higher limit.   Our accession to Fund 92 will  enable

victims  of oil pollution damage to seek additional compensation

where   compensation  from  shipowners  or  their  insurers   is

insufficient to meet the claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a party to CLC 92 and Fund 92, Singapore is obligated to

give  effect to the provisions of these Conventions in its laws.

The Bill contains the essential provisions to give effect to CLC

92  and  Fund 92. Administrative and procedural matters will  be

dealt by subsidiary legislation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the higher compensation available to oil pollution

victims  which  I have just mentioned, there are  the  following

differences  between the old Act, which implements CLC  69,  and

the Bill which implements CLC 92 and Fund 92:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 6 of the Bill, owners of ships not exceeding

5,000 tons can limit their liability to a fixed sum of 3 million

special drawing rights (SDRs).  This is equivalent to about  S$6

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3 of the Bill, expenses incurred for

preventive measures are recoverable even where no spill  of  oil

occurs,  provided that there is a grave and imminent  threat  of

pollution damage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions of the Bill apply to pollution damage both in

the  territory (including the territorial sea) as  well  as  the

exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions of the Bill apply to spills from sea-going

vessels  constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk  as  cargo,

whether laden or unladen and apply to spills of bunker oil  from

such ships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving effect to Fund 92, the Bill requires

contributions to be paid to the Fund by an importer or  receiver

of  more  than  150,000  tons per year of  oil.  The  major  oil

companies  and oil traders in Singapore will contribute  to  the

Fund.  The amount to be paid each year will depend on the number

and  size of oil spills in the States party to the Fund 92,  the

amount  of claim that exceeds the limit of the CLC 92, the  cost

and  expenses  of  administering the Fund and any  deficit  from

operations in preceding years. The amount of contributions is to

be  fixed  by  the  Fund.  The Fund shall,  subject  to  certain

prescribed  limits, be liable to any person  who  is  unable  to

obtain  full  compensation  for oil pollution  damage  from  the

shipowner  or  his  insurer  if the shipowner  is  incapable  of

meeting  the claim or the claim exceeds the limitation  fund  of

the owner established under clause 7.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the fines imposed for any

offence  under the Bill and sums collected to be paid  into  the

funds  of the Authority. Payment of fines to MPA will enable  it

to recover part of the clean

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>

up  costs  for oil spills from unknown sources and investigation

expenses relating to pollution incidents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first,

I  would  like  to support this Bill.  This Bill  has  two  main

parts:  one on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution and,  secondly,

on the accession to the International Oil Pollution Compensation

Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore as an international port and maritime centre

should subscribe to these two conventions and fund, which  serve

to  limit liability to ship owners, and yet protect the interest

of  the  countries  around the seas where the  pollution  occurs

arising  from  these ship operations.  As the  Minister  pointed

out,  Singapore  has  been a signatory to  the  Civil  Liability

Convention  of  1969,  which  was  convened  arising  from   the

environmental  pollution and damage of the  "Torrey  Canyon"  in

1967.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is to be welcomed. The question I want to ask is

why  it took so long for us to be a signatory to it.  The  Civil

Liability  Convention  (CLC) will  only  be  in  force  on  17th

September  1998.   In  this  period  since  the  Convention  was

operational in the other more progressive countries, why were we

so  slow  to  join  in?   In this period between  now  and  17th

September  1998, owners of vessels operating in our  waters  are

exposed to liability because of the limitations of CLC  69.   We

have already experienced vessel collision like Orapin Global and

Evoikos  in  October  1997, which caused  major  pollution.   So

technically we are still exposed till 17th September 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the accession to this Convention 92 mean that our

ships  from  the  neighbouring countries will be  restricted  in

trade  around  our  waters  and our  port,  because  such  ships

registered   in  these  neighbouring  countries   may   not   be

signatories?   And  will  the  higher  insurance  premiums   and

standard  requirements imply that our port  will  be  less  open

because it is more restrictive given the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>

higher  stringency  for the regional vessels?   Will  this  have

implications  for  us  in  serving the regional  vessels  in  an

economically difficult period?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of this Bill stipulates that Government ships be

exempted from these regulations.  I can accept if it is  due  to

matters  of  war,  but  navy vessels  also  operate  within  our

congested waters around the port and around Singapore  and  they

should be equally liable for such pollutions if they are due  to

accidents or through negligence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7, subsection 3a(i), liability damages are

determined  in  SDRs  (Special  Drawing  Rights)  expressed   in

Singapore  dollars.   My  question is:  why  must  the  rate  of

exchange  be  determined by the date of judgement?   Bearing  in

mind  that  such  damages extend into millions of  dollars,  and

judgement and settlement can extend over years, should  not  the

rate   of  exchange  between  SDRs  and  Singapore  dollars   be

determined on the date of the event or the last closest rate  to

reflect the real cost damages?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Fund Convention, it puts our importers of oil and

refineries  on  the need to contribute to this  Fund.   Does  it

affect  the  competitiveness of our refineries or oil  importers

when  other  refineries,  including state-owned  ones  in  other

neighbouring countries, are not signatories?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Chay for supporting the

Bill.   He asks why is it that we took so long to operationalise

these  two conventions (CLC 92 and Fund 92).  Let me just  point

out  that  although they were adopted by IMO in 1992 (hence  the

name  CLC  92  and  Fund 92), both these conventions  have  only

entered into force internationally in 1996, two years ago.   The

practice is to have a minimum number of countries accede to  the

protocol  before  it comes into force.  It is  our  practice  to

accede   to   these  conventions  after  it  comes  into   force

internationally.   When it did so in 1996, the  Government  then

started  the  process  of consultation with  various  interested

parties.   In  our  case,  of  course,  we  consulted  not  only

Government agencies and Ministries, like MTI, TDB and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

so  on,  but also other relevant parties in Singapore  like  the

Singapore Shipping Association (SSA), oil traders, oil  refiners

and  so on.  That was done and completed last year and the  Fund

was  acceded to last year and will go into operation this  year.

So  I can assure the Member that there was no undue tardiness in

this area.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what happens in between CLC 69 and CLC 92, in the

period before CLC 92 comes into force, we are still governed  by

the  provisions of CLC 69.  If there are any pollution incidents

that  happen now, these will be covered by CLC 69.   The  Member

mentioned the Evoikos incident.  I would like to inform him that

based on the estimates of the damage that has been caused by the

Evoikos  incident, MPA is confident that the clean up cost  will

be  covered  or  met in full under CLC 69, the  old  convention.

This of course is due in no small part to the fact that MPA  and

the relevant agencies took swift and preventive action to ensure

that  the  damage was not unduly extensive.  CLC 69 coverage  is

sufficient to cover any contingencies that we anticipate, if  we

are  fully prepared for such emergency.  However, to be safe  we

have decided to accede to CLC 92.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asks about higher insurance premiums and

what happens to ships of countries that do not accede to the CLC

<br><br>92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protocol.  Based on international convention, first of  all,

ships of countries that are party to CLC 92 will have no problem

because  under that convention they are obligated, as Singapore-registered   ships  are,  to  obtain  the  necessary  insurance.

However,  ships  which are not a party to CLC 92  will  need  to

obtain  a  CLC 92 certificate to call at Singapore.   What  this

means  is  that  they must obtain the necessary insurance  which

will  provide for the higher limits of indemnity required  under

CLC  92.   In  actual fact, the Protection and  Indemnity  (P&I)

clubs   that   insure  the  ships  and  provide  the   insurance

certificates informed us that most probably there will  be  very

little  or  no  increase in premium for a CLC 92 certificate  as

compared to a CLC 69 certificate.  This means that there will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>

be  very  little  cost  impact on ships  calling  on  Singapore.

Because  the  P&I  insurance cover today is already  very  high,

there  would  not  be any significant increase in  the  premiums

which means therefore that the cost impact on ships will also be

negligible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Government ships exempted? The two Protocols (CLC 92

and  Fund 92) only apply to ships which are constructed for  the

carriage  of  oil  in bulk as cargo and also of  course  to  the

spillage of bunker oil in the ships.  So if such a ship is owned

by government, by a state, or by a state-owned company, then the

convention will apply to those types of government ships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asks why the conversion rate is set at the

date  of  judgement rather than at the date of event.   This  is

part  of the international agreement that has been thrashed  out

and settled among various countries.  There must be a reason why

they  have  set it at the date of judgement.  I am not  familiar

with  the  reason  why  that  has  been  so.   But  that  is  an

international convention and Singapore is obliged to follow.  If

he  is interested, I can find out the reasons and respond  at  a

later date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on competitiveness of oil refineries and whether

Singapore oil refineries will be affected in terms of high cost.

As I indicated earlier, before we acceded to this convention, we

canvassed  the opinion of all interested parties from Singapore,

including  the  oil  refineries,  and  all  oil  companies  have

expressed  support  for this convention.  I  believe  major  oil

companies in Singapore, they are multi-national companies,  find

it  in  their  own  interest for Singapore  to  accede  to  this

convention.  Firstly, it means that they are actually  protected

because  CLC 92 sets a cap on their liability; and, secondly,  I

understand  that  they  do  buy insurance,  they  contribute  to

private   insurance  anyway.   So  the  contributions  to   this

convention would, I assume, be in lieu of contribution to  their

own private insurance funds.  In that sense, I do not think that

there will be any major impact on their competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe those are the few questions that were raised.

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF PLANTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br>5.12 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Plants Act was enacted in 1994 to

consolidate legislation relating to plants and plant products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fulfil Singapore's obligations under the Agreement on

Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or  TRIPS

Agreement,  the Inter-Ministry Committee on the TRIPS  Agreement

recommended legislative amendments to various Acts including the

Control  of  Plants Act.  My Ministry and the Primary Production

Department  (PPD)  have  taken this opportunity  to  review  and

update the existing Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main changes to the Act concern three areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, regulating the import and transhipment of fresh fruits

and vegetables to safeguard the health of humans;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, fulfilling Singapore's obligations under TRIPS and

other WTO Agreements; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, improving PPD's operational effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through and explain the rationale of the

three main changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, regulating the trade in fresh fruits and vegetables.

To  address  increasing concerns about the safety  of  the  food

Singapore imports, the Bill enhances the powers of the competent

authority to impose conditions on the transhipment and import of

fruits and vegetables.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>

Stringent  controls  are also necessary to  protect  Singapore's

trade in plants and plant products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Act, PPD has no legal

power  to  impose  or enforce any conditions on transhipment  of

fresh  fruits  and  vegetables.  This poses a  potential  health

hazard   as   such  products,  although  not  meant  for   local

consumption,  may  introduce harmful micro-organisms  and  pests

into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of potential threats are E. coli 0157:H7, an

organism  causing  severe food poisoning and  the  Mediterranean

Fruitfly, an insect that is detrimental to our trade in  fruits.

To  allow  PPD to impose sanitary controls, clause 2 provides  a

new  definition of "tranship" and clause 5 re-enacts Part II  of

the  Act  to require a person who wishes to tranship  fruits  or

vegetables  through Singapore to obtain a licence,  and  also  a

permit   for   individual  consignments  of  fresh  fruits   and

vegetables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need to enhance the competent authority's

control  on  imports of fruits and vegetables.   New  section  7

requires an import permit for individual consignments on top  of

the  licensing requirement in the existing Act.  With  the  two-tier  control system of licences and permits, PPD will have  the

flexibility to impose and enforce conditions on both imports and

transhipments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under new section 30, PPD can restrict an import or

transhipment immediately by withholding the licence or permit in

respect  of  sources of fruits and vegetables when  evidence  is

received  of any disease outbreaks or other hazards  related  to

fruits  and  vegetables and which may be brought into  Singapore

through  import  or  transhipment.   This  speed  of  action  is

necessary  as  the jet age has allowed goods to  be  transported

between countries in a matter of hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to fulfilling Singapore's obligations to

the  various  WTO Agreements.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  next  major

feature  is how to fulfil our obligations.  Firstly,  clause  6,

incorporating  new sections 15A and 15B, is proposed  to  comply

with  our  obligations  set  out in  Article  39  of  the  TRIPS

Agreement.  Under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>

section  15A, the Director of Primary Production is  obliged  to

take   reasonable   steps   to  protect   certain   confidential

information  received  by him in relation  to  applications  for

registration  of  innovative  pesticides  and  not  to  use  the

information  to  process other applications for registration  of

pesticides.  Section 15B describes the circumstances  where  the

obligations under section 15A do not apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new sections 30(4) and 31(A) have been

introduced  to  fulfil  Singapore's obligations  under  the  WTO

Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WTO Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures places

certain   obligations  on  WTO  members  with  regard   to   the

administration   of   import   licensing   procedures.     These

obligations  are  aimed primarily at promoting transparency  and

fairness.   Section  30  requires the Director  to  provide  the

application with written reasons if he refuses to issue or renew

the licence or permit applied for under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 31A allows any person aggrieved by the decision

of  the  Director  regarding the grant, renewal,  suspension  or

revocation of a licence or permit, to appeal to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has also reviewed PPD's

current  operational needs.  Clauses 9 and 15 will  provide  PPD

the  flexibility  to  carry  out  its  operations  with  greater

effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow PPD to overcome resource constraints and focus its

limited  manpower  on  the  critical areas,  clause  9  proposes

amendments  to  section  26 to provide PPD  the  flexibility  to

outsource less critical operations to the private sector.  These

operations  include the inspection of plants and plant  products

for the issuance of phytosanitary certificates; and the analysis

of imported fresh fruits and vegetables for contaminants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outsourcing of inspection for the issuance of

phytosanitary  certificates is allowed under  the  International

Plant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>

Protection Convention which is the reference point for  the  WTO

on  international  standards, guidelines and recommendations  on

plant health.  The United States has already taken advantage  of

this  provision  to  introduce  a  scheme  to  accredit  private

companies to carry out such inspections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With modern transportation methods allowing pests and

diseases  better  chances  of  surviving  international  travel,

another  critical  function of PPD  is  the  prevention  or  the

containment  of  any  inadvertent  introduction  of  pests   and

diseases that could be detrimental to our plant trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operationally, PPD needs to enter private premises, such as

farms, nurseries and warehouses to detect pests and, if need be,

carry  out eradication tasks.  Based on data gathered, PPD would

evaluate  the  impact on our trade in plants and plant  products

and  decide  whether import restrictions should be  imposed  and

take  remedial  actions such as eradication  operations.   Early

detection  will provide us the opportunity to eradicate  a  pest

before it is established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current legislation presumes the entry of private premises

by  authorised officers to carry out pest surveys.  In practice,

if  permission is denied, no entry can be made.  Section  20  of

the  Act  is therefore amended to give PPD powers to  enter  any

land  or  premises  to conduct inspection surveys  in  order  to

ascertain the presence of pests and to gather the necessary data

to  determine  the need, cost and scale of any pest eradication,

control or quarantine actions to be taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to address possible abuse of such powers, certain

safeguards have been built in.  Firstly, the officer must be  an

"authorised" officer.  Secondly, the  inspections  can  only  be

done  at  reasonable times and only after giving a notice  under

the  hand of the Director at least six hours before the intended

exercise  of  the power.  Thirdly, the inspecting  officer  must

produce  an  identification card, when  requested.   The  United

States and Canada have similar laws to empower their officers to

enter premises for pest surveys and inspection.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill aims (1) to safeguard the health of

Singaporeans with respect to fresh fruits and vegetables brought

into  Singapore and protect our plant trade through the  control

of  pests; (2) fulfil Singapore's WTO obligations; and (3) allow

PPD to overcome resource constraints and focus its resources  on

more critical areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>CONTRIBUTION BY FOUNDING FATHERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to the signification of

support  by at least one other Member.  Does it have the support

of any hon. Member?

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> I support

the motion, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Much obliged, Mr Speaker, Sir. Sir, I

beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House records with gratitude the contribution

made  by our founding fathers in building a multi-racial, multi-religious   and   multi-lingual  society  and  reaffirms   these

principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion is a result of the National Education

Exhibition.  As we celebrate our independence, it is  timely  to

recall  and  recognise  the contribution made  by  our  founding

fathers.   They fought for independence and built a progressive,

peaceful  and prosperous Singapore.  Those of us who have  lived

through  the  tumultuous  years  cannot  but  feel  a  sense  of

gratitude.   How  we  made it to where we  are  today  has  been

compiled in about 36 minutes in a multi-media presentation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the opening ceremony, the Prime Minister asked

me how I felt.  My reply was simple.  The Exhibition has been an

emotional  journey  for most of us who have  lived  through  the

period.  How we made it is a miracle.  Let me say this to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>

National Heritage Board and to MITA: every dollar spent has been

well spent.  They have done well.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.26 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am moving this motion out of

conviction to acknowledge a debt to those who have made us  what

we  are  and to convey to the generation to come that these  are

principles   worthy  of  emulation.   Sir,  an  Indian   classic

Thirukural  says  it is not good to forget a benefit.   We  have

benefited a great deal, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles which I have termed in this motion are

principles worthy of following because without them, we will  be

torn  asunder.  I have discussed this motion with some  friends.

They  felt it was timely.  I agree with them.  Sir, this  motion

deals with founding fathers, but allow me also to deal with  our

forefathers.  Before the British came to Singapore,  the  Malays

were  already  here.  Singapore was part of  the  Johor  empire.

They  came  from China, Indonesia, Malaya and India.  They  came

not  to  set up a home but to return to their homeland  after  a

brief sojourn, making some money.  Some died without even seeing

their  families back home.  Many survived in colonial Singapore.

Some of our forefathers went to their homeland and brought their

families  to  Singapore.  They lived a very frugal  and  spartan

life.   Their life was one of pain and suffering.  Through their

toil  and sweat, they built a place called Singapura, our  home,

their legacy for the future generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we owe a debt to our pioneers that cannot be repaid.

I  hope  in  years to come, we can name one of our  institutions

after  these  pioneers.  They deserve a lasting  memorial.   Our

location has remained our greatest asset.  It is God's  gift  to

us, no man can take this away from us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any natural resources, Sir, except its location and

its  people, the island prospered under the British  rule.   The

strategic  location of this island attracted traders from  South

East Asia and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>

elsewhere.  For decades, life centred on trade.  More  and  more

immigrants made this island their home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with changing of the time, especially after the Second

World  War,  the  political  landscape  underwent  change.    It

awakened  national consciousness and our leaders  realised  that

they  had  to  be  masters  of their own  destiny.   The  Rendal

Constitution  set  the tone for elected government  with  powers

still in the hands of the British government.  This was in 1955.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonial office realised that the status quo could not

be maintained.  There were the student riots as well as the Hock

Lee  riots.  Things started changing.  Singapore attained  self-government in June 1959.  The PAP under the leadership of Mr Lee

Kuan  Yew formed the first self-government.  In symbolic change,

Sir,  the  Ministers  were sworn in City Hall  and  not  in  the

Government  House.   Subsequently,  six  months  later,  on  3rd

December, Encik Yusof Ishak took office as the first local  Head

of State.  And it was a historic occasion, for the first time we

sang  "Majulah  Singapura".   As a  student,  we  were  given  a

national loyalty card.  Sir, I still have this card and this  is

a symbol of our loyalty.  It reads, "Majulah Singapura,  susunan

kata dan lagu oleh Zubir Said."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we entered Malaysia in 1963 as a free people. We had

to  leave  the  federation  in 1965 and  became  an  independent

republic.   We  went  into Malaysia in the hope  of  building  a

Malaysian nation, but we did not succeed.  We must never  forget

our  stay in Malaysia which provided us a valuable lesson.  When

we  became  a Republic in 1965, we were not certain  as  to  the

future.   The resolve by the leaders and the people has made  us

succeed against all odds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is men like Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr

Toh  Chin  Chye, Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr S Rajaratnam, Mr Ong  Pang

Boon,  Mr Lim Kim San, Mr E W Barker, Encik Othman Wok,  Mr  Hon

Sui  Sen  and  others we owe much.  We also  remember  Mr  David

Marshall for his dream of Merdeka.  These men are representative

of their time.  These men could

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>

have  lived a fairly comfortable life from any calling of  their

choice but they decided to help the people in building a modern,

prosperous  Singapore.  They literally risked  their  lives  and

limbs for Singapore.  They were a product of history.  They knew

what it was to be treated as a colonial people.  And let us hope

that  the  best  sons of Singapore would follow  these  leaders'

footsteps,  just not in the Administrative Service but  also  in

politics,  for our scholars must never forget that  they  owe  a

duty and debt to society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can overcome the present and future difficulties

provided  we have the resolve.  In every society, the  cream  of

the  society  decides the fate of the community.   But  we  must

never  forget that there will be no cream without milk.   It  is

equally  important for us to dedicate the course of our  society

from which must come the leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to pay tribute to our civil service as well.

People  like Mr Howe Yoon Chong, Mr Sim Kee Boon, Mr J Y  Pillay

and  others who gave their best beyond the call of duty, for  no

Government policy can succeed without a dedicated, honest, civil

service.   This House and the nation can be proud of  our  civil

servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also pay tribute to our citizens who worked hard, hand

in  hand  with  the  Government, for no government  can  succeed

without the support of the people.  We can overcome difficulties

provided we are firm in our resolve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, multi-racialism is a strong thread

of  our  national  fabric, both for the  majority  and  minority

communities;  in fact, all Singaporeans.  We must feel  at  home

and  at  ease with each other.  In many countries, the so-called

multi-racialism is at best a dressing on the dining  plate.   In

some countries, minorities are persecuted, humiliated and suffer

worst  indignities.  Our appeal to these countries is to respect

and protect the minorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In multi-racial Singapore, our young children go to the

same  school,  share  the common goal and aspirations,  learning

each  other's  culture and mix with each  other  easily.   These

principles must be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>

cultivated,  but  we  cannot take them  for  granted.   We  must

nurture them.  We must not just be tolerant.  Tolerance  to  me,

Sir, is very passive.  We must do more.  We must be active.   We

must respect each other's beliefs and traditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to language, Sir, language is a very sensitive

issue.  We have chosen English as the medium of learning.  Malay

is our national language.  We sing our national anthem in Malay.

We  have  decided  we  must learn our mother  tongue,  Mandarin,

Malay, Tamil, Hindi, Punjabi and other Indian languages.   These

languages  will  act  as  a  ballast,  to  quote  our  Education

Minister,  RAdm  Teo Chee Hean.  These languages  will  help  us

preserve  our  heritage.  Sir, the Government  is  committed  to

nurturing  our  mother tongue and it is prepared to  change  its

policy whenever there is  merit in the proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving now to religious harmony, this is the most

sensitive issue.  We have seen two riots which have religion  as

the  basis of civil disturbances.  Some of us felt very strongly

and   made  representations  to  the  Select  Committee  on  the

Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill.  And we are grateful  for

Parliament in  passing this Bill that we have religious  harmony

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a people of different races and different

religions.  We have only one dream, the dream to build Singapore

where  people  live in peace.  The citizens have  pride  in  our

nation.   Our  young must find it worthwhile to  stay  and  make

their contribution to this country, their homeland.  I say  this

because  in  many  countries, religious strife  has  harmed  the

people  and  the  country.  We have built an honest  and  stable

Government.  Our people believe that there can be no  peace  and

prosperity without a strong government.  It is essential to have

political stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I end my speech with a reference to the Proclamation

of Singapore.  Allow me to quote from the Proclamation:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As from the 9th day of August in the year One Thousand

Nine  Hundred  and  Sixty  Five Singapore  shall  be  forever  a

sovereign, democratic and independent nation, founded  upon  the

principles  of liberty and justice and ever seeking the  welfare

and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the House to support this motion, Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, as an English-educated person, I wish to speak  in

Chinese  today  to  express the gratitude  I  feel  towards  the

contribution  of our founding fathers in establishing  a  multi-lingual  policy.  After all Chinese is my mother  tongue  and  a

language which I deeply enjoy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent economic crisis in all the Asian countries had

noticeable  ramifications at all levels.   The  tension  between

Malaysia and Singapore is one example.  It arose due to economic

and  historical  differences,  with  each  country  arguing  and

defending  its  own  ground.   The  persecution  of  Chinese  in

Indonesia  was another painful and traumatic event,  heightening

our awareness and anxiety toward inter-ethnic conflict.  Against

this  background, the recent National Education Exhibition which

related   the  growth  of  Singapore  from  a  colony   to   its

independence   and  the  resilience  with  which  our   pioneers

struggled to build this country, truly won my admiration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Education Exhibition portrayed our society as

multi-racial,    multi-cultural   and    multi-lingual.     That

Singaporeans  have  for  33  years  co-existed  in  harmony  and

collectively  worked hard to develop this nation  -  amidst  the

throes  of  vast  global transformations - is an  accomplishment

which we must all cherish and feel proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can we sustain this hard-earned harmony through future

generations  without  trouble?  The younger  Singaporeans  today

have  no  understanding of the 1964 racial riots and are  rather

unaware about ethnic issues.  Does this point to the success  of

our  multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-lingual policy  that

made  "race"  not an issue at all or does it signal  a  lack  of

sensitivity towards ethnic issues?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What concerns me are two issues: education and language.

Our education policy created a group of elites such that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>

those  who  finally  entered tertiary  education  are  primarily

Chinese.   Even  among Primary and Secondary schools  achievers,

Chinese  in relative percentage terms still do better  than  the

other  ethnic  groups.   I  do not think  this  is  due  to  any

discriminatory  policy adopted by the Government.   It  reflects

more  the  varying  attitudes toward education  among  different

ethnic  groups  and  the  lack  of adequate  resources  in  some

families  to  allow  the  children to complete  their  education

successfully.  As such, I reckon that what Singaporeans have  to

be   concerned  with  is  how  to  strengthen  and  elevate  the

educational  attainment  levels  of  all  the  different  ethnic

groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern is on the language issue. Till today,

there  are  still many Chinese Singaporeans who  share  negative

views  about Chinese culture and its transmission.  Despite  the

openness  which  the  Government has adopted  towards  the  four

official  languages, Chinese being one of them, there  are  many

Chinese  who will not embrace and accept their own language  and

heritage.   These  in  particular are the  English-educated  who

regard English as Singapore's main language, a superior language

which was passed down to us from the colonial days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, when the Chinese-educated community organise

a  talk  or study group and invite eminent scholars to  come  to

share their insights on Chinese culture, such an event would  be

regarded  as a chauvinistic activity when it clearly is  only  a

cultural  and academic exchange.  The recent cultural  symposium

organised  by  Lianhe Zaobao was essentially an  experience  for

some  Singaporeans to find their lost heritage.  Twelve  hundred

participants were there to seek intellectual stimulation  and  a

diversity  of views on life from four eminent personalities.   I

personally was appreciative of the effort the Lianhe Zaobao gave

to  encourage this high level of cultural dialogue.  In my view,

such an event represents a form of cultural renaissance and does

not  represent narrow-minded ethnocentric chauvinism.  Moreover,

Chinese culture

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>

being  one  of  the world's greatest cultures, has  been  highly

regarded  by  scholars in America and Europe  do we  then  judge

their  enthusiasm  as misplaced?  What the English-educated  did

not realise is the fact that in an increasingly Westernised city-state like Singapore which is dominated by the English language,

the Chinese-educated also feel neglected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Chinese as a majority group in this country must

not  disregard the sensitive reactions of the other groups.  One

specific  example  was  the  recent discussion  by  the  Nanyang

Technological  University on the creation of a Chinese  Cultural

Institute  and  cultural  elite.  A  non-Chinese  felt  strongly

enough  to  write  to  the press pointing  out  that  this  move

directly  contradicted the early principles of  a  multi-racial,

multi-religious  and multi-lingual society.   Other  individuals

asked:  if  we talk about a Chinese cultural elite,  what  about

Malay  or  Indian elites?  Or should each of these  cultures  in

their search for cultural excellence, at some level also promote

the  larger Singapore culture by encouraging the elites in  each

group  to  build bridges of linkages to help our diverse  groups

achieve an even higher level of consensus?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that the issue of race cannot be broached

by  the  intellect or conceptual theories.  I grew up in  Little

India.   During the 50s to the 70s, the neighbours  I  contacted

were Malays, Indians and Chinese.  Because my parents had always

related  to different ethnic groups, this exposure had  made  my

brothers  and  I  develop a high level of  acceptance  of  other

races.   This is the reason why till today, I have close friends

from  different  races.   I  may not  clearly  understand  their

cultures,  but  this ignorance has not prevented our  friendship

from  developing.  I raise this example to express a  fact  that

the  barriers  between  races must be removed  by  interpersonal

relationships through communication.  Such communication must be

sustained  over  a  long period, to allow  us  to  develop  from

different experiences our respect and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>

friendship   for   one  another.   The  kind   of   heart-linked

relationship  for  one  another is the  best  assurance  against

racial conflict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I make a call for all principals,

teachers, parents, Government and community agencies to organise

more   light   entertaining  events  in  order  to  create   the

opportunity  for different ethnic groups to meet  and  have  the

chance  to correct their biases for and misunderstanding of  one

another.  We cannot merely "talk" about multi-racial society; we

need  to  give  time to organise activities  to  "act  out"  our

beliefs and encourage more noble bridge makers to take the lead.

The  Racial Harmony Day is only a symbolic event, what  is  more

representative of our harmony is the creation and continuity  of

multi-racial  relationships at all levels.  At the  present,  we

are  asked to be open and welcome foreign talents to our country

to  help  our  economic development. With  their  arrivals,  the

diversity  in our multi-cultural society takes on an  additional

dimension,  making  it  all  the more  necessary  that  we  keep

developing  the  heart-linked network to achieve overall  social

cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can objectively adopt a larger perspective on global

cultures by recognising that the search for all cultural sources

is like digging a well: that as we dig deeper, we will find that

all   different  sources  from  the  well  will  lead   to   one

undifferentiating source.  If so, why do we not adopt a tolerant

attitude towards accepting our commonness?  If we start  digging

our  multi-cultural  wells  based on  this  reckoning,  we  will

finally reach the Big Singapore Culture which will be a  mix  of

tradition  and  modernity, East and West, people's  culture  and

elite culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I had not intended to speak. I jotted

down  some  points,  but  I  thought the  motion  moved  by  the

Nominated Member was so self-evident and worthy of support  that

it was not necessary for me to speak.  However, I do rise now to

raise  some  concerns  for the future.  I share  very  much  the

gratitude, expressed already, that we build from our  good  days

of  racial  harmony  in the past and I share  a  pride  in  that

Singapore,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>

when  it was in Malaysia, stood for Malaysian Malaysia, and then

stood  for  Singaporean Singapore to act, as  our  pledge  says,

regardless  of race.  But I am perhaps more cautionary  for  the

future.  One of the lessons I extracted from history was that we

should  not take harmony for granted and that there are possible

concerns for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand in good stead because the Constitution promises,

in Article 12, protection of all citizens against discrimination

based  on  race.  But I must share with this House a  perception

that  we  have  moved from the idea of a pledge,  regardless  of

race,  to a policy of acting with due regard to race.   I  think

this  perception  is  wrong.  I think  there  is  no  change  in

Government policy.  But I do share some concerns that there  may

be, and I stress the words "may be", unintended consequences  of

some  existing policies.  I hope I am not misunderstood  here  - policies  which in themselves may be nothing wrong, maybe  good.

But there have been concerns raised at various youth seminars  I

have attended in this last year that I wish to share.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, and I think this touches very much on NMP Mdm Claire

Chiang's  point,  the  Speak Mandarin campaign.   As  far  as  I

understand from the interpretation, she suggested that  English-speaking  Chinese Singaporeans, such as myself,  were  wrong  to

regard  English as superior.  I think she is right.  English  is

not  superior  to Chinese.  But neither is Chinese  superior  to

English,  nor  to  any other language.  I think  that  there  is

nothing wrong with each race trying to learn the language  which

they associate with their mothers, even if their mothers do  not

speak  that  language.   But I am concerned  of  the  unintended

consequence of this policy.  I have heard many anecdotal stories

of  unthinking individuals who, in the name, the misused name of

the  Speak Mandarin campaign, switch to Mandarin when there  are

Malay,   Indian   or  others  like  me,  non-Mandarin   speaking

colleagues,  present.  This is an exclusionary  practice.   Must

all  Chinese  Singaporeans speak Chinese?  Is  English  language

only  for work?  What if, as I do, I think, dream and write from

my very heart in English?  As I said, I do not claim that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>

English  is  superior, but I do not think I am less  Singaporean

because I do not speak Mandarin and Chinese, and I am Chinese.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried my best to learn about Chinese history, the

overseas Chinese from English books.  I hope my child will learn

Mandarin  because that is the school rules now.  But  I  do  not

think I enjoy a lesser place in the sun, and I do not think that

is what Mdm Claire Chiang was saying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second unintended consequence which follows from this

is  the concern of SAP schools.  Mr Shriniwas Rai, the NMP, said

that  our  schools tried to build multi-religious, multi-racial,

multi-lingual harmony.  I think that is true.  That is  what  we

are  trying  to  do.   I think it is good to  promote  bilingual

students  among those who can cope with two languages  as  first

language.   Do not get me wrong.  SAP schools themselves  are  a

useful thing.  But there is a concern that the inter-racial  and

cultural  mix in such schools is reduced, the understanding  and

interaction of the bright and young is limited to those who  are

predominantly  of one culture, one race.  We must remember  that

schools  are not about purely what we learn from books but  what

we learn from each other, from fellow classmates.  The skills of

citizenry,  of  getting along, are built in school.   This  must

include in Singapore racial understanding.  So we need to search

for a balance in these policies, and to guard against unintended

consequences which we may face in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is of ethnic self-help groups. The Government

has  said that it thinks this is the best way to mobilise  self-help.   I  think self-help groups are a fact of life which  many

people  embrace  at present.  But it should also  be  emphasised

that  ethnicity  of  race  should  not  be  the  only  basis  of

volunteering  your  service, or volunteerism.   People  may  and

should  increasingly volunteer for a common  cause,  not  for  a

common  race.   There  is  a  need to  foster  community  across

ethnicity.   So  when  I  see  initiatives  such  as  the  Prime

Minister's call for civil society or for  CDCs which  are  based

more in geography, or neighbourliness, this is good.  Further

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>

along, we need to encourage self-help groups to have more  joint

projects and, if I may voice a suggestion, that one day  further

down  the  road, we should set a sunset clause for ethnic  self-help   groups,  that  in  the  end  Singaporeans   should   help

Singaporeans, not just those of the same race or ethnicity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected with this, the debate that is happening in

Indonesia  must  touch us.  One of the commoner  suggestions  in

this  debate is that identity cards or other official  materials

which  describe a race should have this removed.   Our  ICs  are

similar.  I wonder if this continues to be necessary.   I  point

out  that this is highly artificial given that our rules,  as  I

understand  them, follow the paternal line only.  So  there  are

classification  problems for some people of mixed  marriage  who

may  continue to be registered in whatever race their father  is

despite how many other races they are married into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The connected concern is with newer Singaporeans and PRs.

Many  are  racially similar from China, India or other countries

in  the  region around us.  But we must question if these  newer

immigrants  understand the heritage that Mr  Shriniwas  Rai  has

talked about in moving this motion.  Do they assimilate to  this

multi-racial,   multi-religious,   multi-lingual    belief    in

Singapore?   Do they understand? It is not just our children,  a

newer  generation, these are newer arrivals.  Tensions may arise

between  them  and  us, the older Singaporeans,  and  the  basis

should not be on race, on where we come from, but on citizenship

and where we are going together as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to look forward to the future and now I turn

to  the present.  I have two concerns.  The first is whether  we

should  be thinking about how this economic downturn differently

affects  different races, and the efforts of help to  all  these

people  to  upgrade themselves, whether they are  Chinese  poor,

Malay  poor, Indian poor or other disadvantaged groups,  through

their self-help and education, these efforts should not be wiped

out  in the present downturn. They should be monitored and  this

economic hardship should be evened out and helped along.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>

Otherwise,  as  we  learn again from other  countries,  economic

hardship, if it is uneven, can lead to racial jealousy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other present concern I want to share with the House is

our  efforts as a country, Singapore, to assist other  countries

in  the  region.   I  think we would be  right  to  condemn  the

violence against the Chinese in Indonesia.  But we, as a  nation

and  a  people,  would  be wrong to stop the  condemnation  from

allowing  us  to  help the genuinely poor and  starving  in  the

countries around us.  The victims of famine and violence are not

just Chinese.  There are other races too.  And we should provide

assistance  without regard to race, people to  people,  as  good

neighbours,  as  human beings, because human  rights  are  being

violated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, many of these policies which Government has

put  in  place,  I  understand, and I  think  many  Singaporeans

support.   I  have  tried  to  share  some  of  the  dangers  of

unintended  consequences.  We have a good base  and  I  join  Mr

Shriniwas  Rai in supporting this motion.  It is  a  good  base,

however, and all history is, to build towards a future,  not  to

sit back and take for granted.  The greatest tribute to the past

is  that  we move on from racial tolerance to racial harmony  to

racial  understanding, and perhaps, at least in my  view,  to  a

future of a non-racial Singapore, a society in which race is  no

longer  a  factor to be considered in life, either for merit  or

demerit,  but  a  society in which we are truly individuals  and

truly judged on our merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen

Seow Phun): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Rai and Mdm Claire Chiang

were   touched   by  the  National  Education  Exhibition.   The

historical  events  and lessons depicted by the  Exhibition  had

moved him to move the motion.  I think this is a commendable act

and I agree with him that Singaporeans ought to feel a sense  of

gratitude for the contributions made by our founding fathers and

indeed  our forefathers.  This is the kind of values we want  to

promote in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai is right in saying that every dollar spent is well

spent on the Exhibition.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>

Everyone that I talked to, who has watched it, tells me that  it

was  good.   But  their experiences vary.   Some  of  the  older

Singaporeans  were  so  touched that their  tears  flowed.   The

younger  ones were less so.  Mdm Claire Chiang tried to  explain

why. Although the younger ones equally enjoyed the show and felt

that  the production was good and entertaining, we cannot expect

them to have the same degree of emotions as the older ones.  The

lessons, however, are no less relevant today.  Mdm Claire Chiang

and  Mr  Tay  spoke about the concerns they have.  Let  me  just

respond  to some of these concerns, and after that I would  like

to go on to something which I think is even more important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Tay that we should not take harmony for

granted.   He expressed concerns about some policies,  like  the

Speak  Mandarin campaign, self-help groups, SAP schools, and  so

on.   I  am  glad  to  hear that he realises that  there  is  no

intention  to  look at the policies from the racial  angle.   He

knows  that  the intention for these polices is really  to  help

build  a  stronger  nation.   If he  takes  the  Speak  Mandarin

campaign  as  an example, he would agree that mother  tongue  is

very  important  and  if  we  lose  this  part  of  our  culture

Singaporeans will be less rooted.  He talked about SAP  schools.

Again,  here it is important that we want to promote the  mother

tongue,  and  he  thinks that because of  that,  racial  mix  is

reduced.   But let me remind him that if you go to  our  housing

estates,  if  you participate in our grassroots activities,  you

would  notice that the racial mix is there.  So our children  in

fact  have got many opportunities to mix, interact, and  get  to

know  one another, even to appreciate one another's culture.   I

think  the  elected MPs would know, if you look at the  cultural

functions  and activities that we organise, they are all  multi-cultural, and the different races actually participate and learn

from  each  other's culture.  Even in schools,  I  believe  that

multi-racialism  is  taught  very early  and  the  schools  also

provide the environment to promote interaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the self-help groups, I think he would agree that at

this point in time it is perhaps the best and most effective way

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>

for  Singaporeans to help each other.  Even in self-help groups,

from  my experience, a particular self-help group is not  closed

to  other  races to take part or participate in its  programmes.

But  in order for us to draw the maximum support and involvement

from  Singaporeans, self-help groups are there to  provide  this

most  effective approach.  Therefore, I would say -  although  I

understand his concern about unintended consequences -  that  he

be  rest  assured  that  the  Government,  the  people  and  the

organisations concerned know what they are doing and there is no

question about the importance of multi-racialism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His concern about crisis affecting different races and

whether  it  is  uneven and so on, I think here again  it  is  a

question for the Government and the nation as a whole to  tackle

and  I do not see any imminent problem in this area.  I am  also

glad   to  hear  that  he  talked  about  the  need  to   extend

humanitarian  aid to neighbouring countries regardless  of  what

happened.   If you have followed the news, that is what  we  are

doing.   I have no problem with what he has talked about,  like,

for  instance,  the need for immigrants to assimilate  into  our

society and our culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, to me, to debate Mr Rai's motion, it would be

pertinent  to ask ourselves how our forefathers would  react  to

our  expression of gratitude.  Put yourself in the shoes of  our

forefathers, and if they hear about this debate, how would  they

feel?   If  you  allow me, Sir, I would submit that  they  would

probably have the following response:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My son, we are happy that you feel grateful for what we

have  done  for you.  But we will be even happier if  you  truly

understand  how we have got here today and carry  on  doing  the

right things to protect, preserve and build upon what we,  as  a

nation,  have  achieved thus far.  We had come to  Singapore  in

search  of  a  better life.  Our success did not come  about  by

chance. We had worked very hard and through our sweat and blood,

we had earned a good living for ourselves

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>

and  for  our families.  There were oppositions along  the  way.

There were people, and perhaps they are still around today,  who

wanted to lord it over us.  But we took our destiny into our own

hands.   It was not easy because we are small.  How did we  make

it?   We made it by promoting harmony and unity among ourselves,

by sheer discipline and hard work, and by implementing the right

social  and  economic policies.  But most important of  all,  we

made  it  because we stood up as a sovereign nation, pursuing  a

consistent  foreign policy of mutual respect, mutual cooperation

and  mutual benefit.  As a small state, if we cannot  speak  and

act  as equals among bigger nations, then we will be forever  at

the  mercy  of  others.   Therefore, never,  never  forget  this

crucial  truth.   The day you forget this will be  the  day  you

begin  your downward journey as a nation.  Do not let  Singapore

go  down,  even if we have to lose our lives, or we  will  never

come up again."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our founding fathers had painstakingly built up

Singapore, our homeland, to what it is today.  It behoves us  to

defend, protect and build upon it.  I am taking advantage of  Mr

Rai's  motion  to  remind Singaporeans what our response  should

rightly  be, following this expression of gratitude towards  our

founding fathers.  I think Singaporeans would agree with me that

this  is the best way to say, `thank you'.  I think there is  no

disagreement  here  that  this should  be  our  right  response,

although concerns have been expressed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say a few words in Mandarin in response to Mdm

Chiang's speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Nominated MP Claire Chiang felt that the

lack  of   national consciousness among our younger  people  was

probably due to language problem. Perhaps, in the past,  we  had

not done enough to inculcate in our younger generation knowledge

pertaining  to  national consciousness.  But I  think  the  main

reason  is that the younger generation of Singaporeans have  not

gone through the type of hardship and sufferings experienced  by

our  founding fathers during the war, the difficult lives in the

post-war era, and the struggles in our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>

early  days of nation-building.  Since they have not experienced

such  difficult situations, they naturally would have  different

views,  different mindsets and different feelings.  So we should

go one step further in strengthening the inculcation of national

consciousness in our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with her that in the promotion of racial

harmony,  the  important thing is to have more  interaction  and

communications  among  the  different   ethnic  groups  in   our

society.   This  is  correct.  It is for this  reason  that  our

policies,    whether   in  public  housing   or   in   community

development,  are such that we constantly encourage inter-ethnic

linkage whereby people of all races would live  together in  the

same  housing  estate and in one big community.  Our  activities

are  always  aimed  at  encouraging people of  different  ethnic

groups  to have further understanding and interaction  with  one

another.  Of course, I also agree with her  that we should  have

mutual  tolerance  and accommodation for one another.   This  is

very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the motion before the House today, I feel that apart

from   urging   the   younger  generation   to   recognise   the

contributions  made  by our founding fathers  and  reaffirm  and

record  our appreciation for such contributions, we should  also

think  of how our founding fathers might react to our expression

of  gratitude.  They may say, "Well, we are very  happy  to  see

that  you are showing gratitude but, more importantly, you  must

realize how hard we had fought to bring Singapore to what it  is

today.   As  a small nation, Singapore is very vulnerable.   You

must  work hard to see that we continue to have a place  in  the

global environment."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we remember how our founding fathers had struggled and

endured to bring us to the enviable situation we have today,  we

must not let them down. We must  continue to persevere and carry

on  building on the strong foundation that they have  built  for

us.   I  think this may well be the best form of expressing  our

appreciation for what they have done for us, and indeed the best

way of saying `thank you' to them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I just want to make some

remarks on Mr Simon Tay's comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Vice-Chairman of CDAC, I would like to explain that

a  self-help group like CDAC is not based on racial segregation.

Although our purpose is to serve the Chinese community, students

from  other  racial  groups are allowed to  join  some  selected

programmes.   For instance, our Students' Service Centre  allows

students of other races to participate in our training sessions.

Many  people  probably have the wrong impression that  self-help

groups, based on ethnic communities, could divide our people.  I

think  we  had discussed this when we set up CDAC  at  the  very

beginning.  But from experience we found that the most effective

way  for  a racial group to help themselves is to let themselves

produce and create the momentum so that they realise where their

weaknesses   are,  and  work  out  the  programmes  to   upgrade

themselves.  If each self-help group has done its best,  putting

them  together, it would be able to raise the level of  progress

of  all  groups  in the whole nation, which need  the  necessary

help, to a higher level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at history. When our forefathers came, I think

they  came  as a group.  We have Chinese clans; we  have  Indian

clans.   We have other groups. They probably operated and worked

within  their own group. They have contributed to the growth  of

Singapore  today.   And  if you look at  what  we  have  in  the

commerce  sector, we have the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce,  the

Indian  Chamber of Commerce, the Malay Chamber of  Commerce.   I

was involved in the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for more than 10

years.  I can tell you that if we mix all the traders under  one

roof, it is very difficult to work because sometimes the problem

may  not  be a common problem.  So it is not the most  effective

way to find a solution and to discuss common problems.  But with

these  three  basic  groups and on  top  of  it,  there  is  the

Federation  of Chambers of Commerce for Singapore, which  groups

the three basic groups together, I think that is a good

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>

arrangement.   The  fact that we have three separate  commercial

groups is not a policy of racial segregation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that a beautiful painting is made up of

different colours.  Different races in Singapore, be it Chinese,

Indian, Malay or Eurasians, are different colours.  We paint the

different  colours  on a piece of paper and as  a  painting,  it

looks  beautiful.  If you mix all the colours into one and paint

it  on  a piece of paper, it is one colour.  It will be  a  dull

picture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I expected, when

I  saw this motion, it has turned out to be a song of praise  of

those  who  have been in charge of the affairs of  this  country

since  1959.  The mover of the motion says he was so  moved,  he

got  emotional,  and  so he decided he must  give  vent  to  his

emotion and move this motion in Parliament.  I am glad that  the

two  other  speakers who followed him have brought him  down  to

earth a little bit.  He was floating on cloud nine, as they say,

moved by his emotion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not quite follow who he is referring to as

founding  fathers.  He mentioned a host of names.  Are they  the

founding  fathers of Singapore?  Is that what he says?   Or  are

the  founding fathers the people who turned Singapore from  what

it was a swamp in 1819 when it was first spotted into what it is

today?   So let us be clear as to who we are talking about  when

we talk about our founding fathers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would have thought, listening to the mover, that before

1959,  there  was  no  racial harmony, there  was  no  religious

harmony, the different races were at one another's throats.  Let

me  assure   those who were perhaps not here, in Singapore  that

is,  not even on the planet, in those days there was nothing  of

that  sort.   No  doubt the British had their  divide  and  rule

policy,  but  in  spite of that, the races did  get  along  well

together, and I think Mdm Claire Chiang said that herself  about

growing up in Little India.  So it is not as though it was  only

after  1959 that we have had racial harmony, religious  harmony,

multi-lingualism  and  multi-culturalism.   I  question  whether

those values, those terms, still apply to Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been expressed and this is something that I fear

myself, there is a growing tendency towards compartmentalisation

in  Singapore.  I know the Assistant Director of the CDAC  tried

to  explain  that the CDAC is not just purely Chinese.   But  we

have  the MENDAKI, we have got SINDA, we have got CDAC  and  now

the  Eurasian community thinks it has got to have  its  own  and

they  set up their own.  So the impression is that the different

communities have to look after their own affairs, promote  their

own  growth  in  this place and should not  look  to  the  other

communities, that they themselves are responsible for what  they

are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not going to help, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in

creating a Singapore identity.  We talk about culture.  Yes,  we

have got the Chinese culture, we have got the Indian culture, we

have  got the Malay culture.  But what is the Singapore culture?

Is  there such a thing as the Singapore culture here?  Or is  it

just  making of money, that is Singapore culture?  Have we tried

to  find a synthesis, as someone said in a letter to the papers,

of the various cultures into a unique Singapore culture?  Is any

attempt  being made or are the people who try to write something

creatively slapped down because the authorities think  it  is  a

criticism?   And  how do we maintain religious harmony  in  this

place?  By telling the clerics that they are not to speak on any

issue  concerning society, otherwise they would be  thrown  into

prison.  Is that religious harmony?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine all these platitudes that have been thrown

about.  Is any attempt being made to examine the society  as  it

is today  you will hear some of it when I move my motion  to see

what  kind  of a society we have become?  And there is  a  great

responsibility  on  us now for our children and  our  children's

children.  What are we going to pass to them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is time that we consciously

tried  to  avoid talking about the different races in  Singapore

and made an effort to talk about just Singaporeans.  I have many

a time said that I cannot see the need for showing the different

races, the classification in our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>

identity  cards.  When I am asked to fill up a form,  and  there

are  so many of these forms everywhere, you invariably find  the

box  "race" and I enter the term "Human" because we must realise

that  whether  we are Indians, Chinese, Malays  or  whatnot,  we

belong  in the end to one human race, and that is what  we  are.

And  so  I hope that we will try to create a oneness of all  our

people  to  gather  in  one single purpose  and  not  keep  them

compartmentalised and say to them "you are responsible for  your

own  development" and each community will take care of  its  own

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I proposed at the last sitting of Parliament that we set up

a  Board  of Equal Rights and that was laughed at and dismissed,

"We  don't need it in Singapore."  We do, because if we  believe

that  everyone  is entitled to his right without regard  to  his

race,  religion or what else, then we should have a proper  body

who  will  examine any complaint that he is being discriminated.

That  might  help  in creating the impression  and  sending  the

message to our people that we are truly interested in creating a

one  people  united together, a one people, not  four  different

peoples,  united  together in one common purpose,  not  our  own

separate purposes or our separate courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read, some four or five years ago, that the present

Senior Minister who was then the Prime Minister speaking in  one

of  the cities in Central Asia, said he was presiding over  four

fish tanks and there were different fishes swimming in different

tanks,  and  he  has got to see that they were kept  separately.

Let  us  try  and  get all the fish into one tank  and  live  in

Singapore as a single one people with one purpose, one  aim  and

make an attempt to evolve a Singapore culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just

like to join in this debate hoping that I could clarify some  of

the  confusion that happened during the discussion.  As  to  who

our  founding  fathers are, I think we should  be  referring  to

those  who  have  planted  the seeds of multi-racialism,  multi-culturalism and racial harmony.  The Malays were here.  They had

the island to themselves.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>

Chinese  came here to escape famine.  The Indians came  here  to

work.   The  British segregated us and so did the Japanese.   It

was  our first generation leaders who took the decision  to  put

all  these  together  and established as  a  principle  of  this

nation,  multi-culturalism, multi-racialism and racial  harmony.

These  are  the people we should thank for and be  grateful  for

what we have today.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to

several  Members who have spoken.  I am a bit surprised with  Mr

Jeyaretnam's  stand.   I thought that this  was  a  very  civil,

courteous act.  We will not get involved in party politics,  but

he must get involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I want to take him to pre-1959 and I will take the

historical process.  I have read the Hansard before  coming.   I

have done my homework.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How much of the Hansard have you read?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> It does not matter, Mr Jeyaretnam. Let

us talk history.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, when Mr David Marshall formed an elected

government,  he  felt  that the Chinese and  Malay  schools  had

suffered  deprivation.  English was the supreme  language,   and

this disadvantaged more than three-quarters of our people.   The

frustration  of  the  Chinese students,  the  Tamil  and  Malay-speaking  students  could not be expressed by  those  who  spoke

English, and there was an All-Party Committee of Inquiry.  Prior

to 1959, you had no right of audience in this House if you spoke

a  language  other  than English.  The rules of  the  game  were

changed, and that is what I call multi-lingualism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak with some fervour, Sir, because I took some risks.

In  1986,  my  Hindi  community wanted Hindi to  be  recognised.

Prior  to that, the then Prime Minister said, "No.  If  you  are

an  Indian, you study Tamil."  We formed a protem committee.  We

convinced the Government that our Indian students from non-Tamil

background were losing culturally.  So Government allowed  Hindi

and other Indian languages.  And nowhere

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>

in  the  world such a minority community was given  equal  right

with  Mandarin  and  Malay.   Is that  not  equality  in  multi-lingualism?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised, again another aspersion by Mr Jeyaretnam

on  self-help groups.  As Dr Ker has mentioned, if Mr Jeyaretnam

was  aware, he would not have made this allegation.   I  confess

that  I am not in favour of a communal set up, but there  is  no

other  alternative at the moment.  I am the Secretary  of  SINDA

and I declare my interest.  As Dr Ker has pointed out, SINDA and

CDAC are working together and eventually I hope, not 10-15 years

but maybe 50 years from now, we can disband these bodies and  we

can all have a national organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may laugh, but these are the realities of Singapore

politics.   I  give you an example.  We have Malay and  Eurasian

students  in SINDA.  We have non-Indian teachers teaching  these

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I have told the Prime Minister several times

that  all  the four umbrella organisations should work together.

We are moving in this direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on SAP schools, I share some of the sentiments

expressed  by my colleague, Mr Simon Tay.  There is this  danger

which  we  will have to address.  SAP school students will  grow

up,  their best part of their life, isolated without having  the

benefit  of mixing with the other communities.  Of course,  they

play on the playing field and in surrounding areas.  But in  the

school,  they  are left by themselves.  My good friend,  Zainul,

was  together with me in the University.  We used  to  speak  in

bazaar Malay.  We could exchange views even though we came  from

different  backgrounds because we came from schools  which  have

multi-racial students.  My fear is that the SAP school  students

will  be  isolated.  We must try to take some steps  to  correct

this imbalance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have spoken. What is Singapore

culture?   Singapore culture is not massing together  into  one,

but each culture blossoms, taking into cognizance that there are

different values,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>

different  cultures, different languages and different religious

backgrounds.  We cannot force one culture on the other,  but  we

can  co-exist.  And we hope in years to come, we  can  create  a

Singapore  culture.  Nowhere in the world is there a mixture  of

so  many races and languages and coming out with one.  Even  the

Americans  have  tried it.  They are still  trying  it.   It  is

years,  decades,  centuries.  So  we  have  to  live  with  this

reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are a different community. We must not

just  tolerate,  as  I  said earlier,  we  must  appreciate  and

understand and take positive steps to inculcate in our youth the

value  of respect and understanding.   And that is why  I  think

the  Government did a wise thing because nowhere do we have  one

community living in segregation.  I think it was a very wise and

bold  decision.  I think it was Mr Dhanabalan who  initiated  it

and we should live by it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been a long day. I have

many things to say but I do not want to hold up the Members.   I

would  ask this House that this is an act of civility.   Let  us

vote  unanimously on this resolution and show our  appreciation.

And as Dr Chen has pointed out, the best tribute we could pay to

them  is to live and improve upon them.  The British never  came

here  to give us multi-racialism.  They came and they were  very

honest.   They  came here as a trading company, the  East  India

Company.  It was only in 1955 we started moving.  That was why I

made  it very clear.  I have clarified who were our forefathers.

As  regards our founding fathers, I refer to post-1955.   If  Mr

Jeyaretnam  remembers, I mentioned Mr David Marshall because  he

was a true son of Singapore.  I am proud of him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the House to support the motion?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House records with gratitude the contribution

made  by our founding fathers in building a multi-racial, multi-religious   and   multi-lingual  society  and  reaffirms   these

principles.

<br>6.38 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to signification

of  support  by at least one Member.  Does the motion  have  the

support of any other hon. Member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I support, Sir.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House resolves that it is time to remove fear in

the  people's  lives and to this end calls upon the  Government:

(i)  to  abolish all detentions without trial and (ii) to remove

all   forms  of  coercion  of  the  people  not  authorised   by

Parliament.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion coming after the last motion, which must

have filled Members with self-satisfaction, must come almost  as

a  sort of treasonable activity on my part.  And I have no doubt

that  the  faithful  press  under the  baton  of  an  ex-Cabinet

Minister  will  tell  its captive readers in Singapore  tomorrow

that  whilst the country was worried about its economic  worries

and  anxious  about its future, there is this  man,  Jeyaretnam,

still  bringing up old bogeys.  I am used to all this, but  that

does  not deter me from moving what I think is right and calling

this House to face the realities of Singapore today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no question that fear

grips  our people's lives in Singapore and I will, in the course

of  my speech, show you where and how it is found.  And there is

no question that fear is a paralysis.  It numbs you.  Fear numbs

a  person into inaction.  If you are suddenly struck with  fear,

you  cannot  even think.  So fear is a paralysis that  paralyses

your thinking capacities.  It paralyses your capability to do or

act  and that, I am sure, Members will agree is no basis  for  a

society,  especially for a society to go into the 21st  century.

As  I  said,  whilst   this  motion  may  be  thought  as  being

irrelevant in view of today's present worries in Singapore,  the

main  reason  why  I  am moving this motion is  because  of  the

economic crisis.  Let that be understood.  It has been said more

than once

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>

that  the  troubles in this region stem, if not  wholly,  partly

from the lack of transparency and accountability on the part  of

the  Government in the decision making process, and  in  denying

people  of their rights to take part in decision making  and  to

question decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of economic measures have been proposed. They are

not  all that wonderful but, be that as it may, nothing has been

said  about what the Government proposes to do about this  other

cause of our recession, lack of transparency and accountability.

And  so  I  am  proposing this motion that we take  measures  to

correct  that, not just economic measures, and this  is  a  more

important measure that we have to take, if we want to  see  that

this country progresses economically in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the fear? What are the people afraid of? First of

all, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a fear of being locked up.

I  will tell you why and how it operates, but may I just,  first

of  all, outline what is the fear in the people's lives.  I hear

this everywhere; the fear of the knock on their door at 2.00 am,

the  fear of being driven blind-folded and thrown into a  prison

cell  without any recourse to the courts.  That is a real  fear,

and we just cannot ignore it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the other fear? The fear for their rice bowl, the

fear that should they in some way or other incur the displeasure

of  the Government or the powers that be, their rice bowl may be

broken  or cracked.  Employees are worried that their employment

may  be  terminated if they should show themselves to be partial

towards  any  opposition party, or working  with  an  opposition

party.   Businesses are worried or anxious that they should  not

be seen as helping in any way any opposition party, otherwise in

some  way  or other, their business will be affected, and  there

are  many  ways in which the Government can make its displeasure

known, and I will outline to you how it is done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, over the years, from

1959,  we have built up a system of patronage where anything  is

dependent on whether one conforms to what our rulers tell us  is

good for us.  It is a society which is always looking to see

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>

what  its patron thinks about its actions and, in Singapore,  of

course,  the patron is the PAP or, should I say, the  Godfather.

You incur their displeasure and you suffer.  You do that at your

risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this fear seen? Where is it manifested? You see

it, first of all, if I may refer to my colleagues at the Bar, in

the  lawyers'  reluctance to act for opposition candidates,  and

even  in non-commercial suits against the  Government.  This  is

not something fanciful.  This is real.  The courts were told  of

the difficulties that Mr Tang Liang Hong had in getting a lawyer

to represent him.  He swore an affidavit in court saying that he

had  approached  no less than eight lawyers and  who,  for  some

reason or other, declined his brief, and so he had to bring in a

counsel from England to represent him.  There was his wife,  Mdm

Teo  Siew Har.  I myself, Sir, approached two senior lawyers  in

Singapore to ask whether they would take up her matter and  they

said,  "Mr Jeyaretnam, please, you know, we would have, in other

cases, but I do not think we can in this case.  Our partners may

not  like it.  So, if you do not mind, we won't."  So she  could

not  get  a  lawyer.   Even if you go to a lawyer  with  a  suit

against  the  Government, which has nothing to do with  commerce

or  for  damages arising from a traffic accident,  but  a  claim

because  of  some injustice done, lawyers invariably  refuse  to

accept  the  brief.  I have to tell you again,  through  my  own

experience, people come to me and say, "Mr Jeyaretnam,  we  have

been to other lawyers.  They do not want to take up the case."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the reluctance of printers to print for

opposition  parties. We experienced this in the  last  election.

It  is not that they are worried about being thrown into prison,

neither  are  the  lawyers.  They are  all  worried  that  their

businesses will suffer.  As in the case of lawyers and printers,

they  depend perhaps on getting work from the statutory  boards,

the  Government  and  from  other  financial  institutions,  big

companies.  So  they are worried that their  businesses  may  be

affected.  Printers refuse to print posters

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>

or, even if they are prepared to agree, they would ask, "Can  we

leave our name out of the posters?  We would rather not have our

name  on  the  posters?"  Why?  "Because we have got  Government

contracts.   We cannot lose our business."  Then  there  is  the

fear  or  the reluctance of owners of premises, be it  shops  or

houses,  to allow opposition parties any use of their  premises.

Again, I will give you an experience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last election, I decided that I would go into Ang

Mo  Kio  to meet the residents there every week.  When  I  first

went there, there was a shopkeeper who was quite willing to  let

me  have a little space there to sit down, only once a week  for

about  two  hours or so, and to see anyone who came to  see  me.

But  within two weeks he said, "Mr Jeyaretnam, I am  sorry."   I

said, "Why?"  He said, "HDB has sent me a letter saying how dare

I  let out my shop premises.  I cannot let it out."  He had  not

let  it  out to me.  I was only occupying a space.  But what  is

the  good of me trying to argue with him that he had not let  it

out.   He  said,  "Please, Mr Jeyaretnam, try and  find  another

place."  That's it.  That is real in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the reluctance of Singaporeans to offer

themselves  as  candidates  for  opposition  parties.   I   have

mentioned  this time and time again.  In the last  election,  we

had  three candidates who were very good quality.  I do not want

to  mention their names but who, in the last minute, came to  me

and  said,  "My  wife  is very worried  and  very  anxious.   My

children are worried.  My brothers are worried.  I cannot.  They

say  I  am  mad  or something, offering myself as an  opposition

candidate."  That is what they told me.  So I said, "All  right,

if  that is what it is, stay out."  So are we going to build  up

an  opposition in Singapore when our citizens live in fear?   An

opposition,  of  course, is the sine qua  non  of  a  democratic

society where different views may be expressed and heard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the reluctance among our people to express

any  opinion in public.  This is because of the threat of  being

picked up at 2.00 am and thrown into

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>

prison.  They  look around even when they talk  to  you  to  see

whether any officer from the ISD is around.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fear of voting for the opposition, even

to  cast  their  vote.  This fear stems from the fact  that  the

serial  number  on the Register of Electors is  entered  on  the

counterfoil.  The 1966 Constitutional Commission drew  attention

to  this and said that it was a violation of the secrecy of  the

ballot  and  they  said  that should be removed.   But  did  the

Government remove it?  No.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fear among civil servants to talk to or

see  opposition parties, and particularly their leaders.  Again,

may  I  quote from experience?  In 1982, when I was the  MP  for

Anson, we had a problem about getting office space for me to see

the  residents.  So we wrote to HDB and in the end I was getting

a bit tired of the correspondence and I said, "I wish to see the

Chairman."  There was no direct answer to this.  Then I happened

to  meet  the  Chairman at a private party.   I  had  known  the

Chairman  even  before I became an MP.  We were friends.   So  I

asked him, "Have you seen this correspondence?" I think he  said

he was not very much aware of what was going on.  I said, "May I

come  and  see  you?"  I could see suddenly that  he  was  taken

aback.   He  said, "Well, I have to find out whether I  can  see

you."  Then I never heard from him after that.  And this is  the

Chairman of the Housing and Development Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this fear kept in place and maintained? Mainly by

the  threat  of  prison.   Because there is this  power  in  the

Government  to  pick people up and cast them into  prison,   and

without any recourse to the courts.  May I say in 1988 or  1989,

suddenly  the  courts  decided, following the  trends  in  other

countries,  that they had the power to inquire into the  merits,

and  this was the judgement of the Court of Appeal.  Fast on the

heels of that judgement came the amendment to the legislation  - the  courts shall not inquire into the merits; it is  not  their

business.  And yet the courts in other countries do inquire into

the  merits of any detention, any imprisonment.  So the position

in Singapore today is that somebody who is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>

detained  under  the Internal Security Act, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,

Sir,  has  no  legal redress.  He is dependent entirely  on  the

mercy of the Government.  He may be released if he confesses  to

having  been a bad fellow.  But if he does not want to  confess,

he stays.  And we have a classic example in Mr Chia Thye Poh who

spent  23 years in prison, a man who belonged to the same party,

who shared the same ideals as the founding fathers.  But because

after  some  years  he decided that he could  not  accept  their

ideals and wanted to move away, he was picked up and imprisoned.

This power is used not for the purpose that it was intended  for

but  for purely other purposes - just to ensure that the PAP  is

kept in power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most glaring example is the detention in 1987. Time

does  not  permit me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to go through  all  the

persons who were detained and the reasons given.  But there  was

the  case of one Miss Teo Soh Lung.  And what was the reason for

her  detention?   The  reason was that she had  facilitated  the

infiltration  of  the  Workers' Party in  1984  by  a  group  of

Marxists  after discussion with one Paul Lim Wah Chye,  Tan  Wah

Piow,  fellow  Marxists  and  other  activists.   She  had  also

actively  assisted  them in their efforts to  make  use  of  the

Workers' Party as a vehicle to further the Marxist's cause.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was a fairy tale

improvisation, this was it.  All that Miss Teo Soh Lung did  was

to  help  out  a little in our election campaign in  1984.   She

decided  as  a  citizen that she should help a  candidate  in  a

constituency.  She was not a member of the Party but  called  to

help,  bring  about a better Singapore by trying to  provide  an

alternative voice in Singapore, and that is why she  was  picked

up.   And  then  the Government built up this  huge  edifice  of

Marxist conspiracy, to infiltrate the Workers' Party - honestly,

it  is a lot of nonsense, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.  I was in  the

Workers'  Party  and I was then the leader.   But  that  is  the

allegation against her.  When she appeared before the  Committee

of  Privileges  of  this House, because she  had  called  for  a

resolution  among  the  members of  the  Bar  to  criticise  the

restriction in the Newspaper and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>

Printing  Presses  Bill  that  was  then  introduced,  she   was

questioned by the Committee of Privileges on all these.  She was

told  that she could not continue to be a member of the Workers'

Party,  which she was not, and also a member of the  Council  of

the Law Society.  Again one of the grounds was that she made use

of  the  Law  Society.   So that is why she  was  detained,  not

because  she  was  organising  groups  to  commit  violence   in

Singapore,  not  organising, going round urging  people  to  arm

themselves  to  attack the Government, but  simply  because  she

helped  in the election efforts of a registered political  party

and  was also trying to promote concern among the lawyers of the

restriction on foreign papers circulating in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that shows you the hollowness of the power that was used

under  the Internal Security Act to detain her.  It had no basis

at   all.   Then  you  have  got  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions)  Act,  and that gives the Government  the  power  to

detain  persons for one year at a time.  Under this Act,  it  is

aimed  at persons who are alleged to be associated with criminal

activities  and who apparently cannot be brought to trial.   One

man, who was a trade unionist himself, was charged in the courts

with  conspiracy to cause hurt to Mr Phey Yew Kok who is now  in

hiding  somewhere.  He was acquitted.  The court threw the  case

out saying that there was not a shred of evidence at the end  of

the  prosecution's case.  What happened to the man?  Immediately

after the acquittal, he was arrested and he spent about 10 years

in prison.  So much for the Rule of Law in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fear maintained or applied through the

provision  of housing.  Housing has become a political  tool  in

Singapore.  You have got to be on your good behaviour, otherwise

you  may not get your house or you may stand in danger of losing

it.  There was an instance of a couple some years ago, where the

wife refused to undergo sterilisation after the second child was

born.   They decided that their religion forbade them, and  they

persistently refused.  This was at the time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>

when  the  Government was promoting the two-child  policy  which

they  later  threw out realising that they had made  a  grievous

mistake.   This couple kept refusing.  One fine day  they  found

themselves served with a notice, giving them seven days  to  get

out of their HDB apartment - I think they were paying rent - and

they  refused to move.  Then a summons was issued requiring them

to  appear in court for an application on the part of the HDB to

repossess  the  apartment.  But after a defence  was  filed  and

after  some  time, they probably thought better of  it  and  the

summons was withdrawn.  That was when the HDB still had to go to

court.   But  now  the HDB does not have to go to  court  if  it

wishes  to  repossess.  I think it is section 58 of the  Housing

and Development Act where an occupier, whether he be a tenant or

a  lessee, can be dispossessed for a number of reasons.  The HDB

can retake the property and it does not have to apply to court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what protection does a houseowner have? And the PAP

boasts that Singapore is a society of houseowners.  The HDB acts

as  the  accuser;  it  acts as the judge; and  it  acts  as  the

executioner.    It   decides  whether  the  person   should   be

dispossessed and then he is told he can appeal to HDB and  again

to  the  Minister,  and that is final.  And  if  the  appeal  is

rejected,  he has to go.  And if he does not go, the  tenant  or

occupier  would be forcibly thrown out.  So is there any  wonder

that  people live in fear?  The uppermost question is,  "Are  we

doing  anything that might offend our rulers, our benign  rulers

in this country?  Are we conforming to all they want?  Or are we

showing signs of being independent ourselves?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the method of Ministers rapping people over

their  knuckles if they should so much as express  criticism  in

the papers or speak.  There was the case of a writer who wrote a

feature  article  in  the Straits Times weekly.   Suddenly,  she

found  herself  rapped  by the Prime Minister  because  she  had

written  about the disaffection between the PAP and the  people.

And she was told off in no uncertain terms, "If you want to take

us on, go into politics, otherwise shut up.".  After that, there

was no more article from her in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>

Straits Times.  And, of course, the bosses at Times House  would

not dare to print anything more after that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the recent example of the Prime Minister

criticising  the  businessmen  who  criticised  the   off-Budget

measures.   So  there  you have it.  You  are  not  supposed  to

criticise  the Government where it hurts.  You can  always  sing

the praises of the Government but you cannot criticise them.  If

you criticise them, you take the consequences, and you know what

the  consequences  are.  You can be locked  up.   Your  business

might suffer.  You may lose your house.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the other technique, if I may call it "technique", is

through the powers given to the income tax authorities.  Mdm Teo

Siew  Har,  the wife of Mr Tang Liang Hong, was going across  to

Johor,  not  running away, but she was suddenly stopped  at  the

Woodlands Checkpoint and her passport was unlawfully taken  away

from  her.   And this was apparently on the direction  from  the

income  tax  authorities.  There was  nothing,  as  I  told  the

Minister when I questioned him on this last year, in the  Income

Tax Act which gave the Commissioner power to stop anyone leaving

Singapore  unless that person owed income tax to the Government.

But  Mdm  Teo Siew Har was not paying any tax, she did  not  owe

anything.  So there are these fears.  People know about  it  and

it  is  no  good  pretending that these fears do  not  exist  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I briefly run through the law. This power of detention,

which  is now found in the Internal Security Act (ISA), had  its

origin in the Emergency Regulations.  That was introduced by the

British  at  a time when there was a real threat.  There  was  a

threat  of  communist subversion.  But it  was  intended  to  be

purely a temporary measure, only for three months at that  time,

and the Assembly had to ratify it.  I shall later, when I reply,

read  to you something about what the Leader of the PAP was then

saying about all these Regulations and the power, because  I  do

not have the time now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Marshall's government took over, Mr Marshall

realised what a drastic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>

power it was, that violated all rules of natural justice but  he

also  realised  that there was a need and he set  up  an  Appeal

Court.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, some of the points you

are making, you are tediously repeating yourself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am now looking at the law, Mr Deputy

Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Come to the point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am looking at the law, not the instances

of how it is applied.  I am going to tell you about the law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right, carry on. Make it short.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But when the PAP took over, three months

after it took over, they swept aside the Appeal Tribunal because

the  Appeal  Tribunal had the power to release  anyone  detained

under that power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am spelling out what the law is

and  I was not talking about the law until now.  Section 8  says

"acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore."

That  is as vague and nebulous as you can get.  It has been used

as  though  it  was meant to be read as "acting  in  any  manner

prejudicial to the People's Action Party.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then under section 74, the Police have the power to detain

anyone  under  that Act for 28 days.  No one  disputes  that  in

times of national emergency, in times of threats to the country,

drastic  powers may be necessary.  But the Constitution provides

for  that situation and it is in Part XII, Articles 149 to  151.

It  says that if Parliament is satisfied that there is a threat,

that there is real danger to the country, then it may enact laws

to  detain  persons.   But  that, again,  is  temporary,  to  be

reviewed  every three months and to be repealed as soon  as  the

threat passes over.  So you got it under the Constitution.   You

do  not have to have it as a permanent section of the law in the

statute book.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a moot point whether this power contained in section

8 is ultra vires the Constitution, taking into consideration

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>

Articles  149  to 151.  I know that the Government  amended  the

Constitution  to exempt the ISA.  But it is still a  moot  point

whether  this power is ultra vires the Constitution.   Then  you

have  got  the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act  which  I

have been talking about.  It was intended to be temporary.   But

the  PAP  Government gave it life for 34 years after  they  took

over  and then extended it in 1989 and 1994 for five years at  a

time,  and so it will expire next year, and I have no  doubt  it

will  be  extended again.  That was intended to  deal  with  the

secret  society menace.  But now it has become permanent and  is

used very effectively against persons, persons who are picked up

by  the Police are threatened that if they did not admit to what

they  are  suspected of, they can be detained under section  30.

Do  you  want that?  You get an idea of how effective it  is  to

keep  people in fear and suppress them.  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I  do  not  know whether I have got many more minutes  left  but

before I

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think I have given you too much time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have I passed my one hour because I have

got some questions.  May I put the questions before I sit down?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Quickly put your questions then.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I

would like the Minister replying to answer these questions and I

hope  some  attempt  is  made to grapple  seriously  with  these

questions and not just dismiss them.  My first question is:   is

there  any evidence that there are groups in Singapore  plotting

an organised sabotage of our society that requires Government to

retain  this  power?   The  second question  is:  is  there  any

evidence  of  preparation for terrorist activities?   The  third

question is: why is the law of the land inadequate to deal  with

activities  threatening harmony and peace in  the  society?   We

have got the laws.  So why do we need these arbitrary detentions

by  the Government?  And the final question is:  as a matter  of

policy, will the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>

Government  announce immediately if anyone is  picked  up  under

section 74 of the Act by the Police, giving the reasons why  the

person  has been picked up and revealing his identity?   Because

all this is done in secrecy.  The people are left in the dark as

to  how  many persons have been picked up under section  74  and

then  released  before  the 28 days are up,  because  they  have

signed  the  bond or agreed to be good men and women, conforming

to everything that the Government has to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I just say that this is no

basis for a society which professes itself to be democratic.  It

is  a  hollow claim that we are a democratic society founded  on

the  principles  of  justice and founded on  the  principles  of

freedom when our people live under all this real fear.  It is  a

hollow claim and I think it is time that we decided to be honest

with ourselves and remove the fear from our people's lives.   We

can  then  go into the 21st century as a proud people, a  people

who  are not afraid, a people who know what their rights are,  a

people  who  know  that  they will not be deprived  of  anything

except  under  the Rule of Law, ie, they would  be  tried  by  a

competent court and convicted before they are put into prison or

deprived  of  their goods or property or punished  in  any  way.

Then we can be a proud society.  But if we continue as we are, I

do  not see how we can be a proud society.  I do not see how  we

can   progress   economically  with  our   people   denied   any

participation in the decision making process of our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like to respond to Mr J B Jeyaretnam because I believe it is not

that  there  is  fear  in people's lives  in  Singapore,  as  Mr

Jeyaretnam puts it, although there is indeed a fear amongst many

Singaporeans  to  speak their mind.  There is a perception  that

public  criticism of official policies is not welcomed,  brought

about by a legacy of the past.  However, this is not necessarily

an indication of things to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent introduction of more and wider channels of

communication and a more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>

open  attitude  towards  public  participation  gives  hope  and

justifies  a  more  optimistic  attitude  in  the  future.   For

example, Government's suspicion towards civil groups may  be  an

understandable  legacy  of the past when pro-Communist  elements

took guise of various societies, but this attitude has to change

for the future of civil society.  Therefore, we must be clear as

to  what kind of fear that prevails in our society.  Fear exists

in  so  far  as  the  public  perceives  the  Government  to  be

constantly  on  the  look out for dissenters  and  also  out  of

respect  for  our  preventive detention laws.   This  perception

could also be due to the existence of red tapes covering a  wide

range  of  registration and licensing laws  on  registration  of

societies,  organisation of public meetings and  publication  of

newsletters  - that tend to discourage citizens' initiative  and

do  little  to demonstrate the increasing tolerance of differing

opinions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in most cases fear is exaggerated.

Singaporeans tend to exaggerate the harm that will come to  them

if   they   voice  critical  views.   However,   it   is   quite

understandable  and natural for Singaporeans  to  get  a  little

paranoid.  This is because the Government, to my knowledge,  has

never  told Singaporeans unconditionally that they have  nothing

to   fear  when  speaking  out.   Yes,  there  have  been   many

invitations extended to Singaporeans to express their views, but

these  are usually conditional.  Singaporeans are told to  speak

freely  as long as they are constructive and respectful  of  our

leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem, on the surface, to be quite a reasonable

condition  but,  in  fact, it places an onerous  burden  on  the

ordinary   citizens.    Who   decides   whether   criticism   is

constructive or respectful?  It is only the citizen himself  who

knows  his  own  motives.  But we must be very  careful  not  to

attribute  these  fears  simply on  historical  occurrences,  on

Government  or  on  politics.  Fear, in this  case,  is  also  a

cultural  phenomenon.  Fear, in Singapore, is  instilled  early,

from  when a child goes to school and taught that failure brings

shame on himself and his family, that an academic performance is

the hallmark of excellence and his worth is judged mainly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>

by  his  examination results.  Ask any school  teacher  or  even

bosses  in  commercial practice on how difficult it  is  to  get

people  to  speak up, especially when it is against  established

norms  and practices.  Even participants and members of feedback

groups that were formed under the Feedback Unit, of which I am a

member,  had  initially expressed fears about  expressing  their

views  despite  the  fact that these channels  were  established

simply  for that reason - to gather honest and considered  views

from a wide cross-section of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these participants are themselves very surprised by

the  absence  of  any  form of restriction  or  censorship  when

presenting  their  views  on  politics  and  media.   Some  were

pleasantly  surprised that their recommendations were  presented

in this case to the Chairman of the Singapore 21 Committee.  Let

me  highlight  a  few of these suggestions to  demonstrate  that

carefully  considered views of non-partisan citizens  have  been

given its attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) For example, parliamentary reform. Mr J B Jeyaretnam

may be pleased to know of suggestions to increase the number  of

NCMPs  or Opposition Members in Parliament to form at least  10%

of the total number of MPs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Press freedom to allow more and alternative views to

flourish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Balanced reporting of Parliamentary debates to

highlight alternative views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) A more open political climate and the need to change

the  Government mindset to allow expressions of political  views

without fear of being chastised for meddling in politics.

These  are  very  serious  but  carefully  considered  views  of

ordinary  citizens.  I must say that many of  the  members  were

pleasantly  surprised that while their views may  be  considered

radical  and  brave, it was received without the  robustness  of

response that in the past some may have come to expect.  To  me,

this  represents  a  significant  development  in  creating   an

environment where freedom of expression can thrive even when the

views do not represent the accepted norms of the day.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is important now is to spread the message and

confidence among all Singaporeans that there exist in  Singapore

opportunities   where  ordinary  citizens  can  participate   in

decision making without fear or reprisals.  Therefore, the long-term  solution  to  this climate of fear is  to  re-educate  our

people and to allow them to realise that it is all right not  to

conform,  that  their pecuniary interests  and  those  of  their

family members are not affected by their actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elimination of fear factor is overall a good thing

since  a  creative and vibrant, not to mention  competitive  and

innovative,  society  can only thrive in  an  environment  where

mistakes  are forgiven and non-conformity tolerated  generously.

It  also  requires  the Government to change their  mindset  and

paradigms,  because what  might otherwise be  negative  energies

can  be  harnessed for the good of society in general.  This  is

especially  important in view of the fact that  time  and  again

when issues of freedom of expression surfaced, the Catherine Lim

affair would not be far from the minds of most Singaporeans.  Mr

J B Jeyaretnam referred to her in his speech.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, nothing really happened to Catherine Lim after

she  wrote  her two political commentaries.  She was not  locked

up, sued, fined or anything like that.  All she got was a verbal

response  and a challenge for her to join politics if  she  felt

strongly against the Government.  While some may think that this

was   a  reasonable  response,  others,  especially  the  better

educated, still refer to the Catherine Lim affair as an  example

of Government's intolerance to criticism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Lim is an accomplished professional writer. If

even  her words and motives can be misconstrued, then what  hope

do  other  Singaporeans have of getting their points across?   I

think  this is what alarms Singaporeans.  You have to be careful

in  what you say, should you not be misunderstood.  Singaporeans

fear the risk of getting a disproportionate response.  It is not

surprising  therefore  that some Singaporeans  feel  fearful  to

speak out.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact remains that it takes courage, bravery and an

element of thick-skinned stubbornness to stand up and be counted

for  one's  views,  especially when they are at  odds  with  the

general  norms  of society.  It is for society  as  a  whole  to

attach  a  positive  value to someone speaking  his  conscience,

because  what is worse is to have Singaporeans who  are  passive

and  disinterested.  It is also for the man himself to be  ready

to  receive  and accept criticisms and rebuttals on views  which

are  made  public so long as they do not develop  into  personal

attacks and vendettas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to remove the perception would reinforce the

thinking   that  opposition  and  disagreement   do   not   pay.

Overwhelmingly,  the  economic  animal  in  the  Singaporean  is

encouraged  and his rational side tells him that politics  is  a

dirty  game  and we should not meddle in it, just in  case.   We

need  to remove this perception.  I am, however, confident  that

given  time,  as more people become familiar and be involved  in

the  existing channels, many of the perceptions that we now have

will  slowly  disappear.  If developments in the  past  are  any

indication   of   the   future,  we  can   look   forward   more

optimistically and assure ourselves that freedom  of  expression

is alive and kicking in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to Mr J B Jeyaretnam's suggestion to abolish

all  detentions  without trial.  I suppose in an  ideal  society

without   threats  of  racial  and  religious   chauvinism   and

extremism,   intimidation,  rumour  mongering  and   underground

clandestine  operations, there will be no need for the  Internal

Security  Act  (ISA).  I for one, however, feel that  our  young

multi-racial  society,  having  just  got  out  of  racial   and

Communist threats, cannot take the attitude that these  problems

which  have  necessitated the introduction of ISA in  the  first

place are now completely behind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have relative peace and freedom from some

of these extremist problems makes it all the more important that

ISA  should  be retained.  Clearly, one can argue  that  ISA  is

indeed extreme, but we should take comfort that it is needed to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>

be used against extremists and under extreme circumstances.  The

ISA is not meant to be  used to restrict political opposition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to suggest that we consider

amendments that would allow for greater accessibility and checks

and balances to have a more transparent judicial scrutiny and to

make  the Executive more accountable for their actions.  Perhaps

we   should  consider  removing  the  fetter  of  the   judicial

interpretation imposed in Article 149(3) of the Constitution and

sections 8(a) and 8(b) of the ISA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the combined effects of these provisions fix

the  law of judicial reviews of executive detention to 13th July

1971,  which is the date of the decision in the case of Lee  Mau

Seng  v  Minister for Home Affairs was rendered.  In that  case,

the  High Court held that the test to be used in determining the

legality of the decision to detain was a subjective one and  not

an  objective test.  That is, the courts cannot ask or  question

the  basis,  grounds  and allegations for  the  detention  of  a

person.  This has effectively overruled the earlier decision  of

the Court of Appeal to have an objective test as in the case  of

countries like UK, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest that we review Article 151(4) of the

Constitution  to  provide a tribunal to review detentions  under

the  ISA  be made up of High Court Judges who enjoy security  of

tenure  and remuneration.  This will ensure the greatest  degree

of impartiality possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the ISA is no doubt extreme, but it

has  served  us  well  in  dealing with extremists  and  extreme

circumstances.   The ISA today is still relevant  and  necessary

for peace and stability of our society.  And for that, Sir, I do

not support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, given the time, I

shall try and give my comments as briefly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried my best to listen carefully to both the NCMP who

moved the motion and to the speaker before me, NMP Mr Zulkifli.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>

But  I  want to differ from some of their comments.  I am not  a

member  of  any political party, neither the PAP nor opposition.

I  wish instead to focus my comments about ordinary citizens and

civil  society in Singapore and then about preventive  detention

which  I  teach as part of constitutional law in the Faculty  of

Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we citizens fear? If so, why? Conversely, should the

Government on behalf of the nation fear and, if so, why?   Those

are  the  central questions I come to.  And in addressing  these

questions, let me differ also from the NCMP, in focusing not  so

much on the past, but on the present day and perhaps some of the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is true that some citizens do not speak up or

participate,  or  do not speak up much or participate  much.   I

think  it  is  also  true, in today's Singapore,  that  this  is

changing.   Polls have consistently shown that more Singaporeans

want a say in the policies of the country and this is especially

true of younger Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth conference in the early 1990s was quoted in the

papers  as saying that the participants feared speaking  up  and

therefore had no ideas.  Today, youth conferences give frank and

often  well-thought  through proposals, in detail,  in  writing.

This  has  been my experience in working with the  Singapore  21

Committee,  of which I am a member (although I do not  represent

their views here).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, fear is a very big word and the preventive

detention  laws do not sufficiently explain why Singaporeans  do

not  participate more, or more Singaporeans do not  participate.

Because  the  polls that showed the people want  to  participate

more also showed that Singaporeans trust the Government and they

expect the Government to solve their problems for them.  That is

also clear.  These two things are not contradictory.  Rather the

trust of people means that people expect the Government to think

and  do everything for them.  In some ways, there is the culture

of  over-dependence combined with the culture of  complaint,  to

sit  back  and  complain.   This  breeds  a  certain  tidak  apa

attitude.  Singaporeans expect others to do something for  them,

the Government to do something for them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is also true, however, there is something that I

have learnt to call the "black book" factor.  That people do not

speak  up, not so much because they fear detention or jail,  but

because  of smaller concerns, about not being in someone's  good

books,  in  being  in  a "black book".  It  is  true  that  non-politicians  who  have spoken up have faced very  strong  robust

responses.  As Mr Zulkifli Baharudin has said before  me,  there

is  no  promise  today that we have a free for  all.   So  today

people  who  speak up risk being seen as engaging  in  politics,

they risk being publicly scolded.  I think this should change in

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to move towards consultation which we have seen,

and from there, to a greater sense of participation.  We need to

build  up Singapore's heartware, we need to build up Singapore's

civil  society.  This is the utility of freeing people from  the

"black   book"  syndrome  and  encouraging  their   speech   and

participation,  to  give  people  a  sense  of  ownership,  that

Singapore  is  their  home.  If it  is  our  home,  we  must  be

comfortable  here.  We must be able to speak  freely.   We  must

have  a  part  in deciding how to do things, how to arrange  the

furniture in our home, and also we must have a hand in doing the

chores  around the house.  We must do things for ourselves.   To

encourage  this, I urge the Government to be more  tolerant  and

have a greater acceptance of differing points of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn then, with this view, to the particular concern

of  the  motion  of preventive detention.  Is  it  necessary  to

abolish all detentions without trial?  In Singapore, besides the

Internal  Security  Act,  there is the Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions)  Act (CLTPA), Maintenance of Religious  Harmony  Act

and the Misuse of Drugs Act, which have similar laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus first on the ISA. Mr Jeyaretnam has given the

original  justification  and that  it  was  inherited  from  the

British.   Some may feel that there is a change of circumstance,

that today there is no serious threat of criminal unrest.  But I

think it is necessary to point out that very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>

few  countries which had inherited this law have got rid  of  it

entirely.   More so, that universal human rights  recognise  the

right   of countries to retain such laws of preventive detention

in  times of emergency, in times when the life of the nation  is

under  threat.  It is true that Singapore's ISA laws differ,  in

the  sense  that judicial review is limited.  The judiciary  can

only  comment  on  the  procedure  of  detention  and  not   the

substance.  The review is instead by an advisory board.  But the

point  is  that  international law, human  rights  law  and  the

practice  of  many  countries accepts  that  there  need  to  be

emergency powers for the state to genuinely intervene when there

is  a  problem.   Even the USA and UK, two western  democracies,

have  clear war time cases in which courts have not ventured  to

second  guess  the Executive, even if they have technically  the

power  of review.  The US cases on Americans of Japanese origins

who  were  interred during World War II for no crime other  than

the  fact that they were of Japanese origin.  The United Kingdom

case  of Liversidge v Anderson, which has been affirmed  by  our

own  legal  system.   Given this inheritance,  we  have  to  ask

ourselves, "Is preventive detention now outmoded?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that clearly in the Criminal Law (Temporary

Provisions)  Act,  which  is used against  suspected  criminals,

mainly  gangs, we have to recognise that with a largely  Chinese

population,  many cities in the world have faced  a  problem  in

tackling crime.  Next, in the Misuse of Drugs Act, where  it  is

used  for suspected addicts to search, subject them to test  and

then  to  treatment.  I think our Government is correct  in  not

making  apologies for this, because drugs remain a problem,  and

we are very close to one of the centres of the drug trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, where

religious  leaders mix with politics in an explosive element,  I

think again there is a real danger in a multi-religious society.

That  leaves me mainly with the Internal Security Act which,  as

correctly pointed out, was originally intended to deal with  the

communist threat.  I want to point out that it is not in use  at

present except for Mr Chia Thye

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>

Poh,  who is out of physical detention, still under supervision,

even  though  allowed abroad today.  Should  it  be  revoked  as

outmoded  today?   Or should be it kept in reserve  in  case  of

emergency?  For in recent events, the countries around  us  have

shown,   emergencies  arise  exactly  as  the   word   suggests,

"emergency", urgently.  That is also our history.  We  have  all

concerns  and we are a young society.  I think it is  true  that

policemen  have  guns, even if they are trained that  the  first

response is not to reach for that gun.  I think that analogy can

apply  to  the ISA so long as every use of the ISA is  explained

and  checked  by  either the courts or  by  public  opinion.   I

mention  the word "public opinion" because it comes back  to  my

point  about trust.  That if there is trust, as the  polls  have

shown  in  the Government, then the ISA too can be subjected  to

the trust of public opinion and to the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to question this more. Is the ISA a real

obstacle to speech and participation?  I want to point out  that

in  comparison  to many countries with similar laws,  relatively

few people have been detained in Singapore, and that the ISA, in

my view, is often more an excuse for the tidak apa attitude, the

indifference and inaction of citizens.  But I also want  to  say

that  the ISA should not be a sacred cow in Singapore.  I  think

an amendment to allow a judicial review  or its abolition should

be  considered in the future.  As our society knits more closely

together,  as  dangers recede, as bad memories are  confined  to

history  and  a  history we are not doomed to  repeat  but  have

learnt to grow stronger from, when those conditions prevail,  we

must reconsider this law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we get to that point in the future? I believe we

need to work on building trust and responsibility.  This applies

to  both sides.  Mr Zulkifli Baharudin has spoken about some  of

the concerns that people still have, not so much of the ISA, but

of  being  scolded.  People must trust that the Government  will

listen fairly and act fairly.  The Government, on its part, must

trust  that  citizens  will  exercise  their  rights  to  speech

responsibly.  This trust is not automatic.  It is earned.  There

is no free licence.  Government must respond and engage.  If

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>

an  argument is wrong, it must continue to tell us why it thinks

so.   An example was brought up by Mr Jeyaretnam about the reply

recently by the Prime Minister to developers who have asked  for

various  concessions.   I  am not convinced  at  all  that  this

example is one of fear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that businesses will continue to speak up.

They need not fear.  If they are organised, they will speak  up.

They  are not incarcerated, they are not "blackbooked"  in  some

way.   I think that it is right for the Government to point  out

to  the  national  interest, rather than to  sectoral  interest.

These  people  will  not be intimidated  easily.   But  for  the

ordinary   citizens,  not  the  organised  business  groups,   I

encourage  the  Government to exercise  a  greater  kindness,  a

greater caution, a greater restraint, to reply with the  aim  of

persuasion  and  to remember that the Government can  intimidate

even if it does not intend to.  If the citizen is sincere and on

the issue, I hope the Government will respond likewise.  In that

sense,  I hope for the evolution of certain rules of engagement,

not  just  among  Government leaders, but also  with  the  civil

service,  to take ideas seriously and respond to them  seriously

and with a sincerity equal to what they are given.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give two quick examples from my own experience. The

first  is of the Roundtable, a non-governmental organisation  of

which I am a member, and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin is the President.

The  Roundtable offered its post-election analysis that  one  of

the  reasons the PAP had succeeded so much in this election  was

because  of something we called "package politics".  Of  course,

the   PAP   is  free  to  disagree  with  our  analysis.    Many

Singaporeans have disagreed with our analysis.  The point I want

to bring up today is not about whether we were right or wrong in

our  analysis,  but the reply of government.  The Government  in

its  reply,  or  the  Minister or a member of  the  PAP  in  his

personal  capacity replied.   Mr Lim Boon Heng responded  to  us

substantively on the points we raised.  Only,  I would  say,  on

three words, there was a sense of what people might think of  as

intimidation.  The first, he called us "PAP critics" rather than

simply a commentator or critic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>

of  politics as a whole.  Second, there was a very vague promise

to take us on, and I do not think at that point he meant to take

us  on in Parliament.  The third was that he question marked our

non-partisanship,  that  somehow  we  were  coloured  as   being

predominantly  against the PAP.  Except for those three  points,

the right to reply was certainly fair.  Just as I had a right to

speak, the Minister certainly had a right to reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a second example, something which I think is a

very  promising example.  I do not know whether anyone remembers

the  Budget debate we were engaged in, for even longer days than

this.   I  spoke  briefly on the cut on  the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs  about  the Registry of Societies, and I encouraged  the

Registry  of Societies to expedite registration of organisations

in  order  that  we  might have a more  active  and  able  civil

society.   In my comments, as an example of that, I  brought  up

the  Roundtable  and I mistakenly said that the  Roundtable  had

taken more than a year to register.  The comment was reported in

the  papers and the mistake was pointed out by the Registrar  of

Societies.   It was also admitted by the founding  President  of

the  Roundtable, Mr Raymond Lim, in a reply.  In the  reply,  he

said,  "Yes,  we  made a mistake, but please remember  our  main

point,  that  to  enable civil society,  we  must  have  quicker

registration."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Assoc. Prof. Ho

Peng Kee, replied to me fairly in Parliament promising that that

would  be done, the main point would be addressed, that we  were

all  of  one  mind, that this process needed to be  speeded  up.

When  I learnt of my mistake, because I had been misinformed,  I

wrote  to Assoc. Prof. Ho.  I have asked him before this whether

I  can make reference to the letter, and he has agreed.  I wrote

to  admit my mistake and to apologise, and explained that I  had

not  intended the mistake.  I also encourage him to focus on the

main  issue  on which we concurred.  I think today he  does  not

bear  me  a  grudge and I hope I have not lost his respect.   In

fact, I hope in a sense that this small example is something  we

can learn, that people can speak

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>

up  for  good  motive, even if they make mistakes, and  then  be

accepted for the main point and to move on from there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To widen this trust and such a responsibility will take

time.   I  think I am not alone in this.  I believe  that  Prime

Minister Goh's Government is sincere in wanting consultation and

participation,  civil  society and the  people  sector.   And  I

believe  that  the people's wish on their part  is  growing  for

consultation, participation and democracy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I cannot, with respect, support the

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not intend

to  speak,  but in view of certain allegations which  have  been

made  in  this House against lawyers, I think I owe  it  to  the

House and to my profession to speak up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, if I remember correctly, Mr Tang Liang Hong

had  lawyers  to  represent him.  And if he chose  to  discharge

them, then of course he has to blame himself.  The fact that few

lawyers  refused  to act for various reasons, whether  it  is  a

question  of cost or that they do not want to act, it  is  their

own  choice.  It does not mean that the legal profession is  not

prepared to act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, the ISA, as he has rightly pointed out, has

a history.  It originated from the British.  Mr  David Marshall,

who was a great champion of civil liberty, moved an extension of

the law which allowed detention without trial in this House.  We

know  Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew was against it.  But when  he  attained

power, he realised the importance of this legislation.  He  must

have  been professionally advised to carry on.  I can sympathise

with  ISA  being used against political detainees, but  have  we

used it for the last three years?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to consider amending the law so

that  there will be more judicial discretion.  But that  is  for

the  House  to decide.  As to the allegation that  there  is  no

right of review in the High Court, the law is clear.  Parliament

has  passed the law.  The job of the High Court is to  interpret

it.  Parliament is the supreme body, as Mr Jeyaretnam time

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>

and  again  said, and this supreme body has passed a  law;  High

Court cannot change it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to a more fundamental issue, Sir, which I think my

fellow  colleague, Mr Simon Tay has touched on.  This motion  is

flawed  from  the very beginning.  You cannot have  all  persons

freed  of  detention  without trial for the simple  reason  that

secret  societies'  men are still active even  today.   I  am  a

member  of  SINDA.  When I visit schools, I am told that  school

children are being recruited by secret societies.  Can we afford

to allow these thugs roaming in the streets?  Surely not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Shoot them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Well, if you want to shoot, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what you want.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall not engage

with  him, because time is running out.  My position is,  detain

the  anti-social elements and rehabilitate them.  Some  of  them

have  come  out and have changed.  In fact, the secret societies

are  active in other parts of the world.  It is increasing.   Do

you want it?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, both Mr Zulkifli and Mr Simon Tay

have  quite  extensively put the case - there is no  element  of

fear,  it  is  the  individual who decides.   I  think  we,  the

Nominated MPs, have come into this House not to toe the line  of

the  Government.  We have come here to state our views, and this

view  is  being stated by a Nominated Member, that we have  this

danger of communalists and religious bigots who are prepared  to

stir  trouble.   In fact, this morning I will not mention  name,

from  a  religious  group, one individual came  and  said,  "The

Government is after us."  He came unappointed, and I want to  be

courteous to him and I do not want to besmirch the name of  this

organisation,  and he said, "My organisation  is  delisted."   I

said  I  could  speak to the Minister.  But to  say  that  every

individual has the right to practise as he likes cannot  be  so.

So  I  urge this House, Sir, to reject this motion.  I  did  not

want  to  speak,  but  because of certain  allegations,  certain

misconceptions will be conveyed outside this House, I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>

decided to speak.  I am asking this House to be careful  not  to

do  away  with the ISA altogether.  But I urge the  Minister  to

reconsider  the  position.  We have moved further.   We  are  an

enlightened  society,  and responsible  groups,  Roundtable  and

other  groups, will blossom up.  Give them the opportunity.   In

fact, I hope the Minister will give the figure to this House  on

how many political detainees we have for the last three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I say, in Tamil, romba nandri.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, it has been a long day. It

is  a  long debate.  I will not tax Members' patience very much.

But  let  me  make a response.  First, this has  also  become  a

standard  line  of  mine,  but  it  is  the  truth,  because  Mr

Jeyaretnam  once  again raises old issues.   Together  with  old

issues, he will bring up old cases and even old rules - the  HDB

sterilisation rule that no longer applies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act

(CLTPA).  He was in the House in the 1980s, and if you  look  at

the  Hansard, he debated it fully.  Government gave a  response,

more recently in this House, I think last year in the debate  on

the President's Address.  He also mentioned then the point about

fear, about the ISA and other preventive detention laws.  I also

gave  him  a  reply.   Indeed, I think  the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs,  Mr Wong Kan Seng, gave a written reply to  Mdm  Claire

Chiang as to whether the ISA should be abolished.  So these  are

in  the  record.   But Mr Jeyaretnam, I think maybe  wanting  to

retain  his  record of lodging motions in the  House  regularly,

moves  this motion.  Next year 1999, the Criminal Law (Temporary

Provisions) Act will be up for extension.  Well, at that time we

can have a full debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before talking about preventive detention laws, let me

address  the other point about fear.  I think it is  very  clear

that even though the same word is used here, Mr Jeyaretnam's use

of the word "fear" is vastly different from Mr Zulkifli's and Mr

Simon  Tay's.   Mr  Jeyaretnam would want  us  to  believe  that

Singaporeans are gripped by fear, an oppressive fear.  And  this

indeed is a recurrent theme of his, if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>

you  look  at  all his old speeches in the House  and  political

rallies.   His  tune  never changes, even though  Singapore  has

changed  so  much, and these are highlighted in the speeches  of

the  other Members.  But it is a constant refrain, down  to  the

very  `t'  and `i', the knock at the door at 2.00 am.   So  this

phrase is used all the time.  He also says some of the fears are

brought  about  by  coercion  by the  Government  and  mentioned

instances where people do not want to have anything to  do  with

the Workers' Party, whether it is businesses who do not want  to

serve them, or people who do not want to join them in elections,

and  he  blames it on the Government.  That it is  because  they

fear the Government.  But I think Mr Jeyaretnam and the Workers'

Party  should  examine themselves.  Could it be  that  there  is

something  in  them that puts these people off, not  wanting  to

have any dealings with the Workers' Party?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They do not want to have business

contracts.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Well, it is still a

relationship, right?  So they may not want to have  any  dealing

with him.  But why blame it on the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the truth of the matter is really

Singapore  has prospered and progressed.  As has been  mentioned

in  this  House,  we  have  become  a  more  open  society.   Mr

Jeyaretnam wants us to believe that Singaporeans are  living  in

the dark ages.  He used the term "unthinking".  That the fear is

so  gripping that we are "unthinking".  So what does that  mean?

All  robots?   He is in fact insulting the intelligence  of  all

Singaporeans,  that  we have all become robots  under  this  big

brother,  this  machine - the Government.  If  you  look  around

Singapore,  all  the achievements which we have made  all  these

years,  are  all  these  the result of  an  unthinking,  robotic

people?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have become a role model for many societies. I think if

he  is  objective, if Mr Jeyaretnam reads the papers,  talks  to

people,  he  will know that many delegations visit Singapore  to

learn about many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>

aspects  of life in Singapore which incidentally have also  done

very  well  in international polls, whether it is town planning,

whether  it is the judicial system, whether it is amenities  and

health care, whether it is educational achievements.  All  these

are  not  the result of a people who are unthinking and  robotic

but  a  creative people.  Of course, we can improve and  we  are

moving towards that - to create and foster an even more creative

people.   Look  at our young people.  I think if  Mr  Jeyaretnam

looks at the achievements of our young people, talks to the Dean

of  the  Law Faculty, our young lawyers or law students  who  go

abroad to do mooting, they win top honours.  Our young people go

overseas,  take part in choral competition, they do  very  well.

All  these are the result of a people gripped by fear?   I  will

ask  Mr Jeyaretnam, please, to be realistic and not to be closed

in his mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, is that Singaporeans'

expectations have risen.  Every one of us who has dealings  with

the  average Singaporean will know that Singaporeans have become

more sophisticated; Singaporeans have become more demanding.   I

think  Members of Parliament will know that.  Are  these  people

who can just be led by the nose?  I think the answer is obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Mr Tay, Mr Zulkifli and Mr Rai take a

different  tack.  They are not talking about an oppressive  fear

gripping Singaporeans.  They are calling for a lighter touch  to

government,  more  bonding  with  the  government,   perhaps   a

government  more tolerant of different views.  I  am  sure  they

will  agree that this indeed is happening.  This will not happen

overnight  but  surely the signs are there.   Civil  society  is

alive and well in Singapore.  The people sector is growing.   It

will  not  be  an overnight process but will take time.   But  I

think  the  point is we are coming along.  And  as  our  society

matures, Singaporeans will have a greater say as to the form and

shape  it will take.  More and more their views and inputs  will

count.  Mr Tay has shared about his involvement in the Singapore

<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee.   Mr Zulkifli, I think, is part of  the  Feedback

Unit.  They know from the ground, people who come

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>

in,  give different and critical views.  They are all looked  at

and examined to see whether there are any merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, even in terms of the rules and regulations, we are

opening up.  A few years ago, PM asked to look at the rules  and

see  which can be lifted.  And if you look around you, there are

many  areas  in  which  our  rules and regulations  have  become

lighter, a lighter touch, be it in the area of censorship, be it

in  the area of entertainment such as jam sessions in jazz bars.

It  may  be  a small thing but those people who are involved,  I

think  they appreciate it.  It took some time to come along  but

we  have.  Or in the area of busking where, of course, it is not

an  ideal  scheme,  it  can  be  improved,  but  there  are  now

provisions in the scheme in place where people can busk  on  the

streets  or local government through CDCs  I think Mr  Tay  made

that  point   where CDCs now involve more people living  in  HDB

areas,  private  estates, all having  a  say  as  to  how  local

government is to be run.  The list really goes on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that there is no climate of fear in

Singapore.   Is there a fear of speaking up?  First  of  all,  I

would  say that there are people who speak up critically of  the

Government  in  this House.  Opposition members  speak  up  very

freely.   Does  Mr  Chiam fear or Mr Low Thia Khiang  fear?   Or

indeed does Mr Jeyaretnam fear speaking up?  People speak up  in

various  fora,  out of this House, in seminars, in  conferences,

letters to the press, you will see people speaking up, sometimes

critically  of  the  Government.   Indeed,  at  the  recent  IPS

conference, views were expressed critical of the Government, and

they were widely reported.  Is there fear?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, if I may postulate, maybe people who argue that

there  is  such  a pervasive fear want to see a situation  where

there  is unbridled criticism of the government and its  leaders

which  happens  in some countries where government  leaders  are

then put on the defensive all the time.  But I think that is not

the  way to go because then good governance will be eroded.   We

need  a strong government, we need a responsible government,  we

need a responsive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>

government.   But it must be a strong government.   Mr  Zulkifli

talked about this respect and authority which is in our culture.

Yes, it is there.  And if that respect and authority reposed  in

the  Government  is rightly earned, I think  we  should  not  be

ashamed  of  it.   So  that is a key point  -  we  must  have  a

government that must earn the respect and trust of the people by

good  personal  conduct, by bonding with  the  people,  by  good

policies  that work.  And again, if Mr Jeyaretnam is  objective,

he  must admit that over so many years of PAP rule, since  1959,

almost  40  years,  we  have made tremendous  progress  in  many

fields,  despite  many  difficult  situations  that  had  to  be

overcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that this Government takes the position

that  if you express a view in public critical of the Government

or  a  view that is wrong in terms of policies, we will have  to

reply.  We have to point out where you are wrong.  Otherwise you

may  mislead other people and then the wrong thinking  sets  in.

So  this  rebuttal is something that Singaporeans  who  want  to

speak  up in public will have to learn to take.  It is  part  of

debate.    Just  as  you  can  criticise  the  Government,   the

Government must have the prerogative to point out where you  are

wrong.   As Mr Simon Tay said, the business people gave a  point

of  view  which  we felt is not correct.  So  we  came  out  and

pointed it out.  So it is not so much the fear of the Government

or preventive detention laws that put people off.  It could very

well be a desire not to be shown up in public which is something

where as a society progresses, I guess, will come along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's main point relates to our laws and

detention without trial.  First of all, I must say that the rule

of  law prevails in Singapore.  Our detentions without trial are

not  a  negation of the rule of law.  They reinforce and support

law  and order in Singapore.  It is absurd to say that our  laws

and  detention  without  trial  put  fear  in  the  preponderant

majority of law-abiding Singaporeans, as has been pointed out by

the  other  speakers.   On  the  contrary,  they  put  fear   in

criminals, drug addicts, drug traffickers, terrorists and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>

such  like,  deterring them from their destructive conduct.   So

our  tough laws, including laws on detention without trial,  are

one  reason  why Singapore is one of the safest  cities  in  the

world  with a relatively low incidence of drug abuse  or  crime.

In  fact,  if  we do what Mr Jeyaretnam argues for  and  abolish

these  laws, then Singaporeans would indeed live in great  fear.

That we must not allow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not fully repeat the arguments for retaining our

laws   on  detention  without  trial.   These  have  been  fully

ventilated.  Suffice it for me to say that these laws have  been

in our books for a long time and they are serving their purposes

well.   The  CLTPA  and  Misuse of Drugs  Act  (MDA)  are  still

relevant   in  countering  secret  society  elements  and   drug

traffickers.   As  a result, our streets are  free  from  secret

society  elements.   They are there, but we have  to  keep  them

down.   Our  drug  situation is under control.  Other  countries

without  such  laws  face problems, especially  in  apprehending

syndicate  heads  or  masterminds.  So  please  do  not  let  Mr

Jeyaretnam  lull us into complacency.  As for  the  ISA,  it  is

still  relevant in countering security threats, such  as  racial

and  religious extremism, international terrorism, espionage and

subversion.   Because of our laws, the above problems  have  not

come  upon us.  But does it therefore mean that we let our guard

down?   It cannot be so, because if we do, we will pay  a  heavy

price.   One example will be foreign triads and crime syndicates

may  be  emboldened to penetrate and operate here.  Do  we  want

that?  Surely, no.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam quite naively asked for evidence of terrorism

and  other such like activities.  Surely these people who engage

in such activities will not readily show their face.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They are in mask.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So let us not be lulled into

complacency by Mr Jeyaretnam's seductive and ill-conceived call.

As Mr Tay has mentioned, other countries too have the equivalent

of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>

ISA  and they have remained in their arsenal.  Why?  Because the

safeguarding of national security is paramount in all societies.

This  is  all the more so in a small, relatively new multiracial

country like Singapore.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam should go and see

the National Education Exhibition, if he has not, to see how  we

have  come  to where we are today and how things can  really  go

awry if we let our guard down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that these laws should not be abused

or  misused and that there are adequate safeguards.  And indeed,

the Government will be accountable to the people of Singapore if

we  abuse  and misuse these laws.  So, again, here, we must  not

think  that  Singaporeans are so unthinking, that they  are  not

discerning  enough  if the Government misuses  or  abuses  these

preventive detention laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure this House that these laws are not laws

to  bypass the criminal law processes.  Mr Jeyaretnam says, "Oh,

there  are  other  laws  that  can be  used.".   But  preventive

detention laws are used in situations where reprisals may be the

order  of  the  day  if you go through the normal  criminal  law

process  because we are dealing with terrorists, we are  dealing

with  drug  syndicates,  we  are  dealing  with  secret  society

elements.   So we must have this regime that takes care  of  the

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address this point about judicial review. I

think  Mr  Zulkifli  and Mr Simon Tay have  asked  whether  this

process  could  be examined.  As they are aware,  following  the

Court  of  Appeal  decision in 1989, an amendment  was  made  to

restore  the status quo ante, which is a subjective test,  which

was a position long established by case law, and which reflected

Government's position all along.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is that right?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The question of judicial review

was   thoroughly  debated  on  that  occasion.   In  moving  the

amendment,  the Minister for Law gave reasons why  there  should

not be judicial review of the substantive grounds of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>

detention  under  the  ISA.   The general  point  is  that,  for

national security, the Executive must have the final say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must retain the right to decide what is and what is

not   a  security  threat.   Also,  as  I  mentioned  just  now,

preventive  detention is by its nature a precautionary  measure.

Therefore, what is involved are covert operations, which have to

be  covert  to  get evidence as to some of these threats.   Such

operations  and sources will be compromised if a  court  hearing

were  to  be conducted.  Again, let me emphasise what is  really

important is the integrity of the people who run the system, who

are  of  course  accountable to the people, and the  safeguards.

Recently, a new safeguard in the Elected President's veto powers

was added.  So it shows that we are improving the system all the

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli made this point about whether we should have a

tribunal of three judges rather than the present position  where

there  is an advisory board.  The present position is preferable

because  the board comprises a sitting Supreme Court  judge  and

two  prominent  citizens appointed by the President.   In  other

words,  we are involving the people.  So I think there is better

accountability and transparency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have taken some time. But I

think today's motion surely cannot stand.  It is drafted in such

wide  terms.   It makes such sweeping statements.  It  does  not

take into account the progress that has taken place in Singapore

the  fact that there is more consultation between the Government

and  people,  the  fact that some of the  rules  which  are  not

needful  have already been abolished, the fact that there  is  a

lighter  touch  to Government.  Really, we must not  leave  this

Chamber  with  the  picture  that  Mr  Jeyaretnam  paints,  that

Singaporeans are gripped by fear, unthinking, robotic.  Is  that

the  real  situation, Singaporeans who are like that,  who  have

made Singapore what it is today?  The answer must surely be no.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the

Minister of State whether he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

is  prepared to tell this House how many political detainees  we

have for the last three years.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I think we all know the answer.

The ISA is not used against political detainees.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, what I have

said  in  my  earlier motion, and I will repeat it, is  that  no

serious  attempt  is made to understand the issue.   Instead  of

that, the Minister of State says things which are repeated again

and  again,  that  the  PAP has taken good  care  of  Singapore,

Singapore  is what it is today because of the past,  we  do  not

need  to  change  anything.  We have heard  all  this.   But  no

attempt  is  made to answer the points.  But as  I  said  in  my

speech,  I will let Mr Lee Kuan Yew make the answer to  what  we

have heard from the junior Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew was speaking in April 1955 when there was a

real threat, there were the communists fighting in the jungle in

Malaysia, there was threat of subversion in Singapore and he was

opposing  the  extension of the Emergency Regulations  after  Mr

Marshall's government took over.  They wanted to extend  it  for

three months, promising to study and review it and this is  what

the  great  architect of our society today said in 1955,  and  I

quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we

do, then we must say categorically without qualification that no

restraint from any democratic process other than by the ordinary

law of the land should be allowed."



This, at the time, as I said, when there was a real threat,  and

that  was  Mr  Lee Kuan Yew, the great champion  of  freedom  of

speech, of liberty, of freedom of association, holding forth  in

this  House which was then an Assembly.  And the same man, great

champion of freedom, speaking in September 1955 when Mr Marshall

was  introducing the Public Peace and Security Ordinance (PPSO),

Mr  Marshall  was  introducing into that  law  a  proper  appeal

tribunal   with  power  to  release  anyone  detained   by   the

government,  not  an  advisory  board  but  giving  this  appeal

tribunal  full  powers  to  order  release  if  they  were   not

satisfied.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>

There  you have an adequate safeguard.  But Mr Lee did not  want

any  detention even in September 1955 when the threat was  still

there and this is what he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What he [referring to the Chief Minister] is seeking to do

in  the  name of democracy is to curtail a fundamental  liberty,

and  the  most fundamental of them all, freedom from arrest  and

punishment, without having violated a specific provision of  the

law and being convicted for it.'



So,  I  would like the Minister of State to think about what  Mr

Lee  was saying.  This is not me speaking today.  It is Mr  Lee,

his  own leader, speaking in 1955.  And I am surprised that this

great  architect  of  our  society is not  in  this  House  this

afternoon to answer my motion.  Why is he not here?  After  all,

he  was  the man who is responsible for the continuation of  the

Internal  Security  Act.   He  was the  man  who  repealed  this

adequate  safeguard that Mr Marshall had introduced.  Should  he

not  be here to explain why?  What was wrong in 1955, when there

was a real threat, why is it now absolutely necessary when there

is no threat?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do sympathise, if I may say, with the Minister of State,

because  he was not responsible for these laws.  I am  sorry,  I

hope he does not feel offended, he does not have the depth to be

able to examine these issues and to answer the criticisms of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also tell him what his leader in 1955 said, when Mr

Marshall told him, "You are always bringing up the same  thing",

Mr  Lee  Kuan Yew's answer was, "I shall go on repeating  it  ad

nauseam until you change the law."  So that is my answer to  the

junior Minister and to others when they accuse me of bringing up

old  issues.  If something is wrong and remains a wrong, someone

who feels that it should be changed should go on bringing it  up

until it is changed.  So I intend to do that and this is not the

last time that this House will hear on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the architect, why is the Prime Minister not

here to reply to this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has better things to do!

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He wants a gracious society. How can we

have  a  gracious society unless we have a civil society  first?

And  a civil society is a society of people, men and women,  who

are  conscious of their rights and who are not afraid  to  speak

up,  who know that the law protects them, and they can speak  up

and  participate  in  the  decision making.   That  is  a  civil

society.  You must have that first before you can talk  about  a

gracious society.  So why is the Prime Minister not here?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also disappointed that the Minister for Law is not

here.   I  would have asked him whether he had always  held  the

view  that  detention without trial did not offend the  Rule  of

Law.  Members would have been surprised at his answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: do we, in present day Singapore, need to

arm  ourselves  with powers to throw people into prison  without

first  bringing  them up before a court of law,  laying  charges

against  them  and the court hearing the charges and  convicting

them  and then sending them to prison?  That is the Rule of Law,

I am afraid, not anything else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised to hear from the Minister of State that

detentions  without trial do not negate the Rule of  Law.   What

does  he  understand by the rule of law?  The Rule  of  Law,  as

explained  by the Privy Council in the Ong Ah Chuan's  case,  is

not  just  the  written laws but incorporates into  it  what  is

called natural justice or what the Americans would call the  due

process  of law, ie, no one may be punished in any way, deprived

of his life or liberty until he has been found guilty by a court

of   law  and  ordered  to  suffer  the  punishment.   Our   own

Constitution says that no  man may be deprived of  his  life  or

liberty,  save  in accordance with the law.  And  what  does  it

mean?   When  Parliament passes any law, you can  just  pick  up

people  and  put them in prison?  If that is the interpretation,

then the Constitution becomes a laughing stock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I come to deal with the reply from the Minister of

State,  let  me  deal with the speeches of  the  others.   As  I

understood the speakers, the general

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>

trend  appears to be that we do not really have to do away  with

the ISA, but we can perhaps be a bit more tolerant.  We must get

the message across to the people that they have nothing to fear.

But  what good does it do to tell people that they have  nothing

to  fear when you retain in the statute books the power to throw

them  into  prison?   No amount of saying, "you  don't  have  to

worry,  my  chap, we won't throw you into prison," is  going  to

convince  them.   The only way you can convince them  that  they

have nothing to fear is to remove the power so that they can see

it.   That the Government no longer has the power to detain them

without first bringing them before the court.  That is the  only

answer, nothing else.  Nothing short of it will help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers also made the point that there is a

perception.  Of course, it is a perception.  And they  say  that

people  perhaps fear when they need not fear.  That is true.   I

have told the people a number of times that there is nothing  to

be  afraid of.  But do they take me seriously?  When I tell them

there  is  nothing to be afraid of, they say, "Can you guarantee

it?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this perception. So, what does the Government do

about  it?  Keep telling them there is nothing to fear,  nothing

to  worry, or does the Government take active steps to eliminate

that  fear?  That is what I am asking the Government to  do,  to

take  active  steps  to eliminate that fear, however  irrational

that  fear  may be, however unfounded.  But the fear exists.   I

think  it has been acknowledged by the other speakers that there

is  that  fear.  So the Government has to take active  steps  to

remove  that fear.  No amount of "there is nothing to  fear,  my

good  people, you speak up," will convince them.   Many  a  taxi

driver  when  they see me say, "In Singapore, we  can't  speak."

And  I  said, "Why not?"  They say, "We might lose our  licence.

We  might  be  put into prison."  You might say that  these  are

unfounded fears.  But how do we reassure them?  And the only way

you can reassure them is to remove that power in your grasp.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the speakers also seem to say that we do need

emergency  powers  in times of emergency.  I  have  said  in  my

speech   that  the  Constitution  does  provide  for  times   of

emergency.   They  are Articles 149 to 151 of  the  Constitution

which say that when there is a real threat to the country,  when

there  is a danger of any subversion and Parliament is satisfied

of  this  danger and threat to the country, then Parliament  may

pass  laws curtailing the freedom of the people and, as I  said,

requiring  that that be reviewed and should no longer remain  on

the  statute books once the emergency is over.  So we  have  got

it.   It  is  not as though we do not have the power  to  invoke

these  powers  of  detention  without  trial  if  there  is   an

emergency,  if there is a threat.  But we do not need  it  as  a

permanent  feature in our statute books.  I would like  to  know

which  country  in  the world has this as a  permanent  feature.

They,  of  course,  retain the right in times  of  emergency  to

invoke  these  powers.  I think the Indian Parliament  has  this

provision.   But which country has it as a permanent feature  in

the ordinary laws of the land?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the Minister of State a number of questions. He

thinks  I  am being naive in asking the questions.   Of  course,

every  question that I ask is naive because the Government  does

not  really want to answer those questions.  So the easiest  way

is to say, "It is a naive question, a silly question."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Minister of State should say that

there  is  no  climate  of fear.  Even  the  two  Nominated  MPs

mentioned about this fear.  But they did not think it was as bad

as I made it out to be.  But have they encountered the fear as I

have encountered it in people?  I gave you the examples where  I

encountered this fear in our people.  Have they encountered  the

fear  as  I  have encountered it?  Have they gone  round  asking

people  to  stand for elections to Parliament?  Have  they  gone

round  asking  them  to  donate any  monies  to  the  opposition

parties?  Have they gone round asking the printers to print  for

the  opposition parties?   Then they will know whether there  is

this fear or not.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State says that we cannot have unbridled

criticisms.  I can again, for his reading, recommend him to what

his  great leader said in the Malaysian Parliament in  1964.   I

hope  that  every PAP Member of Parliament has  been  given  all

these  speeches of the leader made when he was in the opposition

from  1954 to 1959.  It should be compulsory reading,  and  then

they  could perhaps ask the leader why is it not right now  when

he  said it was right in 1954 to have these freedoms.  I hope it

is also compulsory reading for PAP MPs of Mr Francis Seow's book

"To  Catch  a Tartar".  There, they will see an account  of  how

they  deal with opposition politicians or people aspiring to  be

opposition politicians once they are taken in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State refers to the amendment that was made

after  the  Court of  Appeal decision in 1989.  With respect  to

the  Minister,  I think he has got it all wrong.   The  case  of

Liversidge and Anderson that Mr Simon Tay mentioned was  a  case

when  England  was facing across the Channel the German  forces.

There  was a real danger there, and Lord Atkin stood out against

all  the  other judges and said, that even in such a  state,  it

would be wholly wrong to deprive a man of his liberty unless  he

had  been found guilty by a court of law.  But the other  judges

thought that in time of such grave danger, the Executive  should

be  the  judges.   That  was 1942, a time  of  great  danger  to

England.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years later, the House of Lords said, Lord Atkin's

classic  statement  was  the  right  principle  in  law.   Every

imprisonment  is  prima facie unlawful unless it  is  justified.

That  was the law in many other countries, but we continued with

the law of Liversidge and Anderson, when all the other countries

said that that was wrong.  But in 1989 the Court of  Appeal felt

constrained because of all the authorities that were put  before

it,  authorities from other Commonwealth countries.   They  felt

constrained to change, and said, "The time has come now  for  us

to change.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>

courts should have the right to look into the merits."  That was

what  led  to  the  amendment of the  law,  amendments  made  by

Parliament excluding any review of the merits by a court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two other points. The Minister of State says,

tongue in cheek, that the Government must be accountable to  the

people.   That  is the real test.  Government can only  be  made

accountable to the people, if the people are given an unfettered

right  to  question the Government and to demand an answer.   In

other  countries, they have the Freedom of Information Act.   We

do  not  have  it  in  Singapore.  It  is  only  then  that  the

Government  can  be made accountable.  It is no  good  repeating

over  and  over again that we are accountable.  People must  see

the right in themselves to make the Government accountable, that

they can demand answers and explanations, and the Government has

to  reply  to those criticisms.  My party has asked a number  of

questions to which we never get a reply.  Is that accountability

of the Government?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister says the advisory boards that we have

at  the  moment, which Mr David Marshall abolished and  replaced

with  a  proper Appeal Court, are adequate.  How could they  be?

They  do not have any power except to make recommendations which

the Government may accept or may not accept.  The decision still

lies with the Government.  So what good is it having an advisory

board  if  it  has  no teeth?   I am saying to this  Government,

quite seriously, and speaking as someone who has the welfare  of

this  country at heart, who feels for our citizens, that  it  is

time that the Government set them free, free from this fear  and

the only way you can do that is to show them that they no longer

have any fear of being detained except under due process of law.

Whether  they speak against the Government or whether they  join

opposition parties or help opposition parties, they need have no

fear whatsoever.  The Government cannot detain them because they

are going to do away with that power.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way the Government can remove the fear is to

abolish  the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.   Because

that  is also used to strike fear into people's hearts.  I  have

mentioned  about  persons  picked  up  by  the  police  who  are

reminded,   "We  have the power, you know, to detain  you  under

section  30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.   So

what  are  you going to do?"  So I hope that something  will  be

done  to  assure  the  people, not just lip  service,  but  some

concrete steps taken to show the people that they need not  live

under  fear any longer, but they can breathe the air more freely

in

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower,  in view of the current worsening economic  situation,

whether he foresees the possibility of prolonged unemployment of

up to a year or more for older and unskilled workers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower whether Singapore will face structural unemployment  in

the  next  two  to three years and, if so, whether  the  current

policy  on  training of workers is sufficient to cope  with  the

situation.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older and unskilled workers are the most vulnerable group

in  an  economic  slowdown.  Whether they  will  face  prolonged

unemployment  for  up  to  a year or more,  depends  on  several

factors.  Firstly, are there still jobs for these workers?  Yes,

there  are  still many jobs, especially in the services  sector,

which can be done by older and unskilled workers.  Secondly, can

this group of workers make the necessary adjustments in terms of

nature  of work and wages in order to stay employed?   They  may

have to accept lower wages, or work which is different from what

they  have been used to during this economic slowdown.  Thirdly,

how  quickly can they acquire some useful skills which will help

them  to  find  alternative jobs?  This is  a  critical  factor.

Apart  from  the  economic  slowdown,  we  are  also  undergoing

restructuring  towards higher technology and higher  value-added

industries.   New  jobs being created will need  higher  skills.

Older  workers, who are unskilled or lower-skilled, must upgrade

themselves if they want to take on these new jobs.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem faced by older and unskilled workers will

result  in  structural  unemployment.   This  is  essentially  a

mismatch between supply and demand of labour in terms of skills,

occupation or industries.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy to deal with structural unemployment is

focused on skills upgrading and re-training of older workers  to

meet  the  needs  of the jobs being created by new  investments.

Hence, the Minister for Finance has allocated $50 million to the

Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  This will complement  the

Skills Development Fund's allocation of $50 million for the SRP.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Minister for Finance has allocated $20

million  to  establish a Skills Development Centre.   The  total

budget for the SRP is hence $120 million and is expected to meet

the  skills  upgrading  needs  for up  to  40,000  lower-skilled

workers over the next 2 years. We will monitor closely the level

of  usage  of  the SRP and ensure that funds are  sufficient  to

provide the training places needed and the scope of training  to

enhance employability for older workers.  This will help  us  to

minimise the impact of structural unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no restriction on foreigners buying private

restriction on landed properties and flats in buildings below  6

storeys.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



Whether  foreigners buy properties in Singapore is a  matter  of

supply  and demand.  The Government should not introduce special

measures to favour foreigners who do so, just as it has  in  the

past  resisted  calls to make it harder for  foreigners  to  buy

Singapore properties.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restriction the Member refers to is on financing of

property  purchases by foreigners using Singapore  dollars.   It

was introduced to ensure that such foreigner buyers were serious

investors  with  their  own  sources  of  funds,  and  were  not

borrowing Singapore dollars from banks here to speculate in  the

Singapore  property market.  Permanent residents are allowed  to

borrow in Singapore dollars to purchase one property, for  owner

occupation.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the objective of the restriction still remains valid,

the Government has no plans to lift the restriction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The off-Budget measures were meant to help companies during

effect  from  1st  July  1998.  The  measures  would  cost   the

Government $2 billion.  Some of these will translate  into  cost

savings  for employers, while others will stimulate demand  thus

helping employers to save jobs.  At this stage, it is too  early

to assess the full impact of these measures.

of  subletting  to  50% of available space.  For  subletting  to

related  companies,  the  limit is raised  to  70%.   These  are

reasonable  caps  since leasing properties is  not  the  primary

activity of these lessees.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, in view of the current economic slowdown, JTC

and  HDB  will be flexible in applying their subletting  policy,

taking  into  account  any special circumstances  faced  by  the

companies on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;37. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  whether  a time frame has  been  established  to

implement Expressway Monitoring and Advisory Services (EMAS)  on

on the Central Expressway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EMAS was implemented on the Central Expressway (CTE) on

21st March this year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its installation along the CTE, it has yielded

significant benefits for motorists.  It has enabled the  LTA  to

provide   assistance  to  distressed  motorists  and  to   clear

obstructions to traffic flow more quickly.  It is estimated that

for  the CTE, EMAS yields a time saving worth about $6.8 million

per  year  for motorists because of quicker removal of  disabled

vehicles by LTA's vehicle retrieval service.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the evident benefits of the system, the LTA has

decided  to  extend  EMAS  to  the other  expressways.  EMAS  is

scheduled  to  be  extended to the Pan-Island  Expressway,  East

Coast Parkway, Ayer Rajah Expressway, Bukit Timah Expressway and

Kranji  Expressway  by 2000 and to the Tampines  Expressway  and

Seletar Expressway by 2001.

Singapore (IRAS) has received about 1900 objections.  The number

of   objections  received  is  not  higher  than  that  for  the

corresponding period last year.  This is despite the  fact  that

IRAS  has  reviewed  the annual values of  more  properties  and

raised  more  new assessments this year.  Taken  together,  this

indicates  that the rate of objection has fallen. IRAS'  efforts

to  review  the  annual values to reflect the prevailing  rental

level  as  quickly as possible also explains  why  the  rate  of

objections is not high despite the weakening rental market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objections to annual values are always dealt with

expeditiously.   In  cases where the owners  provide  sufficient

information or grounds of objection, IRAS will ensure that these

are dealt with within a month.  Where more information is needed

from  the  owners, IRAS will contact the owners to  obtain  more

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already an administrative concession in place

since  1992 to allow Singaporeans working overseas to repatriate

their  foreign  income  to  Singapore  without  attracting   any

Singapore   tax.    Under  this  concession,  Singaporeans   and

permanent  residents  can elect to be treated  as  non-residents

where they have been employed abroad for a period of at least  6

months in any year.  As non-residents, the foreign income  which

they  remit  to  Singapore during any year  in  which  they  are

treated  as  non-residents would not be taxed.    Even  if  they

choose  to  remit their overseas employment income  after  their

return to Singapore when they have become residents and be taxed

on  the income remitted, they will be given a tax credit for any

foreign  tax  suffered on it.  Unless the foreign tax  is  lower

than  the Singapore tax payable, which is rare given Singapore's

generally  low  tax rates, there should be no further  Singapore

tax  on  the  remittance with the tax credit  given.   With  the

Industry,  with  retail sales now in negative growth  for  eight

consecutive  months  and  showing no sign  of  reversal  due  to

sector.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is in regular consultation with retailers,

and  is mindful that, apart from the structural problem of over-capacity   facing  the  retail  sector,  retailers   have   been

particularly  affected during this economic  slowdown.   In  the

recent  off-Budget package, several measures  were  targeted  at

providing relief to retailers:

<pre>

     -    A 40% property tax rebate on commercial properties for the

       year commencing 1st July 1998.  This is on top of the 15% rebate

       announced during the FY98 Budget Statement.   Landlords should

       pass on such tax savings to their tenants.



     -    Suspension of the Carpark Surcharge Scheme with effect from

       1st September 1998.  Currently, a surcharge of $60 per month is

       levied on each lot in non-residential car parks with at least 5

       parking lots in and around the Restricted Zone (RZ).



     -    From 1st September 1998, when Electronic Road Pricing is

       extended to the RZ, the Area Licensing Scheme (ALS) operational

       hours will be shortened on Saturdays.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourism Board has also intensified its

tourist  promotion efforts in markets such as Australia,  China,

Europe,  India  and USA to make up for the declining  number  of

tourists  from ASEAN and Japan. These efforts should have  spin-off benefits for our retailers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retailers themselves have to act to weather the present

upgrading  and  development.  Further details  are  provided  at

apply for such licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ban on satellite dishes for households will continue

for  as  long  as it is effective and useful. The Government  is

committed  to providing an alternative to satellite  television,

through  a  national cable network linking every office,  school

what  percentage  of applicants have found  a  job  through  his

Ministry's    Employment    Assistance    Scheme    since    its

implementation; what sort of jobs they were matched to;  and  if

there  are  clearer indications now on the sectors or  types  of

jobs for which there is a demand but no supply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Service Department (ESD) helps to place job-seekers with employers who posted job vacancies with the

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of this year, the ESD has been

providing  employment assistance to between 900 and  1,600  job-seekers per month. In recent months, the proportion of the  job-seekers  who  were  retrenched  from  their  previous  jobs  has

increased  to  about 25% to 30% each month,  as  compared  to  a

monthly average of 5% in 1997.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ESD has been able to provide job referrals to more than

80%  of  the  job registrants. The majority of job-seekers  were

looking  for clerical, production and general worker  positions.

Our  experience  to  date  shows  that  about  50%  subsequently

declined our job assistance as they were able to find employment

on their own, or they rejected the job offers by the prospective

employers.   The  reasons  cited  for  rejection   include   the

unsuitable nature of work, working hours, location of workplace,

or  salary. Based on companies' feedback, about 10% of the total

job registrants were successfully placed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM is in the process of identifying the sectors for which

demand for skilled manpower is still strong despite the economic

downturn.  This study is necessary as the manpower  requirements

in  the economy have changed considerably since the onset of the

regional  economic  crisis. Our preliminary assessment  is  that

there are still job opportunities in new growth sectors such  as

the    wafer   fabrication,   precision   engineering,   medical

instrumentation and process chemical industries.

<div align="center"><b>LICENCE FOR MOTOR REPAIR AND SERVICE WORKSHOPS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether

work  on  vehicles could be properly attended  and  road  safety

enhanced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roadworthiness of motor vehicles using Singapore roads

is  ensured through regular inspection of the motor vehicles  by

authorised  inspection  centres.  This  practice  in  the  motor

vehicle repair services has served us adequately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries operate differently. The UK Institute of

Motor  Industry  practises self-regulation. It  has  a  code  of

conduct to guide its members in their performance standards  and

in  dealing  with the public and the industry.   The  UK  Retail

Motor Industry Federation does likewise. The American Automobile

Association (AAA) and Society of Automotive Engineers  (SAE)  in

the USA also adopt similar practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, a similar scheme has been adopted by the home

renovation  industry  and is working well.  The  Renovation  and

Decoration  Advisory Council (REDAC) was set up in 1986  by  the

Consumers'   Association   of   Singapore   (CASE),   Renovation

Contractors'   Association  of  Singapore,  Singapore   Building

Materials  Suppliers'  Association and  Singapore  Institute  of

Material Management to promote and regulate the highest standard

of  conduct  and  good practice by industry  members.  It  gives

advice  and  assistance  to contractors  and  consumers  in  the

observance  and  enforcement  of the  Singapore  Renovation  and

Decoration Code of Practice.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This model of an industry regulated code of practice is

worth considering for the motor vehicle industry. The Automobile

Association  of Singapore together with the relevant  motor  and

motor repair industry associations could consider setting up  an

industry  council to set the standards or code  of  practice  to

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching</b> asked the Minister for National

review  its  subletting fee structure on its leased premises  in

view of the deteriorating economic conditions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB allows subletting of its leased commercial and

industrial  premises.   In the case of commercial  premises,  no

subletting  fee  is charged.  Instead, lessees have  to  pay  an

administrative fee of $200 for the processing of the application

to sublet the premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of subletting of HDB leased industrial

premises, which are mainly industrial land leases, HDB charges a

subletting consent fee, except in cases where the subtenants are

wholly-owned subsidiaries of the lessees.  This is because HDB's

industrial  land is not tendered out to the highest bidder,  but

is  allocated to deserving industries, with the support  of  the

EDB.   The  industrial land is intended for the  industrialists'

own  manufacturing activities.  Thus, it is reasonable to impose

a  subletting  consent  fee  to  ensure  that  the  premises  is

essentially  owner-occupied.  HDB's subletting fee structure  is

similar  to that used by JTC.  Under this structure, the minimum

subletting fee is $1,000 per annum.  So far, about 37% or 200 of

HDB's  industrial  lessees have sublet  their  excess  space  to

unrelated companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC has recently reviewed its subletting fee structure

which  will  benefit new subletting cases as well  as  renewals.

Essentially,  the subletting fee will be moderated depending  on

the  plot ratio of factory development (ie. the higher the  plot

ratio, the lower will be the new subletting fee compared to  the

current  fee).  The minimum subletting fee will also be  reduced

from  $1,000 per annum to $500 per annum.  HDB will,  similarly,

be reviewing its fee structure to be consistent with JTC.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education whether there

is a growing problem with discipline in schools and to what

extent can the school discipline the children.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br><i>State of Discipline in Schools</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As SMS Dr Aline Wong explained in Parliament during the

Committee of Supply debate on Education in March this year,  the

state  of  discipline in schools is generally good.   The  great

majority   of   students  are   hardworking,  well-behaved   and

responsible.    Serious  cases  of  breach  of  discipline   are

infrequent occurrences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995, MOE has implemented the Behaviour Tracking and

Analysis  (BETA)  system in schools.  The  system  represents  a

methodical way of collecting data on the state of discipline  in

schools.  The implementation of the BETA system has allowed  MOE

to  collect  data  on  disciplinary cases very  quickly  and  to

respond to changing trends in disciplinary problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records made by schools using the BETA system showed no

significant  statistical change in the  offence  rates  (offence

rates refer to the number of offences per 1000 pupils) from 1995

to  1997.   There is, however, a significantly higher proportion

of  offences  in  the  secondary schools  than  in  the  primary

schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For primary schools, less serious offences such as not

doing  assignments  and  disruptive  behaviour  and  attendance-related offences constitute 84% of the total number of offences.

Offences such as theft/damage to property, assault and fighting,

constitute the bulk of the more serious offences (16%).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secondary schools, top offences were attendance-related (74%), namely late-coming and truancy. Misconduct

offences dropped by 1% to 3% each year over the 3-year period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the stabilising of the offence rate can be

attributed  to the concerted and co-ordinated efforts  taken  by

schools  and  agencies  such  as the  Police,  the  Ministry  of

Community  Development,  the juvenile court,  Voluntary  Welfare

Organisations and self-help groups in managing discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are continuing in their efforts to improve the

state  of discipline.  MOE is also alert to the possible changes

in  trends in discipline problems and juvenile delinquencies and

are taking measures to address potential problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An area of concern is the increase in the number of cases

of  substance abuse from 33 cases in 1995 to 272 cases in  1997.

MOE  and MHA are working very closely together to try to contain

this problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern is the growing offence rate

amongst  female  pupils  in the secondary  schools.  The  female

offence  rates, though lower than the male offence  rates,  have

increased  by  6% to 9% per year compared to the rate  for  boys

which has remained fairly constant.  A committee chaired by  the

Senior  Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline Wong, was  set

up  in May this year to look into the discipline situation among

girls  in schools.  The report by this committee should be ready

by the end of this year.

<br><br><i>Extent School Can Discipline Its Pupils</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has adopted the philosophy that to care is to

discipline.   The extent to which schools care  for  the  pupils

under their charge is the extent to which schools can discipline

its  pupils.   In  general, schools have adopted a  whole-person

approach  to  discipline.  Thus, in the  discipline  of  pupils,

schools are mindful of the needs of the pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools do mete out consequences for misbehaviour,

counselling is often used together with these measures  to  help

the   child  correct  his  behaviour.   Schools  also  work   in

partnership with parents in disciplining their children so  that

they  can  provide  the necessary home support  to  sustain  the

changes in behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While principals are allowed to administer corporal

punishment on male pupils, many schools restrict its use only to

very serious offences such as assaults, extortion and vandalism.

Schools  have to abide by the guidelines on corporal  punishment

provided by MOE.

<div align="center"><b>PRIMARY SCHOOL SYSTEM</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education what is being

done  to  ensure that all children leaving the school system  at

the primary level can read and write in basic English.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English is a core subject in the curriculum. The first 4

years  of  primary school make up the Foundation Stage in  which

the  teaching of English takes up one third of total  curriculum

time.   At the end of the Foundation Stage at Primary 4,  pupils

are assessed on their attainment in listening, speaking, reading

and  writing in English.  Their performance in English, together

with  their attainment in Mathematics and Mother Tongue, decides

the educational programme that pupils will undergo at Primary  5

and 6, the Orientation Stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils who are academically weak and deemed to be best

taught  at a slower pace are placed in the EM3 stream at Primary

5 and 6 where they are taught Foundation English.  In Foundation

English, the minimum targets for reading and writing at the  end

of P6 may be summarised thus:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pupils can read simple stories, newspaper articles and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magazine articles for enjoyment or information;

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pupils can understand the main ideas and details of what

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they read and demonstrate their understanding by correctly

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answering the comprehension and vocabulary questions;

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pupils can generate enough ideas to write a narrative or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;descriptive composition on a familiar topic.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pupils can present ideas in a logical way to complete

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functional types of writing, such as notes, messages, postcards

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and instructions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Ministry provides schools with support in

the following ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Teachers are provided with in-service training so that they

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a range of strategies and approaches to teach weak pupils

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading and writing.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- School libraries are given funds to purchase a variety of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading materials to meet a range of reading abilities;

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Many schools have specialised personnel such as the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning Support Coordinator who assists teachers to plan and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach remedial programmes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures ensure that even the weakest pupils attain

at least the basic literacy skills of reading and writing by the

time they complete 6 years of primary school.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>SUPPLEMENTARY FEES OF SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education whether

schools should be asked to collect less supplementary fees

during the current difficult economic conditions instead of

increasing such levies.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents pay supplementary fees as a contribution towards

the  cost of materials used by pupils in the schools.  In recent

years,  there  had  been  much change to  our  curriculum  which

require  more innovative materials and programmes.  For  schools

which  wish  to  expose  pupils  to  the  myriad  of  innovative

materials available in the market, they have been making ad  hoc

cash  collections  from  pupils.  This makes  it  difficult  for

parents  to  budget for such expenditures, and places  an  extra

administrative burden on teachers and schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give schools the flexibility to reduce the ad hoc cash

collections from the pupils, we decided to allow them  to  raise

the supplementary fees.  Children's Edusave Accounts can be used

to  pay  for the increase in fees.  There will therefore  be  no

increase in cash outlay for the great majority of parents.
