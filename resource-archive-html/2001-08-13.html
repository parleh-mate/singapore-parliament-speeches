<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>RETRENCHMENT SITUATION AND PROJECTION OF JOB CREATION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  he can give an update on the retrenchment  situation

and projection of job creation for this year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, a total of 3,248 workers were retrenched in the

first   quarter   of  this  year.  In  the  second   quarter,

preliminary   findings  of  our  survey  on  private   sector

establishments with at least 25 workers show that some  5,600

workers  were  affected by retrenchments. Based on  voluntary

notifications  by companies to the Ministry,  the  number  of

workers affected by retrenchments in the third quarter  would

be higher than the figures registered in the first and second

quarters. For the whole of this year, the estimated number of

workers  who  may be retrenched could reach 20,000.  This  is

significantly higher than the figure of 11,624  recorded last

year  but  is  lower than the figure of 29,086 retrenched  in

1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total employment in the first quarter of this year rose

by  23,210,  seasonally lower than the  35,066  in  the  last

quarter  of 2000. However, based on changes in employment  up

to  May  and  forecast  of economic conditions  ahead,  total

employment  for  this year is likely to be flat  or  slightly

negative  as  against a sharp employment gain of  108,500  in

2000.  Unemployment is expected to rise to around 4% by  year

end.  However, the  forecast of annual average

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>

unemployment for 2001 is lower in the range of   3%  to  3.5%

because  of the generally lower figures in the first half  as

unemployment tends to lag economic activities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> In view of such a high

number of retrenchments, does the Ministry have any plans  to

help the retrenched workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I will give the Member the

answer when he asks the next Question.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1962</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>SECTORS FACING SHORTAGE OF WORKERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

(a) whether there are sectors currently facing a shortage  of

workers  and,  if  so, which are the sectors;   and  (b)  how

Singaporean  workers can be given assistance to  qualify  for

jobs in these sectors.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the employment

situation, as I have just mentioned earlier, has deteriorated

over  the past few months due to the economic downturn.   The

construction and manufacturing sectors have been  badly  hit,

with   net   employment  declining   by   2,160   and   1,075

respectively,  in  the  first  quarter  of  this  year.    In

contrast,  the  services  sector has  continued  to  register

positive  employment growth of 28,200 over the  same  period.

Job  vacancies  were  highest in the transport,  storage  and

communication industries, which saw nearly 3,000 job openings

in the first quarter of this year.  Other services industries

such  as financial services, wholesale and retail trade  also

had high job vacancies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the situation may have worsened since then, there

are  still job opportunities.  According to industry feedback

in  recent months, there continue to be job vacancies in  the

services  sector.   For  instance, there  is  a  shortage  of

housekeepers, receptionists, waiters/waitresses and cooks  in

the   hotel  and  restaurant  sector;  ambulance  attendants,

healthcare assistants in the healthcare sector; and childcare

assistants in the education

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>

sector.  The  transport and logistics sector is  also  hiring

vehicle mechanics and warehouse assistants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still facing a shortage of nurses, pharmacists,

radiographers  in  the healthcare sector; and  administrative

support  staff  in  the  education sector.   There  are  also

vacancies for network analysts and software developers in the

infocomm  sector; actuaries and underwriters in  the  finance

sector;  and  engineers and technicians in the pharmaceutical

and aerospace industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While manufacturing industries such as the electronics

industry are cutting jobs, there are still jobs available  in

the services sector.  However, the skill sets required in the

services  sector  may be different.  To help  our  older  and

lower skilled retrenched workers make the switch to new jobs,

we  started  a pilot programme called the 'People  for  Jobs'

Traineeship  Programme in June this year.  This  is  like  an

apprentice  programme  for mid-career  workers.   Under  this

programme, my Ministry provides financial support  of  up  to

$3.80  per  hour or $600 per month for 3 months for companies

which  employ  the  older  retrenched  workers.   This   will

encourage  employers to recruit retrenched workers  and  ease

their transition to a new industry and work environment.   To

date, more than 30 companies from various industries like the

hotel,  retail, security service sectors have already  signed

on  with  this  programme.  They have  made  available  1,000

vacancies  for  room attendants, sales assistants,  cashiers,

security officers and others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to help Singaporeans better qualify for the

available positions, my Ministry works closely with  relevant

organisations  to  enhance  the  short  and  long  term   re-employment prospects of retrenched workers through  training.

For  instance,  under the sponsorship of surrogate  employers

such   as   the   NTUC   and  self-help  groups,   retrenched

Singaporeans can benefit from Skills Redevelopment  Programme

training.   To encourage these surrogate employers  to  reach

out  to  more  workers,  from 1st  August  2001,  the  Skills

Development Fund

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1964</b></font><br><br>

will increase its course fee support for trainees aged 40 and

above  under the surrogate employer scheme from 80% to  100%.

As  for trainees below 40 years old, my Ministry will provide

a separate grant from the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to

surrogate employers to help offset part of their cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will equip displaced workers with the

right  skills  for available jobs.  We will  also  supplement

training   efforts  with  employment  assistance   to   match

individuals  with  jobs. The Career Centre  at  my  Ministry,

CareerLink@mom, provides free employment assistance  services

to  Singaporeans.  From this month,  my Ministry will also be

starting  a  series  of community based job  fairs  to  bring

together job seekers and employers.  We target to organise an

average of one job fair per month for the rest of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will do its best to help retrenched

workers  transit to new jobs in new industries  that  require

different skills.  However, we urge retrenched workers to  be

flexible and adaptable, and make the necessary adjustments to

take  on  these jobs, such as accepting shift work  and  even

working occasionally on weekends.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  ask the Minister whether he agrees that the quality of our

services  sector could be further improved compared  to  many

countries, especially the consumer services?  May I also  ask

the  Minister  whether now is the opportune time  to  address

this issue and how would his Ministry address this issue?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot say that my

Ministry is an expert on the quality of service in the retail

sector.   But  we have seen reports or comments where  people

have  felt  that the quality of service of the retail  sector

personnel  needs  further improvement.  If  we  look  at  the

experience of some other countries, I remember in the  middle

of  the  80s, Hong Kong underwent a severe economic downturn.

Prior  to  that,  Hong Kong had a rather poor reputation  for

service  quality  but, as a result of the economic  downturn,

there  was  a  dramatic transformation.  Hong  Kong's  retail

sector,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1965</b></font><br><br>

in  particular, and the services sector, in general,  made  a

really  dramatic improvement in the quality of  service  that

they were offering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, in the same way, with this downturn and the

loosening of the labour market where jobs do not easily  come

by,  people who move into the services sector should  make  a

greater effort to provide better service to ensure that  they

can hold on to their jobs and, in general, that will help  to

raise  the  quality of service.  At the same  time,  training

will  also  make a difference.  That is why in our  programme

like `People for Jobs' Traineeship Programme, one of the  key

factors is to require the employer to provide proper training

for  the  new recruits and part of this training will include

providing better service quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also providing community-based CREST training

modules.  These are basic learning-to-learn skills which  can

help workers to better understand how to relate to customers'

requirements and how to improve the service quality that they

have  to provide.  In fact, there are several programmes that

will  help to enhance the skills and service quality  of  our

retail and services sectors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, it may be more difficult for us

to  shift the existing manufacturing workers to jobs  in  the

healthcare  sector  like  nursing and administrative  support

staff  in  MOE.  But I think it is easier for us to  consider

helping  the  manufacturing workers to move to  jobs  in  the

hotel  and  transport sectors.  Would the  Ministry  consider

some  concrete  plans or conversion programme to  help  these

workers  and,  more importantly, to assist the  employers  so

that  they  will  also change their mindset to  accept  these

older workers from the manufacturing sector?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, the `People for Jobs'

Traineeship Programme will in fact address the concern raised

by the Member.  Those who are shifting from the manufacturing

sector into jobs, whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>

it  is in the transport, warehousing or services sector, will

receive  some training by the employers who will also receive

Government  support  of up to $600 per month  for  the  first

three months of the worker's employment.  This will help them

to overcome the initial difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the jobs in the healthcare sector are

suitable  for  those  in  the  manufacturing  sector  to   be

redeployed  to, there are some jobs in the healthcare  sector

that   require  almost  professional  qualifications  and   I

understand  it will not be easy for people to shift  over  to

these  jobs.   But  there  are also jobs  in  the  healthcare

sector, for instance, nursing assistants or nursing aides who

help  in  the general running of providing basic services  in

the  hospitals, which can be taken but, of course, with  some

form  of  training, because it is a totally different working

environment and the requirements are quite different.  But we

are  prepared to help employers who are ready to recruit  the

displaced  workers from the manufacturing sector and  to  put

them into these jobs in the healthcare sector.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask

the  Minister three questions.  The first is, while I commend

these  extra efforts, may I enquire how much this would cost.

The second question is:  are there targets?  How effective do

we  hope to be in creating the number of jobs that we hope to

create  or  match?  And thirdly, can I ask  the  Minister  if

there will be a special effort to target or differentiate the

higher  educated, the white-collar and managerial people  who

will lose jobs?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we set out with a

modest  budget  to  start off as a pilot  project  for  these

people for a jobs programme in June this year.  But since the

situation has got worse since then, we are prepared to  raise

the  budget and, as my colleague, the Minister for Trade  and

Industry, said on 25th July when he announced the package  of

measures,  the  Government is prepared  to  put  in  as  much

financial resources as necessary to keep this programme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1967</b></font><br><br>

running  as  long as there are takers from the employers  and

there  are  workers who are prepared to make  the  effort  to

acquire  the  new  skills  to  work  in  the  jobs  that  are

available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How effective? We will measure the effectiveness at the

end  of  the  day  by the rate at which we can  redeploy  the

displaced  workers  from the manufacturing  sector  into  the

services  sector.   In a way, it is to avoid  increasing  the

degree   of  structural  unemployment  among  our  workforce,

because if we do not succeed in making this redeployment, and

knowing  that many of the manufacturing sector's  low-skilled

jobs are unlikely to return even if the economy turns around,

we  may  well be saddled with a very high level of structural

unemployment.  So at the end of the day, we can  measure  how

effective  our  programmes  are  if  we  are  able  to   keep

structural unemployment as low as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question about special efforts to differentiate

the  higher skilled workers, as I mentioned in my main reply,

there  are also jobs for the higher skilled workers that  are

available today in the infocomm sector.  For instance, in the

healthcare sector, there are also jobs for professionals.  As

I  have  also  mentioned previously, for most of  the  higher

educated,  it  is  not so much a question of  further  skills

upgrading,  because they are already highly  skilled,  highly

educated  individuals.  So they may be far more adaptable  to

take  on different kinds of jobs with different requirements.

Their job skills may not perfectly fit what is available now.

Nevertheless, we are prepared to help them acquire a  set  of

skills  that can help them in taking on the new jobs,  and  I

refer  specifically to a programme that we launched in  1999.

This  is  called the Strategic Manpower Conversion Programme.

This  is  a  programme  that will reach  out  to  the  better

educated  who need to acquire a different set of job  skills,

eg,  those who are already degree or diploma holders  but  do

not  have  sufficient expertise in the infocomm sector.   And

this is one sector that is still generating job vacancies and

looking for people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are prepared to help them undergo a short period

of  training to acquire the infocomm skills, then they can go

into  these  jobs.   We  have  extended  the  programme  from

infocomm to e-learning and we will be looking at other  areas

where  we  can likewise provide a similar conversion training

for  the  better  educated  so that  they  can  take  on  the

available jobs.

<div align="center"><b>PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a)   how   many   schools  have  established  Parent-Teacher

Associations  (PTAs); (b) whether schools with PTAs  (i)  are

effective in fostering shared responsibility between teachers

and  parents in the children's education; and (ii) have  less

complaints by parents against teachers.

<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, about two-thirds of our schools

have  established parent support structures.  Out  of  these,

about  5% of them have registered parent-teacher associations

(PTAs)  and about 65% have established parent support  groups

(PSGs).   Parent  support groups are more informal,  allowing

parents to contribute their time and effort whenever they are

able  to  do  so,  and the remaining schools are  in  varying

stages of setting up their parent support structures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These structures have helped foster a shared

responsibility between parents and teachers in the children's

education.   The  PTAs  and  PSGs  serve  as  a  channel   of

communication  and feedback between parents and  the  school,

and help develop better parent-school understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTAs and PSGs also participate in the organisation

and  execution of school activities for the school  children.

Many of them bring valuable expertise and experience for  the

benefit of the school children.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, up to now, we do not have data on the number of

complaints  by parents against teachers at the school  level.

However,  the general feeling among principals  is  that  the

regular  dialogue  between PTAs, PSGs and  the  schools,  and

their participation in school activities have resulted in  an

improvement  in  the  relationship between  the  schools  and

parents.

<div align="center"><b>MEDISAVE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Use for annual medical check-ups)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Sin Boon Ann</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  his Ministry will consider reviewing the  guidelines

to include the use of Medisave for annual medical check-ups.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Medisave  scheme  is primarily  designed  to  help

individuals   meet  their  personal  or  immediate   family's

hospitalisation   expenses,  especially   during   old   age.

However, over the years, we have extended Medisave to certain

outpatient treatment, such as chemotherapy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has considered extending the use of Medisave

for health screening, including annual medical check-ups, and

decided  against it.  First, there are many types  of  health

screening, of which many are not cost effective.  Second, for

certain cost-effective health screenings, such as mammography

and  pap  smear, my Ministry has already made them affordable

by  providing heavy subsidies at the polyclinics.   Also,  we

have introduced the Community Health Screening Programme  for

the  elderly to detect diabetes, hypertension and high  blood

cholesterol.  Again, the cost is minimal, as the elderly pays

up   to  $5  for  the  screening  which  costs  around   $20.

Therefore, Singaporeans need not rely on Medisave to pay  for

cost-effective health screening.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the temptation to liberalise Medisave

for  various types of healthcare services.  We have to  guard

against such a tendency, as an overly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>

liberal  extension  of Medisave will result  in  even  higher

rates of contributions into the Medisave Account.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I would like to ask

the  Minister whether he will consider reviewing the  various

types of medical screening that are available, because we all

know  that with advancements in technology, certain kinds  of

test  can  actually  help one detect  serious  illness  early

enough  and,  with early detection, it will help Singaporeans

manage their Medisave savings better in the long term.  So  I

would  like  to  ask the Minister whether  he  will  consider

looking  at  the  various  kinds of screening  again  to  see

whether these can be introduced at some point of time in  the

future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is indeed what

we have done.  We all believe in evidence-based medicine, and

we  regularly  look  at the tests which  are  done.   If  the

clinical  trials  and the tests show that  certain  types  of

screening  are indeed effective, then we introduce these  and

we  make  these mass-based.  This we have done for pap  smear

and  mammography,  and we have also done, for  the  community

health screening, for diabetes and high blood cholesterol and

hypertension.   But  there  is  a  wide  range   of   medical

screenings.  So we look at the evidence and, if the  evidence

shows  that a nation-wide mass screening is effective, we  do

indeed undertake this screening.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can think of one

example  of  screening that would help manage  the  patients'

medical resources in the long term.  For instance, if we  can

scope Singaporeans intensively and aggressively, we can  help

detect  some  form  of stomach cancer and colorectal  cancer.

And  early detection in these areas of cancer would be useful

for the patients concerned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no evidence

right  now that a nation-wide scoping, as Mr Sin puts it,  is

going  to be cost effective in preventing or detecting  these

cancers  early  enough.   There  are  just  too  many   false

positives and false negatives involved.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1971</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister

for  Health whether he agrees that prevention is better  than

cure.   If  it  is,  would he not encourage  more  people  to

practise this concept using their own funds by allowing  them

to  go  for health screening for the common cancers, such  as

colorectal  cancer as mentioned earlier by  my  parliamentary

colleague,  Mr  Sin Boon Ann, and breast cancer  using  their

Medisave?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do believe that prevention is

better  than cure and, therefore, I urge all Singaporeans  to

have  a  very  healthy lifestyle.  Screening  is  not  a  key

mechanism  for  prevention.  If we all undertake  to  have  a

healthy  lifestyle, we will go a long way  in  making  health

care affordable and reducing healthcare costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I have not ruled out health screening as

a  useful  device.   But before we undertake  a  mass  health

screening  and  also  allow Medisave to be  used  for  health

screening, we have to be very careful.  First, we have to  be

convinced  that  the  health screening based  on  trials  and

evidence is effective, otherwise we undertake a major  health

screening  and  we get people all worked up, too  many  false

results and it is not money put to good use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must remember that Medisave is really

intended  as savings for medical treatment for old age.   The

amount  of money that we put aside for Medisave is estimated,

for  the  average  Singaporean, to pay for  about  10  or  11

hospitalisation  episodes.  So if we  ask  our  constituents,

those  below 60 years old, as I do regularly in the  dialogue

sessions, to put up their hands if they had been hospitalised

more  than twice or thrice, very few had done so.   In  fact,

most  of  the hospitalisation episodes are when we  are  old,

when  we are 65, 70 or 75.  That is the whole purpose of  the

Medisave  account - to save for the day when we  are  retired

and  we  have  to pay for our hospitalisation.  When  we  are

still active, earning and have our own savings, we should use

these  to  pay for the other types of health screening  which

different  people want to undergo, and reserve  the  Medisave

accounts for hospitalisation in our old age.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1972</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask

the  Minister what other new healthy lifestyle programmes his

Ministry will be promoting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We stick to the old one, ie, do not

smoke, eat healthily, exercise, manage our stress.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek your patience

and  indulgence of the hon. Members of this House?  I beg  to

differ with the Minister for Health on what he has just said.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, 4,220 Singaporeans died from cancers,

constituting about 27% of all deaths.  Colorectal  cancer  is

the  commonest  cancer among Singapore  men  and  women,  and

breast cancer is the most frequent killer of Singapore women.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Neo, can you ask your question?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, can I seek your patience? I am

coming to my question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you ask your question now?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I will come to it, Sir, because I need to

state the facts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry. You will have to frame your

facts in your question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> All right. Mr Speaker, Sir, the most

important  factor is early detection.  Therefore, may  I  ask

the  Minister  for  Health whether he  will  facilitate  more

people  to  go for early detection by allowing  them  to  use

their Medisave?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not dispute the number of people

who  died  through  cancer.  People also  die  through  heart

disease,  strokes and many other causes.   The  approach  is,

really,  for effective mass screening, we do encourage.   For

mammography, we have it in our polyclinics, and we  subsidise

it up to 50%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think cost is the main deterrent in people

coming   forward   for   screening.    We   have   run   free

mammographies, and the take-up rate is still very low.  So it

is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>

whole  process  of  education  and  getting  people  to  come

forward.  Cost is not the key issue here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other forms of health screening, where there is evidence

that  they are effective, we would do so.  Colorectal  cancer

is  one  of  the  key  cancer killers in Singapore.   We  are

looking at other tests, not necessarily scoping, as a way  of

doing some kind of screening.  We are still in the process of

evaluating the efficacy of such tests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would urge against a trigger-happy use of our

Medisave.    Medisave   should  be   largely   utilised   for

hospitalisation episodes in the later stages of our life.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether it is

correct  to say that mammography in the polyclinics  is  only

applicable  to women aged 50 years and above on demand,  that

there is no population screening programme and there is  also

a  co-payment  fee of $50 for each screening?  But  since  an

average of three women are diagnosed with breast cancer, half

of  them are below 50 years of age, and that breast cancer is

curable if detected early, should not the Minister facilitate

more women to go for early screening and save lives?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have to use our Medisave

carefully.  I sympathise entirely with women who want  to  do

their  breast screening early.  I would urge them to  do  so.

My  usual reply to them is:  save on one hairdo and  use  the

money  for  breast screening.  I have been taken to  task  by

many of my hairdressers in Telok Blangah but I think this  is

still my main message.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it is

better  to  use  Medisave to detect early diseases  and  save

lives  rather than safeguarding the Medisave for old age  and

end-stage  diseases by which time, the funds in the  Medisave

would  have  been made redundant in the case of  cancers  for

such patients?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, if the Members here support an

increase  in  the Medisave contribution rate, I  would  allow

Medisave to be used for such screening.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to register

my  thanks  to  the Minister for Health for his consideration

and   may   I  also  urge  the  Minister  to  expedite   this

reconsideration.   But, Sir, would he  also  comment  on  the

colonoscopy for colorectal cancer, please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I have already said so in my reply

that  there is no strong evidence that mass screening through

colonoscopy  works.   There are studies done  in  the  United

States  and other countries and there is no evidence  to  say

that  mass  screening works.  We are looking at the evidence.

We  are  looking  at  such clinical tests  and  when  we  are

convinced that it is effective, we would do so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether I am

correct  to say that colonoscopy is actually the most  widely

and  currently advocated screening test for colorectal cancer

and  is, at the moment, being adopted by America because they

have  very  high  incidence of colorectal  cancer  just  like

Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I have had this debate in my Ministry

many times and my doctors tell me that right now, there is no

evidence, on efficacy grounds, to do it in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Is the Minister suggesting therefore

that  the  annual executive health screening  programme  that

some  of  us  go through is not really an effective  form  of

medical detection?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> It is an effective screening and I

think  you should use your cash to pay for it.  For the  bulk

of  Singaporeans, if they all just turn up for the  community

health  screening,  I  will  be  very  happy  as  the  Health

Minister.   Even if I allow Medisave to be used for executive

health  screening,  it  would  not  be  the  bottom  50%   of

Singaporeans who will go for this screening and this  is  the

group  that presents the greatest challenge for us,  not  the

top  30%.  And even if you go for executive health screening,

you  do not scope every year.  The doctors would tell you  if

you are in the high-risk group, and you only scope if you are

above 50 years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>

old.   If you can afford it and you want to do it every year,

by all means, do so.  But please do not use Medisave.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, would the Minister not agree with

me  that  it  is precisely for the bottom 50% of Singaporeans

who cannot afford the cash outlay that they need to use these

Medisave resources, which is their own money, for the purpose

of this health screening?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> For the bottom 50%, if they turn up

first  for the community health screening, it will go a  long

way  to minimise the health problems faced by them.  That  is

our  priority.  That is our main challenge - to get the older

folks and lower-income people to do regular health screening.

The  $20  health  screening  will  go  a  very  long  way  in

minimising all these chronic illnesses.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I essentially

think that we probably are alarmed.  I would like to ask  the

Minister, before I get called to order, if we could have  the

reassurance that for all the efficacious screening tests that

can  be  done, his Ministry will do the best to expeditiously

implement such screening programmes so that, in fact,  we  do

not  have  to resort to liberalising the use of Medisave.   I

think that may be a better way of going about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> My Ministry would definitely do so.

We  are  in charge of healthcare.  We want the best  outcomes

for Singaporeans.  If we are assured that health screening is

effective,  you  can have my assurance that  we  will  do  it

quickly.

<div align="center"><b>PATENTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.05 pm

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill seeks to modify provisions in the Patents

Act  concerning  the  regulation  of  patent  agents  and  to

introduce  a number of minor amendments to streamline  patent

administration and strengthen the patent legal framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would touch on the modifications of patent

agents provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 14 seeks to amend sections 104 and 105 of

the  Patents  Act  to  improve the provisions  governing  the

regulation of patent agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Sir, that when the Patents Act was

brought  into force in 1995, we delayed the entry into  force

of  sections 104 and 105, in so far as they relate to  patent

agents.  The reason for that was that we wanted to allow time

for fledgling patent regime to mature before starting our own

patent  agent  profession.  More than  five  years  have  now

passed  since  Singapore first had our own indigenous  patent

regime.   I  think  the time is now right to  start  our  own

patent agent profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, sections 104 and 105 will have to be modified

before bringing them into operation.  We seek to modify those

provisions  after  the  corresponding provisions  in  the  UK

patents law.  They place no restrictions on the categories of

persons  who can provide patent agent services.  They  merely

prohibit  persons who are not registered patent  agents  from

describing themselves as patent agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That situation, Sir, is peculiar to the United Kingdom.

All  the  other  major  jurisdictions we  have  studied,  for

example,   the  United  States,  Australia,  France,   Japan,

Germany,  and the European Patent Office have a more rigorous

regulatory regime.  They all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>

require  a  person  to attain certain minimum  qualifications

before  he  is  allowed to practise as a patent  agent.    We

believe that Singapore should adopt a more rigorous system of

regulation  in  order to promote our drive to be  a  regional

dynamic intellectual property hub.  We should be mindful that

a  single high-profile mistake, made by an unqualified patent

agent  whom  we have allowed to practise here,  could  easily

damage Singapore's reputation as an IPR hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised sections 104 and 105 therefore provide that

only  registered  patent agents and lawyers  are  allowed  to

provide  patent  agent services.  This model was  adopted  in

Australia.  Individuals will only be allowed to be registered

as  patent agents if they meet the qualifying criteria set by

the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore or benefit from

the transitional provisions, all of which will be provided in

the  Rules.   With  this  amendment, only  registered  patent

agents  will  be  allowed to hold themselves  out  as  patent

agents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualifying criteria to be set by the Intellectual

Property Office of Singapore will be similar to those in  the

United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan.  First of

all,  applicants  will  have to attend a  16-week  foundation

course in intellectual property law conducted by the National

University  of  Singapore Law Faculty and obtain  a  Graduate

Certificate in IP Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they will have to undergo a one-year

internship  programme under the supervision of  a  prescribed

registered   patent  agent.   The  Asian   Patent   Attorneys

Association,   International   Federation   of   Intellectual

Property  Attorneys (FICPI) and the Law Society of  Singapore

will  assist  in  the  securing of both  overseas  and  local

placements.  The National Science and Technology  Board  will

assist  in  co-funding  the course fees  and  payment  of  an

allowance  to  the  applicants  during  internship  (if   the

applicant  is co-sponsored by a corporate body), through  its

Manpower   Upgrading  for  Science  and   Technology   (MUST)

programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the applicants will have to pass a qualifying

examination  set  by  the  Intellectual  Property  Office  of

Singapore.   Provisions  would be  put  in  place  to  enable

flexibility in meeting certain registration requirements such

as  waivers of certain components, courses, as are adopted in

other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards transitional arrangements for IP lawyers

currently practising as patent agents, some lawyers today are

already using the term "patent agent" to describe themselves.

As  such,  provisions  will be made in  the  rules  to  allow

lawyers  who  currently  have an active  patent  practice  to

register  themselves as patent agents, without having  to  go

through the qualifying examinations.  This approach has  been

worked  out in consultation with the Law Society of Singapore

and   the   Asian  Patent  Attorneys  Association  (Singapore

Chapter).  But we have to be satisfied that they indeed  have

had an active patent practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rights of audience, clause 13(a) of the Bill

will  amend  section  94(1) to provide that  only  registered

patent   agents   and  lawyers  may  represent   parties   in

proceedings before the Registrar of Patents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13(c) will amend section 94(2) to provide that

only  lawyers  may represent parties in an  appeal  from  the

Registrar to the High Court.  The current section 94(2) would

have  allowed  registered patent agents to appear  in  Court.

But  then this again is a provision adopted from the UK  law.

In  the  United Kingdom, this provision posed no difficulties

as they have a specialised Patents Court.  Our system is more

in   line  with  that  of  Australia,  where  there  are   no

specialised  patents courts, and thus no  special  rights  of

audience  in  the courts for patent agents.   Let  me  stress

that  no accrued rights are affected by this change as  there

are as yet no registered patent agents in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on other minor amendments, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as regards the removal of dependency on a patent

being in force in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>

United Kingdom, section 36(4) provides for rules that require

the  submissions of renewals of patents registered under  the

repealed  Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act,  to  be

accompanied  by  a  statutory  declaration  that  the  patent

remains  in  force  or  has not been revoked  in  the  United

Kingdom.  We are removing this restriction as the renewal  of

a  Singapore patent, in our view, should not be dependent  on

whether  it  is  in  force  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  a

proprietor  should be free to maintain his Singapore  patent.

This is provided in clause 8(b).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, section 116(3) is a transitional provision that

provides  for  the  continued validity of patents  previously

registered under the repealed Registration of United  Kingdom

Patents  Act,  as long as the patent is not  revoked  in  the

United Kingdom.  We are similarly removing this condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the Bill also includes amendments that

will  modify  certain  procedural  requirements  relating  to

applications   and   grants   of  patents,   facilitate   the

implementation  of  an  electronic patent  register  and  the

maintenance of information in an electronic environment,  and

dispense  with the need to gazette new entrants to the  Paris

Convention and WTO as convention countries.  It also  extends

the  protection  of visiting aircraft and ships  from  patent

infringement  proceedings  to ships  and  aircraft  from  WTO

countries,  and will remove doubts concerning the  Minister's

rule-making powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to speak in support of this Bill,  which  is  a

further  step in building the legal infrastructure  necessary

to sustain a knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House debated the setting up of the Intellectual

Property Office (IPOS) only in February.  Now we are  looking

at   another  dimension  of  intellectual  property,  namely,

patents.  In particular, this Bill seeks to regulate  further

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>

patenting system in Singapore, which means the provision  for

a  register  of  patent  agents in  Singapore.   This  is  an

important  legal  institution in an  economy  that  places  a

premium on creativity and enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek clarifications on a couple of

matters  relating  to the registration of patent  agents  and

their  practice.   First, if I read clause 14  correctly,  no

one,  individual, partner or director, can refer to  himself,

the partnership or the company respectively as a patent agent

or patent attorney unless the individual, partner or director

is  a registered patent agent.  Can the Minister confirm that

this is the position?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, would this mean that no lawyer or law firm can

actually  say  that they are in the practice of  patent  law?

Clause 14 contains a new section 105(4) which describes  what

the  practice of a patent agent is.  This seems  to  describe

also  what  certain law firms currently are  doing  in  their

intellectual property departments.  Can they continue  to  do

so  if  they  do  not  have  a partner  or  director  who  is

registered  as  a  patent agent?  This  interpretation  could

cause  immense problems for the well-established  law  firms,

which  usually  employ foreign patent agents,  to  draft  the

technical  parts  of  a  patent application.   Once  the  new

provisions come into force, will these firms still be able to

call  themselves as being in the practice of patent law?   If

not, would this not be regarded as a drawback to developing a

strong   legal   practice  in  patent  law  and   indeed   in

intellectual property law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I am also concerned that by employing

just one registered patent agent as a partner or director,  a

law  firm  can then immediately advertise itself as being  in

patent law practice.  I am sure that we do not want law firms

who  are  not adequately equipped with intellectual  property

law  expertise to elevate themselves into this lucrative  but

specialised practice of patent application.  I agree with the

Minister  that  a  botched patent application  can  cause  an

inventor  millions of dollars.  Should we then not look  very

seriously at other criteria concerning this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>

matter of who or what firm can be called properly patent  law

agents or patent law attorneys?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am also troubled by the fact that in

February,  when we debated the IPOS Bill, there  was  then  a

provision  requiring  intellectual property  advisers  to  be

registered.   I  raised the concern then that this  might  be

over  regulating and that the scope of that section  was  too

wide.  Here, I wonder whether we are also drawing the correct

line in specifying that a firm with a registered patent agent

as  a partner can describe itself as being in the business of

patent  law but not otherwise.  While I support the  Bill  in

general,  I  hope that more attention would be paid  to  this

issue.   I also hope that some attempt be made to rationalise

these   provisions  with  the  provision  in  the  IPOS   Act

concerning  intellectual  property  advisers.   Otherwise  we

shall  be  requiring  multiple registrations.   For  example,

lawyers who want to be in patent law practice, they may  have

to  register as intellectual property advisers, patent agents

and,  of  course, advocates and solicitors.  Is  this  really

what we intend?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister would be prepared to look into

the  prospect of future amendments, if needed.  And  on  that

note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I thank Prof. Chin for supporting

the  Bill.   He has raised a few questions which  I  have  to

clarify.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain the present situation and what the

Bill  seeks  to do.  Under the present situation, any  lawyer

and  any  law  firm  can  advise on  patent  law  and  patent

application process.  Any lawyer and law firm, at the moment,

can  hold  himself and the firm as a patent agent.  What  the

amendment  seeks  to do is to restrict the instances  of  any

lawyer  or  law firm holding themselves out as  a  registered

patent  agent.  But we will not prevent a law firm or  lawyer

from  continuing to be engaged in the practice of patent law.

I will make that overall clarification first.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will turn to his specific question. First, he

asked  whether he has read clause 14 correctly, ie,  no  one,

individual,  partner or director, can refer to himself  as  a

patent  agent  unless the individual is a  registered  patent

agent or the firm has at least one partner or director  as  a

registered patent agent.  Indeed, that is so, and his reading

of it is correct.  But Prof. Chin is not correct when he goes

on  to extrapolate from this that this means that a law  firm

from now onwards will not be able to say that they are in the

practice  of patent law.  This is incorrect, because  lawyers

and  law firms can continue to be engaged in the practice  of

patent law.  In fact, I would say that they will even be able

to  advertise  the fact that they can advise on  patent  law.

What  they  cannot  do  is to say that they  are   registered

patent  agents or firm of patent agents.  Let me  stress  why

this  is  important because we do not want the public  to  be

confused and to be under the impression that partners in  the

firm  have  gone through this rigorous qualification  process

and  have  obtained  the qualifications to become  registered

patent agents when they are not.  This position that we  have

in  this  amending Bill has, in fact, been adopted  from  the

model in Australia, and it has worked well there.   I am told

that  it  has  not raised any problems concerning  the  legal

profession there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin, in a sense, in his comments, has expressed

concern  whether the provisions are too strict.  And  in  the

closing  part  of what he said expressed concern  whether  it

would be too wide, that illustrates the problem which we have

to  attend to.  In the present model, any lawyer can practise

patent  law.  Any lawyer can hold himself out as a registered

patent agent.  Sections 104 and 105, which we are now seeking

to  amend,  as  they stand, would require a  law  firm  or  a

company  to have every one of the partners and every  one  of

the  directors to be a registered patent agent, which I think

is  too strict.  So, what we are seeking to do is to say that

at  least one of the partners ought to be a registered patent

agent.   I think this is a reasonable balance because,  in  a

law  firm,  you may have many other partners being conversant

and competent in different areas.  And,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>

as  I said, this practice has worked well in Australia and  I

think it ought to work well for our purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin has expressed concern over the

possibility of over regulation.  I hope that, to some extent,

I  have  allayed that concern because, partly, it stems  from

his  interpretation  of the provisions that  it  may  prevent

lawyers from engaging in the practice of patent law.  But  he

also  based  his concern on the IPOS Bill when he  said  that

there   was  a  provision  requiring  intellectual   property

advisers  to  be registered.  I think Prof. Chin  might  have

misinterpreted the provisions in the IPOS Bill, because there

is  no provision which requires IP advisers to be registered.

What he might be thinking about is the enabling provision  in

the  IPOS Bill which at some time in the future, if and  when

the  situation requires, would enable the statutory board  to

bring  about a situation of registration.  But there  is,  as

such,  no requirement now under the law for an IP adviser  to

be  registered,  and  we  explained in  this  House  why  the

situations can arise where the enabling provision might  have

to  be  invoked.  So his concern that there may  be  multiple

registrations is, in fact, not the case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope I have explained all the concerns of Prof.

Chin  and  I  am  glad that he has noted that  there  can  be

serious consequences if persons who are not qualified to  act

as  registered patent agents were to do so and in the  course

of doing so, commit a serious mistake.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister

for  his  clarifications.  I would just like to confirm  that

even under the Bill, if passed and brought into force, a  law

firm  can  therefore still engage in the practice  of  patent

law.   But  do I understand him to say that they  could  also

advertise themselves as being in the practice of patent  law,

even  if they do not have any partner registered as a  patent

agent?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, perhaps I should be a bit more

circumspect  in talking about law firms advertising,  because

that must be dealt with by the profession, as to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>

the circumstances in which law firms can advertise and so on.

But  as far as this Bill is concerned, it does not prevent  a

lawyer  or  an advocate and solicitor from practising  patent

law.  And perhaps if you look at the bottom of page 6 of  the

Bill, new section 105(1) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An individual shall not carry on a business, practise

or  act  as  a patent agent unless he is a registered  patent

agent,  or an advocate and solicitor, [this is the key point]

.'



Then you look at page 7, paragraph (4)(c) which says, "giving

advice  ..  about the validity, or infringement, of patents."

New section 105(1) deals with the situation of  practising as

a  patent  agent.   New section 105(5) is a  provision  which

deals  with holding oneself out as a registered patent agent.

It says:

<pre>

     'An individual shall not  -

      (b)   in  the  course of a business otherwise  describe

himself,  hold himself out or permit himself to be  described

or held out as a "patent agent",'

</pre>

So  it  is  an  interplay of these different provisions  that

brought about the position that I have described in my answer

to his question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Prime Minister, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary elections are of vital importance to

Singapore  and  should be conducted in  a  fair  and  orderly

manner,  free  from  distractions and undue  influence.   Our

electoral processes also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>

need to be updated to take into account new developments such

as  the  Internet.   This  Bill proposes  amendments  to  the

Parliamentary  Elections Act to, firstly, regulate  political

campaigning   on   the  Internet;  secondly,   prohibit   the

publication  during the election period  of  the  results  of

opinion surveys on how electors intend to vote; and, thirdly,

disallow a person from contesting simultaneously in more than

one constituency.  I will cover each of these issues in turn.

<br><br><i>Internet Political Campaigning</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Election in 1997 took place under rules that

predated the Internet and did not allow political parties  to

post   election  materials  on  their  websites  during   the

campaign.   At  the  time,  few  people  had  access  to  the

Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the five years since, the popularity of the Internet

has  grown  tremendously.  Singapore already has the  highest

Internet penetration rate in Asia at 48%.  Broadband  access,

which  currently  stands at around 90,000  subscribers,  will

become even more widespread in a few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, contrary to what the media have been

speculating,  the Government has decided to  allow  political

campaigning on the Internet in the upcoming General Election.

However,  a  free-for-all  Internet  campaigning  environment

without  rules is not advisable.  The Internet is  a  double-edged   sword.    Whilst   it  facilitates   discussion   and

communication,  the seriousness of political debates  may  be

cluttered  by  noise,  mischief  or  frivolities  during  the

election period.  Worse, the anonymity in the Internet  opens

a  door  for surreptitious elements to mislead, distract  and

confuse  the public.  On the Internet, once a false story  or

rumour is started, it is like water that has been spilt.   It

is  almost  impossible to remedy matters, especially  in  the

limited period of an election campaign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always maintained that politics

should  be  based  on factual and objective  presentation  of

issues, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>

reasoned  debate.   Regulations are  therefore  necessary  to

protect  the  integrity of our electoral process,  and  guide

responsible use of the Internet during the elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the new provisions on Internet

campaigning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill inserts new sections 78A to 78E.

Section  78A  will  empower the Minister to make  regulations

concerning  Internet "election advertising"  (as  defined  in

clause 2) during the election period from the day the writ of

election  is  issued to the close of all polling stations  on

Polling Day.  These regulations will apply to political party

websites  and non-party political websites which are required

to  be  registered with the Singapore Broadcasting  Authority

under  its  Class  Licence  Scheme.   The  regulations   will

stipulate the features which these websites may contain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For party political websites, the allowable features

will include party posters and manifesto, candidate profiles,

announcements  of  party events, party  position  on  issues,

moderated  chats  and discussion forums.  However,  non-party

political  sites  should not campaign  for  any  party.   For

example,  they should not display party banners or  candidate

profiles.  Such restrictions are necessary to ensure a  level

playing field and that political parties do not make  use  of

non-party political sites to circumvent the rules on election

campaigning,   including  accountability  for  all   election

expenses  and political donations.  The full list of Internet

features will be released when it is finalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 78B will prohibit new displays of, or

changes in, election advertising in all media on Polling Day.

This is in line with current rules to disallow campaigning on

Polling Day.  This practice allows voters to reflect and vote

in  an atmosphere free from new election advertising messages

on  Polling Day.  Section 78B, however, does not prohibit the

publication  of any news or current affairs coverage  of  the

election in newspapers or in radio and television broadcasts.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for contravening section 78A and 78B are,

upon  conviction, a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment

for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.

<br><br><i>"Election Survey" and Exit Polls</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the issue of the impact of

opinion polls on the electoral process and election outcomes.

Opinion  polls or surveys often give the illusion  that  they

reflect  public opinion on certain issues and  could  mislead

the  public.  Quick polls often use small sample  sizes,  bad

question  design and improper sampling, leading to inaccurate

or   slanted  results.   For  instance,  in  the  recent   US

Presidential  Elections,  the early projections  of  election

results  by  the major media networks were faulty  and  might

have influenced the election outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet makes it easy for anyone to conduct a

survey  online  without  proper controls,  often  leading  to

misleading  or  confusing results.   Let  me  cite  a  recent

example.   A  local website ran a poll on whether  the  death

penalty  in  Singapore was supported. During the first  seven

days  of  the poll, some 83% of the respondents had voted  in

favour  of  the  death penalty.  Within the next  four  days,

however,  there was an about-turn resulting in  the  converse

finding  that  69% of the respondents were not in  favour  of

capital punishment.  How did such an about-turn occur?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opinion polls can also give rise to a "horse-race"

mentality,  which  can  distract  voters  from  learning  the

candidates' qualifications and their positions on key issues.

This unhealthy preoccupation with survey results distorts and

trivialises  the  election process  and  the  seriousness  of

purpose   of   a   General  Election.   Laws  governing   the

publication of opinion poll results will need to  be  put  in

place to prevent this from occurring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 30 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia have

imposed  embargoes  on the publication  of  election  opinion

polls  and  exit  polls prior to, and on, Polling  Day.   For

example, in Luxembourg, the embargo period is more than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>

30  days, for Italy 28 days, Venezuela 15 days and France  14

days.  For Switzerland, Chile and Mexico, it is 7 days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill will insert a new section 78C to

prohibit  the  publication of the results  of  any  "election

survey" which is defined as an opinion survey of how electors

will  vote at an election in respect of any candidate,  group

of  candidates,  political party or issue  identifiable  with

them.   This  embargo  will apply to all  media,  during  the

election period from the day of the issue of writ of election

to Polling Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Act already prohibits the publication of

exit  polls.   To remove any ambiguity, the new  section  78D

explicitly disallows the publication of exit poll results  in

all media on Polling Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for contravening the new sections 78C and

78D would be, upon conviction, a fine not exceeding $1,000 or

imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.

<br><br><i>Multiple nominations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now deal with clause 5 of the

Bill on the issue of multiple nominations in an election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the Act does not prohibit a person from

contesting in two or more constituencies in an election.   He

may  even be returned successfully in all the constituencies.

However, Article 47 of the Constitution requires him to  give

up  all but one seat, as it stipulates that one cannot  be  a

Member of Parliament for more than one constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An election candidate must be committed to a

constituency when he contests there.  Since the candidate can

only  take  up  one  seat even if he wins in  more  than  one

constituency, there is no reason why he should be allowed  to

stand for election in more than one constituency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing law dates back to 1947, when the Singapore

Legislative Council Elections Ordinance 1947 was enacted,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>

and   has   its  origins  in  Victorian  England.    Multiple

candidatures  are disallowed in Australia,  New  Zealand,  UK

local  elections and European Parliament elections.  As there

is  no good reason for this provision to continue to exist in

Singapore,  the Government has decided to amend  the  Act  to

disallow multiple nominations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 inserts a new section 32A to deal with multiple

nominations  at a general election or when two  or  more  by-elections  are being held at the same time.  The new  section

provides   that  if  a  candidate  does  not  withdraw   from

nominations in all the electoral divisions for which  he  has

been  nominated except one, he will have all his  nominations

invalidated  by  the  law.  If his  nomination  for  a  Group

Representation  Constituency is invalidated,  the  nomination

for the rest of the group would also be invalidated unless it

can  quickly  file  a fresh nomination before  the  close  of

nominations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to speak in support of the Bill.  With rapid advances in

technology  and with one of the highest Internet penetrations

in Asia, it has become increasingly more difficult to monitor

and   control   political  activities  on  the  Internet   in

Singapore.   This  move by the Government  to  further  relax

Internet  campaigning  based on a `positive  list'  approach,

stipulating  contents which are allowed into political  sites

during  election  is  indeed a step in the  right  direction.

Sir,  this  is  also  in line with our gradual  move  towards

liberalisation of our censorship policies and the media as we

become  a  more developed country.  We would recall that  the

General  Election  in 1997, just four years  ago,  prohibited

political  campaigning on the Internet.   This  amendment  is

therefore  a step forward.  I am sure in the years  to  come,

this  `positive list' will be extended to allow more contents

on the Internet during election campaigning.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, while regulating political campaigning on

the  Internet, also prohibits the publication of voter intent

polls during the elections.  I support this amendment as I am

convinced  that there is good reason for Singaporeans  to  be

concerned  about the potentially disruptive  impact  of  pre-election opinion polls.  There is no assurance of fairness in

the  conduct  of such polls, which could cover anything  from

specific  issues  to  pure  speculation  on  the  outcome  of

particular  electoral  contests.  Hence,  there  is  a  grave

concern  that  such  polls  may be  cynically  structured  to

produce   desired  outcomes  for  promoters,  whose   primary

motivation  may  be to mislead, to misinform  and  to  unduly

influence  the  election outcome.  The risk  is  particularly

high  for  polls conducted on the Internet which, as  we  all

know,  may be rigged, or have a degree of participation  from

individuals  outside of Singapore who have their  own  agenda

and may not necessarily have the interest of Singaporeans  at

heart.   These  foreigners  will not  be  here  to  bear  the

consequences of their actions, should their actions  lead  to

undesirable outcomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some extent, Sir, the fixation of opinion polls in

other  countries, such as the USA on peripheral issues,  some

even  bordering  on the frivolous and scandalous,  will  only

confuse the electorate who may inadvertently focus on  single

issues,  instead of national issues, which are  crucial  when

choosing  a  government.   At  worst,  it  could  allow   the

electoral  proceedings and process in  Singapore,  which  has

always been conducted according to the highest standards,  to

be  trivialised  and be manipulated by parties  with  agendas

that may be inimical to the interest of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-reliance of such polls, which are of less

relevance  than  the  actual outcome of  electoral  contests,

could  undermine the legitimacy of the results and  discredit

the  well-regarded  system that we have  built  up  over  the

years.  Sir, one only has to look at the negative effects  in

the  last Presidential Election in the USA, for example, when

the international community congratulated the "wrong"

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>

President,  only to then have to retract and reinstate  their

messages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, Sir, the legal restrictions on voter

intent  polls during the election period is not new.  As  the

Minister  has  explained,  it  is  being  practised  in  many

countries  in Europe, the Americas and Asia.  This  amendment

should  therefore be viewed positively in this light, ie,  we

are  aligning  our  laws  to be in  line  with  international

practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the Bill, some critics have

complained that the powers being legislated in this Bill  run

anathema to Singapore's ambition to be a regional media  hub.

I  beg  to disagree.  Responsible journalism has always  been

held  in  the  highest esteem by the end  consumer,  ie,  the

public.   I  am  convinced that both the  local  and  foreign

broadcasters  and  other  media players  in  Singapore  fully

appreciate  the  fact  that responsible  reporting  does  not

constitute  censorship  or  restrain  their  obligations   to

report,  inform and educate.  What this Bill does is to  make

it  clear and transparent where the goal posts lie, in  order

for them to operate effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Sir, the Minister could perhaps comment or

give  an assurance to this House that the intentions  of  the

Bill have taken into consideration our overall ambition to be

a media hub.  This affirmation should greatly allay the fears

and  worries of those, both local and foreign, whose business

and  employment interests lie in the success of our media hub

strategy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the enforcement of some of the specific

provisions of this Bill, I would like to raise the concern on

whether  in  the  way  the  Bill has been  drafted,  innocent

bystanders will be criminally liable for offences under  this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, I refer to clause 6 of the Bill which makes it

a corrupt practice for any person to publish on the Internet,

any  election materials without identifying the name  of  the

printer,  the publisher and the person for whom or  at  whose

direction  the election advertising is published.  And  where

any contravention

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>

occurs,  the  printer as well as the person for whom  and  at

whose  direction  it  is  published shall  be  guilty  of  an

offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the nature of the Internet, and the fact that

sites  can be hosted on a world-wide basis, there is  no  way

printers  can  assure  themselves  that  someone,  somewhere,

sometime  may  not post a message or host a  site  displaying

election  advertising  without their  authority  or  consent.

Similarly,  organisations which are non political  in  nature

may not be able to prevent completely someone from picking up

something   on  their  open  discussion  forums,  information

listings,  or  even hijacking their site and publishing  such

information on their own political sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 78E of the Bill puts the onus on such persons

charged  with these offences, to prove that the contravention

of  the  provision  arose  from  circumstances  beyond  their

control  and  indeed all reasonable steps and  due  diligence

have  been  taken to ensure that the contravention would  not

arise.  It is not clear then, and it is quite subjective what

would  be  "reasonable steps", since it is so  easy  in  this

information age for abuse to be conducted without the consent

or indeed the knowledge of the producers of such advertising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister therefore elaborate on how effective

can any enforcement take place when an event like this occurs

and   how   innocent  parties  to  these  infringements   can

adequately  be  assured  that they  will  not  be  prosecuted

indiscriminately?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the last amendment to the Bill is to plug

a  loophole  in  our  law.   It disallows  a  candidate  from

contesting  simultaneously in more than one constituency.   I

agree  with this amendment as, I think, it is impossible  for

an  MP  to serve more than one constituency given the demands

of  an  MP's work nowadays.  Indeed, this amendment  is  long

overdue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I hope the Minister would address

some of the concerns I have raised in my speech.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I refer to

clause 5 of the Bill.  I cannot understand why the Government

wants  to  prohibit  multiple nominations.   As  it  is,  the

Government  has  already pegged the  election  deposit  at  a

prohibitively  high  amount.  If a candidate  wants  to  risk

losing  his  deposit,  it should be  his  prerogative.   What

happens   if  multiple  nominations  are  allowed   and   the

candidates are returned to, say, three constituencies, either

in  the  GRCs  or single seats?  If it is a GRC,  then  there

should  be  no  problem.  By-elections in any event  are  not

allowed  in  GRCs.  Therefore, there shall  always  be  other

Members  of Parliament in the GRC to look after his  ward  if

that  Member  is  busy looking after his other constituencies

which  he  has been returned, or in the case of  Jalan  Besar

GRC, the party that has won that constituency can always send

one  of  its  Members to be a caretaker MP there.   In  fact,

since  such  a precedent has been set up in Jalan Besar  GRC,

the  same  principle can be adopted for a candidate  who  has

been  returned to multiple constituencies.  If he is too busy

working  in one or two of his constituencies, his  party  can

always delegate one of his party members to take care of  his

ward  in another constituency which he has won.  In the  case

of a single seat constituency, the same can be repeated as in

the GRC.  The single member must run from one constituency to

the other constituency to take care of them.  If he is unable

to do so, then his party will have to delegate one or more of

its members to stand in for him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the PAP which has set the precedent of sending one

of his party members to stand in for a colleague who has left

Parliament for whatever reason.  I cannot see why a candidate

who has been elected to multiple constituencies cannot do the

same  if  voters in those constituencies are willing to  vote

for  him.   Voters  must be given a free  choice  to  vote  a

candidate they like.  The Government should not legislatively

deprive them of their right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I wish to speak on the other amendments in the

Bill.   I also cannot understand why the Government,  on  the

one  hand,  spends millions of dollars to promote IT  in  the

schools and ask workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>

to  upgrade their skills but, on the other hand, its  use  in

relation to elections at election time, in some instances, is

prohibited.  As long as we know who are the people behind the

publication    advertising   the   poll    findings,    other

advertisements, or news, I think it should be all right.  The

Government should allow the people of Singapore to  grow  up,

think  for  themselves and make their own  decisions.   Those

publications should be allowed as long as we can identify and

catch  them, if necessary, the persons responsible for  those

publications  and  make  them accountable  for  their  libel,

sedition, or other disseminated matters which are criminal in

nature.   The  Government should give  them  the  freedom  to

publish,  even  if  the PAP risks losing a few  parliamentary

seats  at  the  polls.   The  bigger  issue  of  freedom   of

publication  and  allowing our citizens to mature  is  surely

more  important for nation building than the party  losing  a

few parliamentary seats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, for years now, the Opposition has been

suffering  the problem, that the ruling party is  afraid  of,

that  is, voters at the last moment may be influenced not  to

vote  for  the  Opposition.   The  local  press,  during  the

electioneering period and especially on Polling  Day,  nearly

always  publishes sensational headlines which are detrimental

to the Opposition, so much so that the Opposition has to tell

the voters not to read the newspapers on Polling Day, knowing

that the headlines in those papers will be devastating to the

Opposition.  The Opposition is certain that the ruling  party

is  aware that, during election time, the local press  almost

always  gives a bad press to the Opposition.  Yet  it  allows

the  local press to carry on that practice simply because  it

knows that it is good for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My query to the Minister is: will the present amendments

to the Parliamentary Elections Act cover local press as well?

To  me, it appears to be so under clause 2 of the Bill.  Will

the Minister please clarify?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I rise to speak in

support  of the Bill.  This Bill will have a great impact  in

shaping the way in which we conduct elections in an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>

information    technology   environment.    In    cyberspace,

individuals  are empowered to communicate their thoughts  and

ideas to others quickly and extensively.  It is said that the

pen  is  mightier than the sword, but I have no doubt at  all

that  the  computer keyboard is the mightiest  of  them  all.

This  would  be more apparent in the context of  an  election

campaign when claim and counter-claim can be made as fast  as

one can think and type.  Political exchanges taking place  in

the  physical  world can be easily dwarfed  by  those  taking

place in cyberspace.  Individuals and parties can debate  and

campaign to their hearts' content, literally sitting in their

rooms or offices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill and the regulations will eventually provide

the   rules  of  engagement  for  political  campaigning   in

Singapore.  It is important therefore that they are  seen  to

be  fair  to  all  parties.  I also believe strongly  in  the

Minister's statement that politics should be based on factual

and objective presentation of issues and reasoned debate.  It

does  not follow of course that such a situation cannot arise

in  a  cyberspace environment.  The real question is: if left

unregulated, will an undesirable situation arise?   By  which

is  meant  a  situation where voters are not  able  to  judge

objectively what is true and what is not.  One may argue, for

example, that the laws of defamation and other forms of  mis-statement  would be available to control such  excesses  and,

therefore,  further regulation would not  be  necessary.   Be

that as it may, the Bill opts for control through regulation,

and it is to this approach that I now turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that we are debating this Bill without

having  a complete idea as to what sort of features or  items

would  be  allowed  on  a  political website.   The  Minister

mentioned  just  now  that a full list of  features  will  be

released  when they are finalised.  Firstly, may  I  ask  the

Minister when we can expect to see such regulations  and,  in

particular, the list?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister what is the

extent  to  which  individuals, as  distinct  from  political

parties, can be involved in Internet discussions on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>

political issues?  Clause 6 contains a provision that  allows

individuals  to  communicate  with  each  other  "on  a  non-commercial  basis".   This  is, to  me,  a  puzzling  phrase.

Unless  these  individuals are in the business  of  political

lobbying,  I  should have thought that all would  communicate

political views on a non-commercial basis.  Even in the  case

of a candidate writing to a prospective voter, I do not think

that  he  would be acting in a commercial capacity.  It  must

surely  be in the public interest that candidates and  voters

should  be able to communicate with each other without  being

regarded as being in a commercial capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only type of person that would be caught would

be  those employed by politicians to answer email or  respond

to  messages, presumably because he is doing so in the course

of  his  employment and, therefore, can be regarded as acting

commercially.  If this is correct, and I do not say  that  it

is, I wonder whether this is actually Parliament's intention.

I  should  have thought that the objective would be  to  stop

commercial  posters using the Internet to bombard individuals

with political advertisements.  If so, I am not sure that the

legislation,  as  drafted, would achieve in the  purpose  for

restricting such people from doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know whether in the case of a

political  website, is it permissible for such a  website  to

host  a  page where supporters can, for example,  send  their

messages  of  support for the party or its  policies?   Would

individuals  doing so be regarded as infringing  regulations,

existing  or  proposed?   I  ask  this  because,  again,  the

amendment exempting individuals from liability only speaks of

communicating between individuals, not between individual and

political  party,  for example.  So I hope the  Minister  can

clarify this particular point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Minister will make it very clear to

every  Singaporean that the regulations are not  intended  to

stifle  political comment, especially during  election  time.

That would be inimical to the democratic process that we  are

fostering, and I believe that it would also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>

be against the idea of active citizenry, because the exercise

of political judgement and political will is, if one may call

it,  one of the fundamental attributes of exercising actively

one's citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that there must be some regulation so that the

stated  objective of having a clean and fair election can  be

maintained, as it has been in the past.  But I do  hope  that

the  regulations will be seen to be clear and transparent  to

all parties concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I express strong support for the

restrictions  on  exit  polls and the  like.   I  have  often

wondered why voters would be swayed simply by numbers  rather

than issues, so I think this is indeed a very proper thing to

exclude from the political campaign period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

glad  that  the  Government has decided  to  allow  political

campaigning  on  the  Internet, albeit  with  certain  ground

rules.  This should certainly allay the fear of some that the

Government  would  ban  the  use of  Internet  for  political

campaigns.   Whilst  we recognise the  Internet  as  an  easy

medium  to  reach many people and for many people  to  access

information  easily, we must also concede that  the  Internet

will be abused by some.  Rumours, gossips and unsubstantiated

stories can also be relayed instantaneously, which may  cause

irreparable damage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 78A empowers the Minister to make

regulations governing non-printed election advertising in  an

election  period and election advertising on the Internet  in

an  election  period  by  political  parties,  candidates  or

persons.   It  states  that the Minister would  regulate  the

Internet advertising by prescribing the features that must or

must not appear in any election advertising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that the Minister, in his speech,

has chosen to use the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>

"positive  list" approach in making these regulations  as  it

would  provide clear guidelines to those involved on what  is

permissible  for  election political campaigning.   It  would

also  help  set  clear  markers to  other  non-political  web

masters  on what is legal and illegal under the Parliamentary

Elections Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at first glance, it appears to be a rational move

in  the  light  of the fact that the use of the Internet  for

political  purpose is something new here  and  also  in  many

other countries.  Some skeptics, however, claim that it is an

uphill  battle  to  try to control the use  of  the  Internet

during  election  periods because of the sheer  multitude  of

users  and  also  by  the  cross-border  nature  of  Internet

traffic.   This raises the interesting question how  overseas

websites  which  engage  in local political  activity  during

election periods will be monitored and censured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I recall, very recently, when an election took

place  in  a neighbouring country, a lot of foreign  websites

were  sited  overseas  and  a lot  of  political  discussions

involving  this  particular  country's  politics   were   all

discussed  in  these overseas websites.   So  this  certainly

poses  a  challenge to the proposed amendments, and I  wonder

how the Minister would tackle this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that not doing anything is also

something  no  responsible government can afford  to  do.   I

would like to ask the Minister for some clarification on  the

use  of  the  Internet by political parties,  candidates  and

agents during the election period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, would the positive list allow mass emails

by these political parties' candidates or agents to those who

have  registered themselves with these political parties  and

are  willing  to  receive them, ie, those who  are  willingly

submitting  their  emails  to  these  political  parties  and

candidates  and  are willing to receive these  emails?   Will

they be subject to these regulations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can these individuals send these emails

containing   political  information  or   advertisements   to

friends, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>

will they end up in breach of these regulations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the proposed section 78B seems only to allow

the  sending of email by individuals to other individuals  of

his  own  political  views.   If  one  endorses  the  written

viewpoint of candidates or a political party and states  that

it  is  also his viewpoint, will it also be in breach of  the

proposed regulations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, how are individual emails going to be

monitored if there are thousands, if not millions, of  emails

being  sent  around?   Can  the monitoring  be  done  without

intruding into the privacy of individuals?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Sir, are bulletin boards, chat rooms and other

websites  that  discuss political matters permissible  during

the election period?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the topic of election polls and

exit  polls.  Sir, it is common in many countries,  prior  to

the  closing of voting, for opinion polls to be conducted  by

different  organisations.  The results of such opinion  polls

are published in newspapers, magazines and other periodicals,

and  sometimes telecast or broadcast on the electronic media.

The  dissemination of such results of opinion polls  receives

wide  publicity  and  coverage in the  print  and  electronic

media,  and  such dissemination, particularly on the  eve  of

polls, has the potential to influence the electors when  they

are in the process of making up their minds to vote or not to

vote for a certain political party or candidate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the methodology followed by different organisations

conducting  such  opinion polls varies from  organisation  to

organisation   or   the  agencies  conducting   such   polls.

Similarly, the sample size of the electorate covered by  such

polls  and  geographic  spread of  the  survey  also  differs

substantially in each case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from opinion polls, exit polls are also

conducted  by some organisations on the days of polls.   Many

would  agree  that  opinion  polls,  the  way  the  same  are

conducted, are not scientific.  There is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>

considerable  bias,  in the size and  nature  of  the  sample

drawn,  to  make  such  an opinion  poll  and  they  tend  to

influence  the voters in an unbecoming manner.  It is  common

fact  that  many  of  the  polls are motivated  and  are  not

impartial,  because of the known leanings  or  prejudices  of

some  of the organisations conducting such polls, towards  or

against certain political parties and/or their leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have carefully looked into the existing

legislation  covering  the  subject  in  many  countries.   I

observe  that  in  many  states, eg, Canada,  France,  Italy,

Poland,    Turkey,   Argentina,   Brazil,   Colombia,    etc,

restrictions in one way or another are placed on the  conduct

of  opinion polls and exit polls.  For example, the  Canadian

Elections Act peremptorily prohibits the publication  of  any

results  of  any  opinion  poll two days  before  the  voting

begins.   Similarly, the Italian Decree Law of 18th  November

1995,  entitled "Urgent Provisions for Equal  Access  to  the

Media during Electoral and Referendum Period" provides that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Starting from the 20th day before the elections till

the  closing  date of voting, it is forbidden to  publish  or

circulate  the  results of exit polls, even if  such  surveys

were carried out before the above mentioned period."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, the provisions of our

Parliamentary  Elections Act, namely,  sections  80  and  81,

deserve   to  be  specially  noted.   Section  80   prohibits

canvassing  in  any  manner  on  polling  day.   Section   81

prohibits anyone from dissuading any person from voting at an

election from the day of nomination and polling day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existing law is a clear manifestation of

recognition of ground reality by Parliament in its collective

wisdom that the voter needs a period before the completion of

the  poll,  during  which he should not be disturbed  in  the

process  of  weighing  the merits and demerits  of  political

parties  and contesting candidates in the electoral fray,  so

that he can absorb what he has heard or witnessed during  the

election period in a tranquil and balanced frame of mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, viewed in the light of the above statutory

restrictions,  allowing  results of opinion  polls  and  exit

polls to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>

published  on the eve of polls or during the polling  process

would  be a deleterious intrusion into the mind of the voter,

which  is  already  prohibited by law  during  the  aforesaid

period of 24 hours.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a worldwide study by Nils Rohme on the Freedom

To  Publish  Opinion Polls in 1997, which was highlighted  in

the  Minister's speech, it was reported that  30  of  the  78

countries covered in the survey applied legal restrictions on

the  publication of public opinion surveys, mostly comprising

an  embargo prior to general elections.  It extends  anywhere

from one day in some and up to six weeks in the case of South

Africa.  It is also clear from the survey that many countries

in  the world were not covered in the survey because they  do

not  have regulations governing opinion polls because opinion

polls do not exist or are very new in these countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am comforted by the fact that in introducing this

piece   of  legislation  we  are  in  the  company  of   many

progressive   countries  in  the  western  world   who   have

recognised the weaknesses and abuse of opinion polls  in  the

democratic process and have placed controls on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In supporting the Bill, I would like to ask the Minister

for three clarifications in this area:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is the position if an election survey is

done  and  the results of the survey are put up on a  website

before the issue of the writ of elections?  Is the person  in

charge  of the website obliged to remove the details  of  the

survey during the election period?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will political parties, candidates and the

media be allowed to conduct opinion polls using their website

during  the election period which is not disseminated to  the

public, and whether, in the political list which is to be put

up for political parties and candidates to observe, they will

be  allowed  to conduct opinion polls for their  own  use  or

which  they may want to use after the election is  over,  and

this includes the media?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, what action will be taken against foreign

parties  who  conduct  opinion polls  and  publish  the  same

overseas  during  an election period, as  criminal  laws  are

territorial  in  nature,  and  whether  this  law   has   any

extraterritorial implications?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can comment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  purpose of this Amendment Bill is to  enhance  the

control  of  the  form and manner of election campaigning  so

that  the  opposition parties and their supporters could  not

make use of the new technology for effective publicity during

the  election period, to suppress the limited space where the

opposition  parties have to communicate with the masses,  and

thereby reducing the influence of the opposition parties  and

their chances of winning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Minister mentioned a moment ago in his

Second Reading speech that this amendment has allowed the use

of  Internet  during elections, this is,  however,  only  the

cosmetic  surface of the Bill.  What we should pay  attention

to   is   that   this   Amendment  Bill  redefines   election

advertising.  Under clause 2 of the Amendment Bill,  election

advertising is defined as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Election advertising means any poster, banner, notice,

circular,  handbill, illustration, article, advertisement  or

other material that can reasonably be regarded as intended to

promote or procure the electoral success at any election  for

one  or  more  identifiable political parties, candidates  or

groups  of candidates, . and such material shall be  election

advertising  even  though it can reasonably  be  regarded  as

intended to achieve any other purpose as well and even though

it does not expressly mention the name of any political party

or candidate."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this definition, any expression or article, so

long  as  it  is related to the election, can be regarded  as

election  advertising and comes under  the  control  of  this

Amendment Bill, if this article or expression is published on

the  Internet.  The webmaster of the site can even be  fined.

For  example, if someone puts on the Internet, "Keep  it  up,

Workers' Party", that can be regarded as election advertising

too.  If someone attends a mass rally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>

and  subsequently  writes a review on it, it  could  also  be

regarded as election advertising.  In other words, anyone who

gives  any view on the Internet, whether to support or to  go

against  any particular party or candidate, can be deemed  to

be  election advertising and come under their control.  As to

how  to control and whether or not it could be published,  it

will be determined by the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, this Bill has also given the

Government the power to deal with the webmaster of  the  site

who publishes these expressions or articles.  As a result, no

webmaster would be willing to accept for publication  on  his

site  any  of these articles.  Consequently, this  Bill  will

disable  the effective use of Internet during the  period  of

the General Election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it necessary to move this Amendment Bill now?

This  is  because,  in  the  past, only  the  newspapers  and

television  have the capability to transmit messages  to  the

voters  and all these media come under strict control of  the

Government.   During the elections, they all  play  the  same

tune.  They  will inevitably take the side of the Government,

and  there  will  be  no coverage that is favourable  to  the

Opposition or unfavourable to the PAP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, with the arrival of the new media era, the

Internet is becoming more and more popular and has become  an

effective channel to transmit messages to the voters.  People

also have a new space and channel to express their views  and

comments.   Inevitably,  there  will  be  no  guarantee  that

someone  who  will publish something over the  Internet  that

supports  the  Opposition party and criticises the  PAP,  and

this  may  affect the PAP!  That is the reason  why  the  PAP

Government wants to move this legislation to block all  these

expressions,  articles and comments that are unfavourable  to

the PAP.  This is the true purpose of this Amendment Bill  to

control the usage of Internet during election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, why is there a need now to ban the

publication  of  opinion poll and  exit  poll?   The  PAP  is

worried about the effect of Internet.  In the past, there was

no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>

need  to  legislate  because all the  media  were  under  the

control  of  the  Government.  We all know  that  during  the

election  period, whether or not the party or  the  candidate

could effectively transmit their messages to their voters  is

of great importance.  All this while, the opposition parties,

besides  holding  election  rally,  the  only  way  of   mass

communication was to print and distribute flyers by inserting

them  into the letterboxes of the voters.  It takes a lot  of

resources   to   print  and  to  distribute   these   flyers,

particularly in the GRCs.  A lot of people, time, energy  and

money would be needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the Internet, a relatively effective channel

to transmit the messages is readily available. We do not have

to  depend  on  the  newspapers and television  to  send  our

messages  across  to our voters.  But the PAP  Government  is

blocking this channel, and the Minister now can regulate  and

restrict  the use of the Internet.  Hence, the Opposition  is

again landed in a situation of being disadvantaged.  Is  this

what  the PAP Government claims to be fair competition?  More

apparently, in order to block all these expressions that  are

favourable  to  the  Opposition, the Government  has  already

classified the SINTERCOM, a non-political party website, as a

political  website - this move brings the website  under  the

ambit  of this amendment.  It is regrettable that the PAP  is

so very kiasu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment Bill once again reveals the true colours

of  the  PAP  -  to make use of the power and convenience  of

Government to legislate to block all channels that Opposition

parties could more effectively use to transmit their messages

and  to communicate with voters so that Opposition party  and

its  supporters are not able to be effective during election.

This   is   the  hypocrisy  of  the  PAP's  claims  to   fair

competition, democracy and openness!

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment)  Bill

involves the question of principle and the question of rules.

I have no doubt whatsoever on the question of principle.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>

Mr Chiam See Tong too commented only on the rules aspect, but

not on the principle.  I agree with the principle, but on the

question of rules, I have some reservations.  Mr Chiam  asked

why  a  candidate cannot stand for election in more than  one

constituency. This is like one husband wanting to  have  many

wives.  In  Singapore, the law prohibits polygamy.  Likewise,

in  an  election law, the candidate must contest only in  one

constituency and serve his constituents there.  Mr Chiam must

have  been eyeing the Jalan Besar GRC in addition to his  own

Potong Pasir.  He is not sure whether to move to Jalan Besar,

or  to  stay  in Potong Pasir. So, to have the best  of  both

worlds, he wants to contest in both. Well, he may end up with

nothing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that we can support the general principle, and

that is, we must have fair competition, to compete on a level

playing  ground.   As  we  all know, election  propaganda  or

advertising  is  a  very serious matter. Whether  it  is  the

political  parties or the individuals standing for  election,

their  agenda  and views on major national and  international

issues  must  be clearly communicated to the  voters  to  win

their votes. They should not hide themselves behind the cover

of the Internet.  They must stand up and say the right things

at  the  right time. They cannot say things indiscriminately,

without taking responsibility of what they are saying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rules, the Member for Hougang, Mr Low

Thia  Khiang alleged that our liberalisation on  the  use  of

Internet  for  the  purpose  of  election  was,  in  fact,  a

suppression of the political parties.  If someone is to  post

a  slogan, "Keep it up, Workers' Party" on the Internet, I do

not  think anybody would take any objection to it. So be  it!

You  do  not have to worry about anyone going after you  just

because of that.  If you want to participate in politics, you

must  have the political courage, political intelligence  and

say  what  you  want to say.  If you are not sure,  then  you

should go and do something else instead.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of rules, Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that

the  Government is  liberalising election advertising on  the

Internet.   Political parties can advertise  their  platforms

with  pictures inserted, and the surfers can hear their voice

and   see  their  pictures.  As  the  Chinese  saying   goes,

you  sheng  you se  (full of sound and colour).   This  shows

that  our  legislature and legislation are in pace  with  the

development  of  technology.  But we are allowed  to  display

only   still   pictures,  but  not  films.  So  no   election

advertising motion pictures over the Internet!  Full of sound

and colour, but no motion!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the advancement of technology, our information

providers can string together a series of pictures to animate

them  and turn these still pictures into some kind of  motion

pictures.   Can the Minister please enlighten us  on  whether

this  is  allowed  under this Bill?  I feel  that  we  should

review  our law on video-tapes so that our manner of election

campaigning can keep pace with the development of technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing

me to join in the debate on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some sympathy for this Bill and I have more

questions than protests or answers.  I have sympathy for  the

Bill  because it clearly is a new kid in town, a new  medium,

the  Internet,  which is potentially destabilising.   I  also

sympathise  in the sense that, at this point, with  elections

looming  and talked about, any change or any new rules  would

be  scrutinised  very heavily, especially by  the  Opposition

which  has been patently clear from their speeches,  believes

that the existing media is very much skewed against them.  In

looking through the nature of the changes, I have looked  for

some  ideas of trying to be balanced about it, trying to have

rules  that  help  more  and  more  rational  discussions  of

politics  and  a  maturing of Singapore's  young  electorate,

while  avoiding the dangers of, frankly, rules being made  to

suit the ruling party.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would disagree with Mr Chew Heng Ching that I

do not think this Bill liberalises the rules.  I do not think

the  positive set of what a political party can  put  on  the

website  is actually a step in the right direction.  I  would

have  much  preferred a short, specific negative list.   This

would  then allow much more creativity between the  different

political  parties  in dressing up their websites,  in  doing

many  more things.  In this sense, this positive list,  which

the Minister has told us, is perhaps the wrong approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I also cannot agree with Mr Chew that it is

all clear and transparent.  As the Minister himself has noted

and  the  Bill  states, there are many more regulations  that

would  be  made.  Some of the details that the  Minister  has

given  are clearly not in the Bill and we will have  to  wait

for a later date to find out what these regulations are.  The

devil will be in the details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same breath, there have been many questions

raised  by  MPs before me and I believe Mr Ravindran  himself

asked  them.   There are the details because  the  making  of

legislation creates more intricacies.  Before Nomination Day,

clearly  things would be allowed and after that, not so.  The

question  of  the timeline and what is allowed  by  whom  are

increasingly  complex.  Let me move on to my next  point  and

that is to seek some clarifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, but I do not think it is clear whether the

very  basic point if I, as an individual, write an e-mail  to

one  or even a thousand friends with my political opinion,  I

am  not  sure that the Bill could not catch me if I  were  to

endorse  one  candidate or one party.  This  is  particularly

because  of the definition of political advertising  that  Mr

Low Thia Khiang has pointed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am not clear as to the ability of non-party

sites  to  allow  for  debate, to host  letters  or  even  to

positively  endorse one candidate or one party,  that  is  to

say,  the political party's site obviously can do so.   I  am

not sure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>

what  the non-party sites can do.  In the real world of  real

print,   I   am  reminded  that  the  Straits  Times,   quite

traditionally, does endorse one party, the PAP.  The question

is whether new sites on the website can do the same thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my next point of even-handedness. Mr

Speaker, it does disturb me that the regulations will be made

by  the Minister because during the campaigning period  there

is  a question of even-handedness when the Minister is to  be

contested  as well.  This is particularly as regards  to  the

proposed  amendment in section 78B(f) which would  allow  for

exceptions to be made, not only as to (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)

which  are  all quite specific, but (f), an exception  to  be

made  to  election is banned on "such other circumstances  or

activities as may be prescribed by the Minister by  order  in

the  Gazette."   It is not at all apparent to me  what  these

other circumstances or activities may be.  We are looking for

transparency and even-handedness.  I think there needs to  be

some clearer projection of what this might be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also want to pause here to disagree with two

other things that Mr  Chiam had said.  First, if I understood

Mr  Chiam  See  Tong  correctly, he is in  favour  of  multi-candidature, that is to say, a candidate could stand in  more

than  one  constituency, hope to win perhaps in a GRC  and  a

single  seat, and then give up his GRC seat and leave  it  to

the  rest of the team.  From my reading of this, Mr Chiam has

exposed his election strategy, moving from by-election to two

elections.  But as a citizen, I do not think this serves  the

voters  or  electorate well.  It cannot be in  the  citizens'

interest to have somebody run for two seats, win one and give

one  up, and hope that the rest of the team can make  up  for

the lost man.  I beg to disagree with Mr Chiam there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that Mr Chiam and Mr Low, in their

speeches,  have  made very easy targets of the  local  press.

However,  it  is  true that surveys do show  public  opinion,

among Singaporeans, believes that the media is not fully

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>

impartial.   However,  I  do  think  there  are   many   good

journalists and there is a new dynamic in the print media  as

well  as television, that the competition the Government  has

fostered  in  the last year will, I hope, breed  competition,

freedom balanced with responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my last point. My appeal to the

Government  and  to the Minister would be that  elections  in

Singapore  should not be too quiet.  There are  elections  in

many  one-party states which come and go and  no  one  knows.

There  is  no  heat.   There is no  sense  of  people  really

registering  their  views.  I think Singapore,  so  far,  has

avoided  this.  But this Bill, like the Bills on the  foreign

media before, takes us in little steps towards increasing the

regulations that might bring down the temperature.   Sir,  it

is  true  that  we have seen some overheated elections  which

people maraud, cause damage, even lose lives, and I would not

wish  that  to Singapore.  But I think, whether in cyberspace

or  on the ground, we do need an election period where people

feel  that they are allowed to discuss issues freely, fairly,

whether  in person, in print or on the Internet.   And  there

are  many  difficulties in administrating this  new  half-way

house between print and talk.  Internet is bound to have some

level  of  rumour-mongering.   That  is  because  it  is   so

accessible to all.  But I would ask the Minister to  consider

whether  we really need to go so far.  After all, if we  have

talked  mainly about the Internet, how about other  forms  of

communication, such as SMS on the handphone?  Would  this  be

another  target?  What I am hoping, Sir, is  that  we  should

move  towards not just allowing political parties  and  their

sites  to  have  a free and fair debate but rather  elections

must  be  about people, voters and their opinions,  and  that

these  regulations,  if anything, must err  on  the  side  of

freedom in order to give people their say.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main schools of thought on the

prohibitions  imposed by this Bill.  On the  one  hand,  some

people regard unbridled democracy as a sheer form of tyranny,

as  it  imposes upon the will of others.  Hence, we  need  to

balance  the  right  to be democratic with  the  need  to  be

responsible.   We  need to balance the right  to  information

with   the   need   to  discern  the  person  supplying   the

information, whether they have a personal stake in the  well-being  of  Singapore  or they are acting  on  their  personal

agenda.   We  need to balance the right and  freedom  of  the

individuals  to express themselves freely with the  need  for

those opinions to be expressed in a responsible manner.  In a

way,  it is like  parenting.  I like to give my teenager sons

as much freedom as possible to access information.  But as  a

responsible father, I will restrict pornography, violence and

the  like.  And if I know that drugs and smoking are bad  for

them,  why would I even want to consider letting my  children

try them out?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, if I know that misinformation and

manipulating of information by persons with their own selfish

agenda  is against the well-being of Singapore, why  would  I

want  Singaporeans to be exposed to such information  without

safeguards,  especially on a matter as important as  electing

leaders of the nation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our age of live broadcast, we do not want

opinion  polls  to be conducted by third parties  or  foreign

broadcasters  who  may  misrepresent  or  manipulate   public

opinions.   In this regard, I agree that we should not  allow

decisions  regarding our future to be influenced  by  persons

who may have their own private agendas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans may have the right to information but it is

the  duty  of the Government to ensure that our citizens  are

entitled to information from responsible persons.  In this IT

age, we are flooded with all kinds of information.  On issues

affecting  the  future  of  the  nation,  we  want  to   have

information generated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>

by  persons  with a strong regard for the well-being  of  our

citizens rather than opinions generated by third parties with

no personal stake in the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greatest irony of our age is that having more

knowledge does not necessarily make one any wiser.  Giving  a

man  too  many  options does not lead him to  make  a  better

choice.   At the end of the day, voting is something personal

and  sacrosanct to the voter.  The choice of the voter should

be based on his knowledge of the political party or candidate

rather  than  knowledge of how other voters  choose.   Voting

should be based on the political platform and confidence that

the  voter has for the party or candidate, not on the opinion

of  other voters.  We do not want a situation where materials

are  circulated during the election period without any  names

on  it.   We  do  not want a situation where  candidates  and

political  parties  go  beyond  their  means  and  limits  in

election  advertising.  We do not want to have our  political

parties and candidates to be dependent on the purse of  third

parties  who may have their own private agendas in supporting

their election advertising.  This can lead to money politics.

Where possible, we must remove any danger and possibility  of

money politics taking place in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Bill can help to minimise the

manipulation  of  public  opinions prior  to  and  during  an

election.   The  requirements in the Bill can  also  help  to

ensure  greater accountability on the part of  the  political

parties,  candidates  and third parties engaged  in  election

advertising.  The Government should also be commended for its

alertness to the potential dangers that advancements in info-communications  technology can present.  In  this  regard,  I

also  applaud  the Government for its courage to  make  tough

decisions to deal with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another school of thought on this Bill. Some

purists of democracy will readily cite these prohibitions  to

substantiate their perception of Singapore as veering towards

a  police state, that the Bill impinges on the freedom of the

individuals and political parties to contest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>

freely  in  an  election.  These people  would  consider  the

prohibition of the publication of election opinion  polls  as

an   affront  to  the  individual's  freedom  of  speech  and

expression.   They  would consider the  prohibitions  on  the

Internet as unnecessarily authoritarian and even dictatorial.

This  group  of people will ask why do the United  States  of

America,  widely  regarded as the  epitome  of  a  democratic

nation,  allows election opinion polls to be freely conducted

and yet the Singapore Government wants to ban it.  Surely our

citizens  would be sophisticated enough to make  the  correct

choice  of  electing their political leaders,  regardless  of

what the opinion polls may suggest.  Surely those who are  IT

savvy  enough to surf the Internet would be able  to  discern

and  brandish  the gimmicks and electioneering ploys  on  the

Internet.  If we place limits to the freedom of expression on

the  Internet,  we appear to go against the  grain  of  Prof.

Michael  Porter's recent advice for us to loosen up.   If  we

define "election advertising" and "publish" so broadly in the

Bill,  we may unwittingly send a wrong message to our already

politically apathetic younger generation of Singaporeans that

they  cannot  communicate anything with a political  flavour,

especially during the election period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the concern in this regard is whether we have

defined  the  terms "election advertising" and "publish"  too

broadly  that  they  become catch-all tools  that  cover  too

extensively  non-political party activists who  may  want  to

express  their  views on the election.  For example,  someone

attends an election rally and becomes a converted follower of

that  political  party, be it the ruling  or  the  opposition

parties.   He  sends  an e-mail to ask all  his  friends  and

relatives  to vote for that particular political  party.   On

the  basis of his personal conviction, he proceeds to ask all

his  friends and relatives to canvass their friends  to  vote

likewise.  He even includes in his e-mail that out of the  50

friends that he has asked and polled, 40 of them have decided

to vote for that political party.  Does the Bill prohibit him

to  carry out the above actions, even though he may be acting

on his personal conviction?  If it does, I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>

suggest that we review the definition of these terms, as they

are deemed to be too broad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these concerns, which I hope that the Minister

can clarify, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, I believe you wanted to seek

clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for giving me this

opportunity to ask the hon. Member for Ang Mo Kio to clarify.

For  a moment, I thought he was debating an amendment to  the

Women's Charter rather than the Parliamentary Elections Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to put on record that I do believe in

monogamy.  I do not believe in polygamy.  Can I clarify  with

Mr  Seng Han Thong that he is not insinuating in any way that

I am a polygamist?

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

mentioned  just  now that we must have some moral  principle.

As  a husband, one can have only one wife and be faithful  to

her.   But  as a Member of Parliament, he can only serve  one

constituency  and be faithful to his voters.   Just  now  the

Member for Potong Pasir said that he should be been given the

liberty  to serve many constituencies.  He mentioned that  he

wanted  to  contest in Potong Pasir and the Jalan Besar  GRC,

and serve whichever constituency he wins in.  I am afraid  if

he does that, he would end up losing both constituencies.   I

hope  that  he will be more faithful to his own constituency.

Since    Mr    Chiam   remarked   about   my    analogy    of

yi  fu duo qi (one husband many wives), I would change it  to

yi fu duo qu (one person many constituencies).

to  speak  in support of the Bill.  I just wish to  draw  the

attention  of the Minister to the penalties for  offences  of

publishing    information   conducted   through    the    new

technological media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the advent of the world wide web, electronic

mail  and short message service on mobile phones, information

can be disseminated at literally lightning speed.  Unlike the

traditional   media,   new  technologies   allow   for   mass

circulation  of information at the click of a mouse.   Unlike

the traditional media, a website may also be published by any

other   party's  sympathiser  or  person  in  an   unfriendly

jurisdiction and is made available to all Singaporeans.   The

ease, convenience and cost of sending an e-mail to one person

is  no different from sending to one million persons.  Worse,

the e-mail may be just as easily propagated.  The malicious e-mail  may also be re-routed through another country  or  sent

anonymously which, I understand, can be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How will this be controlled, Sir? The short is that

information, whether true, false or malicious,  may  be  most

easily  disseminated than at any time in human history.   The

damage of false information done through the modern media can

be  most  devastating.  The propagation of poison pen letters

is  as old as there are elections.  In the traditional media,

it is very difficult to mass mail a poison pen letter and get

away  with it.  But in the new technological media, much harm

can  be  done.  In the recent election at one of the branches

of  the  Singapore Airlines Staff Union, just  for  a  branch

election,  there were a lot of poison pen letters being  sent

out  blackening the various candidates who were standing  for

election.  Poison

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>

pen letter is also one of the common features found in use in

other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot appreciate the enormity of the problem

of  a  poison pen letter unless he is a victim.  Imagine  the

power  of a poison pen e-mail done in the midst of a  general

election.  By the time the truth is established, if it can be

established  at all, the harm is already done.  In  politics,

although the allegations may be malicious and false, the  mud

sticks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I am of the view that the penalties should be

enhanced manifold when falsehoods are propagated by  the  new

technological media.  Penalties under the Bill  for  offences

committed  through  the  new technological  media  should  be

considered separately from the traditional media.   In  other

words,  penalties for offences committed through the  use  of

modern  technology  should  be higher  than  the  traditional

media.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to thank you

for  giving me the opportunity to join in the debate on  this

Bill on which I rise to support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of this Bill has generated much

interest  and debate in the public forum, not least of  which

is  the  issue of political campaigning on the Internet.   As

you  are  aware,  Sir, the Bill, in principle,  broadens  the

scope of election advertising to include publications on  the

Internet.  What the Bill tries to do is to regulate such form

of  publication  by  requiring to make known  the  names  and

addresses  of  the publisher and the person for  whom  or  at

whose  direction the election advertising is  published.   It

does  not  in any way seek to prevent anyone from  publishing

his  political  views or inclinations so long  as  it  is  in

compliance with the prescriptions of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore surprises me, Sir, that the Opposition

party  should  be so quick to jump at this new Bill  to  make

wild  allegations  that the Bill is yet, to  quote,  "another

sorry  attempt  by  the PAP to prevent  the  Opposition  from

effectively  reaching  out to voters during  elections".   In

making  this comment, Sir, the Opposition has failed  to  see

the real issue.  We are not afraid of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>

criticisms or comments, no matter what these comments may be.

There  is  nothing in law at the moment to prevent  one  from

harshly  criticising,  in  the open,  Government's  policies.

What  we  do  require, however, is that the  people  who  are

willing  to  criticise must be prepared to come  forward,  to

come  out in the open, to stand by their statements.  Nothing

can be more cowardly than for one to take potshots at another

and  choose  to remain anonymous for fear of shouldering  the

responsibilities that come with the public statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that democracy protects and upholds the

freedom  of expression.  However, democracy is also  as  much

about  responsibility  as it is about right.   Therefore,  if

somebody were to defame another person's name or someone  who

were   to   make   seditious   statements,   he   must   take

responsibility  for his action.  Why should  anyone  be  less

deserving of protection of the law simply because  he  is  in

the  public limelight?  What the Opposition is asking for  is

to  give people the liberty to say whatever they want without

taking  responsibility  for it.  Sir,  I  do  not  find  this

acceptable  neither  do  I  think the  rest  of  Singaporeans

necessarily find this acceptable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is a new frontier that we are still trying

to  grapple with.  The latest edition of The Economist  dated

11th-17th August 2001 recognises that the imposition of local

rules  may  be  better  than  the alternative  of  having  no

regulation at all.  It further states that a complete lack of

regulation  gives  a free hand to cheats and  criminals.   It

generally  recognises  that  the  Internet,  like   all   new

frontiers,  will  be  wild  for a while  and  eventually  the

policemen  and  the law will come round to  enforce  law  and

order.   The  regulation of publications on the  Internet  is

consistent  with  the policies that we have  taken  over  the

years  with  respect  to printed documents.   These  policies

apply equally to all, including the PAP.  If the PAP has done

such  a lousy job in running this country, then no amount  of

regulation, whether on the Internet or otherwise, is going to

prevent people from spreading their views to members  of  the

public.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at this Bill before us, Sir, let us take a

proper  perspective on the issue.  This Bill is not  so  much

about  regulating the content as it is about prescribing  the

manner  and form in which the content is disseminated to  the

public  at  large.   Democracy is not only  about  individual

rights  but  also about respect for the others.   To  suggest

that  the  law  should  be removed to allow  people  complete

liberty  to say whatever they want without having to identify

themselves  with it, is to bring about anarchy  and  not  the

rule of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support this Bill and in particular the

attempts  of  the Government to regulate election advertising

on the Internet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, many who disagree with this Bill see there  is

an  attempt to curb perhaps the only available and accessible

avenue  for  anyone,  big or small, who can  have  their  say

without  fear  or  retribution.  More  often  than  not,  the

Internet  provides  the  only level playing  field  as  other

channels  sometimes  tend to be more  accessible  and  biased

towards the bigger man.  This is a special feature, a  sacred

quality  of the Internet.  The basic question, therefore,  is

whether  the Internet should be regulated like in other  news

medium.    Indeed,  it  is  ironical  that  in  new   section

78A(1)(b), the Bill makes an exception for election news  for

newspapers,  on TV and radio, but no exception  is  made  for

election  news on standalone Internet site.  Is the  Internet

then not a legitimate news medium?  I hope the Minister would

clarify this matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill does not prohibit Internet advertising, as

many  have  misunderstood, but it makes it  mandatory  for  a

person  to  register  with  the SBA  to  identify  the  name,

publisher and printer of the advertisement.  In my view, Sir,

if  the  purpose  of  the  advertisement  is  to  promote   a

candidate, to inform its electorate about the good work he is

doing, and it should be, I do not see why there should  be  a

strong  objection to identify the name of the  publisher  and

printer as they would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>

ultimately be the beneficiary of this advertisement.  But  if

the purpose is to speak negatively about someone else, spread

wild  rumours and allegations, then I can see the  objections

in  revealing such identities.  If you look at past elections

in  and  around  the region, advertisements and  publications

issued are seldom about the good work of one person but  more

about  the  bad  things others have done.   So  the  question

really  is  whether  we  should  allow  advertisements   made

anonymously.   The Internet gives us the freedom  to  inform.

But  one can also agree that we need to inform truthfully and

responsibly.   If  we  have  to  legislate  to  prevent   the

irresponsible  use  of  the Internet,  then  in  the  overall

interest, Sir, it is worth it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But like Prof. Chin who spoke earlier, I would have

expected the Bill to be more specific in detailing the  forms

of advertising allowed under new section 78A(1)(b) because  I

suspect   the   interpretation  of   the   details   can   be

controversial and problematic.  I would also like to ask  the

Minister whether he would think it more appropriate  to  have

this  responsibility delegated to the SBA,  as  the  Minister

himself  may perhaps be seen as partisan when having to  make

such  a  regulation,  especially  during  or  before  general

elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have seen examples in the region how political

candidates have to do battle on the Internet sites where  the

more juicy and damaging news were anonymously circulated when

the   real   battle  should  be  on  the   ground,   in   the

constituencies  and with the electorate.   There  is  a  real

danger  that  others without vested interest in the  election

can dictate the political campaign during election.  However,

despite  these provisions, we cannot regulate Internet  sites

posted  outside Singapore.  So although we have laws to  take

on  errant publishers through libel and defamation law suits,

the question is: is monetary compensation a sufficient remedy

for  someone  who  had lost the election because  of  rumour-mongering or false allegation?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, Sir, I would agree to the general

provisions  of  this Bill.  However, there are some  specific

issues which I am

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>

quite  uncomfortable with.  In particular, the Bill tries  to

force  a distinction between public communication and private

communication  that  simply does not apply  in  the  Internet

world.   The  Bill excludes individual to individual  e-mail.

But it says in clause 2(c) that Internet communication to any

section  of the public will be treated as publication.   Like

many  others who have commented earlier, does this mean  that

if  I  have  a  mailing  list with  100  friends,  I  can  be

prosecuted under the law if I e-mail my views on the election

to  my mailing list?  Will I be penalised for having too many

friends?  So, Sir, how do we deal with such practical issues?

How  do  we  draw a line between those who set out  to  cause

damage  and  mischief  and  others  who  do  not  have   such

intentions,  although  I  would  agree  that  the  e-mail  or

Internet makes it possible the consequences of such action to

be equally damaging?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason, Sir, that I suggest perhaps the

Minister describe an appeal procedure to be heard by the  SBA

before referring such matters for prosecution under the  law.

SBA,  with  its representatives from a good cross section  of

the  population, can play a delicate balancing role  in  this

matter.   Only in this way, Sir, we can preserve the  special

feature  of the Internet, while at the same time safeguarding

against real abuses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all

the 12 Members who have spoken on the Bill.  The impression I

got  after listening carefully to the debate is that everyone

supports  the  Bill in principle.  In fact, I  heard  only  a

dissenting  voice  from  Mr Chiam  with  regard  to  multiple

nominations during elections and some comments on the opinion

poll  during elections.  Apart from these comments,  I  think

everybody  supports  the  Bill in principle.   The  questions

relate mainly to details about the regulations, what kind  of

positive  list, how the law will apply in certain situations,

how   we   differentiate  between  broadcast  and  individual

communication, and so on.  In fact, in drafting the Bill, the

AG's  Chambers  has been very careful to try to  be  fair  to

everybody.  It is a very complex subject and we will have  to

learn as we go

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>

along.   Unfortunately, at this point in time,  the  detailed

regulations are not ready yet.  They will be ready before the

elections.   But  we do have to get this Bill  in  place  and

debate on the principles of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in my Second Reading speech, in fact

this is a positive step, in terms of liberalising the use  of

Internet for political campaigning.  As compared to 1997, the

Singapore  Broadcasting Authority had to ask some parties  to

remove posters on their websites.  This is definitely  a  big

step  forward.  The rules will apply equally to all  parties.

Everybody can use the Internet to reach out to their  voters,

and  to explain their positions.  The key point is that  they

have  to  do it responsibly.  They should be responsible  for

their sites.  They should not libel anybody.  They should not

spread  falsehoods,  and they should not  hide  behind  other

sites, for example, non-party political sites, some of  which

are   clearly  slanted  in  their  viewpoints  and  are  just

masquerading as neutral sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media, especially the foreign media, have been very

fast  to cry foul when DPM Lee Hsien Loong mentioned  at  the

launch   of  the  PAP  website  that  we  have  to  institute

regulations  to  allow  campaigning on  the  Internet.   They

assumed straightaway that we are going to clamp down, and all

kinds  of reports came out in the papers to criticise us  and

said  that we were tightening controls.  In fact,  I  do  not

know  whether  I  am correct but I think even the  Opposition

Members  here  were caught by surprise that we are  going  to

allow  it.  It is just a matter of how to do it.  Of  course,

they  have to oppose the Bill somehow.  In the end, they  did

express  some negative sentiments.  But it is a fact that  we

are moving forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is a very difficult place. It is full of

noise.   If  misinformation is spread, it can  go  round  the

world  several  times within a day.  So it is very  important

that for something so important as our General Elections  the

public  is  not  misled  and  the  parties  should  be  fully

responsible for their viewpoints.  They should come out  with

reasoned  arguments and state their positions.  There  are  a

lot of issues on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>

which  they have strong views.  It is up to them to  convince

the  public  openly through their web pages -  these  are  my

views,  this is why Government is wrong, etc, - and  the  PAP

will respond in kind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting this regulation, the main concern is really

with  the  broadcast  media through the Internet,  the  party

sites which are clearly identified with the parties and  also

those  sites  which  are political in  nature,  in  terms  of

content,  which are required by the SBA Class Licence  Scheme

to  be registered with us.  The intention is to make clear to

everybody  that these are the people behind the  Net,  behind

this  web page, and that they are in fact political in nature

even  though they claim to be neutral.  Other than that, they

have  been coming up with all kinds of views criticising  the

Government,  and  we take it in the right spirit.   There  is

freedom of speech, there is freedom of information.  You  can

access  information from anywhere around the world.  You  can

put  your views on the Internet.  If you want to e-mail  your

friends, by all means.  But how do we know that it is  not  a

party  member  who is sending thousands of  e-mails  out  and

bypassing our rules.  How do we contain the problem, in  what

is  basically a very noisy, very difficult environment  where

information and misinformation can spread equally quickly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I will just read out to you some comments

from  an American who is living here, a gentleman called John

B.  Carpenter.  This was published in the Washington Post  on

18th  July  and is titled "Singapore internet story  full  of

Western  hypocrisy".  This was in response to an  article  in

the  Washington  Times by Mr Regan Morris of  the  Associated

Press dated 16th July which was very quick off the mark after

DPM Lee's speech on the launch of the PAP website.  It reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As an American living in Singapore, I found the July 16

article about Singapore highly stereotyped and an example  of

why  many  in Asia are cynical about appeals for "freedom  of

speech".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report, from the Associated Press, states that the

Singapore  government  has  a  "firm  grip  on  the  flow  of

information".  I'm in Singapore, and I used

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>

the Internet to read this one-sided story.  I also can access

any Web site in the world critical of Singapore's government.

In  addition,  the BBC World Service Radio  airs  here.   The

Singaporean  government  certainly cannot  control  what  BBC

broadcasts from London.  The major American newsmagazines are

sold  here  as well.  They are required to be fair and  allow

the  government a "right of reply" when it perceives they are

unfair.   This seems, however, to be asking for no more  than

journalistic integrity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, it was integrity that this report lacked. No

regulation  has  yet  been introduced in Singapore,  but  the

reporter  sounds  as  if  he is sure it  will  be  draconian.

Meanwhile, the US government has been busy trying to regulate

Americans'  freedom of speech during elections.  Is  it  just

that we're (mostly) white and Western that we believe we  can

be trusted with such regulations, while Asians cannot?"



This is an article by John B. Carpenter in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the discussion today has been on the Internet

campaigning.   So  I will deal with this item  first.   As  I

explained,  the  intention is to have a level playing  field.

We  do  need to have some kind of regulations.  The intention

is  to  come out with the positive list, through regulations,

which will be available before the elections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions have been asked about the new laws. For

example,  this  question was raised  about  the  new  section

78B(e)  relating  to  publication of  any  news  relating  to

election in newspapers or in a radio or television broadcast.

I  think  Mr Zulkifli mentioned this.  I would like to  point

out  that  the new section 78B deals with Polling  Day.   The

intention  is  that, on that day itself, there  should  be  a

freeze on new advertising messages.  This is in line with the

current  practice to allow the voters to reflect  in  a  calm

manner without disturbances on how they want to vote.  On the

other hand, we must allow the newspapers to report.  So  they

will  be  reporting on the elections.  And Mr  Chiam  claimed

that the headlines are detrimental to the Opposition parties.

I  differ  with that view.  In fact, if I recall  during  our

last  elections in Cheng San, the report was full  about  Tan

Liang  Hong and his suits and counter suits, and so  on.   So

how  did they affect the election one way or the other?   But

the  point is we do want to have silence and calm on  Polling

Day, and that is why we disallow new advertising messages  on

that day.  Whatever is on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>

website  already, it remains.  But there should  not  be  any

changes.  The newspapers and TV should be free to report  the

news.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of mass e-mail is troubling quite a few

people.   I  will  have  to  get my officers  to  study  this

carefully.    The  intention  here  is  to   go   after   the

broadcasters, the websites reaching out to a lot  of  people.

The  intention is not to go after individuals  in  their  own

private  e-mailing.   But the point is:  will  somebody  hide

behind  this system and have a chain mail system  and  bypass

our  rules?  So this is something that we have to study  more

carefully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was raised whether SMS, ie, the handphones

that youngsters are very fond of using, will be covered.   At

the bottom of page 2, the Bill says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Publish' means make available to the general public,

or  any  section  thereof, in whatever form and  by  whatever

means,  including  broadcasting (by  wireless  telegraphy  or

otherwise) and transmitting on what is commonly known as  the

Internet."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

So  the  word "wireless" could mean handphones.  I think  SMS

will be covered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point is if you are trying to send out, for

example,  your election poll results, firstly,  you  are  not

supposed to do it, but if you do it and you try and  send  it

out  by  SMS to everybody, that will be violating the  rules.

But  the intention is not to disallow a young man to SMS  his

girl  friend and say, "Oh, I think this chap is speaking well

or he looks very attractive" or maybe a female sending to her

boy friend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned the point about pictures

being  stills  but that they can be made to be  moving.   The

Act,  which  disallows political films,  is  valid  and  will

apply.   It  does  not  disallow  audio  broadcasting.    For

example, if audio messages are sent on the Internet, they are

not  captured  under the Films Act.  On the  other  hand,  if

technology  allows us to piece together pictures as  if  they

are  moving  pictures,  then we will have  to  study  to  see

whether  in fact it is a political film.  The reason is  that

films are very emotive.  You can have a few sound bytes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2024</b></font><br><br>

and  influence elections by saying a few catchy  phrases  and

there  is  nobody to come and counter you.  That is  why  the

Government  decided  some years back  to  disallow  political

films  and political videos so that section of the  Act  will

apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question was asked about foreign sites. The rules are

intended  to  apply  to  all sites under  the  Class  Licence

Scheme.  They are supposed to be responsible, should  not  do

anything  that  instigates racial hatred, be  against  public

interest, public morality and so on.  All sites are bound  by

the  Class  Licence Scheme and, specifically,  for  political

sites and sites which are obviously political in nature, they

have to register with the SBA.  That is why we corrected this

situation  where  some  of the sites like  Think  Centre  and

SINTERCOM were not registered.  All we wanted is to get  them

to  register  and  tell  us who are  behind  the  sites,  the

publishers and the people responsible.  This way, we hope  to

put them on notice that they have to be responsible for their

sites.  The laws of the land will apply to cyberspace and, if

they libel somebody, they can be sued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be other questions on Internet campaigning

but I cannot trace them here.  If hon. Members would like  to

raise them, I will try and answer them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to answer the points raised by Mr Chiam

about  multiple  candidature.   It  shows  that  he  has   an

intention,  before  this Bill is passed, maybe  to  stand  in

Potong  Pasir, and also in Jalan Besar GRC under the SDA.   A

kind  of  tikam-tikam, ie, "If I lose in a GRC,  at  least  I

still  have Potong Pasir."  I think he should be fair to  the

voters.   If he wants to stand for an area and work for  that

area,  he should just stand for that area.  Why make  use  of

this Victorian rule which is out of date?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make the point that what we have done is,

really, very limited in scope.  We are not curtailing freedom

of  speech.  People can email, write letters to the press and

speak  freely.  But, for the purpose of the election,  during

the election period, and for political websites and non-party

political websites, we must have some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>

rules  to make sure that campaigning is orderly and  fair  to

everybody.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered

one  of  my queries in my speech and that is whether articles

in  local  newspapers are covered by clause 2, the definition

of election advertising.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I thank Mr Chiam for reminding me

about  his question.  On listening to his speech, I was under

the impression that he was asking whether this ban on opinion

polls  applies  to  the mass media.  The answer  is  yes,  it

applies  to  all  media,  not  just  the  Internet  but  also

newspapers, TV and so on.  Thank you for pointing  this  out.

The answer is that the mass media is also covered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to clarify that whilst

I  do not state clearly whether I oppose the Bill, I wish  to

clarify  that  although  I  have  no  problem  with  multiple

nominations,  which I support, and also on opinion  polls,  I

have  no  problem with that, I do not think the Bill  on  the

whole has enhanced or helped our position in any way by using

the Internet.  I am opposing that part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have some clarifications for the Minister. I

would  like  to know, first of all, for third party  websites

which are not under the Class Licence Scheme of SBA, if  they

publish  during  the election period, eg,  a  report  on  the

election campaign or their opinion on a political rally, will

that come under the Bill?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can he tell us what specifically will be the

regulation?  For instance, he mentioned just now that we  can

have  our  candidates' profile and things like that.   May  I

know  whether a political party website would be  allowed  to

publish  speeches  of  the rallies  and  report  on  election

campaigns, for instance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to know whether the current

regulations under the SBA are not sufficient enough  to  deal

with  whatever  problems that may arise during  an  election.

Why  is  there  a  need  to have a different  set  of  strict

regulations,  with  very  strict  and  wide  definitions   on

election

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>

advertising,   to   restrict  the  use  of  Internet   during

elections?  Is that not a restriction on the use of  Internet

by  political parties?  I do not understand how that actually

enhances the usage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I mentioned in my

speech  that  for  party  political websites,  the  allowable

features  will include party posters and manifesto, candidate

profiles,  announcement of party events,  party  position  on

issues, moderated chats and discussion forums.  This  is  not

exclusive.   There  will be other elements  which  are  still

being   drafted.   The  whole  point  is  that  this   covers

practically everything that they want to do.  So  as  regards

Mr  Low's  point about putting speeches on the Internet,  why

not?   And even his own comments on rallies, again, why  not?

These  are all covered.  These are positions on issues.   The

point  is  that  the  party must be  identified,  eg,  it  is

Workers' Party site and all these are Workers' Party's views.

People  can  go  and attend his rallies, they  can  read  his

speeches  on  the  Internet.  So this is  definitely  a  step

forward.   This  is  allowing campaigning  on  the  Internet,

within  certain regulations.  What we want to do is  to  make

sure  that  the parties and the people responsible know  that

they  have to comply with the law, be careful that what  they

put up does not libel anybody or spread falsehoods.  So I  do

not understand when Mr Low says it does not help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I get the impression that the hon. Member is

opposing this just for the sake of opposing.  We are allowing

and  he  is  opposing.  Shall we just not allow?   The  other

point is ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, shall we allow and without

strict regulation on that?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Low, can you allow the Minister

to finish?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> I think the Member will be aware that

Internet is a very dangerous place.  We can have all kinds of

poison letters and they will just spread like wild fire.   So

we  must  have some means to try and minimise this  and  make

sure that everything is orderly and fair.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other point about third-party sites, I mentioned

just now that third-party sites also have to comply with  the

Internet code of practice.  We require specifically political

sites  and sites which are obviously political in nature  and

active  political  sites  to  be  registered  with  the  SBA.

Otherwise, all the sites and web pages are covered under  the

Class  Licence  Scheme.  And if they violate the  rules  with

regard  to, for example, information that could cause  racial

riots  or is pornography, they could be fined or SBA can  ask

them to take down the websites.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. I wish to

clarify  that whilst I do not have problem with the amendment

on  Multiple Nomination and do not have much problem with the

ban  on  opinion  poll,  I do not support  the  amendment  to

regulate  the use of Internet during election.  Sir,  what  I

want  to  know is if a website which is not under  the  Class

Licence Scheme posts something on the web during the election

period  and supports a political party, for instance,  is  it

liable under the amendment?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Then we will have to see the actual

situation.  But, as I said, the intention is to go after  the

popular  sites,  the  main  sites of  parties  and  non-party

political  sites.  If it is an individual, eg,  a  young  man

posting  up his own site and saying "These are my views",  we

are  not  going to go after those people.  We are only  after

the  main broadcast medium, and an email is in the nature  of

private mail.  It just happens to be on the Internet.  So our

intention is not to go after those but, at the same time,  it

is  perfectly feasible for a member to arrange  to  send  all

kinds  of  messages  through  mass  mailing  and  defeat  the

regulations.  That is why we will have to study carefully how

we can regulate the situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister is

clear.  What I want to know is, for instance, Talkingcock.com

is  not  under the Class Licence Scheme.  During the election

period, eg, the website publishes some political speeches  of

opposition  candidates  or  have  certain  comments  on   the

election.  Will the web

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>

master  or  whoever posts it there be liable under the  Bill?

That is what I want to know.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Well, we will have to study the law.

But  my impression is that they are liable.  Of course,  they

are  outside  Singapore, and whether we  can  catch  them  is

something else.  But whoever targets Singaporeans,  our  laws

will apply to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clarification. In

other  words, the Minister is saying that any website  within

Singapore and can be prosecuted under Singapore law  will  be

brought  under  this  Bill.   Is  that  correct?   Not   only

political websites with a Class Licence but any website?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The intention is to make the rules

clear  for the main parties involved in the contest, in other

words, the party websites.  These are the areas we are mainly

after.   But  we  are aware also that some of  the  so-called

neutral sites, eg, Think Centre, they are obviously political

in  nature, their publications are slanted towards particular

parties.   So we also have to rope those in.  Those  will  be

our  main  targets.   At the other end,  there  will  be  the

individual  websites  which we are not concerned  about.   In

between is a gray area.  So it is a bit difficult for  me  to

be  very  specific  now.  We will have to see  what  actually

happens.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in other words,

anything  can happen because the Minister does not know  what

will  happen.   Anything  could happen  during  the  election

period to any website that publishes anything that relates to

political campaigns.  Is that so?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The Government will be very

reasonable  and  fair  in  whatever  action  it  takes.   And

whatever action it takes has to be defended.  If we are  seen

to be unreasonable, that might cost us votes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> In other words, is the Minister

saying  that  whether  a website that  is  going  to  publish

anything,  any  opinion, during the election  period  of  any

candidate or political party, there is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>

possibility that it can be liable under the Act, depending on

the  Government's reason or how reasonable the Government is?

Is that so?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The position will be clear when the

regulations have been drafted.  Right now we are debating  it

in  the  absence  of actual wording of the regulations.   The

regulations will be fair, they are meant to maintain a  level

playing field, and we should wait for the regulations  before

we pass judgement.

The  intention is not to go after everybody.  We  think  that

the  campaigning  should be done by the party  sites  openly.

Standing behind their platforms, their views, a lot of things

can  be  done on the Internet.  They can have chats,  forums,

speeches  and their views.  They can pick.  They cannot  have

political  films, because these are disallowed.   Other  than

that, almost anything that you can think of is allowed.   But

if  besides  that, there are other sites actively campaigning

for  a  particular  party, then we would  have  to  see  what

actions we should take on those sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Low, it appears to me that you

are raising fresh points which you should have raised in your

speech.   If you are making clarifications, you have to  seek

clarifications on something which the Minister has  said  and

not try to raise fresh points.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Yes, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,

before  he seeks clarification, can I just add to this  point

that  Mr  Lee  Yock  Suan was trying to explain?   This  Bill

covers  political parties and political sites as  defined  or

registered by SBA as political sites.  For example, the Think

Centre has been gazetted as a political site and is therefore

covered by this Bill.   Anything else is not covered by  this

Bill.   That  is my understanding of it.  Mr Low asked  about

Talkingcock.com.  Today it is not registered as  a  political

site,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>

not that I know of.  So it is not covered.  But should it  be

involved  in political discussions, should it be involved  in

the  way  that Think Centre has been involved, then  we  will

consider  including  it  as a political  site.   That  is  my

understanding.  I understand that there is also  a  new  site

called JamesGomez@yahoo or whatever it is.  If it is based in

Singapore, doing the same thing as he did in Think Centre, we

may also consider gazetting that as a political site.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek a clarification? The

Minister  just now mentioned that it will be clearer  if  the

regulations are ready.  I would like to ask him whether it is

fair, since the regulations are not ready, to present a  Bill

in  Parliament and he wants us to pass something that is  not

clear.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> The other Members have no problem

supporting  the  Bill,  including  Mr  Chiam.   I  think  the

position is about 95% clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>3.50 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Constitutional Amendment Bill proposes to amend

Article  114  of the Constitution, to enable the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs to implement a new superannuation scheme, known

as  the  INVEST Plan, for the Home Affairs Uniformed Services

(HUS).   The INVEST Plan will be established under  the  Home

Affairs  Uniformed Services Superannuation Bill 2001 which  I

will  move  afterwards.   The INVEST Plan  will  replace  the

current  contract and full CPF schemes of the  HUS  officers.

It  will also replace the Pension scheme of the Police Senior

Officers.   The  INVEST  Plan is similar  to  the  SAVER  and

Premium  Plans  introduced  for  uniformed  officers  in  the

Singapore Armed Forces in 1998 and 2000 respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment will allow Parliament to establish

separate  Government  funds to pay pensions,  gratuities  and

other allowances in respect of any public service instead  of

meeting   the   payments  from  the  Pension  Fund   or   the

Consolidated  Fund.   The  amendment  is  necessary  as   the

retirement  benefits  of  Home  Affairs  Uniformed   Services

officers  who join the INVEST Plan will no longer be  charged

on  the Pension Fund or the Consolidated Fund, but on  a  new

fund known as the INVEST Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the setting up of the INVEST Fund to pay

for  the  retirement benefits of the Home  Affairs  Uniformed

Services officers, there will be a consequential amendment to

the  Pension  Fund  Act (Chapter 224A).   This  amendment  is

contained   in   the   Home   Affairs   Uniformed    Services

Superannuation Bill 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain the INVEST Plan in greater detail when I

move  the  Second  Reading  of  the  Home  Affairs  Uniformed

Services Superannuation Bill 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That the Bill be now read

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Affairs Uniformed Services (HUS) plays a key

role  in  meeting  public  safety and  security  needs.   The

presence of  capable Home Affairs Uniformed Services officers

will  help to maintain a stable environment needed to attract

investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the HUS is able to execute its roles in

meeting  public security and safety needs, we need to attract

and  retain good officers to join the Home Affairs  Uniformed

Services.   It  is  with  this objective  in  mind  that  the

Ministry  of  Home Affairs (MHA) commissioned a study  by  an

international  consultancy firm to review  the  Home  Affairs

Uniformed  Services career structures and  systems  in  April

2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Affairs Uniformed Services Career Review aimed

to  restructure the Home Affairs Uniformed Services career to

ensure  that  it  is  well positioned to meet  future  public

security  and safety needs.  It studied the career structure,

pay  and  benefits package, career management and performance

management of the HUS officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted the recommendation to

introduce a super-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>

annuation  scheme for HUS officers.  The scheme is  known  as

the  INVEST Plan.  The Plan will replace the Contract  scheme

that  is  currently  open to Home Affairs Uniformed  Services

officers in the Civil Defence, Prisons, Narcotics Service, as

well  as  the Police (Junior) Officers Service.  Officers  on

the   Full  CPF  Scheme  in  the  above  services  will  also

participate  in  the  INVEST Plan.   They  will  continue  to

receive   Full  CPF  contributions  and  will  also   receive

additional  contributions credited into the  INVEST  Plan  to

build  up a superannuation fund to help them transit  out  of

service  at the age of 50 or 55.   The Plan will also replace

the  Pension scheme of the Police (Senior) Officers  Service.

The  Plan  will  apply  to  all new  Home  Affairs  Uniformed

Services  officers  from  1st October  2001.   Existing  Home

Affairs  Uniformed Services officers are given an  option  to

convert  to the INVEST Plan and have the accumulated benefits

under  their  existing schemes transferred to the  new  Plan.

Let me explain the rationale of the INVEST Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirement age for new Home Affairs Uniformed

Services  officers will be lowered by 5 years, in recognition

of  the  rigorous requirements of the Home Affairs  Uniformed

Services.   Being in a uniformed organisation,  HUS  officers

are  required  to  be physically fit, agile  and  alert  when

discharging  their day-to-day duties.  For  instance,  Police

officers  need  to  be  agile and fit to  perform  patrolling

duties,   which  include  physically  strenuous  tasks   like

pursuing   criminals.    Civil   Defence   officers   perform

operational   duties  such  as  fire-fighting   and   rescue,

emergency ambulance and hazardous materials mitigation, which

require   considerable  physical  effort.   Similar  exacting

physical  fitness and mental alertness requirements apply  to

officers in the Prisons and Narcotics schemes of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the increasing civilianisation and

outsourcing of non-core functions will reduce the  number  of

desk-bound  administrative jobs.  This in  turn  reduces  the

traditional channel used to hold older officers  who  are  no

longer suited for rigorous, frontline work, till they retire.

For example, the number of desk-bound

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>

administrative  jobs  in the Police force  will  decrease  to

about 10 percent in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus from 1st October 2001, all new officers joining the

Home Affairs Uniformed Services will retire at age 50 if they

retire  as  Junior Officers, and at age 55 if they retire  as

Senior Officers.  Serving officers can choose to opt into the

new  scheme.   The  INVEST  Plan is to  help  these  officers

transit out of service into their second career.  Similar  to

the  SAVER and Premium Plans that have been introduced in the

Singapore   Armed  Forces  (SAF),  the  INVEST  Plan   offers

reasonable  superannuation terms to  uniformed  officers  who

have to retire earlier than other civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs has also taken the

opportunity  to replace the Pension scheme for Police  Senior

Officers  with the INVEST Plan.  This is because  our  review

found  that  a  plan  which  builds up  officers'  retirement

benefits  through  making  monthly  contributions  into   the

officers'  accounts during the course of their careers,  such

as  the  INVEST  Plan, is better able to meet  the  needs  of

Police  Senior  Officers, as compared to one  where  officers

receive  a  fixed quantum on retirement, such as the  Pension

scheme.   This is also to make it consistent with our  Senior

Officers   in  the  other  Home  Affairs  Uniformed  Services

Schemes.  We will then have uniformity in treatment,  instead

of   differential  treatment  for  the  Home  Affairs  Senior

Officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanism of the INVEST Plan is similar to the SAF's

SAVER  and  Premium Plans.  Under the INVEST Plan,  the  Home

Affairs  Ministry  will  contribute  an  amount  based  on  a

percentage  of  the officer's monthly salary into  an  INVEST

Retirement  Account kept for the officer.  It is 7  3/4%  for

Junior Officers and 6% for Senior Officers, starting from the

7th year of service.  Because of the additional component  to

replace  pension, Police Senior Officers will  get  a  higher

contribution  rate, that is 11 3/4% from the  first  year  of

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Junior Officers will receive retention

payments  in  a  separate  INVEST  Retention  Account.    The

retention payments will be credited into the officer's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>

Retention Account on satisfactory completion of each year  of

service, during the officer's first 10 years of service.  The

payments  equal one month of salary for each year of  service

during  the  first  6 years.  In the 7th to  10th  year,  the

payments  rise to 1 1/2  months of salary for  each  year  of

service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds in the officers' Retirement and Retention

accounts  will be pooled to form an investment fund known  as

the  INVEST  Fund.   The  INVEST  Fund  will  be  managed  by

professional   fund   managers.   Based   on   returns   from

investments,  dividends will be credited into the  individual

accounts  of  each  officer.  An INVEST  Board  of  Trustees,

chaired  by  the  Permanent Secretary, and comprising  senior

Home  Affairs  Ministry officials and  people  with  relevant

experience from the public and private sectors, will  oversee

the fund managers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated amounts in the INVEST accounts can be

withdrawn  by  the officers progressively.   If  the  officer

resigns  prematurely, the Ministry will retain  part  of  the

amount  in  the  officer's accounts.  The  officer  can  only

withdraw the full amount in his accounts if he serves a  full

career  with  the  Home Affairs Uniformed Services,  when  he

retires  at  age  50  or 55 for Junior  and  Senior  Officers

respectively.    The   Ministry   expects   the   progressive

withdrawal  feature of the INVEST Plan to enhance  retention,

thus helping the Ministry to attract good quality officers to

join and remain with the Home Affairs Uniformed Services  for

a full career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Home Affairs Uniformed Services officers are,

generally,  pleased with the review and the  enhancements  in

the  career management.  Junior Officers who have served more

than  10  years  and  who will be given a  one-off  retention

payment  are  happy.   Briefings on the details  on  the  new

scheme  of  service and the INVEST Retention  and  Retirement

Plan  started  in mid-July, with individual consultation  for

officers  who  need  to discuss further  their  options.   In

addition to information

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>

booklets, officers were also given a projection software  for

them  to  compute  and compare projected benefits  under  the

current and the new terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the INVEST retirement plan where serving officers

opt for earlier retirement age, officers decide based on what

suits  them  best,  taking  into account  their  age,  family

commitments  and  plans after retirement.   While  some  have

expressed concern about the limited second career choices  at

age  55, others look forward to being able to start a  second

career  after earlier retirement.  Officers are also  pleased

with  the possible additional source of savings available  at

retirement from the retirement fund.  In general, the  INVEST

Retirement  Plan has fared better among younger  officers  as

officers with 10 or less years to retirement feel that  their

investment  is not likely to gain much in the short  span  of

time.   Ultimately, each serving officer chooses  what  suits

him best.  No serving officer is worse off than before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will provide the legislative framework to

implement  the  INVEST Plan.  It will also make consequential

amendments  to  the Pension Fund Act to allow  for  officers'

benefits accumulated under the Pension Fund to be transferred

from the Pension Fund to the INVEST Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee
