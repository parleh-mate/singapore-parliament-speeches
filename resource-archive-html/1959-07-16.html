<div align="center"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>PROMISSORY OATHS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  I beg to introduce a Bill  intituled

"An   Ordinance  to  amend  the  Promissory   Oaths

Ordinance (Chapter 58 of the Revised Edition)."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Now, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have the Certificate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I lay upon the Table a

Certificate  of  Urgency signed  by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara in respect of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are

typed copies of the Bill available for Members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, hon. Members, who know the Promissory Oaths Ordinance, that is Cap. 58 of the Revised

Edition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



would  have seen in that Ordinance the form of  the

Minister's  oath.  The  Minister's  oath  in   that

Ordinance is subscribed before the Governor or  the

Deputy  Governor  or the Officer Administering  the

Government of the Colony of Singapore, and no doubt

hon.  Members will agree that the form of that oath

needs   to  be  corrected  in  the  light  of   the

constitutional changes that have been made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new form of oaths is set out in the Singapore

(Constitution)  Order  in  Council  in  the   First

Schedule  to  that  Order in  Council.  It  is  the

purpose  of  the  Bill  now  before  the  House  to

substitute this new form of oaths, which  is  shown

in    the   First   Schedule   of   the   Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council, for that  form  of

oaths   which  is  prescribed  under  the  existing

Ordinance; the Bill sets out to do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that the promissory oaths

shall be taken by Parliamentary Secretaries. Now if

you will look at the form of oaths that is shown in

the  First Schedule to the (Constitution) Order  in

Council, you will see quite clearly that oaths  can

only  be  taken  by  a  Minister  or  an  Assistant

Minister. In view of that fact, we have also had to

provide  in  the Bill before the House  that  these

oaths  in  their present form can also be taken  by

Parliamentary Secretaries, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer Members to the text of the Bill

itself, particularly to clause 3 of the Bill, where

it  is  stated that "The Prime Minister  and  every

other  Minister  and every Parliamentary  Secretary

shall  before entering on the duties of his  office

take  the  Oath  of Allegiance and the  appropriate

oath  for the due execution of his office: ".  Then

follows the proviso that "a Parliamentary Secretary

who  has  been  appointed and has  entered  on  the

duties  of his office before the 15th day of  July,

1959,  shall  take the Oath of Allegiance  and  the

appropriate  oath  for  the due  execution  of  his

office  as soon as may be after that date." It  was

quite  impossible for the Parliamentary Secretaries

to  take the oath that is shown in the Schedule  to

the Order in Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



until  the Bill has been introduced to provide  for

that,   and   the   Bill  so  provides   for   that

contingency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Byrne].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read the Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><h4>TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[15th  July, 1959], "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, at the end of the Assembly

sitting yesterday, I explained the motion that  was

before   us.   Regarding  the  criticism   of   the

Opposition, I feel that it was not criticism  which

was  constructive but quite the reverse. As we  see

it.  Mr  Speaker,  the  object  of  Government  in

transferring the functions of the City Council  to

the Minister for National Development is mainly  to

ease   the  administration  and  to  enable  better

services to be provided for the public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yesterday, we heard the Opposition wasting

our  time  on the talk of whether it was democratic

or  not of Government to take over the functions of

the City Council. I feel that our criticism of this

matter   should  be  logical  and  realistic.   The

Opposition  should understand the whole purpose  of

the Government exercise, which is to put it simply,

to make it easier for the proper implementation and

also for the benefit of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, on this side, have explained what

difficulties a member of the public has to face  if

he  wants to, say, build a house. The complications

involved  are  known  to many. The  Government,  by

taking  over  the  functions of the  City  Council,

hopes  to  remove these difficulties and  hopes  to

have  matters affecting the public dealt with  most

speedily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assured the employees of the City Council

and the Rural Board that they will not be dismissed

from  service as a result of this take-over.  There

is  no  justification whatsoever for any  sense  of

insecurity  of employment. All we want  is  a  more

efficient  administration for the benefit  of  all.

This  matter  had been dealt with at length  and  I

feel  that  it  is  now time for the  Minister  for

National Development to make his final reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> In reply. Mr Speaker, whether

it   is   fate  or  whether  it  is  just  a   mere

coincidence, the fact is that wherever  the  Member

for  Farrer  Park has been or has gone to,  it  has

been  my strange and unpleasant task to follow  him

wherever he is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park was in the City

Council for nearly ten years and we see the mess he

left  for  us to clean up. Mr Speaker, the  Member

for   Farrer   Park  was  also  in  the   Singapore

Improvement Trust and we are now doing the cleaning

up.  We  have  chosen the S.I.T. building  as  the

headquarters   for   the   Ministry   of   National

Development, because we believe that at present  it

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



the most filthy and the most corrupt institution in

Singapore, and we are going there to clean it up as

expeditiously as possible. Mr Speaker, the process

of  cleaning up has started. The S.I.T. building in

the  past has been famous or has been notorious for

two  reasons.  One  is that there  have  been  many

suicides,  romantic affairs and financial problems.

There  have been many suicides from that  building,

but  to  the people of Singapore, the famous S.I.T.

building in Upper Pickering Street is noted not for

its  suicides but for the filth and the  corruption

which  the small nine-storey building can  contain.

The  process of cleaning up the small building  has

started. Immediately I was appointed the Manager of

the  S.I.T., I called for the file of  one  of  the

most  important persons in the S.I.T. - Mr Firshman.

He was-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering how the

Minister's remarks could be related to the  present

Bill,  which  is  the City Council (Suspension  and

Transfer  of  Functions)  Bill.  The  Minister,  of

course,   will   have   other   opportunities    of

criticising the S.I.T. At the moment, we are on the

Second Reading of the City Council (Suspension  and

Transfer of Functions) Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I was replying to

a  pertinent remark made by the Member  for  Farrer

Park  that he hoped it would not be the last of  us

as regards the S.I.T. building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are confident that, as with the City

Council and the City Hall, the S.I.T. building will

be  the  second  step  in the  right  direction  of

achieving  a social revolution. As I mentioned,  we

are  proceeding along those steps. As I have  said,

one  person scooted the day his file was asked for.

He  knew that the P.A.P. means business and we  are

confident,  Mr  Speaker, that the S.I.T. building

will not be the last of the P.A.P., or the last  of

our  Ministry,  as the Member for Farrer  Park  has

envisaged, but it will only be one step which  will

bring   us   further  to  our  goal  of  a   social

revolution,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the policy of rationalisation and streamlining of the machinery of government in

Singapore  has been laid down in our policy  speech

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



was  approved by the electorate on 30th May,  1959.

May   I  repeat  here  certain  extracts  from  the

P.A.P.'s policy statement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the important decisions we will take for

the  welfare of the people of Singapore, should the

P.A.P. be  returned  as  the  government,  is  the

immediate  re-organisation of the present unwieldy,

inefficient,  expensive  and  wasteful  system   of

government.



The   advantages  of  the  re-organisation  of  the

administration of the State of Singapore by  having

only  one  Central authority for this Island  State

are briefly as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Politically, the absorption in the Central

Government of parallel administrations in the

forms  of  the  City Council  and  the  Rural

District  Councils  designate  covering   the

whole  island  makes  for  an  efficient  and

effective Central Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Administratively, the centralisation of

State  functions in an island like  Singapore

will reduce much red-tape for the benefit  of

the  public, and also facilitate the work  of

national construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Financially, it will mean the saving of

millions of dollars a year."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically, administratively and financially,

the  people  of  Singapore have  much  to  gain  by

rationalisation of the organs of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today in this Assembly we are facing similar situations faced by other countries in

other  parts of Asia, countries which have achieved

independence.  In  this country,  Mr  Speaker,  we

always  find  that the compradore class  which  the

colonial rulers left behind are often more colonial-minded than their colonial masters. They try to ape

their  colonial masters in all their forms  without

understanding  their contents and  their  meanings.

They are capable of copying every iota of the forms

practised   in  British  parliamentary   democratic

institutions  without  understanding  what  is  the

essence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes wonder, Mr Speaker, whether hon.

Members  of  the  Opposition,  some  of  whom  were

Members of the previous Government, understand what

is meant by democracy. Even an Englishman, a person

in  the  category  of Mr John Ede  (ex-Member  for

Tanglin) and one of the former close colleagues  of

the present Member for Farrer Park,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



mentioned in this Assembly on 12th December,  1958,

Vol. 3, columns 1227-8 of the Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We come to the conclusion, as we must, that the

cost of administration on this small island of  220

square  miles  is  out  of all  proportion  to  the

returns  we  get  and  to what  we  can  reasonably

afford.  We  cannot  afford  the  luxuries  of  the

democratic system but only the essentials; by which

I  mean  that  we  cannot  afford  the  cost  of  a

multiplicity  of  administration -  a   central   or

national    government,   local    government    as

represented  by the City Council for one  part  of

the  island, and four new District Councils for the

rest of it."



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  may  I  say  that  he  omitted  one paragraph  in  the  previous Government - a  colonial

government  under  the  Governor  and  the  Central

Government  under  Tun Lim Yew  Hock,  the  present

Member  for Cairnhill. Mr John Ede, ex-Member  for

Tanglin, continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We often refer to Singapore as a City State. Why

do  we not run it like a City State under a single,

streamlined, rationalised administration?  Most  of

us  have  been  brought up to  accept  the  British

pattern    of   central   government   and    local

government - I have certainly been very close  to  it

myself - but it is becoming clear that we must recast

our  thinking and reshape our ideas, and  have  the

courage   to  admit  that  it  is  not  necessarily

satisfactory on a small island."



<br><br>He quoted examples -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boundary between the City and District

Councils  for  many miles runs down the  middle  of

roads, Braddell Road for example."



<br><br>Mr  Ede  was trying to explain to Members  of  the House how much red-tape meant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The City Council may want to resurface and widen

their  half  of  the  road, even  to  make  a  dual

carriage-way, but the District Council, which  will

be responsible for the other half of the road," -

<br><br>the other half of the road-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"may have other ideas. So nothing will happen and

the road will deteriorate, and it will cost more to

put it in order in the long run."...



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads are in the hands of the Government, the

City  Council, the District Councils and  now  even

the   Rural  Development  Panel.  There  are   two

assessment offices and two policies. Traffic is  in

the  hands of the City Council in certain  aspects,

the  traffic police and licensing under  the  Chief

Secretary, and transport to some extent  under  the

Minister for Communications and Works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is to be a Government housing

authority,  local  governments  are  in  charge  of

building plans and construction by-laws."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Mr Ede was quoting examples  of  how the   task   of  national  construction  could   be

frustrated by this red-tape.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, certain hon. Members of this House

mentioned  that  to scrap the City  Council  or  to

absorb the City Council into the central Government

would  mean  less  chance  of  a  merger  with  the

Federation,  because  the  Federation   has   local

government.   To  a  mind  like  mine,   I   cannot

understand what logic it has - that merger is related

to  the  existence of local government authorities.

But  since  certain hon. Members are interested  in

mentioning  the Federation, let us show  them  what

Mr Ede mentioned in his debate on the relationship

between rationalisation of the Government machinery

in Singapore and merger with the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we show to the Federation and to our

neighbours  and to the world that we  are  bent  on

putting our administrative house in order, reducing

our  overheads  and  lowering our  expenditure,  we

should attract both the Federation and the world to

our  doorstep.  Indeed, eventual  merger  with  the

Federation will be easier if we have one  clear-cut

administrative body from which certain subjects can

go  under  central  control  with  the  minimum  of

reorganisation.  We  shall  appeal  more   to   the

Federation if we are a financial asset, and  not  a

liability."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is to show that often we find in countries which have attained independence that

the  compradore  class which the  colonial  masters

left   behind  have  only  learned  the  forms   of

democratic   parliamentary   institutions   without

understanding their contents and their meanings. We

in  Singapore  cannot afford the luxuries  of  this

lavish   copying  of  the  outward  forms  of   the

democratic  system. To our people at large  and  to

the  large masses, democracy means how fast we  can

deliver  the  goods,  and how  much  goods  we  can

deliver. It does not mean, as the Member for Farrer

Park   said,  how  many  political  groups   should

administer  the state of affairs at the same  time.

That  was  the  situation during his ten  years  of

office  in  the City Council. We had  the  colonial

group  represented  by the President.  We  had  the

Progressive  Party group, we had the Labour  Front;

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



had a group of Independents. That is the system  of

administration  which has produced  scandals,  like

the leaks in the Murnane Reservoir which at present

cannot  be used; the Odeon-Katong cinema;  and  the

millions  of  dollars  spent on  the  Tebrau  River

scheme where six sets of machinery were bought  but

one  only was used during the past five years,  the

other live sets being thrown into the dust to rust.

And  scandals  over the Victoria Memorial  Theatre,

and   many   other  scandals  which  we   have   no

opportunity to reveal, because on the positive side

we  are  spending our time in doing  work  for  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, that is the system of

Government which the Member for Farrer Park and his

colleagues  would  like to  see  continue  in  this

island - a system of Government where there are  very

many  different  competing political  groups  whose

basic  fundamentals are the same but whose personal

interests  are conflicting - where many shady  things

happen  and where we cannot pin down responsibility

on any person or whoever he may be, a Councillor, a

member  of the staff, or of a political party.  The

previous  Government did not want to  fight  vested

interests  because  they  were  afraid  of   vested

interests,  or  because they were  linked  up  with

vested  interests, I will just quote an example  of

how,  under  the  old regime, a  person  could  get

things  done  or could not get things done.  For  a

village  in the rural area to get a standpipe,  the

headman  must first write to the Rural  Development

Commission,  which is under the direct jurisdiction

of  the  Chief  Minister, the  present  Member  for

Cairnhill.  The Chief Minister will  write  to  the

Member  of  the Local Government, perhaps,  who  in

turn writes to the Rural Board, and which might  in

turn  write to the District Council, which in  turn

write  to  the City Council, perhaps,  through  the

auspices  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government.

Hundreds  of  memos  would have  been  sent  around

asking  for  a  standpipe  to  be  erected  in  the

village. The people in the kampong cannot wait  for

the  Ministers and their Permanent Secretaries and

the  Heads  of  Departments  wasting  time  on  the

memoranda for their needy water supply. Now, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



Speaker,  is  that the way whereby the  Member  for

Farrer   Park   wishes   democracy   practised   in

Singapore - checks and counter-checks? You check  and

counter-check  to  make  sure  that  the  money  is

properly  spent, and let the poor farmers wait  for

many years before they get their water supply.  Mr

Speaker,  if it is with honest intentions that  the

money  should be properly spent - well and good!  But

from  my  experience  in these  few  weeks  in  the

Ministry of National Development, I have seen, from

records.   Ministers  and  Heads   of   Departments

spending  thousands of dollars in salaries  dealing

with matters of difference which were not more than

$5 or $10.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has also asked me a

question - Is  the Minister for National  Development

going  to  issue  hawkers'  licences  himself?  Mr

Speaker, the Minister for National Development  has

no  personal  ambition to distribute  or  to  issue

hawkers'   licences  himself,  nor  taxi   drivers'

licences,  nor  trishaw riders' licences,  nor  any

form  of  licences. We believe in organisation,  we

believe  in building up an honest, efficient  civil

service whereby the Minister himself does not  have

to  issue  licences.  The Member  for  Farrer  Park

perhaps  wishes to see us carry on with the  method

of  issuing licences which he himself had practised

in  the City Council. Before we went into the  City

Council  in  December  1957,  it  was  the  general

knowledge  of  hawkers  that,  in  order   to   get

licences,  the  applicant must  get  the  requisite

number  of  bottles of "TST" brandy, the  requisite

number  of katties of oranges and tins of biscuits,

and  send them to the person concerned in order  to

get a licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, we do not believe in

Councillors   and   Ministers  themselves   issuing

licences.  We  believe in evolving and  training  a

competent, honest and efficient civil  service  to

issue the licences, and the Ministers will just  do

the  check  and counter-check. We have  found  that

licences issued when the Member for Farrer Park was

in  office in the City Council led to many  abuses.

Mr  Speaker, democracy to the P.A.P. does not only

mean   the   form   of   parliamentary   democratic

institutions   practised  in  Britain   and   other

countries.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



What is more important to us is the content of  the

democratic institutions, and by that we  mean  that

we must be able to deliver the goods and we must be

able   to   effect   economies,   rationatise   the

administration  and deliver as  much  goods  as  we

possibly can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, our policy to rationalise the City Council and absorb it into the Government

administration  is  one  of  the  steps - a  positive

step - we  are  taking to uphold democracy,  for  the

benefit,  not  as in the past, of  a  small  vested

group,  but  for  the benefit of  the  overwhelming

majority of the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, I move "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker and Members of the House, I should like to draw your attention to section 28 (1) of

the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council where

it is provided that-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Yang di-Pertuan Negara, acting in accordance

with  the  advice  of the Prime Minister,  may,  by

instrument under the public seal, appoint Assistant

Ministers  from among the Members of the  Assembly

to  assist  Ministers  in the  discharge  of  their

duties and functions".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government has decided that, in accordance with the practice in advanced

democracies  like  the - United Kingdom  and  Ceylon,

Parliamentary  Secretaries be appointed  to  assist

Ministers in the discharge of their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



duties  and  functions.  It  is  not  proposed   to

recommend   to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara   the

appointment of any Assistant Minister under section

28   of  the  Singapore  (Constitution)  Order   in

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Ministers of the Crown Act in the

United   Kingdom,  there  is  provision   for   the

appointment of Parliamentary Secretaries. There  is

a  Parliamentary Under-Secretary when the  Minister

is   a   Minister  of  State  and  a  Parliamentary

Secretary  when the Minister is not a  Minister  of

State,  and there is provision in that Act for  the

appointment of 27 such Parliamentary Secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same position obtains in the Constitution of

the Government of Ceylon. Under the Ceylon Order in

Council, there is provision for the appointment  of

Parliamentary  Secretaries, and  such  appointments

cannot  exceed  the  number of  Ministers  who  are

appointed. You will see, Mr Speaker and Members of

the   House,  that  our  Bill  provides  that   the

Parliamentary  Secretary will be appointed  by  the

Prime  Minister or by a Minister, and will  perform

such functions as may be specified in his letter of

appointment.  To  that extent we  depart  from  the

provision  of  section 28 where the appointment  of

Assistant Minister is by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

on the advice of the Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker and Members of the House, there is a provision in that part of the Order in Council

dealing with the Legislative Assembly wherein it is

stated  that  the  seat of a  Member  shall  become

vacant  if  he  is appointed to or to  act  in  any

public office to which there is any remuneration or

allowance attached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Order in Council also provides in its

definition  section that for the  purposes  of  the

Order  in  Council  the holders of  the  office  of

Speaker,   Deputy   Speaker,  Minister,   Assistant

Minister  or  Member of the Assembly shall  not  be

considered as public officers by reason of the fact

that the incumbents of these offices are in receipt

of  any  remuneration  or allowances  (including  a

pension or other like allowance).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision in the definition section

of  the  Order  in  Council  to  enable  the  local

legislature to provide that an office shall not  be

a  public office for the purposes of that  Part  of

the  Order  in Council dealing with the Legislative

Assembly, and if the local legislature so  provides

that,   any   such  provision  shall  have   effect

accordingly as if that provision of that  law  were

enacted therein.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill therefore, Mr Speaker, provides that

the   holder  of  the  office  of  Speaker,  Deputy

Speaker,   Minister,  Parliamentary  Secretary   or

Member  of the Assembly shall not be deemed  to  be

the  holder of a public office for the purposes  of

Part  V  of the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in

Council,  that  is, the Part which deals  with  the

constitution of the Legislative Assembly, by reason

of   the  fact  that  he  is  in  receipt  of   any

remuneration or allowance in respect of his  tenure

of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Parliamentary Secretaries have already been

appointed,  it  is necessary to have the  Ordinance

enacted  as  soon  as  possible,  and  to  give  it

retrospective effect to the 8th day of June,  1959,

the date when the Government took office.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to make

temporary provisions to suspend for a period of six

months  those  sections  of  the  Control  of  Rent

Ordinance which operate to the detriment  of  legal

farmers and other legal tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, with the present law as it is, we have found that many unscrupulous building

societies  or  landlords have  acquired  acres  and

acres  of  agricultural land at a very low  nominal

price.  There are hundreds of families  of  farmers

who  have  paid their rents sometimes  for  two  or

three generations. These building societies, or  in

some  eases unscrupulous persons, buy over the land

at an average of a few hundred dollars an acre, and

get  the  S.I.T. and the City Council  to  approve

their  building plans. So long as the plans are  in

order, the S.I.T. and the City Council will have to

pass them. These unscrupulous contractors will take

such  building  plans, engage lawyers,  go  to  the

court and seek the eviction of the farmers who,  in

certain cases, to my personal knowledge, have  been

staying  on  the  land as legal tenants  for  three

generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of eviction, no compensation is

ever   given.   Neither  is   there   the   humane

consideration  to provide alternative  sites.  When

the Government evicts people from the land in order

to  develop the land for the benefit of the  nation

and  the  public at large, compensation is normally

given,  and  more often suitable alternative  sites

are  offered. But this is not the case with  these

unscrupulous societies and other persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, it is the intention of

Government  to  introduce  at  an  early  date  new

legislation to assist farmers and householders, but

definitely not illegal squatters of land. The  idea

of the new legislation is to assist legal farmers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



and  legal householders to obtain compensation,  or

the  offer  of  a suitable alternative  site,  when

evicted    from   land   required   for   so-called

development  purposes. Pending the introduction  of

such  legislation  which will  take  some  time  to

draft, it is considered necessary and desirable  to

make  temporary provisions to suspend for a  period

of six months paragraphs (i) and (k) of section 15,

subsection (1) of the Control of Rent Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill is a short and simple one. Sub-clause (2) of clause 1 provides for the

Ordinance  to remain in force for a period  of  six

months only. Clause 3 provides for the deletion  of

paragraphs  (i)  and (k) of section 15,  subsection

(1) . In other words, these two paragraphs will have

no  effect  for  six  months. Clause  4  is  merely

consequential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Ong Eng Guan):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to speed up the

procedure for dealing with unauthorised structures.

Mr  Speaker, as Members of this House  are  aware,

during the past few months, particularly during the

time when the P.A.P. was not in the City Council or

during  the  time  of  the  Tang  Peng  Yeu-Vasagar

regime,  unauthorised houses were springing  up  in

thousands in all parts of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



Island. Most of these unauthorised houses are being

built  by  unscrupulous building  contractors,  who

build  them at a cost of $1,000 to $1,500 each  and

sell  them at a price of about $4,000 each. In some

of  these  cases,  permission  from  the  landlord,

whether it is private land or State land, has never

been   obtained   and   the   purchaser   of   such

unauthorised  structure finds  himself  or  herself

overnight  that  he or she is in possession  of  an

illegal hut, squatting on land to which he  or  she

has  no title. Eventually, the hut will have to  be

demolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present procedure dealing with unauthorised

structures requires the City Council or  the  local

authority  first  to serve a notice  on  the  owner

requiring him to demolish an unauthorised building,

and if he does not do so, a summons has to be taken

out  in  the  Court.  Eventually,  by  the  time  a

mandatory order for eviction is obtained  from  the

Magistrate's  Court,  several  months  would   have

lapsed, by which time the building would have  been

occupied  and  action  to  demolish  would   result

normally in great hardships to the occupiers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These unauthorised structures do not conform to

any  standards of hygiene, health requirements  and

fire  hazard  requirements. They are  built  mostly

from flimsy materials, from timber and planks which

the  timber mills are not able to sell in the  open

market, and which are sold to them on credit  at  a

very  low cost. They are very serious fire hazards.

In  most  cases the building of these  unauthorised

huts  is  undertaken  in  conjunction  with  secret

societies.  It is known that during  the  last  few

months, most of the racketeers have been backed  by

unscrupulous politicians and secret societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments now proposed will enable immediate

action to be taken against unauthorised structures,

by  imposing a daily fine of $50 against  offenders

as  well  as permitting a local authority to  enter

the  premises to demolish as well as to execute any

work  ordered by the Court. Further, a penalty  is

now laid down for anyone who sells



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



or enters into an agreement to sell an unauthorised

building. In such a case, the offender is liable to

a  term of imprisonment of not less than six months

or  more  than a year, and in addition a  fine  not

exceeding   $5,000.  Any  person  who   erects   an

unauthorised building and sells it subsequently, is

liable  also to the same imprisonment and fine.  In

addition, the injured party, that is the purchaser,

may be given a refund of the purchase money as well

as compensation, if so ordered by the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been provided in the new section 170A that

in any prosecution under this section, the sanction

of  the  Minister shall be required and  there  is,

therefore,  the safeguard that every case  will  be

considered  and only the racketeer will be  charged

in Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to make an

amendment  to  section  117  of  the  Ordinance  to

require  a  person who is aggrieved  by  an  annual

value  fixed on his property to pay the  assessment

due  before  his appeal can be dealt with  by  the

High Court. This provision existed in the Municipal

Ordinance  but was inadvertently omitted  from  the

Local  Government Ordinance and,  because  of  this

omission,  the  City  Council  has  reported   that

millions  of  dollars  are  being  tied   up   with

consequential loss of interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, there are two important

amendments in this Bill before the House. One is to

take   strong   and   firm   action - merciless   and

unequivocal action - against the building  racketeers

who have built houses in the past and who are still

building  houses.  These are the  persons  who  are

mainly  responsible  for such  disasters  like  the

Lorong 3 fire and the Kampong Tiong Bahru fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is to bring the process of

appeal  to  the High Court in assessment  cases  in

line  with appeals to the High Court on income  tax

cases.  A person who is aggrieved in his assessment

should pay, first of all, the assessment before  he

can lodge his appeal to the High Court, because  we

have  found from our fifteen months' experience  in

the  City  Council  that it is  cheaper  for  every

property  owner  to  lodge an appeal  to  the  High

Court, whether he or she is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



aggrieved  or  not aggrieved. Thus  the  amount  of

money he can earn from interest rates is much  more

than he would have to pay to his lawyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have no objection

to  the  policy of this Bill, if it is used  mainly

against  racketeers.  But,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we

should   consider  the  views  of  the  population,

especially in the rural areas where about 6,000  to

7,000  houses have been erected and which could  be

classified, according to this Bill, as  illegal.  I

would  advise the Government to follow the practice

of  the  City  Council and the previous  Government

whereby  owners whose houses are a year old  should

not  be touched but should be given the opportunity

to  get numbers for their houses so that they could

be properly assessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to implement this new law, the Government should look at it from the financial

point of view as well, as has been explained by the

Minister  for Finance. From that point of  view,  I

think  the Government itself could not erect houses

for   the  benefit  of  the  whole  population   of

Singapore  when we see that annually no  less  than

40,000   children   are  born.  This   means   that

Government  will have to build no less  than  8,000

houses annually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are my views for the Government to

consider. I repeat once again that I agree with the

policy  of  this  Bill if its main  purpose  is  to

combat  those  racketeers  who  erect  houses   for

exploitation.



<br><br>3.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in clause 3 (1), on page 1, lines 15 to 17 are

the  words "is about to be erected or is in  course

of  erection".  Again in clause 3 (2)  on  page  2,

lines 5 and 6 are the words "is being erected or is

about  to  be  erected". Then  in  the  Explanatory

Statement, it is stated:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...it is desirable that the local authorities

should   be  enabled  to  control  effectively   or

demolish speedily all unauthorised buildings...".



<br><br>If  this  word  "all" applies to  the  category  of

buildings  specified in the Bill, then  I  for  one

heartily support it because lawbreakers should  not

be  condoned. Unauthorised houses which do not meet

the  minimum requirements of the Government are  or

will  be  in future a menace to health and  safety.

But  if  this word "all" literally means "all"  and

includes those houses that have been built, let  us

say,  a  couple of years ago, then I would like  to

say  this. When the P.A.P. won the majority in  the

City  Council, they had the reputation of  being  a

Party  that  worked for the poor. I would  like  to

refer you again to the Explanatory Statement,  Sir,

which goes on to explain that this Bill is intended

"to prevent innocent people from being victimised".

Sir,  there  are  people already victimised.  As  I

said, when the P.A.P. won the majority in the  City

Council because of their reputation of helping  the

poor  and  working for the poor, there was  a  very

strong  rumour  that if the poor  people  tried  to

improve   themselves   by   building   houses   for

themselves,  the  P.A.P.  City  Council  would  not

prosecute them. I am not condoning the ignorance of

the  illiterate, but because they were ignorant and

because they were illiterate they depended on  this

rumour and many of them built houses for themselves

at that time. I am not referring to those that have

just  sprung up. At that time, there were many  who

built their houses because they were confident  and

had  faith that the P.A.P. was going to support the

poor  and  would  help them. What is  their  plight

today? If the word "all" literally means "all", and

those who have been victimised either by purchasing

these  houses  from unscrupulous  opportunists  or,

having  depended on those rumours and having  faith

in the P.A.P., have built those houses and lived in

them  for  a couple of years, and today  find  that

they will he thrown out in the streets if this Bill

is  passed - many of them with 8 or 10  children  and

many  of  them  with fathers and grand-fathers  and

what have you to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



a  family  of  16 to 20 - what will be their  plight?

They have been victimised by the opportunists.  Are

they  now  going  to suffer at  the  hands  of  the

Government?  If  the Government  lives  up  to  its

promise  to  prevent  innocent  people  from  being

victimised,  I  think  the word  "all"  should  not

include the category I have described.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara and also in the manifesto of the P.A.P. "The

Tasks Ahead", it is promised that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Government is pledged to make an all-out

effort to ease the housing problem,"



<br><br>and that



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"the Government will ensure that the welfare and

interest  of  the  rural  dwellers  are  adequately

looked after."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have decided not to raise any objection and not

to  make any amendment because I am very much aware

of  the  8  against  43, but I  do  appeal  to  the

Government,  based  on  their  pledges  and   their

assurances  to the illiterate and to  the  ignorant

who  had  unknowingly  placed  themselves  in  this

plight,  that  the  word "all" should  not  include

those who have already been victimised.



<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, referring to this Bill just now,  the

hon.  Member  opposite made certain comments  which

indicated her attitude towards it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about this Bill, I want to say a few

words.  The  previous Government, in  demonstrating

their  functions,  pretended to be  merciful.  They

thought that we are too radical. If we analyse  the

position  very carefully, I feel that the  previous

Government  was without plan or organisation.  They

left  us a lot of bitterness to face and to  solve.

They  should realise that the P.A.P. policy  is  to

bring  about a socialistic society. If we  want  to

produce  a  just  society for the people,  we  must

start  doing  so  from now. We must  not  make  our

younger generation face the conditions of living in

attap houses. We do not want our Government in  the

future to demolish these houses. I think this  Bill

is  correct, because you can realise at present and

also previously in Singapore there have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



been many unscrupulous contractors. They will seize

every  opportunity  to make a profit  out  of  this

business.  What  have we seen? We  have  seen  that

there  is  an increased number of persons who  have

been victimised by these racketeers. Since this  is

so,  then  we  will  see that there  will  be  more

drastic  and  stronger action against them,  if  we

really  want to improve the conditions of work  and

the livelihood of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple case can be taken. At present there is

no  Ordinance  whereby action can be taken  against

the  racketeers in this island. They  do  not  care

about  the dangers placed on a person who  want  to

rent a house from them. They also do not care how a

person  will  fare on a rainy day. He can  stay  in

this  house  for one or two months, but what  about

one  or  two years? Can the house stand for one  or

two  years?  The  dweller will thus  be  victimised

living  under such a roof. Therefore, I think  this

Bill  is  really  a  good Bill.  It  can  help  the

Government  to improve the present situation.  Such

is   the  situation  created  by  the  unscrupulous

racketeers who are engaged in this manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many people who think we are crude. I

have  received complaints from many people  because

their  houses  were demolished. But I would  rather

accept  their  complaints  today  than  see   their

generations  forever living in those illegal  attap

huts.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, not

only  does  this Bill seek to enact new  provisions

but  it also proposes to repeal the present section

170 of the Local Government Ordinance, 1957. It is,

Mr Speaker, by virtue of this section 170 that the

local  authority, wherever it may be  situate,  has

power   to   take   action   against   unauthorised

buildings,  be  they about to be commenced,  or  in

course of construction, or be they completed and in

occupation.  What this Bill seeks to  enact  is  to

take  away  completely  the present  provisions  of

section  170 and to enact in substitution  therefor

the  proposed  clause  170. It  seems  to  me,  Mr

Speaker - perhaps the Hon. the Minister for  National

Development will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



explain - that   under   the  proposed   new   clause

unauthorised  buildings  have  been  restricted  in

scope to those which are about to be erected or  in

the  course of erection. It seems to have left  out

of  the  category  of unauthorised erections  those

buildings  which  have been completed  and  are  in

occupation.   Whether  it  is  the   intention   of

Government to do this, it is not for me to say  but

for  the Minister himself. It would appear from his

Explanatory Statement that he hopes, by the  repeal

and by the re-enactment of the proposed clause 170,

to take in all unauthorised buildings. Mr Speaker,

may I with respect suggest to the Hon. the Minister

that  his proposed enactment does not achieve  that

purpose?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, there

seems  to  be  some  ambiguity  or  a  conflict  of

intentions  as indicated by the terms of  the  Bill

and the Explanatory Statement. I believe, Sir, that

we  on  this  side of the House are  in  favour  of

anything to prevent the exploitation of the poor by

the  building  of unauthorised houses  and  selling

them  to the victims. If that is to be made  clear,

Sir,  then  that  Explanatory  Statement  must   be

amended.  Otherwise it means that the intention  of

this  Bill is to demolish speedily all unauthorised

buildings including those already in existence.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member should know

that the Explanatory Statement is never part of the

Bill.  It  is  just  an explanatory  statement  and

cannot  form  part of the Bill when it  becomes  an

Ordinance.  Perhaps  the  Minister  for  Law   will

confirm this.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> I do so confirm it.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  yesterday  we saw  a  lot  of  democratic

forces.  Today, we see there are still some  people

who  fight  for the poor people. If we continue  to

search  their minds, we know they do  not  work  on

behalf  of  the poor people or speak for  the  poor

people.  We  know  before  that  there  were   many

unauthorised  contractors.  They  built  a  lot  of

unauthorised houses and within a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



week they sold all these houses to the poor people.

They  could earn a lot of money, and the poor  were

victimised.  We  know  the victims  were  the  poor

people.  Not only this, these houses are insanitary

and  are  dangerous because they catch fire easily.

These houses are unauthorised, insanitary, and very

bad for the poor people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are going to amend this Ordinance. The

intention is to protect the poor and not to protect

the   capitalists  or  the  racketeers.  Today  the

Opposition  speak again for the people, but  really

they  do not. The contractors, within a year, built

many  houses and paid only one assessment for  all.

How  could  they build so many houses? Because  the

officers   of  the  previous  Government  intrigued

together.  Now, in order to avoid future happenings

of  this  kind by the racketeers, we have  proposed

this  Bill.  Therefore, I agree with the Government

in proposing this Bill.



<br><br>4.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, what some Opposition

Members  said just now showed that at present  they

realised  that  the building of these  unauthorised

houses  had developed into a serious situation.  At

the  same  time,  we also know from their  speeches

that  the past Government had failed completely  in

solving  the  problems of housing for  the  people.

According  to a speech of the Opposition,  if  they

know  that  unauthorised houses are  illegal,  they

should  uphold  our  Bill. If  as  the  Member  for

Mountbatten has said they are for the poor  people,

then  when their Party was in power, why did  their

Government  not  propose  this  Bill  against   the

illegal contractors? Why should they wait until  we

are  in  the government and then say they  too  are

against the racketeers? From this, we can see  that

that is hypocrisy. When we were in the City Council-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There has been some difficulty about

the  interpretation, and it occurs to me that I  am

perhaps  a  little late. But the hon. Minister  was

accusing the Member for Mountbatten of being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



a hypocrite, or of hypocrisy. Now, if that is so, I

think  the Hon. Minister knows that that  word  has

been  over-ruled  in this House  and  he  ought  to

withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not hear the Hon. Minister through the

interpreter - I  did  not  hear  him  withdraw   the expression  that the, Member for Mountbatten  is  a

hypocrite.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): -shedding

crocodile tears, and not hypocrisy.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let us have the withdrawal of that

expression  first  and  then  we  can   deal   with

"crocodile tears".



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, just now I did

not  use the word "hypocrite". What I used was  the

phrase "shedding crocodile tears".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That expression is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

when  we  were  in the City Council we  faced  this

serious problem. We proposed to the Government that

we  wanted this power, that we could use this power

against  the illegal racketeers. But we failed.  At

that  time the attitude of the Government  was  for

these  racketeers and not against them.  They  were

not for the victimised people. We propose this Bill

in  order to deal with the racketeers and  to  stop

their  illegal building of houses and  development,

in  order to avoid something like the Lorong 3 fire

or  the  Kampong  Bahru fire, because  the  illegal

builders of houses use a kind of material which  is

liable  to catch fire, for example, attap, and  at

the  same time they build without plans of any kind

and the houses are not sanitary. The purpose of our

present Bill is against the illegal racketeers  and

not   against  the  poor  people.  Therefore,   Mr

Speaker, I uphold this proposal.



<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, this Bill is very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>



good  because,  since I am with  the  Minister  for

National  Development, I have experience  regarding

illegal  houses  in this island. I feel,  from  the

explanation  given  by  the ex-Minister  for  Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing,  that  there  are

thousands of illegal houses erected in Singapore. I

dare say that if those people were affected by this

Bill,  they  had been the victims of  the  previous

Government which had purposely kept quiet regarding

this  matter. Personally, I feel that the existence

of   these  illegal  houses  was  because  of  many

reasons.  First, it is because of the  weakness  of

the   previous  Government  in  controlling   their

officers   from  corruption  and  activities.   For

example, when a person asked for a licence to erect

a  house, there were officers who delayed this  for

months  and  for years. This not only  happened  in

Singapore but also in the Southern Islands  when  I

visited the islands a few weeks ago. This delay was

due  to the delay in giving corruption money to the

officers. If money was paid early, the permit would

come  out early. But those who could not afford  to

give  money and who did not want to give  money  to

those  said officers, were forced to erect  illegal

houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai said earlier that

there   were   thousands  of  illegal   houses   in

Singapore.  This means that the previous Government

knew   of  the  existence  of  illegal  houses   in

Singapore before. But they did not take any action,

because  there were certain people in the  previous

Government  who, because they had to protect  their

own  political interest, just kept quiet though the

offence was clear before their eyes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to say that if we do not take positive action in this matter, I feel

that there would be many more illegal houses, which

having  just  been  erected, they  would  say  were

erected a long time ago. For example, I was told by

my  friends who had observed the erection of  these

illegal  houses that they would get their materials

ready  at the places; they got ready the roofs  and

walls  and  everything, and when the sun set  about

ten  of  them would work to erect the houses  which

would be completed in a matter of a few hours,  and

that very night they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



moved  in  with their children. By tomorrow  a  new

house would be seen in that area. When the officers

came  to examine, they would say that these  houses

had been erected many years ago, and that they were

just doing the renovations to the houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to create a Singapore that is

peaceful,  happy  and just, we  may  be  forced  to

introduce  laws which in the beginning  would  seem

drastic. For example, take a small child who has  a

boil.  If the father were afraid to operate on  the

boil for fear of the child crying, then I feel  the

child would get worse. What he should do is to  cut

out  the  boil and allow the pus to come out.  When

the child got well, he would think how lucky he was

that his father had cut out the boil, for otherwise

he would have lost the hand.



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, regarding this

Bill concerning unauthorised houses in Singapore, a

number  of  Opposition Members have stated  clearly

that  they  are  not  opposing  this  Bill  in  its

entirety.  It seems to me that a number  of  people

who  have spoken from the Government side are still

bringing  up the old story of what had happened  in

the  past. I said yesterday that we are now  facing

the period in front of us. We should face this with

full realisation, a full sense of responsibility of

building  this  Singapore  and  to  bring  about  a

Government in Singapore that is strong and just. We

should   accept  views  that  are   meant   to   be

constructive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning houses that have already been erected,

this  is  a problem which is affected by  the  Bill

when it is enacted. For instance, we know that most

of  the houses which have been erected are most  of

them  huts or terrace houses with a number of rooms

which have no numbers and are rented out to various

families. We know the mistake. But this is a matter

that  has happened and it is a matter that we  must

face,  and if we take the action to demolish  these

houses,  it  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the

Government to place these people in areas which are

safe. So we hope that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



Government,  if they must take action,  the  action

will  be  just,  and without favour to  any  Party.

Wherever the houses are found to be erected the law

should  apply.  To  those  who  are  renting  these

houses,  they must be given an assurance that  they

would get proper treatment from the Government.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, it seems there

have  been  a  lot of misunderstanding or  possibly

distortions in the purpose of this Bill.  The  main

purpose of this Bill is to declare open war on the building racketeers. It has nothing to do with  the

houses  which have been built by farmers  or  other

persons who are in need of homes due to the  short-sighted and wrong policy of previous Governments in

not   building  enough  S.I.T. houses  for   their

accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 170 (1), as amended, says, clearly that

"Where the Minister is satisfied that a building is

about  to  be erected or is in course of erection".

That  is the main purpose of the Bill. Mr Speaker,

because  of  the ineptitude of past administrations

and  because perhaps of the recent events so-called

politicians  have  contacts  with  these   building

racketeers.  Past  Governments had  never  taken  a

stand  against these building racketeers,  although

the  erstwhile colleague of the Member for Tanglin,

Mr  Lim  Koon  Teck, had always repeated  in  this

Assembly  that  the Government should  take  strong

action against unauthorised structures. Because  of

the  ineptitude of past Governments, we have in the

past year a big fire in Kampong Tiong Bahru; a  big

fire  in  Lorong 3, Geylang; and in  the  past  two

months  another  big fire in Kampong  Tiong  Bahru.

Three weeks ago, another big fire nearly broke  out

near  the  Kallang Gasworks. On Sunday  last,  many

persons came to see me from Kampong Amber which the

Member  for Mountbatten represents. They were  very

afraid  because in the past few weeks six cases  of

fire  have  broken out. I am sure  the  Member  for

Mountbatten realises the position of the Government

if Kampong Amber is burnt out.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is not to take action

against  the  existing structures which  have  been

built  in  Kampong  Amber. It  is  to  take  action

against  new  unauthorised  structures.  The  Local

Government  Ordinance in itself will be  sufficient

to  deal  with those structures which have existed.

They  will  go with the normal process of  the  old

laws. As I have said just now, the purpose of  this

amendment of section 170 is to declare open war  on

the  building racketeers and we are very  confident

that  from now onwards, when this Bill becomes law,

no   more  such  racketeers  will  ever  exist   in

Singapore.  They  will have  to  close  down  their

business and perhaps, because of that, many persons

will  have  their incomes decreased. The  penalties

which  will  be  enforced  against  these  building

racketeers will be very substantial and very  high.

On  conviction they might have to pay  a  fine  not

exceeding $50 a day for every house they build.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if we have this Bill, or if the previous Government had got the courage to enact

such  a  Bill, today there would not be 300 to  500

houses in the course of being erected - some of  them

have been built in Geylang. They would have to  pay

$15,000  to $20,000 a day for the houses  they  are

building, and on top of that they might have to  go

to  prison for a minimum period of six months or  a

maximum period of 12 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we believe that fines are not sufficient for the building racketeers, who are in

general  being backed by secret societies. We  feel

that   the  most  important  weapon  against  these

building racketeers is to put them in jail  and  to

fix  a  minimum period during which they will  have

free  food  and rice and accommodation supplied  by

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if previous administrations had been more far-sighted or had worked harder or had

reduced  inefficiency and corruption,  thus  making

more  money for the purpose of building more S.I.T.

houses,  we would not have been saddled today  with

this problem



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



of dealing with unauthorised structures on the one

hand, and trying to build more houses on the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government understands that to stamp

out  these  building racketeers is not  enough,  so

long  as  a  market  exists for these  unauthorised

structures;  and  so  long as  there  are  innocent

victims, these racketeers could still flourish.  We

believe  that, on the more positive side, we  could

increase the building of S.I.T. houses which in the

past  10  years  has been at a very shamefully  low

figure.  The fundamental and lasting remedy against

unauthorised structures is to build more S.I.T. low-cost  houses.  The  previous  Governments  and  the

previous  S.I.T. had never tried to build  low-cost

housing and in great quantities because if they did

so,  the possibility of corruption would have  been

reduced. We are determined to remedy the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Mohamed Ali Bin Alwi (Member for Kampong Kembangan).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this motion, I would like to

refute the charges which were made yesterday by the

Opposition  benchers that we tend to be dictatorial

and  that, because we have 43 Members on  our  side

and the Opposition have only eight, we would be  in

a position to swallow the Members from the opposite

benches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal which I am putting forward shows

that the P.A.P. Government, can be generous and can

be  liberal.  According  to  Standing  Orders,  the

Committee  of  Selection  should  be  formed   from

Members  of  the Government and also to  include  a

Member  from the Opposition, so that, in proportion

really,  we  should  have  four  Members   on   the

Government bench and one from the Opposition  side.

But  I  would  like to say, in all earnestness  and

seriousness, Mr Speaker, that we do  not  wish  to

take advantage of the strong position which we  are

in.  We do believe that the essence of a democratic

government is that Bills and laws are moved in this

Legislature  and  that  not  only  Members  on  the

Government  side, but Members from the  Opposition

side,  have also a say in the passage of Bills  and

other motions. That being so, Mr Speaker, we  have

today  included in this motion that there be  three

Members  from the Government side and  two  Members

from   the  Opposition  side  who  will  form  this

Committee of Selection.

<div align="center"><b>STATE ADVOCATE-GENERAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Remuneration)</b></div>



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (7) of

section 30 of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in

Council,  1958,  resolves that the remuneration  of

the State Advocate-General shall be $2,075 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I should like to draw the attention of the House to section 30 (7) of the Singapore

(Constitution) Order in Council which provides:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The State Advocate-General shall be paid such

remuneration  and allowances as may  from  time  to

time  be  determined  by  the  Assembly,  and  such

remuneration and allowances shall be charged on and

paid out of the Consolidated Fund."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of the House know, the State Advocate-General has very wide powers conferred on him by

the  Singapore (Constitution) Order in  Council  in

relation to the institution, conduct and control of

criminal proceedings and, in the exercise of  these

powers,  the State Advocate-General is not  subject

to the direction or control of any other person. In

addition,  he  is  the  Government's  chief   legal

adviser and is in charge of all proceedings brought

against the Government or by the Government against

the  subject.  The conduct of civil proceedings  in

which  the Government is involved or interested  is

undertaken  by him and the law officers  under  him

and  his  Department are also responsible  for  the

preparation  and vetting of legislation,  including

subsidiary legislation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, he has been appointed Permanent

Secretary  for all departments dealing  with  legal

matters  and  in  this  capacity  he  assists   the

Minister  for  Law in all matters relating  to  the

legal  departments, the Courts, the  Department  of

the  Official  Assignee  and  Public  Trustee,  the

Registry   of  Trade  Marks,  Business  Names   and

Companies,  the  Registry  of  Marriages  and   the

Registry of Muslim Marriages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of the present Government that the

State Advocate-General should be given a status and

a  remuneration above that of the Puisne Judges but

below  that  of the Chief Justice. It is  therefore

proposed  that his remuneration should be $2,075  a

month, which is the same as the basic salary of the

former  Attorney-General. For  the  information  of

Members,   I   would  like  to   state   that   the

remuneration  of a Puisne Judge is $1,950  a  month

while that of the Chief Justice is $2,375 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in this matter, Mr Speaker - although I have

had  very hard things to say in other places  about

the colonial regime and colonial precedents - in this

post  I  think I am nevertheless happy to recommend

to  the  House that it should adopt a good colonial

precedent in this case and that precedent  is  that

the  person  occupying the position  of  the  State

Advocate-General  should  be  placed  on  the  same

footing  as the colonial officers who occupied  the

august  position  of Attorney-General  under  other

regimes,  and  I do recommend that the remuneration

of our State Advocate-General should be on a par.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour and Law (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> I second the

motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

when  the  sum involved is $2,075, I do not  wonder

why  the Minister for Law says that that is a  good

colonial  precedent which should  be  followed.  Be

that  as  it  may, I have no quarrel with  the  sum

involved, but the Hon. the Minister for Law did say

that  this salary is fixed in relation to the  very

high  office  that this person holds by  being  the

State Advocate-General. It is one of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



most  important positions in our State.  He  is  in

charge  and  in control of all criminal proceedings

and it is part and parcel of his office that in the

initiation,  prosecution  and  conduct   of   these

proceedings  he is completely impartial  and  never

looks  behind his shoulder. I have no doubt  in  my

own  mind  that the present occupant of  this  post

will  do his duty in a manner that this high office

merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

to bring to the attention of the House, and if I do

not do so, I think I will be failing in my duty.  I

regret  that  Government should have considered  it

necessary to appoint this person to this post  only

to  the end of next year. They may have reasons for

doing it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. As far as I can see, the

motion merely asks the Assembly to resolve that the

remuneration of the State Advocate-General, whoever

he  may  be,  shall be $2,075 a month. So  I  would

suggest  that any comment or any debate on who  has

been  appointed and for what period  is  perhaps  a

little far away from the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I felt that as the

post was a temporary one, perhaps the salary was  a

little higher than normal.



<br><br>4.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, I myself feel that

$2,075 a month for a highly qualified legal man  is

not much. I am sure there are many professional men

who  have  not  seen fit to dedicate themselves  to

public  service  and whose integrity,  intelligence

and  professional capacity are very much lower than

those  of  certain holders of high offices  in  the

State.  But  we  have  considered  it  fit  in  the

interest  of the nation that they should man  those

posts and accept much lower scales of pay than they

would get if they were to go out on their own. I am

sure, Mr Speaker, that the Member for Farrer  Park

gets more in his own legal practice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I am a good lawyer!



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I would like to correct the impression

which was given by the hon. Member for Farrer Park

that  this appointment is to be temporary. I  would

refer  him  to section 30, subsection  (4)  of  the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, where it

is provided that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The State Advocate-General may be appointed for

a  specified  period and, if he was  so  appointed,

shall, subject to the provisions of subsection  (6)

of   this   section,  vacate  his  office  (without

prejudice to his eligibility for re-appointment) at

the  expiration  of that period,  but,  subject  as

aforesaid,  shall otherwise hold  office  until  he

attains the age of fifty-five years."



<br><br>In  this  case  it  was  thought  proper  that  the

appointment should, in the first instance, be  made

for  eighteen months, with a view to a confirmation

of  the  appointment  at  the  expiration  of  that

period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make it very clear to

Members that it is not intended than this is to  be

a  purely  temporary appointment, but there  is  an

implied promise that if the officer discharges  his

duties to the satisfaction of the Government,  that

appointment  will  be confirmed and  he  will  then

continue  to hold his office, in the words  of  the

Order in Council, until he attains the age of fifty-five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (7) of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

Singapore,  express  our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered on

behalf  of  the  Government at the opening  of  the

present session of this Assembly."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not usual to begin when the curtain

rises  with an epilogue, but I would like to  quote

the  conclusion  to  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech  delivered  at  the  last  sitting  of  this

Assembly. In this, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was the last of the British Governors of

Singapore.  It is not as Governor and Commander-in-Chief that I deliver this address on behalf of  the

first   elected   Government  of  the   people   of

Singapore."



<br><br>Sir, precisely in those few sentences the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has very neatly summed up the change

of conditions - the change from 1955 to 1959. In 1955

the  People's  Action Party contested  the  General

Elections. But it was never our intention  at  that

time that we should be returned with a majority  to

form a government under the Rendel Constitution. We

knew  precisely  what  were the  pitfalls  and  the

handicaps in the Rendel Constitution. In  the  last

government,  the  Chief  Secretary,  the  Financial

Secretary, the Attorney-General and above  all  the

Governor,    were   colonial   officials.    Power,

therefore,  lay  in  the hands  of  these  colonial

officials,  and not so much in the hands  of  those

who became Ministers under the Rendel Constitution,

although  some  pretence was made  that  the  Chief

Minister  and  his  colleagues held  the  reins  of

power. We realised their disabilities of forming  a

government  under these conditions and,  therefore,

we put only four candidates in the 1955 Elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959 conditions have now changed. The P.A.P.

has  led  the people of Singapore to obtain  a  new

Constitution which provides for complete control of

internal  self-government in Singapore. It  is  now

time  for us to change our policy, for us  to  take

hold  of the reins of government and use our powers

wisely  to advance the cause and our objects  which

were  stated in our Party manifesto. So it was that

two  months  ago, on 30th May, the People's  Action

Party was returned by the people of Singapore  with

an   overwhelming  majority,  which  a   well-known

churchman  said, "was an earthquake  to  shake  our

conscience".  But  it would be foolish  for  us  to

believe  that  with the change of the Constitution,

we  shall also adopt the ritual and the regalia  of

the past without modifying them. Just as an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



English  daffodil  cannot thrive  in  our  tropical

climate, it will be foolish for us to believe  that

the   pomp  and  circumstances  of  British   State

functions,   the  undiluted  forms  of  uninhibited

liberalism  of the West, of Hyde Park  corner,  can

flourish  in  our  political  environment   without

undergoing certain modifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We subscribe to parliamentary democratic rule.

But it does not necessarily mean that, in doing so,

we  shall  adopt the forms which are known  in  the

West.  With  the pending retirement of the  present

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, so also will  there  be  a

change  in  our symbols. The flag of Singapore  and

the crest of Singapore today have still a trace  of

colonialism.  When  our own Malayan-born  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara assumes authority in a few  months'

time, we shall have a new flag for the new State of

Singapore,  and also a new National  Anthem.  These

symbols  are  important, psychologically,  in  that

they  draw  the  loyalty of the population  towards

certain beliefs, towards the country. But it is not

enough that we should reside or dwell in the  light

of  these symbols. We must come down to the reality

that  the success of the future of the country must

be  dependent  upon  action, upon  our  own  honest

labours,  upon  hard  work,  for  no  country   can

flourish merely on symbols alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Colonial Government had stood

aloof  from the people they ruled. But the People's

Action  Party has during the past five  years  been

close  to  the masses. They have grown out  of  the

roots,  and now that we are in Government, it  will

be our intention that we who come out of the masses

shall go back to the masses. It is in keeping  with

this belief of ours that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

last  month  shed his uniform, his Colonial  plumes

and  regalia with which a Colonial Governor usually

adorns himself. The change of attire of the Yang di-Pertuan   Negara  also  signifies  the  change   in

attitude of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Action Party has a positive

ideology.  We believe that our ills, the  ills  of

our society, can only besolved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



on the basis of a socialist ideology, and it

is because we have a political belief, we therefore

have  a principle, and having a principle, we  have

the  ability to lay down a line of action by  which

we  hope  to advance our cause and the progress  of

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, during the last two months, during the

election  campaigning, produced  policy  statements

all  of  which have been embodied in two  pamphlets

called  "The Tasks Ahead". These tasks outline  the

plans  which  we hope to execute in the  next  five

years  when  we are in power. The tasks ahead  have

included the problems of women, education,  labour,

trade   unions   and   social  security,   economic

policies,   housing,  rural  development,   health,

reorganisation of Government administrative organs,

including   absorption   of   the   City    Council

departments into Government Ministries, and  nation

building.  These tasks ahead have formed the  basis

for  the  speech  which the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

delivered at the opening session of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic general problems which we

face. First is one of nation building. Second,  the

conversion  of  our existing economy  from  a  non-productive one to a productive one. With regard  to

nation  building, we realise that that  is  a  task

which is not possible to be solved within the short

space of two years or five years. We know that  the

task  must necessarily be a continuous one, but  it

is  our  intention and our object that  within  ten

years  the  basis will have firmly  been  laid  for

nation  building. We are all aware that our society

is  complicated by the fact that there are  present

different races and different cultures. Because  of

different cultures we are also handicapped  by  the

presence  of  a multitude of tongues.  Nonetheless,

our  faith  is that despite this diversity  in  the

constitution  of  our  society  we  can  weld   the

different  elements together into one  nation.  And

today  this  session of the Assembly is  historical

because,  for  the  first time in  the  history  of

Legislative  Assemblies, not only in Singapore  but

also in Malaya, we have four tongues spoken. We are

proud  that  multilingualism  has  come  into  this

Assembly, and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



will  stay.  In this way we have opened  Government

not  to  a  privileged few, not to those  who  were

educated only in the language of a Colonial  master

but we have opened Government to the masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard yesterday and today speeches made in

Chinese,  Malay and English, and it is  our  desire

that multi-lingualism will make its effect felt  in

this  Assembly  not because of the  fact  that  one

language  is different from the other and therefore

it is a novelty to listen to another language which

is  different from what we have been used  to,  but

because  by allowing our Members in this  House  to

use  the tongue they are accustomed to we also feel

the reactions and the emotions from the ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy has during the past hundred years

been  based almost entirely on an entrepot economy.

Our population has outgrown the ability of such  an

economy  to  support us. It is therefore  of  great

importance   that   we   should   take   steps   to

industralise our economy, and make it a  productive

one, in  this way we hope that some  of  the  ills

which we see in our society will be solved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said just now, Sir, that the P.A.P. is a

socialist Party, and therefore, we have a socialist

programme.  We  must,  however,  recognise  certain

facts and conditions which are imposed upon us.  We

recognise  that our little island of Singapore  has

no natural resources, and that our entrepot economy

has  remained  static, that there  is  pressure  of

population on the island and that we also have  the

complexity  of  a  multi-racial  society  and   the

special  problems which they pose. The  conditions,

therefore,   to  realise  a  completely   socialist

society are not present. But nonetheless, it is our

intention to do our utmost within these five  years

so  that  at  the end of this period we  will  have

firmly  laid  the  basis  for  a  future  socialist

society,  and it is also our intention that  during

these  five years, what is more important  is  that

existing  feudalistic  and  conservative  attitudes

must be changed to a progressive socialist outlook.

Socialism  is  not  just merely  a  change  in  the

ownership  of property. For us who are  faced  with

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



task  of  forming a nation, socialism also includes

the fostering of an attitude and an outlook towards

a Malayan nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the details of the Yang-di-Pertuan Negara's

speech,  I  will  not  deal with  them  because  my

colleagues  will capably dispose  of  them  in  the

course of this debate. However, I would like to say

this:   that  in  1955,  the  Labour  Front   which

contested   the  general  elections  never   really

planned  to  win  the elections. Neither  did  they

expect to win the elections. It must have been  the

greatest  surprise of the lives  of  those  in  the

Labour Front when they found that they were in  the

majority,  and having never calculated  or  planned

what to do if they should form the Government,  the

Labour  Front  were faced with the  situation  that

they had to scrape together their members from here

and  there to form a body which they could  call  a

Government. The Labour Front had a vague  political

ideology.  But the ideology was never  strong,  and

therefore the principles were never strong.  Having

no  principles they had no plans of what they would

do  when  they  formed the Government.  The  Labour

Front  Government was like a ship  sailing  in  the

Pacific Ocean, without a compass and without a pair

of oars. They are like those who first ventured out

into  the  Straits of Johore at Changi in a  little

rowing  boat  in the hope of having a gay  time  in

their  lives,  and it must have been  the  greatest

surprise  to  them  when they found  the  boat  had

drifted  into  the Pacific Ocean. But  the  Pacific

Ocean is not that pacific. It is notorious for  its

typhoons!  Poor  devils!  They  had  never   really

understood the currents of our political life,  and

it  was  therefore not unexpected that  the  Labour

Front Coalition Government, and latterly the S.P.A.

Coalition  Government, capsized in the stormy  seas

of Singapore politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.A. Coalition Government lost the general

elections  not  simply because the P.A.P. captured

the City Council. The people of Singapore were wise

during  the last four years, that those  whom  they

voted  into  power  should honour  their  word  and

should  execute  what  they  had  promised  to  the

electorate.  The last Government forgot  what  they

said  in  1955.  Their word was not  honoured.  The

lesson for those who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



believe  in democracy is that a Government  can  be

changed by the electorate if it fails to fulfil the

wishes  of  the  electorate.  That  is  the   basic

principle of democracy, and that is the reason  why

today we have Members in this House changing seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the P.A.P. have calculated the odds. We

know  the  heavy responsibilities we will face.  We

are  aware  of the pitfalls and whirlpools  of  the

political  scene.  We  have  therefore  faced   the

electorate  prepared. Our compass  is  a  five-year

plan  to  which we have given considerable thought.

It  will be our intention that at the end of  these

five  years we shall fulfil and we hope even  over-fulfil a five-year plan in certain sectors.

The  people know this. This is why we have a P.A.P.

Government  today. During the next  five  years  we

will  give  further proof that we are a  consistent

Party.  What  we promised before the elections,  we

will  make sincere efforts to carry out during  the

next  five years. I should like to call the special

attention of this House to that part of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's speech which deals with  national

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yang di-Pertuan Negara has promised that the

Government   will  ensure  that  the  welfare   and

interests  of  the  rural dwellers  are  adequately

looked after. There are three reasons for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A large proportion of our population live in

the  rural  areas and the P.A.P. is  interested  in

serving  all the people, not merely one section  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Our farmers and fishermen in the rural areas

have  been exploited by middlemen in the past. They

are still being exploited. Our farmers today depend

on the credit of middlemen to provide them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



with  imported fertilisers and feeding  stuffs.  In

return  for this credit they pay higher prices  and

receive  reduced prices for the products  of  their

industry.  This  situation  must  end.  The  P.A.P.

Government   has  plans  to  organise  and   assist

farmers, producers' co-operatives and marketing co-operatives. This will help to break the grip of the

middlemen  on our farming community. It  will  also

ensure  a  fair  return for  the  products  of  our

farmers.  We shall have fishermen's producers'  co-operatives  and fish marketing co-operatives  in  a

similar  way,  Sir, for the same  purpose.  If  our

fishermen  and market gardeners can  be  helped  to

increase  their  production by modern  methods,  it

will  do  three things. It will increase their  own

earning  power; it will also strengthen the economy

of  Singapore;  finally,  it  will  mean  more  and

cheaper poultry, eggs, pigs, and vegetables for our

people and also a much greater surplus for export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government has another purpose in

view.  This is steadily to remove the disparity  in

the  amenities  of  life between  urban  and  rural

areas. This means that we must and will take  steps

to do the following things:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to bring electricity to the rural areas and

provide water-pipes for the rural people:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) encourage rural people to build kampong roads

and   assist  in  carrying  out  kampong   drainage

schemes.  The  building materials in all  instances

will be provided by the Government;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) provide the rural areas with good roads, new

link roads, bus services and also bus shelters;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) more and more community centres of modest

size but adequately equipped for the rural areas;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) provide two district hospitals which will

cater largely for those living in outlying areas;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) provide more infant and ante-natal clinics

for the women and children in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, and more besides, the P.A.P. Government

will undertake within the next five years to

improve the standard of living and the social

facilities of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



rural   population.  But  these  plans  cannot   be

fulfilled overnight. This House must remember  that

the P.A.P. Government is working on the basis of  a

five-year plan, not a six-month plan or a  one-year

plan. But of one thing we can speak with assurance,

Sir.    Given   the   necessary   time,    planning

organisation,  co-operation and hard  work  of  all

those  concerned, we can and will fulfil our  five-year plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on this House, Mr Speaker, Sir, to

express  its  unqualified thanks to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara for his constructive and  inspiring

speech on behalf of the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, we express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara for his speech at the beginning  of

the  session. In his speech, we clearly  understand

that our Government is to build an independent non-Communist  Malaya.  This is our  purpose.  For  our

bright   future   in   this   difficult   and   dim

environment, we struggled very hard with the people

of  Singapore for this purpose. As a result, on the

30th  of  May, the people of Singapore by  peaceful

means freed themselves from Colonial rule. Together

with  the  people  of  Singapore,  we  formed   the

Government.  This is the Government of the  various

peoples. We have to work to implement our plans. We

know  that  what  we do will be  to  care  for  the

welfare  of  all the people and be responsible  for

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have just said that we want to bring about a

society  where there is no exploitation. Therefore,

our  Government must look closely after  those  who

have  been exploited and forgotten by the  previous

Government, such as the fishermen and labourers. Of

course,  we must also look after the interests  and

benefit   of   other  people.  These  farmers   and

fishermen  and labourers do not get a  fair  return

for  their  labour.  In the  case  of  housing  and

health,  they  do  not  receive  regard  from   the

Government. Regarding the supplying of electricity,

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



cleaning  of the drains, the fitting of  the water-pipes  and the building of the bridges, it will  be

up  to the present Government to do it. We must try

our  best  to  bring  all this  about  under  these

economic  conditions. We sincerely hope that  those

hardworking  and  good people will  give  us  their

closest co-operation and trust. Only with this  can

we fulfil our tasks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding those who are against giving benefit to

the  people we will persuade them to believe in us.

At  the same time, we hope that those who worry for

nothing will realise the aim of the Government  and

participate in our work. They will work harder  and

co-operate with us to help our new nation.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, as one

directly connected with trade unions and the day-

to-day  problems of workers, I wish to make  a  few

remarks on one aspect of the Government's policy as

contained in the speech delivered by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  namely,  that  which  relates  to

workers and their organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's guiding principle in industrial

relations, as has been stated, is industrial  peace

with justice. Industrial peace, of course, does not

mean the same as what our predecessors certained it

to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past era, Government merely interpreted

industrial  peace  to  be  "law  and  order",   and

therefore every effort was made to check and  crush

the  workers'  agitations for  improved  wages  and

conditions of work. Obviously, there was no justice

done,  because  the  Government, being  excessively

keen  and enthusiastic to maintain law and order - if

need  be  by thuggish means - had for the convenience

of  rich  employers, quite comfortably  ignored  to

revise certain laws which were not in the interests

or in favour of the workers. This ultimately led to

warfare  on  the industrial front. The unions  that

were  strong  and  well-organised, with  sufficient

funds to maintain a prolonged struggle, received to

some extent what they wanted; but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



the  unions  with  poor  organisations  became  the

underdogs  and were left at the mercy of  merciless

and  ruthless  employers. No  effort  was  made  to

strengthen  the trade union movement on  the  whole

and  the individual unions which, although they had

legitimate  demands, were unsuccessful  because  of

weak  and  poor  organisations. The Government  was

indifferent   to   the  principle   of   collective

bargaining  and,  on the contrary, fostered  yellow

and  splinter  unions  which further  weakened  the

workers' movement. Today, Mr Speaker, Sir, what do

we have? There are 218 trade unions of workers many

of  which  are empty ghost unions. It is  not  very

necessary to state how ridiculous the situation is.

In  an  island  of about 1� million people,  with

about  32  per  cent of the population economically

active,  we  have 218 employee trade unions.  There

are  two  unions - if not more - claiming to  represent

workers  of one industry in quite a few cases,  and

if  we  examine their membership records, we  shall

find  one with less than ten members and the  other

with  more than 5,000 members. It was not that  the

Government was unaware of splinter unions,  as  has

been  proved  in  the  past. For  example,  in  the

Harbour  Board there are about five unions  with  a

total  membership of about 500 and one large  union

with  more  than  7,000  members.  Yet  the  former

Government refused to take the necessary action  to

make this large union the only voice of the Harbour

Board   workers.  Besides  this  type,  there   are

numerous small unions managed by thugs and hoodlums

which  had  been set up by employers with  specific

functions to break militant unions. At the  moment,

out of the 218 unions, about 100 have less than 250

members each. About 85 unions have between 250  and

1,000 members. In other words, about 185 unions out

of  a total of 218 have each a membership of 1,000.

Today,  the  workers are fed up with this  sort  of

affairs  and in the trade union field,  the  trends

are  for  a unified trade union movement. Unity  is

the  call among the workers, as it was in the past,

but this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



time  the  difference is that we have a  Government

which is not impotent or sterile but determined  to

carry  out the declared policy with the purpose  of

strengthening  the trade unions  and  unifying  the

working  class movement in order to ensure  a  more

active, a more widespread and, on the whole, a more

militant participation of workers' organisations in

the  struggle to establish a fair and just  society

in which man will not exploit man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fully aware of the need to

establish  and maintain industrial peace  but  this

will certainly not be like the wild cry of the past

for  "law and order". Industrial peace can only  be

maintained if there is justice for the workers, and

the  most  practical  way in  which  there  can  be

lasting  industrial peace is to have an independent

Court  of Labour which will not be deterred by  the

pomp and the power of money of the employers, whose

findings  and  recommendations will be  binding  on

both  the unions and the employers, and which  will

have the force of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has stated clearly that it will

cancel  the  registration of  yellow  and  splinter

unions. There may be some across the Floor who  may

become  vociferous about democratic  liberties  and

freedom  of association and the rest of  it.  Those

crushed  on  the  30th  of  May  by  the  will  and

determination of the working class will attempt  to

champion  the cause of anti-unionists  and  hoodlum

leaders of these unions who do not even represent a

sizeable  proportion  of  the  workers.  Let  these

people  not  forget that the P.A.P. won a  decisive

victory at the elections and more than 50 per  cent

of   the   electorate  voted  in  favour  of   this

Government. The electorate were fully aware of  our

policies   and  they  supported  us  because   they

supported our policies. And let there be  no  doubt

that the P.A.P. will fulfil its obligations to  the

people  by  enforcing  its  declared  policies.  To

pretend  and  fake as heroes of the  working  class

will result in greater demoralisation than 30th May

in time to come.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is not a point on

which  I  can assist. It is up to the Deputy  Prime

Minister  who is also the Leader of the  House  and

perhaps the Government Whip, if they choose to,  to

whip  up their Members. It is not a matter in which

I can assist.



<br><br>6.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

speak  on the Government policy as outlined by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, may  I  first  take  this

opportunity  to congratulate the P.A.P. for  their

success?  This  may seem strange and unorthodox  to

some  but it is my belief that as this House  is  a

unit  comprising the Government and its Opposition,

I see no reason whatsoever why the two sides cannot

or  should not start, function and end amicably and

constructively for the good of the  State  and  its

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much time was spent yesterday and today digging

up  history, digging up mud to sling at one another

and  much time was wasted by one Party accusing and

the  other Party defending itself. That time  could

be  more profitably spent if we could spend  it  on

constructively planning for the State and  for  the

paramount interest of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that 54 per cent of the electorate in

Singapore have voted for P.A.P. - four per cent  more

than  half  the  electorate.  This  majority,   the

Government  spared no pains to drive  home  to  the

Members of the Opposition. But I feel that we are a

bit confused over this matter. We are aware that we

are 8 against 43. We are aware that the people have

chosen the P.A.P. We are aware that the P.A.P. has

published  "The  Tasks Ahead", and the  people  who

have  voted P.A.P. have accepted on principle their

manifesto. But it must also be remembered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



that  of those who voted for P.A.P., many have  not

read "The Tasks Ahead". Assuming that everyone  has

read  and has digested it, "The Tasks Ahead"  still

does  not give in detail the methods by which these

principles in the programme are to be carried  out.

So,  in  spite  of  the fact that the  people,  the

majority  of the electorate, have voted P.A.P.,  we

cannot  but  run  away  with  the  idea  that   the

programmes,  in  whatever  method  introduced,   no

matter  by  what  means they are carried  out,  are

acceptable   and  are  given  a  mandate   by   the

electorate. That is why we have to get together and

plan  constructively, as I said, for the  paramount

interest  of the State. Let us spend our  time  and

energy doing that. Evidently, the 54 per cent, when

they voted for the P.A.P., had hoped that when  the

P.A.P. formed the government, it would  voice  the

opinion of the electorate; it would promote  peace,

freedom and justice for the people; it would  bring

about work for the good and prosperity of the State

and its people, and improve the standard of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's determination to wipe out the

alleged  deficit of $14 million, and the policy  of

dropping the axe on those whom they think are  best

able   to  bear  it  is,  of  course,  commendable,

especially  when  they have considered  it  to  the

extent  of dropping the axe on those who  are  best

able  to  bear it so that it would not cause  undue

hardship  on  those  who cannot  bear  it.  But  to

implement those pay cuts, without even one  month's

notice,  certainly will cause severe hardship,  and

in  some  cases  maybe disaster and misery  in  the

family.  This can be avoided if only time is  given

to  the  poor  employee to balance  or  adjust  his

family budget.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the fact that these cuts have been

implemented  without negotiations with  the  unions

has  given  a  sense  of  insecurity  not  only  to

Government  employees, but  also  to  employees  at

large.  The  meeting that Government had  with  the

trade   union   leaders  can   hardly   be   termed

"negotiations", when, I believe, in  the  words  of

the  Finance Minister - I am not quoting exactly  but

the  gist  of it is that Government had decided  to

decide for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



people,  because the trade union leaders  were  not

able  to  make any decisions without referring  the

matter to their respective trade unions. After all,

is   not  this  the  essence  of  democratic  trade

unionism - to  bring  it back  to  the  trade  unions

before  the  leaders decide? Government has  always

been   regarded  as  a  model  employer,   and   if

Government  deals  with its  employees  in  such  a

highhanded   fashion   today,   what   right   will

Government  have  to prevent other employers  doing

the  same  tomorrow?  No wonder  the  employees  of

commercial   firms  are  sharing  this   sense   of

insecurity  with Government employees. The  Finance

Minister  calls for understanding of the people  by

the  civil servants. I am afraid, to achieve  this,

Government will have to show this understanding  to

its  civil  servants first. As a trade unionist,  I

had  the good fortune of working with many who  are

now  Ministers on the Government bench, and I  used

to  admire them for the untiring effort they put in

to  protect  the  right of trade unions  and  trade

unionism. It seems incredible to me now to  witness

the  position of the very trade unionists, who  had

been  protected,  standing up now to  defend  their

right  against  their own leaders who,  until  very

recently, had been their champions in the fight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's intention to wipe out the

deficit and to bridge the gap between the different

social strata is, of course, plausible. But it must

be  remembered  that the means by which  these  are

being  carried  out  are as important  as  the  end

itself.  It  does  not take an economic  expert  to

slash  the  salary  of  its  employees  to  meet  a

deficit. The true worth of an economic expert  will

be  fully appreciated when he meets the deficit  by

expanding trade and industry. If Singapore were  to

keep in step with the other countries in the world,

this  gap  will  have to be bridged by  pulling  up

those from the bottom to meet the top, and not pull

those  at  the top to the bottom. This  will  be  a

retrograde step which should be avoided. The people

of  Singapore in general and the trade unionists in

particular  look up to their trade union champions,

their economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



expert,  and their chosen leaders to improve  their

standard  of living and to protect their rights.  I

am  sure they are confident that the noble instinct

shown  by  these  leaders  in  the  past  will  yet

prevail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Community and Recreational Organisations, the

Government has decided to take over and to exercise

full control over these community organisations and

partial     control    over    the     recreational

organisations.  Throughout the  world,  the  stress

today  is  on  helping people to  help  themselves.

Volunteers,  it has been accepted universally,  are

the  best  yardsticks by which to measure community

acceptance  of  social services. The enthusiasm  of

the  citizen  volunteers,  as  board  members,   as

solicitors  in Community Fund Drives, or  volunteer

agency   workers,  determines  the   democracy   of

community  services.  A community  welfare  service

should  be  representative of the total  community.

There should be room for all in order to strengthen

community   understanding.  There  should   be   no

discrimination  against any group  on  any  grounds

whatsoever, be they social, cultural, religious  or

political. Yet Government has discriminated against

a certain group known as politicians. The excuse is

that  if politicians are allowed to take an  active

part in community activities, they will exploit the

community  centres  and  organisations.  This,   of

course,  should be stopped. I agree. But the  means

of  carrying this out are as important as the  end,

because  Government's method  of  implementing  the

idea  of  preventing  politicians  from  exploiting

community centres, is leading to Party politics  at

a  higher  level and on a bigger scale, because  no

one will be allowed to run or take part actively in

his  community  activity except the Government.  It

will   all  be  run  by  the  Government  and   the

Government happens to be the P.A.P. No citizen of a

democratic country should be deprived of his  civic

rights to serve his community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the world, efforts have been made to

encourage  civic  consciousness  and  interest   in

community welfare. At the Ninth Conference  of  the

International Council of Social Welfare held



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



in  Tokyo last November, it was unanimously  agreed

that social workers should approach their political

leaders  and  encourage them to take a more  active

interest  in the welfare of the community,  because

it was felt that they are the people who can render

valuable services to the community. I am sure it is

not  the  intention  of the Government  to  isolate

Singapore  from the rest of the world  by  ignoring

recommendations which have been unanimously arrived

at  by  them.  Moreover,  active  participation  in

community    centres   and   organisations    helps

tremendously to provide leadership training. If the

community  centres  and recreational  organisations

have  not  come  up  to  the  expectations  of  the

Government, it is up to the Government  to  provide

such  training  for  the  citizens,  because  these

citizens are not specially trained to carry out the

work;  and  the  way  to meet this  is  to  provide

training for the volunteers, rather than chuck them

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, it

is said that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"it now falls upon this Government to instil in

our people of all races the will to be a nation."



<br><br>Sir,   I   maintain  that  depriving  citizens   of

leadership training and of the right and freedom of

a  citizen to serve his community will not help  to

instil in them the will to be a nation.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we have just heard the

speech of the Deputy Prime Minister. In my opinion,

it  is  not  based on the speech of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.  What  he has  stated  are  purely

matters which concern the struggle of his own Party

and  they are not related to the Speech of the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I wish to clarify to this Assembly that this self-Government, a democracy through

elections,  which  we  have  just  been  given   in

Singapore,   and  which  we  have  experienced   in

Singapore   for   the  last  few   years,   is   an

administration and a condition that is newly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



brought about in Asia. On the other hand, it should

not be forgotten that this democracy is a system of

life  in Europe which the people have had for  more

than  a  thousand years, and which has reached  the

status that is now obtaining throughout the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to come back to the speech of

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. It seems to me that  in

this speech the aim of the Government is to abolish

the  interest of democracy, that is, to abolish the

City Council and the District Councils. That, in my

opinion,  is  not right because we have  only  just

received  power through democratic  means,  and  we

should  give  an  opportunity  to  the  people   of

Singapore  not only to vote, but also to carry  out

the powers of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara I notice a section where it has been

stated that the aim of the Government is to shape a

Malayan nation. Here I would like the Government to

say  how  it is to carry this out. Are we to  shape

the  new  nation based on the indigenous people  of

Singapore, that is the Malays, or is it to be based

on the Chinese people, or the Indian people who are

inhabitants staying in Singapore? I feel that if  I

were to forget my feelings as a Malay, it would  be

difficult. Likewise for the Chinese and the  Indian

people,  it would be difficult. So here  we  should

ask for clarification on the part of the Government

as to how it intends to implement his policy. Apart

from  that,  in  the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  it is stated that the stand of the  P.A.P.

Government  is  to  form a  society  that  is  non-Communist  but  socialist in nature.  But,  on  the

other  hand,  this  society is not  meant  for  the

people  of  Singapore,  but  is  called  a  Malayan

society.  In my opinion, this is hardly correct  at

all  because  when  we  use the  word  "Malaya"  it

includes  the  Federation  of  Malaya,  and  if  it

includes  the Federation of Malaya, it  means,  Mr

Speaker, that the Government wishes to take part in

the  internal affairs of the Federation of  Malaya.

On the other hand, if the Government wishes to form

a society that is non-Communist but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



socialist in Singapore, there will be no difficulty

because  it has the power to carry it out. But  the

Government  should not bring in the  Federation  of

Malaya,  because Malaya involves the Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>6.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): We know

our  Government since its formation one month  ago.

Thus  our  self-Government is one  month  old.  The

previous Government was a Colonial Government and a

bureaucratic Government. The responsibility now  is

to   change   the   former  Colonial   bureaucratic

practices.  We  must have plans and  procedures  to

enable  the  present  Government  and  the  present

employees  of  the Government to serve  the  people

well,  especially  the poor  people,  in  order  to

enable  them to approach the Government. For  this,

then  the Government employees will be working well

for the country and for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in order to carry it out well,

education  is  very important.  We  know  that  the

former  education policy was a Colonial and servile

one. If the people receive no education or Colonial

education then it is difficult for the formation of

the  country. We should not just educate  them  for

their profession or work. We should educate them so

that,  on  the one hand, they can serve the  people

and, on the other hand, they can work for their own

livelihood.   Formerly,  the  Colonial   Government

produced a privileged class. This privileged  class

was  the English-educated class. On the other hand,

they  neglected the interests of the other schools,

for example, the Chinese schools, Malay schools and

Tamil  schools, where talented people may be found.

Now  our education policy has given equal treatment

to all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, we will train people of all races who

have  talent  and ability, to make them  serve  the

country  well. On the one hand they can earn  their

livelihood and, on the other hand, they can produce

a  lot  of  goods for the country and increase  the

production  of  the country. They  will  be  useful

economically  to the country. The former  education

policy was to produce clerks and teachers. Now  our

present education policy is not of that type.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we have decided to make Malay the

national language of this country. That is  not  to

say  that we will neglect or overlook the languages

of  other races. The reason is that there  must  be

one  language for the whole nation, and it  can  be

understood  by all the people of the  country.  The

Malay  language is the most suitable one to be  the

national  language.  We  must  learn  our  national

language, and be loyal to Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly, the Colonial education policy produced

a  lot  of  teachers and clerks, and  because  this

education  policy contained a tinge of colonialism,

it therefore corrupted the thoughts of our youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present we have stopped a lot of yellow

newspapers and also obscene films. But some  people

who  published these types of papers and films said

that  the P.A.P. is destroying the freedom  of  the

Press.  Actually they themselves have utilised  the

freedom  of  the  Press to destroy the  freedom  of

others. Everyone wants to be good, but this  yellow

Press and yellow films purposely lead us to do  bad

things.   Is  it  not  to  destroy  other  people's

freedom?  No one has absolute freedom - otherwise  we

have the freedom to kill a person. The servile  and

colonial  education  policy was  quite  successful.

What I said just now proves that this education has

not failed completely. Why? Because it has produced

a   lot  of  people  worshipping  Western  material

progress and civilization.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we have heard that a lot of teachers and

Government officers went to see obscene films. Most

of   them  were  English-educated.  Therefore   the

English  Colonial education policy proved  that  it

has  not  failed completely. On the other hand,  it

produced  Rock and Roll dances for our youths.  Now

our  present Government has sacked those  teachers,

who  went  to  see  the obscene pictures.  Formerly

under  the Lim Yew Hock Government, I believe there

were  teachers  who also went to see those  obscene

films, and they were arrested by the Government but

their names were not published. Why? Because-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I heard an allegation

that  the Member for Cairnhill went to see  obscene

films. I may be wrong, but if I am right, that,  if

course, is completely improper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there an allegation that the Member for

Cairnhill  saw  obscene  films?  If  there  was  an

allegation  of  that nature, then, of  course,  the

allegation must be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No. (Just now I

was  giving  details about the former  Government.)

The  former Government was very corrupted. How were

they  corrupted? I give you one example. A  teacher

told  me  that he went to the Education Department,

and asked a clerk, "Why do you not work seriously?"

The  clerk replied, "Go and ask Mr Chew Swee Kee."

This   proves  that  because  the  Government   was

corrupted,  therefore  the  employees   were   also

corrupted.  If  the  Government serves  the  people

well, then the employees of the Government will  be

working  for the people. Our Government has  sacked

the  teachers  who saw obscene films.  This  proves

that our Government is different. Our Government is

a clean Government. We will work for the people and

we will take action against irresponsible people. I

believe  some  teachers play mahjong all  day,  and

gamble  and  see  obscene pictures.  I  hope  those

people  will pay some attention. If they  can  work

well  for the people I think their rice bowls  will

not   be  broken  and  they  will  not  blame   the

Government for breaking them. To promote a  healthy

culture,  the former Government will say these  are

subversive  activities.  But  our  Government   now

encourage healthy culture. I think our former Chief

Minister   will  say  that  we  are  "a  subversive

Government". We have to wipe out illiteracy  so  as

to enable all the people to read and write and also

to  spread  education  and raise  our  standard  of

education.  Now  these English-educated  privileged

classes no longer exist. Our Government is to  make

use  of  the  talented people  from  all  kinds  of

schools - Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil. If they

are useful and able, we want to make use of them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have to wipe out the former

bureaucrats - the  feudalistic,  corrupted,  Colonial

bacteria. By means of this, we can build  a  happy,

independent,   free,   and   democratic   socialist

country.



<br><br>7.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, today we the people of Singapore have

entered  into  a new society. From the  140  years'

rule  of  a  Colonial Government,  there  comes  an

internal self-government elected by one and a  half

million people. This is an aspect in the history of

human   society   struggling   for   freedom    and

emancipation.   Although  we  have   not   achieved

independence,   the  distance  from   independence,

however, is not very far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 140 years ago our predecessors, for the

sake   of  freedom  and  of  being  able  to   live

honourably  like  human beings,  had  put  in  much

effort and even sacrificed their own lives, and  as

a result of which, we acquired self-government. But

how  are  we  going to treasure this self-governing

seed  to make it bloom into flower and bear  fruit?

This is a heavy responsibility for the 1� million

people  of  Singapore. Everybody knows that  it  is

easy to eat fruit but it is difficult to plant  it.

This  is indeed our responsibility and we must  not

shrink from it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an old society we enter into a new society;

and  from a position of the ruled, we step  into  a

self-governing  position. In  the  course  of  this

historical  change, people are not ready  to  adapt

their lives and thought to the new environment  and

they  always feel somewhat troubled. Those who were

well-treated under the colonial rule, would  always

yearn for the past, hoping that it would linger on.

There  are  people  who  were  educated  under  the

colonial  servile education. These poor  people  at

one time did not know what to do. But thousands  of

people   who   were  oppressed  and  who   actually

participated  in  the struggle, hope  eagerly  that

they  can  immediately get rid of the 140 years  of

colonial  rule and fly freely. Even if  this  means

that  they have to fare some bitterness, they  will

accept it willingly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not altogether easy for us to

achieve  self-government. The immediate  and  heavy

task  in  front of us cannot be possibly  performed

overnight,  particularly as the previous Government

did  not basically look after the interests of  the

people  of  Singapore as a whole. They misused  and

wasted  public  money and left  a  deficit  of  $14

million  in our State budget for the new Government

to  balance. It is because of the interest  of  the

1�  million  people  and to  prevent  the  public

finance from going into a state of bankruptcy  that

we  have  no  alternative  but  to  take  immediate

corrective measures to economise. Unfortunately, as

the  result of the audit and study carried  out  by

the  Ministry  of Finance, our civil  servants  are

first  called  upon  to  bear this  responsibility,

because  the expenditure on the personal emoluments

of government employees occupies 50 per cent of the

total  national  revenue.  This  is  an  irrational

phenomenon. Some irresponsible people may say  that

if  there  is  a  deficit in public  finances,  the

government  has just to give an order  to  increase

taxation and the deficit will be wiped out.  It  is

not  necessary to reduce the salaries  of  a  small

section of the people. This is the most stupid  way

of  talking,  just like blind people talking  about

the  sky.  We  must realize that a  country  cannot

depend  on  increasing taxation  to  wipe  out  its

deficit, for it is a negative measure and,  at  the

same  time, it appears quite illogical. The  reason

is  very  simple: if we "drain the  pond  to  catch

fish",  we  will be finished in no time. Hereafter,

our government of 1� million people must not only

economise but must also positively open the sources

of  income  to  expand  and  develop  our  national

economy so as to improve the standard of living  of

our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every part of the world, there are good

citizens  who, for the sake of building  their  own

country,  have  sacrificed their own interests  for

the  good of the people. There is an old saying  in

Chinese, "Where skin no longer exists, feather  and

hair  would not survive too." The lesson from  this

saying  can  be easily grasped. It is  only  in  an

unevenly developed society where you can benefit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



a small section of the people at the expense of the

larger proportion of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the people of Singapore control and

manage  their public finance, they should  consider

every  cent  precious  to them.  If  we  allow  the

present  position of our administrative expenditure

to  continue without any check, we definitely  will

increase taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonial government left to us the problem of

unemployment. If we do not find ways and  means  to

solve  it,  then this problem of unemployment  will

become more and more serious and consequently  lead

to  social  unrest  and  the  increase  of  immoral

conduct. This condition will be further worsened by

the  problems of housing, medical services,  social

welfare  and the education of children.  All  these

require a great amount of money. Where can  we  get

all  this  money to finance our projects? How  many

Christmas Islands then can we sell? Even  if  there

are,  we  will definitely not sell the property  of

our  ancestors like a prodigal just to be  despised

by our coming generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From June 5th this year, the public servant and

the  government  are no longer in the  position  of

employee  and  employer. The  relationship  between

them as employee and employer must naturally follow

the Colonial government into oblivion. In its place

must  be substituted a new relationship of partners

who will fare together in happiness and bitterness.

We must quickly develop this attitude.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget our ancestors were the masters

of  this  country. Today we, (including  the  civil

servants) recover again the position of masters. We

are  members of the elected government. In this big

family of ours every member must be responsible for

the  economy of this family. We are closely related

to  one  another and we must be ready to  share  in

bitterness  and  in  happiness.  Our  1�  million

people  must  work hard together  to  build  a  new

Singapore.  They  are  no longer  working  for  the

Colonial   Government   and   thereby   earning   a

livelihood. It is time for them to discard the  old

attitude.  Although  it is an  honour  for  a  mean

servant once to become



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



master,  but it must be acknowledged that  with  an

empty treasury, a small section of the people  will

be  inevitably asked to make some minor sacrifices.

We  must bear in mind that in every corner  of  the

world,  there  is  hardly any  master  who  is  not

responsible   for  the  economy  of   the   family.

Therefore  we appeal to those people who  may  face

some minor sacrifices on their part. In view of the

development of this big family and the happiness of

the    coming   generation,   they   must    accept

wholeheartedly  the  Government's  pay-cut  measure

and,  at the same time, cultivate a sense of  self-respect  so that they will be able to shoulder  the

responsibility of nation-building in  the  capacity

of master.



<br><br>7.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff (Anson)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, and hon. Members, the birth of

the  State  of Singapore under its new Constitution

represents  a  change in the political  field,  but

this political change would have no meaning if  the

conditions which prevail in our society do not also

change.  If  things were to remain unchanged,  then

the struggle of the People's Action Party, which is

now  administering  the  Government  of  Singapore,

would  have  been  ineffective. The  changes  which

we - that  is  to  say,  my  Party,  the  P.A.P. - have

planned  cater for all sections of the  population.

And this has been made clear by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  in  the  First  Opening  Session  of   this

Assembly recently. What are those changes? I  think

they are known by all Members here: they cover  the

field  of  economics, finance, medical  facilities,

health,  national  development,  culture,  internal

affairs  and  others. These changes are  not  being

brought  about  for  the benefit  of  a  particular

section of the people, but they are for the benefit

of  all the people of this country, irrespective of

race,  religion, colour and ideologies. This  is  a

basic  issue which is being pursued by the People's

Action Party in a country which is multi-racial  in

character.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Government has made Malay the national

language  of  Singapore. This  proves  to  all  the

people of this island



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



that  this  Government respects the Malay language,

and  because of the fact that it is a language used

by  all  the  people,  its  role  as  the  national

language  will  further  strengthen  the  bonds  of

friendship  and  relationship  among  the   various

races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the question of the policy of the

P.A.P. to build a united Malayan nation from  among

the   citizens  of  Singapore,  I  was   just   now

embarrassed  to hear a Member in this House  making

speeches, which are most communal in character. The

Member for Geylang Serai said. "If I am a Malay,  I

will feel difficult to change my opinions to change

my own self. Likewise a Chinese." He mentioned also

that the P.A.P. is non-Communist but Socialist. And

he said that he was not opposed to this question of

a  socialist, non-Communist Singapore, but  he  did

not   agree   with  it  because  it  involved   the

Federation  of Malaya. I wish - unfortunately  he  is

not  here - to  tell  him  that  the  policy  of  the

People's Action Party is non-communal, irrespective

of  race, religion or colour of skin; that all  the

people   of  Singapore  are  as  one  people   who,

according to our long-term policies, will create  a

Malayan  nation,  the  aim of the  People's  Action

Party being to merge with the Federation of Malaya.

It  is  for  these  reasons that we  use  the  term

"Malayan",  and  if  the Member for  Geylang  Serai

refuses  to  be called a Malayan, it means  clearly

that  he  is  still doubtful - he  is  still  in  the

dark - whether one day Singapore will merge with  the

Federation of Malaya. But we of the People's Action

Party,  who  have,  set  out  in  the  belief  that

Singapore will merge with Malaya, will continue  to

pursue  our  aim,  although it may  take  years  to

achieve. Every member of the People's Action  Party

is  determined to work towards that aim.  Does  the

Member  for Geylang Serai know the meaning  of  the

term  "Malayan" and the aims of the People's Action

Party to create a Malayan society? The Ministry  of

Education  and the Ministry of Culture will  pursue

this  aim  of  creating  a Malayan  outlook  and  a

Malayan  consciousness. This is  what  we  have  in

mind:  that is, to inculcate this attitude  in  the

minds of the people of Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



so  that  they will have a Malayan outlook and  not

think in terms of other countries. Thus if a man is

a Chinese he should not turn to China; and if he is

a  Jew he should not turn to Israel, and so on. And

this  is  the  aim which we will pursue.  I  myself

cannot  understand whether the Member  for  Geylang

Serai  still wants the Malays to regard  themselves

as Malays, the Chinese to think in terms of Chinese

politics in China, the Indians to think in terms of

Indian  politics in India and the Jews to think  in

terms of Israeli politics in Israel. Therefore,  we

mention  specifically a Malayan socialist  society,

because  we  have  ultimately  to  merge  with  the

Federation. Singapore and the Federation of  Malaya

will be one and that is Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning culture - which is also contained in the

booklet  "Towards  a More Just Society"  which  was

read  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara - I, as a  Member

of  this  Assembly  who  is  also  serving  in  the

Ministry of Culture, wish to make it known  to  the

Member  for  Geylang  Serai that  the  Ministry  of

Culture  has taken definite steps to quickly  alter

or  remould certain attitudes of the people so that

they  will  all have a Malayan outlook and  not  be

influenced by decadent Western culture which  comes

in  the  form of rock and roll. The evil influences

of rock and roll dances have been too widespread to

be allowed in our society. Yellow films and Frenchy

films  of half-naked people must be wiped out.  And

if  there  are  stage  shows  which  perform  "Plum

Blossom"  acts, which were allowed by the  previous

Government,  then  we  must  put  a  stop  to  them

immediately. Artistes and troupes from Hongkong and

Europe   were  examined  by  the  former  Assistant

Minister  for  Labour  and Welfare.  If  they  were

beautiful,  they were given permits. This  resulted

in the struggle against yellow culture - which we aim

for - being channelled to undesirable ends. If it has

been so diverted, then it, will be difficult for us

to  redivert  it  although we will definitely  take

steps  to  rectify the wrongs and misdeeds  of  our

predecessors.  We  must have courage  to  do  this.

Although we are opposed by certain quarters, yet we

must  have  courage to carry out the demolition  of

houses,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



such  as those in the Geylang Serai area where  the

owners  let the houses to the people - the Malays - who

subsequently  had to go to Court and pay  fines  of

anything from $10 to $100. This is all the fault of

the  previous Government. But as has been said  by

the Member for Mountbatten, we should not throw mud

at  the  previous Government. We are  not  throwing

mud.   We   are  pointing  out  the  misdeeds   and

maladministration  of the previous  Government.  We

have  to say frankly what has taken place. What  we

are  doing  now is the result of what we have  been

bequeathed with by the previous Government. And  as

stated  by the Deputy Prime Minister, some of  them

are   even  more  colonial  than  the  colonialists

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to culture. If I am not mistaken,

there  was  previously a cultural organisation,  an

arts  or  cultural body, to appeal  to  the  former

Government, in regard to "yellow" films,  rock  and

roll,  which are detrimental to the moral being  of

our youth and which should be abolished. But not  a

single  step was taken and, thus, here  is  another

proof  that  the previous Government was negligent.

To  be more accurate, the Ministers themselves were

fond of such like dances, films, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member

alleged   that  certain  Ministers  of   the   past

Government  were guilty of viewing improper  films.

Now  he  must remember that there are Ministers  of

the  previous Government as Members of  the  House.

Therefore,  he  must not make allegations  of  that

nature.  If  there has been an allegation  of  that

nature, he must withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): If it was not true,

I withdraw it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not want any qualified

withdrawal. I would like a complete withdrawal.



<br><br><!-- Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Baharuddin Bin Mohamed Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I withdraw it. Our

Government  can  fittingly be called  the  People's

Government, as it is known that more than  half  of

the people of Singapore voted for the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficiency of the Ministry of Culture and

Members  of  the Cabinet is seen in the  fact  that

these  weaknesses  have been  overcome,  little  by

little;  and  there  have  been  changes  in  radio

programmes, the film censorship, and in the work of

every  single Ministry. But these will take a  long

time to complete because, as it is said. "Rome  was

not  built  in  a day." Therefore, every  time  the

Prime  Minister speaks, he asks for the support  of

the  people of Singapore, so that we can fulfil the

five-year  programme of the People's  Action  Party

which has been read by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me say that it does not cater

for  only  one section, one race, or any particular

group  of people, but it caters for all the  people

of  Singapore, for the benefit, welfare, prosperity

and happiness of the citizens of our Singapura.



<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems to

me  that the new State of Singapore is like  a  new

ship,  with a new captain and a new crew.  Some  of

us,  Sir, are still in doubt as to who is the  real

captain  of  the  ship. I hope the Government  will

make  it  clear  to us, because usually  the  Prime

Minister is the captain. But we are told indirectly

through  the Press that the captain of the ship  is

the Deputy Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Malay Press or-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, earlier we had the

impression that the captain and crew could be human

robots   because  they  believed  in   unity   with

uniformity, and all came into this Chamber  dressed

in  white. But today, Sir, we notice that there are

splashes  of  different colours - grey,  dark  grey,

brown-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am just wondering how all

these   personalities  and   description   of   the

sartorial pleasures of others have anything  to  do

with  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara. The hon.  Member

might even start to comment on my wig!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I believe this is

relevant because in a true democracy we believe  in

unity with diversity. We are glad, Sir, to see that

the   Government  is  quite  sensible   and   quite

sensitive  to  the  need  for  change  in  changing

conditions; and in this Chamber there needs to be a

bit  more laxity as regards maybe Party discipline.

Sir,  joking  apart, we realise that [Laughter]  in

the  hands of the captain and crew lie the  lives,

the  happiness  and the security of  one  and  half

million  passengers, and that the course of history

for  the  future  of Singapore and Malaya  will  be

decided  by what happens in the next few  years  in

Singapore.  We  believe, Sir, that the  Opposition,

although  small  in number, have a  very  important

function to fulfil. We believe that if the Ship  of

State is heading for unseen rocks, hidden dangers-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The passengers will jump out!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> -or for stormy weather, it is

our  duty to draw the attention of the captain  and

the  crew, and it will have to be left to  them  to

decide whether they will steamroller all Opposition

(which  they  can,  because of  their  overwhelming majority)  or  whether they will be able  to  weigh

things  dispassionately, whether there is need  for

reconsideration,  or need for  change,  or  whether

they  will be capable of reconsidering and changing

their policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 1 of the speech of His Excellency

the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, I believe the  keynote

of  the policy of the new Government is that  of  a

more  just  society.  Sir,  we  of  the  Opposition

believe in that. But more than that, we would  like

the  Government to clarify whether  in  seeking  to

achieve  a  more just society they will  strive  to

bring it about also by just means and methods,  and

also  in  a manner which bears the mark of  justice

and  humanity.  Sir, in the not too  distant  past,

dictators like Hitler and Mussolini, in the name of

justice,  invaded  other countries  and  ordered  a

massacre  of  millions of inhabitants.  Talking  of

justice,  Sir, we are reminded also of the immortal

words of Shakespeare in a famous play where he said

that "earthly power doth then show like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



God's, when mercy seasons justice". [Interruption.]

We  look  forward to a policy which  will  seek  to

achieve  not only a more just society but  also  by

means  and methods and in a manner to show  to  the

world  that  they also are just and humane  to  all

sections of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in paragraph 1 of "Economics and Finance"

we  are  told that the Government will  "place  the

finances  of  the  country on a sound  and  healthy

basis".  Then it states that there is a "threatened

deficit", I repeat, Sir, "threatened deficit",  "of

$14  million for 1959". Judging by the past records

of  past Financial Secretaries, I am surprised that

the  Minister for Finance is also adopting the same

policy  by  saying  that  there  is  a  "threatened

deficit".  Every  year from 1947  onwards,  it  was

found that the "threatened deficit" always ended in

a  surplus.  This was due usually to unspent  votes

and     under-estimated    items    of     revenue.

Unfortunately,  Sir, instead  of  waiting  for  the

"threatened deficit" to materialise, the Government [Interruption]-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member is entitled

to  be  heard  in silence. I think Members  of  the

Government Benches have been heard in silence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Unfortunately, Sir, instead of

waiting    for   the   "threatened   deficit"    to

materialise,  the new Government looked  around  to

find  lambs  to be slaughtered and the first  lambs

that  they  wanted  to  slaughter  were  their  own

employees.  No  doubt  there  was  the  problem  of

balancing the Budget, but whereas the Minister  for

Finance is able to ensure a balanced Budget, he has

passed  some  of  the problems  to  probably  6,000

families - passing  on  worries  to  probably  30,000

passengers on board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe, Sir, that if it is necessary for the

deficit to be met, it can be met by spreading  that

burden on others as well as on their own employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a belief - whether this is true or not the

Government will have to clarify - that this step  was

taken as an act of political revenge. We hope it is

not   true,  because  if  it  is  true   then   the

foundations  of  true  democracy  will  have   been

undermined.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Does the Member for Tanglin

believe   that  he  is  furthering  the  cause   of

democracy  by spreading unfounded rumours  in  this

House?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the

business of the Opposition to draw the attention of

the  captain and the crew to what is going  on  and

what  is  being said outside. I have asked them  to

state  whether it is true or not. I am not alleging

that it is true. In fact I wish to express the hope

that it is not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the grievances of the Government trade

unions  are  now well known. There is a feeling  of

great disappointment and disillusionment among them

that their once great champions of the liberty  and

rights of trade unionism have now been transformed,

and  that  their old champions have begun to  adopt

the  boss  mentality of their old Colonial masters.

An impossible situation! But this is their feeling,

Sir,  and  it is right that this feeling should  be

expressed in this Chamber. I would suggest that the

good  boss should first look after the interest  of

his  own employees, then he will set an example  to

other  bosses as to the way they should treat their

own employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another report: that this is a

method by which Government robs Peter to pay  Paul,

because  in Part 1 of the P.A.P.'s Five-Year  Plan,

page  26, it is stated that millions could be saved

by   the   Government  to  finance  this   proposed

Development Board by this sort of economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to inform the

hon. Member and other hon. Members that if they are

quoting from a document, newspaper or any pamphlet,

that  document,  newspaper or  pamphlet  should  be

produced.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I have the document.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The passage should be read from the

document.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Part 1, page 26. Sir, this has

become  the textbook also of the Opposition Members

because we want to be fair and we have got to  know

what the Government really believes in. May I read,

Sir,  an extract from the second paragraph at  page

26:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By ruthless pruning of Government expenditure,

we  may be able to add $20 million annually to  the

Development Board."



<br><br>But  instead  of  pruning Government  expenditure,

Sir, Government has decided that it should get  the

$12 million from the pay of its own employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this has been expressed to me by some of the

Government   employees.  Supposing  the  threatened

deficit does not turn out to be so serious  as  has

been  expected, and the finances of Singapore  will

after  all end up with not such a large deficit  as

has been stated, will Government consider restoring

part  of the pay cuts to their employees? This will

help to restore the confidence of the employees  of

Government  that  they are  in  the  service  of  a

Government which really seeks to build a more  just

society by means, methods and in a manner which are

also just.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of information.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon. Member for Tanglin

was  quoting  at  some  length  from  the  pamphlet

produced by the P.A.P., and in one passage  it  was

said   that   we  intended  ruthlessly   to   prune

Government  expenditure. Does he not  consider  the

pay of civil servants coming within the category of

Government expenditure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Yes, Sir. But I stress that to

achieve  a more just society the means and  methods

should  also be just, and the Government  employees

feel  that if there should be a cut, the cut should

be so imposed that the burden falls on all members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On the poor!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> On all members in Singapore.

They do not say that it should be on the poor,  but

there  are  so many others who are much better  off

than they, on whom the cuts have not been made.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> The Member for Tanglin seems

to  suggest that if the Government finances at  the

end of the year proved to be a surplus, would there

be a -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That does not seem to be a point of

order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I was just going to say that

perhaps  he  is an interested party because,  as  a

member  of  an aided school, he therefore  receives

funds  from the Government, and whether he  is  not

pleading his own cause.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister is

rather  talking  with  his  tongue  in  his  cheek,

because  this  matter  is a  matter  of  Government

policy,  and  it  is completely in  order  for  the

Member for Tanglin to attack that policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I also draw the attention of hon. Members to

a Standing Order which says that Members should not

read  their speeches? They can refer to  notes  but

they should not read their speeches.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in paragraph

3  of  the  Speech of His Excellency the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,  the Government  stated  that  the

prime  task  is to build up a climate of confidence

under  which trade expansion and industrial  growth

can  take place. Sir, we welcome this statement  of

policy.  But we feel that the way things are  being

done creates an atmosphere of fear in this country;

fear  in  Government  offices,  fear  in  the  City

Council  offices,  fear  in business  houses,  fear

among  the  workers. Sir, I do not  think  that  an

atmosphere of fear is conducive to the creation  of

a climate of confidence under which trade expansion

and industrial



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



growth  can take place. I would suggest. Sir,  that

it  is necessary for Government to help remove this

fear  complex  in  order  that  the  objective   of

building  up  a  climate  of  confidence  will   be

achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another fear, and this fear acts

like  a nuclear chain reaction. This is the economy

complex.  There  is  fear that many  people  cannot

balance their budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Six thousand!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> No, Sir, more than that. So

because  of  that  fear they tell  their  children,

members  of  their  families:  "We  have   got   to

economise,  we have got to tighten our belts."  But

what  is  the  effect of that? Employees  in  other

employment say that if this is a sign of  a  slump,

they also must economise even before their own  pay

is cut. So they tell all members of their families:

"We  must all economise. Do not go by taxi,  if  we

can  help it. Go by bus, walk or cycle. Do not  buy

as many things as we did before."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the Chambers of Commerce are thinking

along  the same lines. This is bad. When they  talk

about economising and retrenching, the effects will

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



to  be borne by the poor and by the workers. For  a

place   like   Singapore,   without   any   natural

resources,  a  fear complex and an economy  complex

are bad. An expanding population needs an expanding

economy. But when people from the top to the  lower

strata  at  this time keep on thinking of  spending

less,   then  it  does  not  look  too   well   for

Singapore's future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his Han Raya Haji

message said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It serves to remind us that whatever the

differences in name and form of various  religions,

so  long  as we remember that all religions  preach

goodwill  and love for one's fellowmen,  then  with

tolerance we can live happily together in peace and

prosperity."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is now 8 o'clock. Further

consideration, what day?
