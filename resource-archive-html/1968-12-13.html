<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL MUSEUM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Plans for modernisation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Science  and Technology what steps have been  taken  to

modernise the National Museum on the lines indicated in

the  addendum  to the President's Speech  on  6th  May,

1968.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the time of the transfer of

the  National  Museum to the Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology,  there were plans to modernise  the  public

galleries  and  to  modify  the  existing  building  to

increase the exhibition space from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>

the present 36,000 square feet to 51,000 square feet as

well  as  to  provide  adequate accommodation  for  the

reference collection, library and research facilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plans were based on recommendations submitted by

a  UNESCO  museum adviser, Dr A. N. J. Vandehoop,  and

those submitted by the Science and Industry Museum  Com

mittee set up in 1961. The Government has also obtained

the services of a Colombo Plan expert, Mr Y. Takizawa,

of  the  National  Museum of Modern  Art,  Tokyo,  from

September  1967  to June this year  to  advise  on  the

designs  and layout of exhibition cases in  the  public

galleries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Members will be aware that the Museum, as it

stands  at the moment, is almost a junk-shop containing

a  hodge-podge of exhibits. You enter one room in which

you  see snakes and monkeys and you enter the next room

and you see old Chinese furniture and sarongs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously the Museum needs a new policy and,

accordingly,  a Gallup poll was conducted among  Museum

visitors to ascertain their preferences for the various

categories  of exhibits in June this year. The  results

showed  a general preference for exhibits of flora  and

fauna. In view of this preference and of the limitation

of  funds  which makes it impossible to  build  up  the

Anthropological Section of the Museum, it has now  been

decided  to develop the National Museum into a  Natural

History   Museum.  In  the  meantime,  the  Development

Planning  Committee has given approval for  expenditure

of  $245,000 to improve the existing building according

to plans already made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation will shortly be introduced to provide for

the establishment of a National Museum Board which will

advise  and  assist  in  the running  of  the  National

Museum.  There is also a possibility that the  services

of   a  Museum  expert  may  be  obtained  with  UNESCO

assistance to advise on the setting up of exhibits  and

dioramas in the National Museum.

many  pioneer industries have been and are expected  to

be  set  up  and  how many workers have  been  and  are

expected  to be employed by such industries during  the

period of twelve months from 1st July, 1968.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as at 30th June, 1968,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>

approximately 19,000 workers were employed by 174

pioneer industrial firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part of the question, Sir, during

the  period  of  12 months from 1st July,  1968,  25

additional pioneer firms are expected to go into pro

duction and it is estimated that 8,000 new jobs will

be created.

established during the period 1st January,  1968  to

investment; and (b) how many workers are employed by

those industries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the Economic Development  Board

survey,  which covers all pioneer firms in Singapore

and   only   those  non-pioneer  firms  in   Jurong,

indicates  the  following situation for  the  period

from 1st January to 31st October, 1968.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of this year, 120 new factories

were established, consisting of 61 pioneer firms  and

59  non-pioneer firms in Jurong. Of these,  56,  that

is,  33  pioneer and 23 non-pioneer firms in  Jurong,

have   already   started  production/operation.   The

remaining 28 pioneer and 36 Jurong non-pioneer  firms

are in various stages of implementation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at October, 1968, the 56 firms in production had

a  total  fixed capital investment of $56.3 million,

and employed 3,679 workers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  if  he  will  make  a  statement   on   the

Government's  plan  to  develop  the  Sembawang  and

Woodlands areas into an industrial complex.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, approximately 6,000 acres of land in  the

Sembawang/Woodlands   area,  with   existing   housing,

industrial   and   other  facilities,   together   with

waterfront land with access to a deep-sea channel, will

be available for civilian use when the British withdraw

from  the  Naval  Base by 1971. These facilities,  with

suitable  development and conversion, can  provide  sub

stantial  infra-structure for  a  potential  industrial

complex  which would generate new activities to replace

the  old  military activities and to absorb the  labour

force formerly employed in the military establishment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A naval dockyard has already been converted for

civilian   use.  And  a  preliminary  study  is   being

conducted with the view to drawing up a master plan for

the development and conversion of the area for civilian

use  according to the phased withdrawal of the military

base  and  according  to the estimated  requirement  of

industrial land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, approximately 390 acres of

swampy land within the Naval Base situated west of  the

Naval Dockyard are being surveyed and tenders for earth

works in this area will soon be called.

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF MANUFACTURE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ORDINANCE, 1959</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government policy on setting up new factories to</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>produce goods specified in First and Second Schedules)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for Finance

(a)  what is the policy of the Government in regard  to

the  setting  up of new factories to produce  goods  or

classes  of  goods  specified in the First  and  Second

Schedules  to  the  Control of  Manufacture  Ordinance,

1959,  where those goods are already being produced  by

existing  factories; and (b) whether would-be investors

will be allowed to set up new factories to produce such

specified goods, on the condition that they can promote

an  export  market  for  a proportion  of  their  total

production.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the licensing of new factories  to

manufacture  products on the Control  of  Manufacture

list  where these products are already being produced

by  existing factories would depend on the volume and

capacity  production of such factories as  the  local

market  could  bear. The Government  is  prepared  to

consider  the  issue  of  new  licences  if   it   is

established   that   the   production   of   existing

manufacturers  is  not sufficient to  cater  for  the

needs  and requirements of local consumers.  However,

the  Government would like to satisfy itself that new

manufacturers   have   the   necessary    managerial,

technical   and  marketing  expertise  required   for

successful  operation  of their  enterprise.  In  all

cases   where   a  small  number  of  licencees   are

authorised,  a  condition is  imposed  in  regard  to

maintenance of quality as well as price variations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question, Sir,

the  Government is always willing to give sympathetic

consideration to any proposals for the setting up  of

plants  to produce goods for export markets. In  line

with  this  policy,  the Government  is  prepared  to

consider licensing new manufacturers if they are in a

position to export their products overseas or, in the

case  of  international manufacturers,  they  already

have   existing  markets  to  which  they  have  been

exporting  from  other  locations.  It  is,  however,

difficult  to  enforce compliance  with  undertakings

given  in respect of export performance. Accordingly,

such undertakings are treated with reserve.

<div align="center"><b>CONTROL OF MANUFACTURE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ORDINANCE, 1959</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Profiteering by manufacturers of goods</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>specified in First and Second Schedules)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Low Guan Onn</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  he is aware that some existing manufacturers

of  goods specified in the First and Second Schedules

to the Control of Manufacture Ordinance, 1959, are ex

ploiting the captive market, and prices



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>

of  some  items of daily necessities have -gone  up  by

more  than  50  per cent, and what measures  have  been

taken  to curb this profiteering tendency which  is  at

the expense of domestic consumers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  order to answer the  hon.  Member's

question,  I  have caused a survey to be taken  of  the

prices of the following, which are the likely items  of

daily  necessities the hon. Member has in  mind.  These

items are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) toilet soap;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) condensed milk;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) singlets;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) toilet papers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) shirts;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) hair cream.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The survey shows that there has been little change in

the  retail  prices  of  the  items  before  and  after

protection has been accorded. There has been no  change

in  the  prices of all the other items mentioned except

for  toilet  soap. There is therefore no  justification

for  the contention of the hon. Member for River Valley

that  prices  of  some items of daily necessities  have

gone  up  by  more than 50 per cent. As for  shirts  -

until  recently there existed neither duty nor quantity

restriction. Even now there is no quantity restriction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaints of higher prices are perhaps more the

result of local consumers insisting on imported brands,

on which protective tariffs have been imposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

completely disagree With the Parliamentary Secretary. I

have  got the figures for 1965 for the following items:

singlets  used to cost 60 cents each and  today  it  is

being sold at 75 cents; socks used to cost $7 per dozen

as against $7.80 per dozen today; toilet papers used to

cost  18  cents per roll as against 23 cents  per  roll

today;  Lux  soap  used to cost 25 cents  per  cake  as

against 45 cents per cake today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain the increase

in prices between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>

1965  and  today  in  the  light  of  his  contention

yesterday  that  there was not much increase  in  the

cost of living?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for River Valley answered his own question by his last

sentence. Indeed, during yesterday's Budget  debate  I

quoted  the retail price index which showed  that,  in

fact,  there  was a decline in the retail price  index

from  something like 113 points to 111 points. I  have

got  a  list here which I shall be only too  happy  to

give  to  the  hon. Member, and if he will  also  make

available to me his list, I shall check up. If  he  is

satisfied with my private answer later on, all will be

well, otherwise he can always table another question.

<div align="center"><b>RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR 1969</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reduction in provision)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance,  in  view of the increase in  expenditure  on

defence, whether he will give an assurance that  there

will  be  no reduction in the provision for the  Rural

Development Programme for 1969, so that the people  in

the  rural  areas will continue to benefit from  rural

development schemes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang seeks an  assur

ance   that  in  spite  of  the  increase  in  defence

expenditure,  there  will  be  no  reduction  in   the

provision for rural development in 1969.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I trust that the hon. Member is not taking the

position  that the welfare of the rural people-whether

in  Sembawang  or  elsewhere-has precedence  over  the

security  and safety of the entire population  of  the

Republic.  I  am  sure  he is not.  But  his  question

reminds  me  of a cartoon I saw in Punch during  World

War  II.  Britain  was  then in a desperate  position,

standing alone against Nazi in Germany, and her cities

were being bombed day and night. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>

cartoon   depicts  a  bespectacled  middle-aged   woman

addressing  a gathering of village folk in  some  small

English village. She said, "Of course, the Government's

policy  will advance the national war effort, but  will

it help this village?".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to answer the question. It is fortunate that

defence expenditure can be met in 1969 without reducing

essential  expenditure in other fields. This,  however,

assumes  that  economic growth in 1969  will  be  good,

resulting in good tax yields. If that proves not to  be

the case, then either defence expenditure will have  to

be  reduced  or  other expenditure, including  that  of

rural development, will have to be reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, cannot give the assurance that the

Member seeks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>

has  experienced, and is still experiencing,  an  acute

shortage of hotel accommodation which has led  to  some

hotels  increasing their charges and also  has  led  to

some  tourists  by-passing  Singapore.  If  we  are  to

promote  the  tourist industry, there  must  be  easily

available adequate good class hotel rooms at reasonable

charges  coupled  with  first-class  service.  We  have

always thrived on competition and with more hotels  and

keener   competition,  even  better  service  will   be

provided for hotel guests.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development whether planning approval  can  be

expedited so as to speed up private development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the law requires that

planning decisions be given within three months  of  an

application  being submitted. This is provided  for  in

the  Planning  Ordinance, but in  most  cases  planning

decisions are given much earlier than three months.  In

cases where the proposals submitted involve alterations

to  the Master Plan, the procedure required by the  law

is  somewhat lengthy as it involves notification in the

press   and   public   exhibition   of   the   proposed

alterations. Where there is a special need to encourage

and  expedite a particular type of development  in  the

public  interest,  for  example,  hotels,  there  is  a

provision   in   the   Planning  Ordinance   for   such

development  proposals  to be considered  expeditiously

without  following  the  strict and  lengthy  procedure

normally required for alterations to the Master Plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst efforts are continuously being made by my

Ministry to investigate into possible ways and means to

expedite  planning  approvals,  developers  and   their

architects  can also help by submitting complete  well-thought-out  and  properly  planned  proposals  and  by

providing  all relevant information necessary  for  the

consideration of the planners.

<div align="center"><b>RECLAMATION PROJECTS AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEVELOPMENT PLANS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National  Development to what extent  reclamatory

works  along  the  East Coast and  at  Pasir  Panjang,

Kallang  and  Kranji have been completed;  what  plans

there are to reclaim land in other areas in Singapore;

and,  if  he will make a statement on plans to develop

the land already reclaimed and to be reclaimed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the question requires information in

respect  of  several reclamation projects and  I  will

take them in turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the East Coast foreshore. The biggest

reclamation project at present is proceeding along the

East  Coast foreshore in two phases: the first reclama

tion of about 1,000 acres of foreshores extending from

Bedok to the Singapore

Swimming Club, and the second reclamation of about 125

acres  from the Singapore Swimming Club to the tip  of

Tanjong Rhu. By the end of October last, 705 acres  of

land  had  been  reclaimed. It is expected  that  both

phases  will be completed by early 1970. Comprehensive

plans  for the utilisation of the reclaimed land along

the  East Coast are now being prepared. A new  coastal

highway   will  first  be  constructed  to  meet   the

increasing needs of the East Coast area. In  addition,

land will be set aside for housing, parks, hotels  and

shops.  It  is likely that another 200 acres  of  land

along  Nicoll  Highway will be reclaimed  at  a  later

stage  to  provide better open spaces and recreational

facilities for the people in the central areas of  the

city.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major reclamation project now in progress and

nearing  completion is the Kallang Basin  Reclamation.

Out  of  the 450 acres of swamp land in Kallang Basin,

370  acres  had been reclaimed by the end  of  October

last. The remaining 80 acres will be reclaimed in  the

next  two years. Two-thirds of the reclaimed  land  in

the Kallang Basin will be used for labour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>

intensive industries and one-third for low-cost  public

housing.  Two  blocks  of flatted factories  have  been

constructed and already occupied, and more  blocks  are

now  under  construction. About 3,550 units of  housing

have  been  completed and occupied and  another  12,000

units  are  expected to be built within the  next  five

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pasir Panjang reclamation. Early this year, a

pilot  scheme  to reclaim the West Coast foreshores  at

Pasir  Panjang  began.  By September,  the  scheme  was

completed and ten acres of land near the 6th mile  were

reclaimed.  This  piece of land will be  used  for  the

development   of   tourist   recreational   facilities.

Detailed   investigations  into  the   feasibility   of

reclaiming  more  land along the West Coast  are  being

conducted at present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kranji reclamation. A total of 247 acres of swamp

land  was  earmarked for reclamation out of  which  160

acres  have already been reclaimed. This area is to  be

developed for sawmills and related industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, other reclamation projects which are being

planned or undertaken include the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 1,000 acres of swamp and foreshore at the east

bank of Jurong for marine, woodworking and other

industries;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 307 acres of prawn-ponds and swamp at Sungei

Kadut for woodworking and other industries;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 108 acres of swamp close to the Armament Depot

in   the   Naval  Base  for  marine  and   other

industries;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) extension of the East Coast Reclamation from

Bedok towards Changi; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) extension of the West Coast Reclamation towards

the city to provide an area for the construction

of godowns.

and  after  the  reclamation of the foreshore  of  Joo

Chiat?

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, these are specific

problems  which  we have had to meet  because  of  the

reclamation.  I  have  also received  complaints  from

other  constituencies.  For  example,  one  was   from

Siglap.  Reclamation of the sea must lead to  blockage

of  some drains and outlets leading to the sea. Follow

ing  complaints by the Member for Siglap, the position

in  Siglap was remedied. Now that the Member  for  Joo

Chiat has complained in the House, I assure him that I

will  look  into  the matter and try  to  improve  the

drainage system in Joo Chiat.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL ZOO</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development whether the Government proposes to

set up a National Zoo and when.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the feasibility of

setting  up  a  zoological garden within the  catchment

area of Seletar where a site of 260 acres is available,

is  under consideration by the Public Utilities  Board.

Sizable water catchment areas totalling 8,600 acres are

vested  in  the Board and the need to put  these  large

areas of land, which would otherwise be sterilised,  to

such maximum public use as is compatible with the over-riding  necessity of ensuring a safe water  supply  has

resulted in the development of MacRitchie Park as  well

as the present proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept envisages moated enclosures and spacious

paddocks to house a variety of mammals and reptiles,  a

development which will have immense educational benefit

for  the younger generation and also serve as a tourist

attraction.  The natural environment would be  retained

as  far  as  possible and concrete  bars  and  wiremesh

fencing  kept to a minimum. Towards this  end,  in  the

middle  of  this year, the Board invited a  Mr  E.  H.

'Thong, Director of Whitsney Zoo in England, to  advise

on all aspects and possibilities of the construction of

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>

wild  life sanctuary and limited zoo. Mr Thong,  who

was  in  Singapore for five weeks,  has  submitted  a

detailed report which suggests that the proposed area

at  Seletar would be highly suitable for the  purpose

and can be made into an attractive zoo park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has also had the advice of Mr Straham,

Director  of  the  Tarronga Zoo in  New  South  Wales,

Australia,  who  was  also in Singapore  for  a  short

period.  Mr Straham is also of the opinion  that  the

area  could be developed into one of the best zoos  in

this  region. A number of other experts have also been

consulted. The financial implications of the  project,

the  amount  of subsidy required and the effectiveness

of  possible  anti-pollution measures are amongst  the

many  problems that are being carefully examined. Once

these  evaluations are completed, it is  hoped  to  be

able  to  proceed  with  the  implementation  of  this

venture  which will complement the proposed aviary  at

present under construction at Jurong.

total for each head of expenditure as it appears in the

pages 53 and 54 of the Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing first with the heads of expenditure in

respect  of  which amendments stand on the Order  Paper

Supplement No. 5



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0106 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0106 he reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2013.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am confident that the Government

is  still  desirous  of  promoting  and  uplifting  the

livelihood  of  the  Malays in the Republic  by  giving

opportunities  to  Malay  children  who  are  Singapore

citizens to acquire higher education. The Malays in the

Republic  are  generally far behind in  all  fields  of

human  endeavour.  I  believe the Government  is  fully

aware  of  this  fact.  That  is  the  reason  why  the

Government  is  setting  aside  special  bursaries  for

Malays. But, unfortunately, the bursaries for the  year

1969/70  have  been reduced. Each recipient  gets  only

$750  per year. This is half the amount which the Malay

students  received in previous years.  This  amount  is

inadequate for a student studying in an institution  of

higher learning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first time in the history

of the Republic of Singapore, students from the Malay

language  stream  are admitted to the  University  of

Singapore  and  Nanyang  University.  Although   both

universities   provide  courses  in  Malay   studies,

nevertheless, they both require a pass in English and

Mandarin respectively before students can be admitted

and  obtain their degrees. One of the ways to improve

Malay students' knowledge of English and Mandarin  is

to  stay in the hostel where they can mix freely  and

harmoniously  with their non-Malay  fellow  students.

But  the  reduced amount of bursary of $750 per  year

for  each  student  will not  be  adequate  for  this

purpose.  Because  the Malays are  still  behind  the

other  communities in all fields, I make  the  appeal

that the special bursaries for Malay students be  con

tinued  to be given in full for at least a period  of

ten years. If they are given in full, the Malays will

not  lag  behind  their  more advanced  brethren  and

fellow citizens of other communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Acting Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Prime Minister (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the hon. Member has rightly  observed

that  it  is  an  important item  of  policy  of  the

Singapore  Government  to  ensure  that  the   Malays

improve  their competitive position in  our  society.

And  one of the best ways to achieve this is to  give

them  certain  privileges in the field  of  education

which  other  communities do not  enjoy.  At  present

Singapore  Malay  citizens enjoy  free  tuition  from

primary school to secondary school level and, if they

are   qualified,  are  eligible  for   admission   to

institutions  of  higher learning.  They  enjoy  free

tuition in the universities, the Polytechnic  and  so

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the special Malay bursaries were first

introduced,  it  was possible to give  everybody  the

maximum amount of the award simply because there were

at  that time very few students who were eligible for

such   bursaries.  This  year  the  number  of  Malay

students  who  have obtained bursaries is  more  than

three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>

times that of last year. There is no justification  for

giving everybody the maximum award, either in the  case

of  the special Malay bursaries or, indeed, in the case

of other bursaries. There is also an additional reason.

Interest-free  study  loans  are  eligible   to   Malay

students  as  well as to other students.  So  with  the

increase  in opportunities available to Malay students,

it  is  necessary  to  modify the original  conditions.

Where  before there was no regard paid to the  academic

performance  of  the students, now  their  progress  in

their  work, their family income, and the economic  cir

cumstances  of their family, will have to be  borne  in

mind.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am satisfied that, all things considered, the

present  position  is  one  which  provides  sufficient

benefits  to Malays in pursuit of higher education  and

that  the new policy would in no way reduce the ability

of  the Malays to gain admission to higher institutions

of learning and profit from academic studies.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, can the Minister

confirm  whether a student, who is receiving a  bursary

of  $750  a year, can apply for an interest-free  study

loan  if he is in need of financial aid to further  his

studies?

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Am I to understand that the

question  is  whether, in addition to bursaries,  Malay

students can get study loans? I am not conversant  with

the  details  of the regulations governing study  loans

and   bursaries.  No  doubt,  if  there   are   special

circumstances which justify a grant of both study  loan

and bursary in any individual case, such an application

will be considered.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On the explanation of

the Minister, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment aslo stood in the name of Mr. Hwang Soo Jin.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that this block provision of

nearly $2.3 million is provided for the Bases Economic

Conversion Department for the next financial  year  to

meet  expenses on the training and retraining  courses

for   redundant   base  workers  and  expenditure   on

administration in connection therewith.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there is a supplementary provision of

$430,000 provided in the Third Supplementary Estimates

of  Expenditure  for 1968 which was approved  in  this

House a few days ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of this new department is necessary

in  view  of the redundancy of large numbers  of  base

workers who will be retrenched in stages from  now  up

to the end of 1971. Our Government must be praised for

this  wise move in making advance plans for the  train

ing  and retraining of redundant base workers and  for

the  taking  over  and conversion of certain  military

bases  for  commercial use. For  instance,  the  Naval

Dockyard   at  Sembawang  has  been  taken  over   and

converted into a commercial dockyard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Base workers will no doubt benefit under this scheme

and will definitely appreciate what the Government  is

doing  for  them. Sir, may I request the Acting  Prime

Minister to brief the House on:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) whether the training and retraining of redundant

base workers is deemed to be satisfactory;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) how many of the redundant base workers who have

completed  training? have been taken  into  employment

with  the industrial firms and how many are at present

still under training;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) whether plans have been made out to take over the

three air bases at Changi, Seletar and Tengah and what

the Government proposes to do with them; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) whether the British Army establishments and land

along  Ayer  Rajah Road and Alexandra  Road  areas  and

elsewhere in the Republic will be converted for use  by

light industries after providing for its use by our own

defence forces.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, as you are

aware,  the  Royal Air Force Seletar  Base  is  in  the

constituency  of  Jalan Kayu. I understand  it  is  the

first  base  to  be  affected by the British  projected

withdrawal. In order that those of my constituents  who

are likely to be affected either directly or indirectly

may  start  preparing  for any  change  and  adjustment

necessary  in  their  economic  activities,  I   should

appreciate it if the Acting Prime Minister would inform

the   House  whether  plans  have  now  been  finalised

concerning the conversion of Seletar. I appreciate that

conversion of the base is a major undertaking and calls

for the most careful consideration and planning. But  I

do  hope  that the people can be kept informed  of  progress from time to time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Mountbatten

wants to know whether the training schemes provided for

redundant  base workers have been deemed  satisfactory.

Of course, this is a very difficult question to answer,

because whether or not the training is

satisfactory  will depend on whether or  not  they  get

jobs after they have been retrenched. This test has  so

far  not been applied on a very large scale. The reason

is  that  most  of those base employees who  have  gone

through the training schemes are still employed at  the

bases.  In  the  first batch of trainees,  out  of  561

workers,   427  successfully  completed   the   course.

Similarly, in the second batch, out of 524 workers, 417

passed the course. But 90 per cent of the trainees  are

still in the employ of the British services. Therefore,

whether the training would be good enough to get them a

new  job  in industry has yet to be seen. But of  those

who  have been retrenched and who have responded to the

circular



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>

issued  by  the Bases Economic Conversion Department,

81  out  of the 1,105 retrenched have undergone  this

course  and 49 of them have been re-employed  by  the

Sembawang Shipyard, formerly H.M. Naval Dockyard.  So

on  that  question,  no conclusive  answer  has  been

reached.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also answered the Member's question about

the number of persons taken into new employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the three air bases, Changi, Seletar and

Tengah, it is a bit early to think about what  to  do

with  Changi and Seletar. These are not likely to  be

released  until  very late in the rundown  programme,

probably at the end of December 1971. So far, only  a

limited  number of properties have been  taken  over.

These include Blakang Mati, Fort Canning, Bukit Timah

Maintenance  Park,  30  buildings  and  a  hangar  in

Seletar, some buildings and a hangar in Tengah, Pulau

Tekong,  Kiat Hong domestic accommodation, the  Naval

Dockyard  and  No. 5 Sub-depot of the  Base  Ordnance

Depot at Telok Blangah.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence has taken over all these

properties except the last which is being used as  an

industrial  training centre. Plans,  of  course,  are

being  drawn up in consultation with the Land Office,

the  State and City Planning Department, the Ministry

of  the Interior and Defence and various other depart

ments and Ministries concerned. It will

be some time before a final decision is reached on

these matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the air base in Seletar, the present

intention  is to develop it into a civilian  aircraft

maintenance

centre.  This project has been under intensive  study

by the Economic Development Board which has engaged a

team  of American consultants to see in what form  or

what shape this aircraft maintenance business can  be

carried  on  in Seletar. The study is in an  advanced

stage of completion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the study by American consultants,

Hawker de Havilland has proposed that they be allowed

to make use of some facilities in Seletar air base



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>

to run an aircraft maintenance and overhaul business on

commercial lines. The merits of this proposal are being

assessed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be some time, not too long I am sure, before

a final decision is reached on these matters.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0301 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the only purpose of this amendment is to seek

information on why only a token provision has been made

for  -the Minister's salary. Sit, is the Minister going

to live on fresh air?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why is it that there is no Permanent

Secretary  attached  to  the Ministry  of  Science  and

Technology?

<br><br>3.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Member for Changi

intends  to remove even that little $10, there will  be

nothing  left and the Minister does not exist  at  all.

However,  for  the clarification of the House,  Members

will  be  aware that I also hold another post as  Vice-Chancellor  of  the  University  of  Singapore.  I  can

receive  only  one salary and I am being  paid  by  the

University  and  therefore  I  am  not  receiving   any

emolument  from  the Government. The $10  vote  is,  of

course, a token sum to indicate that the Minister  does

exist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of this moment when I am building up the Ministry

and the work is slowly piling up, the reason why we  do

not   have  a  Permanent  Secretary  attached  to   the

Ministry  is  that I cannot find any civil  servant  of

that category who can be my Permanent Secretary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>

So I have a Principal Assistant Secretary instead.  I

must  add that I have been relieved of a considerable

load  of work by the Science Council of Singapore  to

which  I  have passed a lot of the problems addressed

to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, the Ministry is involved in a

sample  survey of professional and technical manpower

in  conjunction with the Economic Research Centre  of

the University, and there has also been a proposal to

form a placement agency attached to my Ministry.  The

reason  is  that  graduates who  have  come  back  to

Singapore  from abroad have found that they  are  not

able to obtain jobs according to their qualifications

or  training. Some have become square pegs  in  round

holes and some have become unemployable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of these graduates have approached or

written  to  me for jobs. Being responsible  for  the

University  and the Polytechnic, I am in a favourable

position to understand the staffing

position in these two institutions. I do hope that  I

will  be  able to help them as far as I can. However,

there  is indeed a need for us to explain to students

who  go  abroad  for  a higher  degree,  or  even  an

undergraduate   course,   what   studies   they   can

profitably  undertake so that  when  they  return  to

Singapore  they can be usefully employed.  It  is  my

concern that many of our young students who go abroad

have  not been so counselled and we see now  the  con

sequences of students taking up esoteric studies and,

on returning, find that they cannot obtain employment

for the training which they have undergone. This is a

problem with which my Ministry is faced, and  as  the

work  accumulates it is my intention at  some  future

date to appoint perhaps a Parliamentary Secretary  to

assist  me  in  interviewing some of  these  returned

students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this explanation satisfies the Member for

Changi.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, in view of the clarification

and explanation given by the Minister, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $390,200 for Head 0301 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0401 -

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam

Chan Choy Siong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, the Ministry of Finance has played a very

important  part  in the building of  our  country.  For

instance,  the  Ministry has formulated two  industrial

projects which have attracted many foreign investors to

set  up  factories here and thereby create more  employ

ment  opportunities for our workers. The  stability  of

our  currency has also been maintained, and our  people

have  confidence  in  it. This  contributes  to  social

stability and economic well-being.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At yesterday's sitting, the Member for River Valley

and  other  Members spoke about the increased  cost  of

living.   I  think  this  question  needs  our  special

attention because in the past few years there have been

many  changes in the prices of goods. I would  ask  the

Minister  whether  he will set up  a  Prices  Committee

comprising Members of Parliament who can represent  the

people of the various constituencies, because they  are

in close contact with them and know the prices of goods

very  well, and officials from the Ministry of  Finance

as   well   as  representatives  from  industrial   and

commercial  circles. The Committee can gather  material

and data on the prices of goods. Thus, on the one hand,

the Committee can prevent an increase in the prices  of

goods  and,  on the other hand, it can give information

on  the cost of living and the prices of various  goods

and also think of a method to impose control on prices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to deal with is currency. The

old  currencies will no longer be used with effect from

16th  January,  1969. I hope the authorities  concerned

will remind the people to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>

change notes or coins in the old currency before 16th

January, 1969, in order to avoid any losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point concerns the question of

unemployment.  According to information  supplied  by

the  Ministry of Labour, the unemployment figure  now

stands   at   60,000.  After  the  British   military

withdrawal,  it  will be between 20,000  and  30,000.

Since  our  Minister  for Finance  is  an  expert  in

economics,  I  think he can think of  a  solution  to

resolve  this  problem, such  as  by  developing  the

agricultural areas, the opening up of available  land

for this purpose and the building of fish ponds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem touches on the question of imports

exceeding  exports. I think we are all worried  about

this.  There  are  also currency  problems  besetting

other  countries, such as the French currency  crisis

and  the  pressure  on  the  American  dollar.  These

problems are mainly due to the imbalance of trade. At

the  moment,  we  have  a deficit  of  $960  million,

although  our total trade amounts to $6,720  million.

If  we  have  a  deficit  running  into  hundreds  of

millions  of  dollars, it may in the end  lead  to  a

currency crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will think of a solution to

resolve this problem.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch upon the  matters

which  have already been mentioned by the Member  for

Sembawang  just now, one of which being the  increase

in  the  prices  of goods. I support the  Member  for

Sembawang on this matter because the prices of  goods

have  been  fluctuating  according  to  the  economic

situation.  In order to resolve this problem,  a  com

mittee  should be set up to look into the  prices  of

goods. I hope that members of the committee will also

include   representatives  from  the  Citizens'   Con

sultative  Committees so that they may present  their

recommendations  to the Minister  after  having  duly

considered the various problems connected  with  this

subject.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the pound .sterling was

devalued, the expectation was that it should  not  have

affected  the prices of our goods, but because  of  the

procedure  in  exchange, merchants were  able  to  make

profits  out  of it. In the end, goods  which  cost  15

cents  were  charged at 20 cents because the  merchants

said  that it was difficult to give an additional three

cents change. Thus, the prices of goods were increased.

To people with a good income, this does not present any

problem, but those in the lower income group would have

to bear the added burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Minister for Finance announced the Budget

for  the  ensuing financial year, he did  mention  that

Singapore  would  not  have a painless  Budget  in  the

coming financial year. Because of this, the people were

worried  and  there were rumours that  taxes  would  be

levied on refrigerators, television sets, etc. In order

to  avoid paying additional taxes, the people rushed to

buy  these goods so that the Government might incur the

losses  in the end. I think the Trade Division has  not

been  properly controlled. That is why such an incident

has  happened. Therefore, a committee is very necessary

to resolve

problems concerning the prices of goods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to which the Minister for Finance

should  pay  attention is this. I have found  out  that

many  of  our local goods are more expensive  than  the

imported  goods. Being produced locally, the goods  are

exempted  from certain taxes and therefore they  should

be

cheaper. I can give a very simple example. I have  here

some samples of match-boxes. They have an elephant as a

trade mark.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One match-box is produced abroad and the other is

produced locally. There are ten small match-boxes in  a

packet.  A local packet of match-boxes, each containing

48 matches, costs 50 cents. An imported packet of match-boxes, each containing 62 matches, costs 60 -cents. The

locally-produced  match-boxes are  not  taxed,  whereas

there is a tariff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>

on  imported match-boxes. This means that  the  people

are  cheated  in the price of locally-produced  match-boxes.  That is why some people buy cheaper matchboxes

and goods that are made in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, a committee should be

set  up  to  look  into the prices of  various  goods,

especially  those produced locally,  with  a  view  to

imposing  some sort of control over them. How  can  we

expect  to  encourage the people to  buy  local  goods

which are more expensive than imported goods?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  touch  on the subhead relating to the salaries  of

Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless somebody says something now, our Ministers

will  be  getting $2,000 a month a hundred years  from

now!  I  realise that it will take some time to change

the  thinking in Government service, but  getting  the

best  at  the  cheapest rate is a clever scheme.  This

kind  of  thinking  is  probably  inherited  from  the

colonial   past  and  has  led  to  some   unnecessary

exploitation   of   our  talents.  Is   it   therefore

surprising that we are having a brain drain  from  the

Government service to the private sector and  also  to

other countries? Take, for example, the salary of  the

Minister  for  Finance. His salary  is  formulated  on

civil  service emoluments of 1955 and I  think  it  is

very  much out of date and unrealistic in relation  to

his  status and to the work he has to do and  even  to

the rise in the cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the House will agree with me that we can

easily  afford to pay our Ministers more.  I  suggest,

therefore,

that their salary scales should be reviewed and

revised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I will start off with prices and  price

committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my Parliamentary Secretary yesterday announced

that the retail price index had gone down from January

to  September  this year from 113 to 111  points,  his

statement was greeted with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>

a  great  deal  of  scepticism, if not  with  downright

derision.  Obviously people believe that  the  cost  of

living is increasing. But before we argue about whether

prices  are  going up or down, I would like to  explain

how  the cost of living is measured statistically, what

the  retail price index means, and the basis  on  which

the index is computed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say that prices are going up, it is always

very  easy for anybody to point to particular examples.

The prices of bicycle-tubes, or shoes, or socks may  be

going  up in one week and you say that on the basis  of

this  evidence, prices are going up. On the other hand,

you can point to the prices of other goods which may be

going  down  - rice, or chillies, or blachan,  or  what

have you. So in our type of economy which is based on a

free  market,  prices are always changing  -  some  are

going  up  and some are going down. So how do you  say,

"In  general, prices are going up or prices  are  going

down,  or  prices have remained stable  when  some  are

going  up  and  some  are going  down  and  others  are

remaining stable."? Obviously, there must be some  kind

of  averaging process applied to prices of goods bought

and sold in the market. This is exactly what the retail

price index attempts to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail price index is based on a study of what

people  in  Singapore  actually  bought  in  the   year

nineteen fifty something - I have forgotten the  actual

year.  Some people went out and studied what  some  500

working  class  families  in Singapore  bought  in  one

month. They kept detailed records of what the housewife

spent  every  time she came back from the market.  They

asked  other members of the family, "How much  did  you

spend     on    transport,    education,    cigarettes,

entertainment,

clothing,  and  so  on?" Taking the  total  pattern  of

expenditure   of   these   few  hundred   working-class

families, you then arrive at the relative importance of

different types of consumer goods and

services that enter into a working-class family budget.

Then you can say that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>

food  will come to, say, 45 per cent or 51 per cent  -

and  the  food  items are these: rice, noodles,  this,

that and the other. For each item, you can say that it

comes   to   a   certain  percentage  of   the   total

expenditure.  The  pattern  of  expenditure  of  these

working-class family budgets gives you what is  called

the  weights, that is, how much importance you  attach

to  the different commodities - say if they spend ten.

per  cent of their expenditure on rice, then rice will

occupy one-tenth of the total expenditure, and if  the

price of rice goes up, then it has a weight of ten  as

compared with the total weight of 100. This is the way

we measure the cost of living movements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we get the weights which are based on actual

budget   surveys   of  working  class   families,   we

periodically  send out inspectors  to  take  down  the

prices.  There is a team of price inspectors  attached

to   the  Statistics.  Department,  each  of  whom  is

provided with detailed instructions. They do not  just

find  out whether the price of shoes this week is more

expensive  than that of last week. They are told,  "Go

to  this shop, check this kind of shoes and record its

price  regularly." Different inspectors,  will  go  to

different  shops  to  get  different  types  of  shoes

properly specified, so that we do not have changes  in

prices  which  are  due to, changes  in  quality.  And

similarly  with  the whole range of vegetables,  fish,

and  so  on.  Of  course,  there  are  many  technical

difficulties   of   definition  in  getting   standard

qualities  and so on. But within what is  possible  to

standardise  and what is possible to define,  this  is

the  way  the  cost of living index is formulated  and

kept up to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be asked, "How is it that in Singapore in the

first nine months of this year, the retail price index

has  gone  down by two points, whereas we know  for  a

fact  that in most other countries, the cost of living

has been going up?" If advanced countries like Britain

or  the  richest  country in  the  world,  the  United

States, are taken, it will be found that this year the

retail



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>

price  increases have been of the order of  between  4�

and  6 per cent. That is the measure of inflation  that

is  going  on  in these countries. But in  poorer  coun

tries,  the  situation  is worse.  In  a  large  under-developed  country  like  Brazil  when  they  have   an

increase in prices of 80 per cent a year, they say that

they have done well because the prices had increased by

200  per  cent  the previous year. Take our  neighbour,

Indonesia,  which  has been racked  by  inflation  ever

since  Dr Sukarno thought that economics was a  matter

for book-keepers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case, when the official price index showed a

decline of two points from 113 to 111 points this year,

there  is  a  rational explanation  for  it.  You  will

remember  that last year there was a very big  increase

in  the  price of rice because of a drought in Thailand

and   a   general  shortage  of  rice  from  our  other

traditional source - Burma. The price of rice  shot  up

to  50 cents or more a katty for the best quality.  But

since  then it has gone down. And because rice is  such

an  important  item  in the budget of  a  working-class

family,  this decline in the price of rice has  brought

down  the retail price index. Therefore, when  you  say

that  the prices of shoes and socks have gone up,  they

might  have  gone  up  a little bit.  But  because  the

proportion of money spent on shoes, socks, match-boxes,

or what have you, is so small compared to that spent on

rice, the general fall in the price of rice has brought

about a fall in our retail price index.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the background. Therefore, it is not

necessary,   in   order  to  measure  price   movements

scientifically, to form a Price Committee.  Unless  the

committee  works  according  to  these  principles   of

measuring  prices, we will be constantly arguing  about

whether prices are going up or going down, because they

may  be  collecting prices at different  shops  and  at

different  markets and indeed in respect  of  different

brands or different qualities of products. So I do  not

think that a Price Committee will be more useful



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>

in  giving us information as to movements in the  cost

of living than the official retail price index.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang believes that a Price

Committee  can  prevent increases in prices.  This  is

what  King Canute thought. Governments have  tried  to

control prices and the net result is the emergence  of

black  markets, bribery and corruption.  Where  a  com

mittee  has no statutory powers, I do not see  how  it

can  exert any influence over prices. Mind you, it can

probably  browbeat the grocer around the  corner,  but

that  is not going to help the people. So in order  to

ensure that the cost of living does not go up, we  can

take a number of precautions. The first, of course, is

to  ensure that we run an efficient port. We get  most

of  our consumer goods from abroad, including the bulk

of  our foodstuffs, textiles, and so on. So long as we

have an efficient port, a competitive importing system

and  an  absence of monopolies, we can ensure that  we

buy  the cheapest and the best goods from any part  of

the world.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly for locally produced goods. I will deal

with this subject in some detail later. The Member for

Delta has raised this point also.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point raised by the Member for Sembawang

was  :  what would happen to the old notes  and  coins

after 16th January, 1969? They will no longer be legal

tender.  Anybody who has these coins  had  better  put

them  either  into  the bank or  the  Currency  Board,

because after 16th January, 1969 the bus conductor has

a  right  to say, "I do not want this money." We  have

already  announced to the public to send in their  old

coins  and  old  notes  quickly,  because  after  16th

January,  1969, they will no longer be  legal  tender.

The  public  will be put to a lot of inconvenience  to

get  par  value for these coins and notes.  They  will

not,  of  course,  be utterly worthless,  because  the

value  of  these old notes and coins is guaranteed  by

law. But it would be very inconvenient.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to unemployment, the Member for Sembawang

has suggested opening up arable land, fish ponds and so

on  and  so  forth. The trouble with opening up  arable

land  is that we have only 224 square miles of land  at

low  tide. Where are your vast areas - the new  western

frontiers? I do not see them. In fact, I am  trying  to

persuade   my  colleague,  the  Minister  for  National

Development, to induce our pig farmers to raise pigs in

flatted  concrete structures. This has  been  tried  in

England,  and with such great success that the  British

Ministry  of  Agriculture have banned  this  method  of

raising  pigs  because they say it will knock  out  the

ordinary farmers who raise pigs on the ground  and  not

in concrete structures. This is a very efficient method

of  raising  pigs. I hope I can convince  my  colleague

that  we should do likewise. But so far I have not been

successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang is greatly concerned about

the  gap  between imports and exports. He says that  we

imported  more than we exported, and that there  was  a

deficit in our balance of trade. Of course, there is  a

deficit  in  the  balance of trade. There  has  been  a

deficit  ever  since Sir Stamford Raffles landed  here.

Mind you, each year, for some reason or another, within

a day or two after we have published the twelve months'

trade  figures, Radio Peking will say, "There you  are,

Singapore  is  in  trouble again.  Exports  are  $2,000

million  and  imports are $3,000 million.  There  is  a

deficit  of  $1,000 million. They are going  bankrupt."

And  this has been going on for years. I would ask  the

Member for Sembawang not to worry at all. We are in  no

danger of going bankrupt. What you want is not so  much

a  balance  of trade; that is, the goods you  buy,  the

goods  that are transported from the holds of the  ship

to  the harbours and thence into the shops and godowns,

and  what we export by sea or by air. That is only part

of  what  the economists call the balance of  payments.

Although there is a deficit in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>

the  balance of trade - that is, we import more  than

we  export, and the deficit is very substantial; this

year it will probably be short by $1,000 million - we

make  it up by what we call "invisible exports". They

are, for example, the earnings of tourists, what  the

seamen spend when they are on shore in Singapore, the

British  base  expenditure,  which  unfortunately  is

getting less and less each year, and our earnings  on

shipping,  insurance,  and on  the  general  entrepot

trade. All this makes up the balance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, nobody really knows what our balance of

payments  position is in any given year. I  have  come

across dozens of estimates of balance of payments made

by  the  International Monetary Fund, the World  Bank;

estimates  made  by  our  own  statisticians,  by  the

University of Singapore Economics Department and so on

and so forth. But, quite frankly, I do not believe any

of  them.  At one time those who estimated Singapore's

balance  of payments were very modest. You  will  find

that  one of the biggest items will be what they  call

"E, and O." - Errors and Omissions, and they will  be

running  to  $500 million. But now statisticians  have

presumed  to  be more accurate and this  "E, and  O."

business  seems to be getting smaller and  smaller.  I

wonder  whether that is, in fact, the case. The  proof

of the pudding, as they say, is in the eating. Whether

we  balance our trade or not, the question is  whether

in  the end our external balances go up or go down. In

the  case of Britain, they say all the time that their

assets go down and they have to borrow from people. So

sterling  is in trouble. But in our case,  our  assets

are  going  up year by year and, in fact,  at  a  very

rapid rate. What are we going to do with such sums  of

money  with the international monetary system in  such

an  insecure  situation? It gives  me  many  sleepless

nights  to think of what to do with the $2,000 million

that we have All is well with our imports and exports.

Do not worry about that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has dealt with the cost of

living. I think I probably

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>

answered  her points when I replied to the  Member  for

Sembawang. I do not know whether I have got her  right,

but I had the impression that she was complaining about

merchants making money as a result of devaluation. I do

not  know  why she should complain about other people's

good  fortune.  After  all, some make  profits,  others

suffer losses, and in the end it all evens up. She said

that  after  I  had  said that there  would  not  be  a

painless budget, rumours apparently were quite rife  in

Singapore and people rushed to buy refrigerators,  T.V.

sets and what have you. So what ! She cannot blame  me.

I cannot tell them that there would not be any increase

in  tax  in refrigerators, T.V. sets or shoes  or  what

have  you.  So  if  they  listen  to  rumours  and  act

foolishly, that is their business. I do not think -

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Goh, Madam ,Chan wants to intervene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> On a point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Madam Chan.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for

Finance  was perhaps not quite clear about what  I  was

saying.  Of  course, he could not tell the people  that

taxation would be increased on certain goods. But  what

I  meant  to  say  was that when the  Finance  Minister

announced  that  there would not be a painless  budget,

the merchants had the impression that there might be  a

purchase  tax  on certain goods. They, therefore,  took

advantage  of the situation. Hence, the people  thought

that it would be better to buy such goods earlier.  For

example,  if  a  refrigerator  -cost  $750,  then   the

merchants could sell it for a few dollars more, say, at

$755  or $760, when the original cost should have  been

less. Thus the people had to incur greater expenditure.

But  the  trade  section did not pay any  attention  to

this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sit. I

take  the  point,  but  I am really  working  to  this

position. Instead of having a price committee, I think

what  can be done is to form a consumers' association.

This is rather important, because of the example given

by  the Member for Delta that locally-made matches are

more expensive than imported matches in spite of taxes

levied  on imported matches. What is really needed  in

Singapore  is a consumers' association. It  works  out

this  way.  When you form this consumers' association,

it  can  do  many of the things which the  Member  for

Delta has been suggesting; that is, it can keep an eye

on  local  industries to make sure that  they  produce

goods of the right quality at the right prices, and if

prices in the retail markets are high, then who is  to

blame,  whether it is the retailer, the wholesaler  or

the   manufacturer.  That  is  one  thing  which   the

consumers'  association can do. Also  it  can  get  in

touch  with the Industrial Research Unit and see  that

the  range  of  goods  which  is  being  sent  to  the

Industrial   Research  Unit  for  quality   tests   is

adequate. They can satisfy themselves that the quality

tests themselves conform to acceptable standards.  All

these  things are obviously needed here.  I  hope  the

Member  for  Sembawang and the Member for  Delta  will

take   the   initiative  in  forming  this  consumers'

association.  If  they  want  any  literature  of  how

consumers'  associations of other  countries  operate,

the  Trade Division will be very glad to give them all

the assistance. This is a practical proposal. In Japan

and in the United States, and I suspect in quite a lot

of  other  industrial countries, you  have  consumers'

associations  which  can  be  a  very  powerful  lobby

politically. The Japanese Consumers' Association,  for

instance,  maintains  its  own  laboratory  and  takes

samples  from  shops  and manufacturers,  and  lobbies

M.P.s  from  industrial  areas  to  ensure  that  high

standards  of  quality are maintained in the  industry

and  that reasonable prices are charged in the  retail

markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Joo Chiat made the rather

cheerful suggestion that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>

we  deserve  more  pay. Mind you, speaking  purely  for

myself,  I  could not agree more ! But we are  in  this

political  business.  We have  to  set  an  example  of

dedication,  self-sacrifice to the trade, industry  and

to  the whole country. I am afraid that unless there is

a public clamour to give Ministers more pay, the matter

must rest where it is now.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, are you withdrawing your

<br><br>4.15 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1004*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr. Yeoh Ghim Seng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am under the impression that if a Ministry has

a  legal  problem,  it  will seek  the  advice  of  the

Attorney-General or his legal officers and  that  there

is  no  necessity for each Ministry to retain  its  own

legal consultant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subhead, the Ministry of Finance not only

requires  a  legal consultant, but a very senior  legal

consultant.  This is apparent from the relatively  high

salary allocated for this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>

officer which is more than the Minister's salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be enlightened by the Minister on the duties

of  this legal consultant, and why is it not possible

to utilise the services of the Attorney-General?

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I am not speaking.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, actually the Member for

Anson has a point there. But then we were faced  with

rather  exceptional circumstances which  required  an

exceptional  solution. The, present  incumbent  is  a

legal  authority  of international eminence.  He  was

formerly  our Ambassador in Cairo. Of course,  before

that,   he   was   the  State  Advocate-General.   On

completion of his diplomatic duties, he is available.

Either  he  takes on the job as Professor of  Islamic

Law  in  the University of Cambridge or he  works  in

Singapore. So in order to prevent a brain  drain,  we

have  to create this post and give him a salary which

is  somewhat  larger  than a  Minister's  salary.  Of

course,  there is a lot of work for him to do.  There

is  the  Income Tax Department; the Customs Ordinance

is  being revised; and, of course, the Government  is

now  a  major shareholder in dozens of companies.  In

strict  accordance with the socialist  principles  of

the  People's  Action Party, we are in industry.  Our

companies often need legal advice and there he is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all in all, it is a very good move to create

this post and appoint this gentleman.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> In view of the Minister's

explanation, I beg leave to, withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to speak on the Economic Development

Division.  I  have two points. The first  is  that  the

Economic Development Board has done a good job  in  the

development  of industries. However, I should  like  to

point out that some of the products of these industries

are  not  very good. In fact, their quality  is  rather

poor. If we compare these goods with similar goods from

advanced countries, the difference is quite marked. The

Economic  Development Board, in addition to  developing

industries,  should  also be engaged  in  the  task  of

improving the quality of the products of our industries

so  that they can compare favourably with products from

other  countries.  Or at least the  difference  in  the

quality   should  not  be  so  great.  Otherwise,   our

competitive position in international markets  will  be

very poor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local textile merchants have told me some of

their  problems. They complain of the quota system  and

say that nowadays they can only sell a limited range of

textiles.  They say that the locally-produced  textiles

are  of  very poor quality. Even though they are  cheap

and  are  on display, most of their customers  are  not

willing  to buy them but prefer to buy goods from  Hong

Kong  or  the  Philippines.  Even  textiles  from   the

Philippines are being sold locally. Therefore,  if  the

Economic Development Board is concentrating its efforts

only  on  the establishment of industries and  neglects

the  quality of their products, I feel that this is not

a good sign for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Economic Development

Board  should pay equal attention to helping the  large

enterprises  as  well  as  the small  and  medium-sized

industries  with limited capital. These  industries  do

not  receive much encouragement or help from the E.D.B.

I  hope the Development Bank, which has taken over some

of   the  functions  of  the  E.D.B.,  will  pay  equal

attention  to  large enterprises as well as  small  and

medium-sized enterprises. It should give the small  and

medium-sized enterprises the same help that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>

extended  to  the big enterprises. In this  way,  the

small  and medium-sized enterprises will also  assist

in the industrialisation programme of our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that these two points will be carefully dealt

with.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> I do not think anyone

can  disagree with what the Member for Delta has said

on  what  we should do. On the quality of  goods,  of

course,  we  must ensure that our industries  produce

not  only quality goods but also goods that are cheap

and competitive in the international market. That  is

a basic principle of our industrialisation programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the facts? The facts are that the textile

industry in Singapore produces quality products  that

are so competitive both in the U.S.A. and in the U.K.

markets  that those markets cannot compete  with  us.

They  have  to resort to restrictions. They  have  im

posed  a  quota system as well as putting tariffs  on

our  textiles. The same applies to Canada.  In  fact,

not  long  ago we sent a team to Canada to  negotiate

with  them on the amount of yardage that we can  send

to Canada in any one year. Actually all we ask for is

that  they  open their market to us and  we  will  be

prosperous  in  Singapore. We can compete  very  well

indeed  with other countries. The point is that  they

do not allow our goods to go in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there are various qualities of products. As

the  Member for Delta herself has said, in the shops,

some products are cheaper but their quality is not as

good.  In  Singapore, we have a very  wide  range  of

goods.  Take  your pick. If you like  better  quality

products,  pay  more  for it.  If  you  like  cheaper

quality goods, they are there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the answer perhaps is as suggested by my Minister,

that  we  set up a consumers' association which  could

compare  whether  the quality of  a  particular  brand

selling at so much warrants that price. Or whether the

quality of a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>

cheaper brand is comparable with another brand  at  the

same price or at a lower price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention that in the Economic Development

Board there is the Industrial Research Unit which  does

research  into the quality of goods. It also undertakes

testing. But, of course, such testings are only done at

the    request   of   manufacturers.   The   consumers'

association - the Member for Sembawang has said that he

will  invite the Minister for Finance to be  its  first

president - can request the Industrial Research Unit to

test  the quality of goods and then inform its  members

of the range and quality of goods that are available to

consumers  in  Singapore  and  thereby  safeguard   the

interest of consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second suggestion that the E.D.B.

should encourage small and medium-sized industries  and

not just the big ones, again I agree with her. But that

is  exactly what the E.D.B. is doing. In fact, in order

to  help  small industries, the E.D.B. has set  up  the

Light Industries Services Unit. The main object of this

Unit  is to service light and small industries. It also

finances them provided, of course, they can make out  a

case and show that the projects they are promoting are,

in  fact, beneficial to Singapore and are in accordance

with  the Government's policy of industrialisation  and

providing jobs for its citizens.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave

to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1251.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our civil service is always, by comparison, one

feature in our country of which we can take pride,  but

I think there is always some need for vigilance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>

over  a  possible  relapse into inertia  which  could

arise  when the civil servant begins to restrict  his

ability and interest to the immediate activity of his

post.  I  think that you begin to get this  situation

where  the  civil  servant says to a  member  of  the

public who approaches him with a problem, that he  is

sorry,  it  cannot be done, and it is said  with  the

finality  that  brooks  no further  question.  It  is

certainly  not a desirable situation,  Sir.  What  we

need  is the civil servant who, when approached by  a

member of the public for a problem to be resolved and

finding  that he is unable to resolve it, is able  to

suggest  how  it can be resolved perhaps  in  another

department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve that situation, I feel that,

first of all, the civil servant needs to inject  some

professionalism into his duties and  also  to  extend

his   knowledge  of  the  establishment  beyond   his

immediate activity. I think there is also a need  for

an  inter-departmental  communication  whereby  civil

servants  in the respective departments could  be  as

knowledgeable  of  the definition of  duties  in  the

other  departments  in respect  of  the  other  civil

servants.  Sir,  I wonder to what extent  this  inter

departmental  communication  exists  in  the  service

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is also necessary to see that powers do

not   continue  to  be  vested  with  the  particular

individual at the top in the department so  that  you

will   begin  to  get  the  civil  service   becoming

authoritarian.  I  think there should  be  sufficient

delegation  of  duties  so  that,  to  resort  to   a

colloquialism,  "the  buck is not  passed  upstairs",

which  then makes it difficult for the public to  get

their problems solved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I think it is also opportune for me to

mention  at  this  stage  the unavailability  of  the

Instruction  Manual in the civil service today.  This

book  is  becoming  as  rare as  the  dodo  nowadays.

Perhaps   the   Parliamentary  Secretary   will   say

something about it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Serangoon Gardens has enunciated principles on  which

I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>

cannot  disagree  with  him. He  says  that  our  civil

service  is  efficient.  The  objective  of  the  civil

service  is to serve the public and it should  be  both

civil and helpful. The hon. Member quoted an example of

somebody going to an officer and asking him, "Can  such

and such a thing be done?" and the officer replied,  "I

am  sorry.  It cannot be done." I think it  depends  on

what   the  particular  matter  is.  Sometimes  certain

matters  can be said with finality that they cannot  be

done.  In fact, that is the very idea of the delegation

of  authority that the Member for Serangoon Gardens has

advocated.   He   cannot  really  have  delegation   of

authority and yet be able to say, "The matter cannot be

done.  I will refer it to my superior." Surely that  is

passing the buck which the hon. Member is against.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a matter does not concern that particular

department but another department, it is expected  that

the  civil servant should know about it and be able  to

help the enquirer with the problem. For example, if  an

enquirer, by mistake, enters the Registrar of Citizens'

Office  and  wants to renew his Identity  Card,  it  is

expected  that the civil servant in that office  should

be able to advise the enquirer, "Sorry, this is not the

office to come to. Will you please go next door to  the

National Registration Office? The officer there will be

able  to  help  you."  This is expected  of  the  civil

servants  and  they  are supposed  to  be  helpful  and

courteous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member knows of any particular case in

which  civil  servants are rude or adopt a bureaucratic

attitude,  perhaps  he can give the necessary  details,

preferably to the Parliamentary Secretary in charge  of

the particular Ministry or to the Minister, or even  to

the head of department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of communication between the various

departments, the Government, as far as possible,  tries

to let its left hand know what its right hand is doing.

Normally,   correspondence   is   copied   to   another

department



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>

that has an interest in the matter concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the unavailability of the

Instruction Manual, I can only say that, as far as I am

aware, copies of this manual have been distributed to

all Division I officers as well as those in the

Executive grade for reference in the day-to-day

administration. Sufficient copies have also been

approved for issue to various Ministries and

departments, and regular reviews are also made of the

distribution of the Instruction Manual. Additional

copies of the manual are approved for issue if a need

for them is established.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Parliamentary

Secretary will make a survey, he will certainly  find

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point of this amendment is to seek

information from the Parliamentary Secretary  on  the

schedule   of   operation  of   this   Training   and

Organisation  Division. What is  the  nature  of  its

operation? Does it provide its services to a Ministry

on  an  application by the Ministry? Or has it got  a

schedule  of movements whereby it visits the  various

Ministries  in  rotation? When did  Organisation  and

Methods last visit the Ministry of Education?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Organisation

and  Methods  Branch is responsible for  providing  the

following services:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) conduct general reviews of all government

machinery and departmental organisations;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) undertake detailed studies of specific problems

of   organisation   and  methods  in   Ministries   and

departments;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) review the designs and use of all forms in the

civil service;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) advise on all questions involving office machines

and equipment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) undertake the drafting of administrative

instructions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Branch operates on the basis that its services

are available to all Permanent Secretaries and heads of

departments on request. It offers advice and assistance

and   makes   recommendations,  not   directions,   for

improving  office efficiency. In practice,  this  means

that  if  the head of any office wants advice from  the

Organisation and Methods Branch, he must  ask  for  it.

The  Organisation and Methods Branch will not interfere

with  internal  administration unless it  is  asked  to

help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Organisation and Methods - I shall call it "O.

and  M." in short - recognises that the problems  of  a

small  office  are often as difficult as those  of  the

larger  ones.  Priorities are given  to  an  assignment

where  it  is  felt that "O. and M." can be  of  utmost

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stages of review of an assignment may be, for the

information of Members, briefly stated as follows.  The

"O. and  M." officer first establishes the objects  of

the   organisation  under  review  and   then   obtains

agreement  to terms of reference. He next collects  the

facts  about  the existing organisation and procedures.

He   records  and  analyses  these  facts.   He   draws

conclusions  from his study and tests these conclusions

on the department. Finally he makes his recommendations

on  the remedies to be put into effect to overcome  the

shortcomings which his study has revealed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>4.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last major assignment in the Ministry of

Education  was  a  review  of  the  organisation  and

procedures of the Accounts Branch of the Ministry.  A

report was submitted in August 1965. Follow-up visits

have   been   made  of  this  and  other  assignments

previously  completed for the Ministry of  Education.

The  last  recorded visit to assist the  Minister  in

implementing the "O. and M." recommendations  was  in

September 1966.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above major assignments, "O. and M."

officers  frequently visit the Ministry to advise  on

questions of office machines and equipment as well as

on  forms  design.  The latest  visit  made  in  this

connection was on the 4th of December, 1968.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An "O. and M." officer is at present engaged on an

assignment to review the organisation, procedures and

equipment of the Ministry of Education Registry. This

assignment  commenced on the 8th of  November,  1968,

and fact-finding is still in progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1431.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this subhead refers to the

Political Study Centre for civil servants. It was  set

up  when  the People's Action Party came to  power.  I

understand   that  the  civil  servants  who   receive

training at this centre are mainly Divisions I and  II

officers.  But  Division III officers  have  not  been

asked to attend

courses at this centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, Divisions I and II officers have

fewer opportunities than Division III officers to come

into contact with members of the public. Division  III

officers  are  not only required to  be  courteous  to

members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>

of   the  public  but  they  should  also  be  made  to

understand better the problems confronting the  people.

For  instance, officers employed in the Land Office and

Resettlement Office have to visit certain areas to make

on-the-spot  investigations.  Some  people   who   have

different political ideologies and different levels  of

understanding even call such officers "running dogs -of

the  P.A.P.".  As  a  result,  these  officers  may  be

deterred  from  carrying out their  duties.  They  find

themselves  in  a  dilemma when they are  subjected  to

abuses and they cannot get any redress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Political Study Centre has been established to

provide  study ,courses for civil servants, why  should

not  Division  III officers who come into contact  with

the  public  be  also given a chance  to  attend  these

courses?  They  -are not meant to brainwash  the  civil

servants  but to enable them to understand  better  the

people and local conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine that the Political Study Centre should

teach politics. Some Members of Parliament are not even

known to the people. That is why more stress should  be

placed on the teaching of politics and current affairs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to add something  more  to

what  the  Member for Delta has said. We know that  the

civil  servants are not always wrong. The  Minister  is

always wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various sections in the Ministry of

National  Development which carry  out  their  official

duties  very  harshly. They force people to  move  away

from  their homes. Who is responsible for this?  It  is

the  Minister who is responsible. Ours is a  democratic

country  and  it is no longer under colonial  rule.  If

settlers do not want to move from a site, we should try

persuasion.  We should not chop down their  houses.  We

should  not  send  out  teams of people  to  drive  the

occupiers out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, some civil servants who are sent out to the

rural  areas  steal rambutans. Does the  Minister  know

about this?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>

He certainly does not. If anything is amiss, it is the

responsibility of  the Minister. He should  look  into

the matter and come up with an explanation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan (Crawford):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may

I  take  this  opportunity of asking the Minister  con

cerned  whether,  in  view of  the  new  circumstances

confronting Singapore, he will consider expanding  the

Political  Study  Centre to provide political  courses

for  the  civil servants. I believe that the Political

Study  Centre - as pointed out by the Member for Delta

-  was set up not long after the P.A.P. took over  the

administration  of the State and its  activities  then

were at their peak. I do not see refresher courses for

many  of  the  Division I administrative  officers  in

various   statutory  boards,  apart  from   superscale

officers  and  those  who  assist  directly   in   the

formulation of government policies. They have not been

given  the  opportunity to be informed of and  trained

for  the  changing  circumstances  that  confront  the

Republic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, may I know whether it is the intention of

the  Minister  to provide the Political  Study  Centre

with  more  facilities for the  carrying  out  of  its

duties?

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may refer to

the  allegations made by the Member  for  Ulu  Pandan

against   officials  of  the  Ministry  of   National

Development.  First, may I answer  his  question  and

tell him that, in my view, in the final analysis,  it

is  the Minister who is responsible and not the civil

servants. But my Ministry is not under discussion  as

yet.  I  will  welcome  from him further  information

giving  particulars of rudeness from my officials.  I

cannot  answer general statements in Parliament,  but

if he has specific instances, he can write to me, or,

better,  raise  them  here when the  affairs  of  the

Ministry of National Development will be discussed in

a few days.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will chip in

a  little bit just to dispose of the matter raised by

the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



Ulu  Pandan. He blames the Minister for the  faults  of

civil servants. That is very correct. The Minister must

ultimately    be   responsible   for   his   particular

department.  However,  as  the  Minister  for  Law  and

National  Development has said, unless details  of  the

facts  are given, it is very difficult for him to  deal

with them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also add that it is part of the democratic

system  that  a Member of Parliament should  also  look

after  the people and that if he comes across instances

of  such behaviour by civil servants, like the plucking

of  rambutans  from orchards without the permission  of

the  owners, he should report them. In fact, he is duty

bound  to report such incidents. If he has not reported

them,  he  has  failed  in his  duty  as  a  Member  of

Parliament  and  he  has  not  done  his  duty  to  his

constituents!

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tang, are you prepared to give way?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Finance has  said  just

now  that  I did not make a report of such an incident.

I  am  reporting to Parliament now. This  is  the  best

opportunity so that even Mr Speaker himself

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lee, what the Parliamentary

Secretary  would  like you to do is  to  write  to  the

appropriate Minister and say that on such  and  such  a

day,  at  such and such a time and at such and  such  a

place,  so and so, an employee in that Ministry,  stole

rambutans,  or  whatever else it is. That  is  what  he

means when he says a member must give details and  make

a report.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): That is right, Sir,I

quite understand you. But he said I did not report  and

therefore  I was not doing my duty. But I am  reporting

to Parliament. Am I right?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the

Member for Delta and the Member for Crawford. Owing to

the  limited  time and staff available, the  Political

Study Centre had been concentrating on Divisions I and

II  officers  first where the greatest impact  can  be

made.  Although  it  was  not possible  to  give  such

training  to  Division  III  officers  generally,  the

Political Study Centre did conduct courses of lectures

at  the Police Training School, the Teachers' Training

College  and  the Nurses' Training School.  Where  the

problem was acute, a special course would be arranged,

as in the case of the P.U.B. meter readers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware of the situation that civil

servants  should  understand  and  be  alive  to   the

situation  obtaining in the country.  They  are  given

training  in  the  constitutional  structure  of   the

country  and  in political ideologies  as  opposed  to

party political ideas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the general example quoted by the Member for

Delta  regarding resettlement officers going  down  to

the  rural areas and being scolded as puppets  of  the

P.A.P., the officer concerned should know what  he  is

doing.  We  cannot,  of course,  train  him  in  party

political  ideas.  What we can train  him  in  is  the

general  political  set-up  of  the  country  --   the

constitutional  structure. All civil servants  have  a

knowledge,  or  at least they should  have,  of  their

place  in  the  political set-up. Simply because  they

have  been scolded by somebody in the rural area, they

should  not give up doing what they are there  to  do.

This  is,  of course, a very general sort of  example.

Perhaps  the Member concerned can give particulars  to

the  Minister  for National Development  who  will  no

doubt look into the matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member for Crawford's idea of increasing

facilities  at the Political Study Centre, of  course,

the  Government is always alive to the demands. I have

no  doubt that if the demands justify the extension of

facilities, such extension would be made.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg leave to

abolish two posts of watchmen? The post carries a small

salary. Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for Finance clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the two watchmen's posts were

abolished  as the store at River Valley Road  has  been

closed. The premises have now been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>

taken over by the Economic Development Board. The  two

persons affected have been transferred to the Ministry

of Education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be reduced

by $10 in respect of

subhead 2005*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The same amendment also stood in the name of Madam

Chan Choy Siong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this sum is a subsidy to the Housing and

Development  Board.  I notice that  there  is  half  a

million dollars increase after providing for the first

quarter of 1970. I would have thought that the subsidy

would  have been reduced considerably since new  flats

and  some existing ones have been offered for sale  to

the  public and to existing tenants. I would  like  to

have the Minister's comments on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the standardisation of rentals

paid by Housing Board tenants. The Old Kallang Airport

Housing  Estate  is  in my constituency.  The  Housing

Board   tenants  there  are  paying  three   different

rentals,  and I suppose it is the same with the  other

housing  estates. In the Old Kallang  Airport  Estate,

for  a  one-room flat, the different rentals are  $20,

$25 and $40.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Ng, I do not think it is

quite  fair to expect the Minister for Finance or  his

Parliamentary Secretary to answer questions of  detail

concerning the Housing and Development Board in a vote

for a subsidy under the Head "Ministry of Finance".

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I only want the Minister to

know  so  that  he  can raise this  anomaly  with  the

Housing Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a two-room flat, the rentals are $35, $46.50 and

$60. For a three-room flat, the different rentals  are

$55, $66.50 and $75.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister for Finance can look into this.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, I am not speaking.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the budgeted provision of

$10,333,750 is to cover a 15-month period from  January

1969 to March 1970. The original estimated subsidy  for

1969 was $8.2 million as against $7.8 million for 1968,

which includes some $1.7 million (comprising $1 million

for  designing  and  supervising the  erection  of  new

buildings,  $0.1  million  for  management  of  housing

estates and $0.6 million for loan charges) representing

the  proposed  accelerated  building  programme  to  be

implemented  to  offset the effects of  British  forces

withdrawal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This estimated subsidy was also computed before the

decision  allowing for the use of C.P.F. balances  and

contributions   to  purchase  flats  under   the   home

ownership  scheme and provided for estimated  sales  of

4,000  units of flats in 1969. To date, more than 4,200

C.P.F. contributors have applied to purchase flats with

C.P.F. money  and expected sales for 1969  are  10,000

units  of  flats  - 5,000 new units and 5,000  existing

units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, loans to the Housing and Development

Board  are at 7� per cent interest per annum. But  flat

purchasers  are only charged 6� per cent per  annum  on

loans  taken  to  buy  flats under the  home  ownership

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of subsidy generally, the major

portion  is in respect of one- and two-room  flats  let

for  rent,  whereas flats sold are principally  of  the

three-room  type  as one- and two-room  units  are  not

easily  salable. As long as the level of one- and  two-room  flats let for rent remains as at present - 29,000

one-room  units and 25,000 two-room units -the  subsidy

level will continue. But if the numbers of one- and two-room  units  that are at present rented are  increased,

the subsidy will have to increase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the differential in rentals

raised  by the Member for Mountbatten, it is, as  you

have rightly observed, Mr Speaker, Sir, not a matter

which I am in a position to answer. All I can now say

is that the differential may be due to the difference

between  the improved and the old types of  flats.  I

would   suggest  that  the  Member  for   Mountbatten

approach the Ministry of National Development and  no

doubt  they will look into this matter. This  is  not

passing  the  buck, Sir,If he likes,  I  can  always

enquire for him.

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2102.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is noted that the sum of $10,000 was

estimated  for the losses of public money and  stores

for  1968  and $12,500 is estimated for 1969.  May  I

know from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Finance whether the sum of $10,000 allocated for

this  year  was,  in fact, lost and how  the  sum  of

$12,500 is going to be lost next year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, the provision for losses of

public  money  and stores is for the  writing-off  of

losses   which  are  unavoidable  in  any  government

structure.  The  vote is used for  the  write-off  of

irrecoverables,  advances and  salaries  overpaid  in

cases  of vacation of office, dismissals, etc. It  is

also used for the writing-off of loss of stamps, loss

through  foreign exchange, theft and the like.  Where

the  loss  is  attributed to negligence, the  officer

concerned  is asked to make good the loss  or  he  is

surcharged.  Where the loss cannot be  attributed  to

negligence, as, for instance, where there is a  theft

or  a  small  fire,  it is necessary  for  accounting

purposes  to  write off the loss, and hence  the  provision in this vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson must understand that in a big

government structure,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>

these  incidents  must  occur.  It  is  just  like   an

insurance.  Why  should the Member for  Anson  pay  his

premium against accidents to his car? If he knows  when

an  accident is going to occur, he can easily avoid the

accident.  Then why pay the premium? The same principle

applies  here. Because of the big government structure,

the law

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

The law of averages!

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes, the law of averages, as the

Minister  for Communications said - the law of averages

works. Certain cases are bound to happen because of the

large  number  of transactions that are going  on,  and

this provision is just like a premium for an insurance.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think the best answer is to put the

Member for Anson on the Public Accounts Committee !

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> In view of the Parliamentary

Secretary's   reply,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   the

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be reduced

by $10 in respect of

subhead 3003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know from the Parliamentary

Secretary whether the sum of $375,000 is to be spent on

trade  fairs  and  exhibitions in  Singapore  or  other

countries, and what are the fairs he has in mind.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, a substantial part of the sum

of $375,000 will be spent on fairs overseas. It will be

spent as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the Second Asian International Trade Fair in

Teheran - estimated sum is $200,000; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) other fairs overseas - $150,000.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second Asian International Trade Fair to be held

in Teheran in 1969 would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>

be on the same scale as the First Asian International

Fair  held  in  Bangkok in 1966  in  which  Singapore

participated  and  on  which  a  total  sum  of  over

$140,000   was  spent.  It  is  estimated  that   our

participation  in the Teheran Fair  will  cost  about

$200,000,  considering the additional  transportation

charges and the corresponding increase in expenditure

to  be  incurred  in setting up and  maintaining  the

Singapore  Pavilion  at that fair.  Furthermore,  the

number of Government representatives to the fair will

have  to  be  increased because we do  not  have  any

diplomatic  staff in Teheran, as we have in  Bangkok,

to provide the necessary assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the provision is reserved for other

trade fairs. Plans have not yet been finalised on the

number  and type of fairs in which we will  be  parti

cipating in 1969. Participation in each fair will  be

determined, among other things, by the response  from

local  manufacturers  and  traders  as  well  as  the

benefits   which   might  be   expected   from   such

participation.   For  instance, we   are   currently

considering  invitations to participate in  the  33rd

International  Exhibition Market for  handicraft  pro

ducts  in Florence as well as the Tripoli and  Sydney

Trade Fairs which are

organised on an international scale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As existing industries get organised and get over

that   teething   stage   and  more   export-oriented

industries  go  into  operation, increasing  emphasis

will  have  to  be placed on participation  in  inter

national   trade   fairs.   Participation   in   such

international and specialised trade fairs in 1969  is

being  organised by the Export Promotion Centre  with

the  advice  and  help of the Trade Division  of  the

Ministry  of  Finance. Plans have been  drawn  up  to

encourage local manufacturers to participate actively

in  important  specialised  trade  fairs,  especially

those  in  Eastern  Europe, for example,  the  Moscow

Clothing    Fair.   At   this   juncture    of    our

industrialisation, it is important for the Government

to   encourage   industrialists  and   exporters   to

participate  in trade fairs by meeting  part  of  the

expenses.

the   Ministry  of  Finance  will  play  a  part   in

encouraging  savings to mobilise  what  is  known  as

"domestic  savings" with which we  will  be  able  to

encourage the development of the country. A committee

was  formed composed of members from the Ministry  of

Finance  and  the Post Office Savings Bank.  We  were

also  able  to  secure the services  of  three  other

gentlemen, one of whom is the Member for Havelock and

Mr Tan Teck Chwee and Mr Han Fang Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of this committee's findings, it was

decided,  among other things, to encourage  students

in  our schools to develop the habit of savings.  As

from  next  year, every Secondary I student  who  is

able  to save $5 in his own account will get a  gift

of  $5  from Government. This $5 is the maximum.  Of

course,  if  a Secondary I student has a  well-to-do

parent  and is prepared to put $100 into the  Postal

Savings  Bank, the Government will give him  $5  and

stop  there,  and not $100. We anticipate  that  for

each year there may be as many as 45,000 Secondary I

students. So at the rate of $5 per student,  we  are

quite hopeful that we will probably get 100 per cent

of  Secondary I students putting in $5 each into the

Post Office



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>

Savings  Bank. The Government will then have to provide

a  sum  of $225,000 for one year, and as the Budget  is

for  a  period  of  15  months, the  provision  is  now

$281,250.  But  there is a little catch to  this.  When

Government  gives $5, it does not mean  that  the  very

next  day  the  boy concerned can draw  -out  $10.  The

catch,  Sir,  is that we will freeze this $10  for  the

next five years.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> It is a racket!

<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is not a racket. I think this

is  to teach secondary school children how to save  for

some  time and, of course, that money is being used  by

Government  for development. A pupil can draw  the  $10

out  one  year  after he finishes his Secondary  IV  examination,  or when he leaves school if he  is  a  pre-University II student.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the reason for this provision of $281,250.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, after 5 years how much will

the interest be?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0403 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2307.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a provision of $15,000 for the next

financial  year  in  the form of contributions  to  the

Singapore  Association  for the  Deaf  and  Dumb  which

provides welfare and care for the deaf and dumb people

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worthy to mention that the Association has also

been  running  a  Deaf and Dumb School  in  Mountbatten

Road,  which  is  in my constituency,  for  many,  many

years. I understand the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>

school is only for primary education. These deaf  and

dumb children, if given proper training, can live  as

useful lives as other children. It is regretted  that

they  receive only primary education in  this  school

and  no  facilities are provided for them for further

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime this year I was invited to witness the

first  investiture of deaf cub-scouts  held  by  this

School  for  the  Deaf and Dumb and I  observed  that

these children had done fairly well. The principal of

this  School informed me that the Association  has  a

plan  to  build a school for vocational training  for

deaf  and  dumb children so that they can make  their

own living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I know from the Government whether there is

any  plan  to  provide a plot  of  land  to  build  a

vocational  school for these deaf and dumb  children,

and   also  whether  the  Government  can  contribute

towards  the  cost of building such a  school  to  be

managed by the Association for the Deaf and Dumb?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Association for the Deaf and Dumb is  given

an  annual grant of $12,000 in order to carry out its

objectives,   namely,  to  provide  educational   and

welfare  services for the deaf and dumb. Besides  the

monetary  grant of $12,000 given to the  Association,

the  Government also pays the personal emoluments  of

the  following staff who are seconded to the  schools

using oral and signs methods:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Nine qualified teachers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Five instructors; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) One Assistant instructor.

<br><br>The  gross monthly salaries of these personnel amount

to approximately $85,000 a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 100 pupils in the Oral School and another

hundred  in the Sign School. These pupils are divided

into  18 classes ranging from preparatory classes  to

Primary VI.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>6.00 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is admitted that the setting up of a vocational

wing  in  the  school will help the deaf  and  dumb  to

become  useful  citizens. At present,  the  school  has

allocated  a small class-room for training in carpentry

work.  Expansion of its vocational activities has  been

limited  because  of absence of space. The  Association

had,  as  early  as 1967, submitted an  application  to

Government for a lease of land of approximately  50,000

square   feet  adjacent  to  its  school  premises   in

Mountbatten  Road  for  the  purpose  of   building   a

Vocational Training Centre and Workshop. Since there is

a  scarcity of land in Singapore, particularly  in  the

Mountbatten  Road area, the Ministry  has  advised  the

Association that it would not be possible to  recommend

its application for such a large piece of land and that

to  cater  for the vocational training of the deaf  and

dumb,  it should look into the possibility of expanding

the existing school upwards instead of constructing new

buildings  on additional land. If such upward expansion

could not be feasible, the Association was also advised

to consider other alternatives such as:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Operating its school in two sessions, as is done

in Government schools, thereby freeing a section of the

school for vocational training; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Renting suitable premises elsewhere; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Scaling down its land requirements to

approximately  10,000 square feet, which is  considered

sufficient  for a three-storey building with dimensions

of approximately 160 feet long and 30 feet wide.

<br><br>The   Association   has  been  so  informed   of   the

alternatives, and detailed proposals by the Association

are  awaited before a recommendation is made for 10,000

square feet of land adjacent to the existing school  to

be leased for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>

building the Vocational Training Centre and Workshop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to funds for building the Vocational

Training  Centre  and Workshop, it is understood  that

the  Association has already raised about $250,004 for

its  building  fund. It is considered  that  this  sum

would  be  adequate for the building of the Vocational

Training  Centre and Workshop on the land leased  from

the   Government.  Since  the  Government  is  already

providing financial assistance to the Association., by

way  of  $12,000 as an annual grant, and approximately

$84,000  a  year to meet the salaries of the  teaching

staff'  in both the Oral and Sign Schools run  by  the

Association,  it  will  be difficult  to  justify  any

further  increases  in  financial  assistance  to  the

Association.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I regret to, hear that no further

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2314.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead concerns "Contributions to Sports

Organisations".  The purpose of this amendment  is  to

seek  from the Minister information on how this amount

will  be  apportioned among the sports bodies, whether

there is a basis of apportionment as such, and whether

this  basis takes into consideration factors like  the

mass  following of the sports and the fact  that  some

sports  bring  in a certain amount of revenue  to  the

Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, contributions

to  sports  organisations are normally made  only  for

those  bodies which take part in the Pesta Sukan.  For

those  sports organisations which have invited foreign

competitors, the contributions given to them are based

on   the   cost   of  accommodation  of  the   foreign

competitors during the period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>

of  the Pesta Sukan. Over the last three years, $25,000

has  been  allotted each year as grants to the  various

voluntary  sports organisations. The grants range  from

$3,500 to $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to such grants to sports organisations

participating  in the Pesta Sukan, sports organisations

which   go   abroad  to  take  part  in   international

competitions  are  given  one-quarter  of   the   total

expenses subject to a maximum of $1,500 in each case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grants are also made to the Singapore Olympic Sports

Council when Singapore sends out its national teams  to

participate  at international games. In  1966,  at  the

Commonwealth Games at Kingston, $50,000 was given as  a

grant to the S.O.S.C. For the Asian and Ganefo Games at

Bangkok  and Phnom Penh in the same year, $100,000  was

given  as  a  grant  to  the Singapore  Olympic  Sports

Council and the Singapore Sports Council. For the  1967

Seap  Games at Bangkok, a sum of $73,000 was  given  to

the  S.O.S.C. and for the 1968 Olympic Games at Mexico,

$14,000 was given as a grant to the S.O.S.C.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to meet these grants to the S.O.S.C. to

enable   our   national  team   to   compete   at   the

international   games  mentioned  above,   the   Sports

Division  of this Ministry had to raise these funds  by

way  of  appeals  for  donations  from  the  commercial

sector,  charity film premiers, donation draws, variety

shows, dances and other fund-raising events.

In  1966, a sum of $250,000 was raised and in 1967  the

sum  raised was $203,000. This year, a sum of  $113,000

has been collected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Republic of Singapore is now

better known to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>

world  since  its independence. The increase  in  this

vote is obviously due to more active participation  in

international    organisations'    activities.     The

information  that  I  wish  to  seek  is,   to   which

respective  international  organisations  the  sum  so

provided in this vote will be paid, and the respective

amounts?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister for Finance has the answers,

though  the  expenditure  will  be  incurred  for  the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Mount

batten  was rather concerned about the expenditure  to

be incurred under subhead 2651 of Head 0403 because we

are  now an independent state. The truth is that  some

of  the expenditure has been recurring over many years

in  the  past,  long before we became a separate  inde

pendent  state, before we were in Malaysia,  and  even

before  we  were a self-governing state. I think  some

items date from the days of British rule. However,  it

is  true  - as the Member said - that since we  became

independent  there  has  been  an  increase   in   our

contributions to international organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members can see, the contributions are made

in  respect of our international obligations - I think

that  is a technical cliche used to get away with this

expenditure - and in the majority of cases,  the  work

of these international bodies, I can assure the Member

for  Mountbatten, has been of benefit to our  Republic

either  directly  or indirectly.  I  was  hoping,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that he would not ask me to list out all

of  them - there are 17 of them. And he also asked  me

for  the  respective amounts of the  contributions  we

have made. Since he has already asked the questions, I

cannot run away from them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we contribute $30,000 annually to the

International Civil Aviation Organisation, $25,000  to

the   International  Atomic  Energy   Commission   and

$215,000  to the Regular Budget of the United Nations,

$7,000 to the World



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>

Meteorological  Organisation,  $6,000  to  the   United

Nations  Relief  Works Agency, $55,000  to  the  United

Nations  Educational, Scientific  and  Cultural  Organi

sation  (better known as UNESCO), $98,000 to the  World

Health  Organisation, $215,000 to  the  United  Nations

Regular  Budget  and  Working  Capital  Fund.  For  the

information of the Member for Mountbatten, may  I  also

state  that under this head of $215,000 which  goes  to

the  United Nations Regular Budget and Working  Capital

Fund,  a  small amount of money comes back annually  in

the  way  of return air passages for five delegates  to

the  General  Assembly of the United Nations  to  which

you,  Mr Speaker, Sir, once went as a delegate  and  I

myself  recently  attended.  The  eighth  international

organisation  on which we are obligated to  spend  some

money  is  the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative

Organisation.  We pay $15,000 for that.  We  contribute

$5,000  to  the  International Customs  Tariff  Bureau,

$5,000   to   the  Commonwealth  Scientific  Committee,

$255,000  to the United Nations Development  Programme,

$8,000  to  the Permanent Southeast Asian Ministers  of

Education  Secretariat,  $60,000  to  the  Commonwealth

Foundation,  only  $500 to the Asian  Highway  Project,

$10,500  to the United Nations Emergency Force (Special

Account), $20,000 to the Economic Commission  for  Asia

and  the Far East (better known as ECAFE). Lastly,  the

seventeenth  international  organisation  to  which  we

contribute is the United Nations Peace-Keeping Force in

Cyprus, including the Refugee Relief Fund in the Middle

East, particularly territories occupied by Israel,  and

other   ad   hoc   payments  -   $35,000.   All   these

contributions amount to $850,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further $212,500 has been provided for, being, of

course,  the  25 per cent of the total of $850,000  to

take  into account the new fiscal year which will  run

from  the 1st of January, 1969, to the 31st of  March,

1970.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to the extremely poor conditions under

which  customers at Government-run toddy shops drink

their toddy. Sir, I am not a customer myself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Who knows!

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> But anyone driving along Dunearn

Road  can  see from the road what the conditions  at

the  Government-run toddy shop there are  like.  The

premises are old and in poor condition. The roof has

a  zinc extension and under this, the customers  sit

on  long  benches which have no back rest. The  area

has  no  walls  and the customers have  no  privacy.

These  are  conditions which the colonial Government

had  considered to be suitable for Indian labourers.

These conditions need to be improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today as we pass the Government toddy shops,

we  can  see many non-Indian customers. The Ministry

must  improve conditions for all customers at  these

Government toddy shops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore now exports canned toddy. If a tourist

visiting  Singapore wants to try fresh toddy,  where

can  he go? Toddy is an all-Singapore drink.  It  is

revenue-producing.  As  it  produces  revenue,   why

cannot  some  of  it  be  used  not  only  for   the

maintenance  of  toddy  shops  but  also   for   the

improvement  and  innovation of the  shops  and  the

provision of better facilities?

shops?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> If the shops are made more

respectable  and comfortable, they might  also  attract

middle-class customers. All this will also  benefit  my

constituency, which is Changi, where many coconut trees

are grown.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

has  provided  sufficient  benches  for  the  drinkers'

comfort. There are also toilet facilities for them.  If

the customers do not prefer the benches, they can drink

while  standing  or  move  about  in  the  open  spaces

provided for them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> That is primitive!

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Food-stalls are also available at

each toddy shop for their drinking pleasure. So far the

system  seems  to  be  working  satisfactorily  and  no

specific   requests   have  been   received   for   any

improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the question of attracting tourists is

concerned, I think the Member is barking up  the  wrong

tree.  Mr Speaker, Sir, tourists do not go for  toddy.

In any case, there is canned toddy. If tourists do want

to  visit  a toddy shop, possibly they might  like  the

atmosphere. To them it may be quaint. That may  be  the

attraction. If you improve it and make it look like  an

ordinary coffee shop or an ordinary cafe, it may cease

to be an attraction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0406 be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a well-known fact that with

the  rapid development of Singapore, land values have

tended  to  increase  over the past  few  years.  The

question  is whether our Property Tax Department  has

done  anything to revalue properties to  reflect  the

increased value of landed properties. To my  mind,  a

periodic  revaluation by the Property Tax  Department

is  logical,  so  that taxes on  properties  will  be

realistic and not be based on values which no  longer

apply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another criticism I have to level

at  the  Property  Tax Department is the  considerable

delay  it takes to assess the values of properties  of

new  housing estates. It may take as long  as  two  or

three years. When the assessment is finally made,  the

property owner may sometimes be required to pay two or

three years' assessments in one lump sum. Besides  the

hardship  this would cause to the property owner,  the

delay in the collection of property tax may result  in

a loss of Government revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the delay in assessing property values in new

housing  estates and the failure to revalue properties

to reflect the current land values may be due to

a lack of sufficient technical staff in the Property

Tax Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the 1968 Estimates under Head

0406,  subheads  1101  to  1133,  there  are  only  58

technical  staff  in the Property Tax Department,  and

the  question arises whether this complement of  staff

is adequate to carry out the technical duties. Sir, it

is  my view that if the technical staff of valuers and

assessment officers of the Property Tax Department  is

increased,  it  will  not  only  result  in   speedier

assessment of property values, leading thereby to  the

quicker collection of property tax, but also allow

for  a  periodic  revaluation of  landed  properties,

leading to increased Government revenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again I find it difficult to believe that all

people who are liable to income tax actually pay tax.

I  would  like the Inland Revenue Department to  make

every  effort to see that all those who earn  taxable

incomes pay income tax.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>

It is no use saying, "Give us the information," because

I just do not know what a person's income is. But every

body knows that hawkers and stallholders and others who

are  operating on a big scale make a lot of money. Take

pirate   taxi  operators,  for  instance.  When   their

vehicles  are confiscated, they buy back their vehicles

and  go into business again. Surely they cannot do this

unless  they  earn  $500 or $600 a  month.  As  another

example,  take  the case of the big food-stall  owners.

They  look  prosperous.  If you  watch  them  at  their

stalls, you can see that they do a roaring trade. As  I

say,  I cannot give information on individuals.  I  can

only   speak   from   general  impressions.   But   the

Commissioner  of Inland Revenue has the  power  and  he

must  exercise it. Sir, I would like the Minister's  or

the  Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that all  this

is  being done and that everyone who is liable  to  tax

actually pays tax.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I would like to underline the

observations of the Member for Changi in respect of the

artificial  valuation of premises which  still  obtains

these days. In my constituency, the number of about 800

service lettings has been reduced to about 150, leaving

house   owners  the  choice  of  either  selling  their

property  or  renting  it  out  at  competitive  rates.

However much they would like to rent out their premises

to  "locals" at competitive rates, they would find that

it  would be a losing proposition on their part because

of the artificially high

valuation which still obtains today in respect of their

premises. If a genuine reassessment of valuation  could

be  made  and the proper level of value of the premises

obtained, then I think we would get proper rentals  and

the   local   inhabitants  would  benefit   from   this

situation.

assessment 1965 was approximately 73,000.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>6.29 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page 49 of the Annual Report refers. This may be

compared with the 65,000 taxpayers mentioned in  page

43.  This 65,000 is the number of resident individual

taxpayers  for the year 1964. If I may make  a  rough

projection  from these figures to 1967,  counting  an

annual  increase of 8,000 or so, we get a  figure  of

about 90,000 individual resident income taxpayers.

<br><br>6.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Year Book of Statistics for 1967, at page

12,  the estimated population figure in Singapore for

people  between  the ages of 20 and 49  for  1967  is

670,000.  Let us deduct from this figure  the  figure

for 1967 for workmen, clerks, industrial clerks, shop

assistants,  namely, 213,700. I got this figure  from

the  Year Book of Statistics for 1967. Deducting this

213,700  from 670,000, we get the figure of  456,300.

From this figure, let us further deduct 72,350, being

the  number  of persons registered as at the  end  of

1967 on the Employment Exchange. We get a balance  of

about 384,000 people. Making a further allowance  for

half  of  this number to be females, we get a balance

of  192.000.  There seems to me to be  a  discrepancy

between  this figure of 192,000 and 90,000 people  as

my  projected number of people who had to pay  income

tax  for 1967. Possibly I stand to be advised on this

matter.  The basis of my arithmetic may have  certain

shortcomings. But even if further deductions have  to

be  made,  an impression is created in my  mind  that

there  may  be  large numbers of  people  who  escape

paying  income tax although they would  belong  to  a

category  of people who would be eligible to  pay  if

their income could be assessed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that this impression is substantiated by the

thought  in  the  minds  of the  people  in  Singapore,

including  the Member for Changi. People in  Singapore,

foreign personnel as well as our own people, think that

that is, in fact, the case, namely, that people who may

be eligible for income tax do not square up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has commented, if my

recollection  is correct, that the figure of  $500,000,

which  will accrue from the 5 per cent levy  on  P.U.B.

consumers whose bills are between $10 and $20,  is  not

to  be  sneezed  at.  Presumably, a similar  or  larger

figure,  if  it  could  be collected  from  people  who

currently  do  not  pay income tax  but  who  would  be

eligible  to pay if their income could be assessed,  is

not to be sneezed at either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also advised Government departments which are operating on a so to speak stand still budget to develop self-help procedures, if I may

describe  them  as  such, to earn more  money  for  the

departments.  May  I  suggest,  Sir,  that  the  Inland

Revenue Department follow this excellent advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good income tax collector may be worth his

weight in gold to the Republic.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Hear, hear!

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I shall first deal with the

question  of property tax as raised by the Members  for

Changi and Serangoon Gardens. A study is being made  in

the Ministry with a view to revising and rationalising,

as  I said the other day, the annual values as well  as

the rates of property tax. At present, the Property Tax

Department  is  grossly  understaffed,  and  when   the

necessary  recruitment  is  done,  things  should   get

better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as income tax is concerned, it is agreed that

all  persons who earn sufficient money to be liable  to

income  tax  should  pay tax. Under  the  Ordinance,  a

person  liable  to income tax charges  is  required  to

submit  a return of his income. This procedure  applies

whether the person involved is a hawker or a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>

pirate  taxi-driver. If there is information  reaching

the  Income  Tax  Department  that  such  persons  are

evading tax or are liable to tax, the normal procedure

of calling them to submit the information is followed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, does the member want me to

clarify  what  I  have spoken?  I  am  coming  to  his

question. Anyway, I am prepared to give way.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, what I meant was that perhaps

the onus of finding out who are evading the payment of

income  tax in the way I described should  be  on  the

Commissioner of Inland Revenue.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, a person who, in the opinion

of  the  Commissioner of Inland Revenue, is liable  to

tax  will be sent a form and he has got to fill it  up

accordingly. Even if he does not earn any  income,  he

has  got to make a nil return. And then, according  to

the  return, if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has

information that he has, in fact, got income which  is

taxable,  he will be called on to pay the tax.  If  he

tries to evade, he will be charged in court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I will not be able to dispute the

figures quoted by the Member for Katong. I do not know

how  he  arrived at the projection of 90,000  persons.

Perhaps  he  should  look at the definition  of  these

figures.   It  could  be  that  they  mean  individual

residents, then people who are partners in  a  trading

firm  or  if  they are sole proprietors, perhaps  they

would  not be included. I am not quite sure because  I

am  not  conversant with the figures. But I will  look

into them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the Member should bear in mind that our

tax  rates  are such that unless a person, who  has  a

wife  and two children, earns more than $500 a  month,

he  will not be liable to tax. If that is the case, he

will  not  be included in the figures the  Member  has

just  quoted. In fact, it is quite dangerous  to  base

one's calculations simply on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>

the  population figure and then refer to the report for

1965  and make one's own projections. Anybody can  make

his own projections. He projects it to 90,000 and I can

project it to 120,000. He would not be able to say that

my projection is wrong and that his is right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I did

mention  when I spoke just now that the projection  was

based on the fact that the difference between the  1964

and 1965 totals for resident individuals paying tax was

8,000.  It  is  not  a question of anybody  making  any

projection  at  all. I did say that  the  basis  of  my

arithmetic  may  have  certain  shortcomings.  But  the

impression - and this is what I am trying to  establish

- is that there are people who would be eligible to pay

income   tax  but  who  do  not  pay  it,  unless   the

Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to come out and say

categorically that there is no such class of people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I think I would be very foolhardy

to  make  such a statement, Sir. However fine the  net,

some will definitely escape.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also draw the Member for Katong's attention to

the fact that 1965 was immediately after the ending  of

confrontation.  So  the projection of  an  increase  of

8,000  persons  a  year may not be  right  because  the

economy was buoyant for the years 1966, 1967 and  1968.

Surely  we  are dealing with very technical matters.  I

think  we  might  as well wait for the  latest  report.

However, if the Member for Katong would like to discuss

this  matter further, I am quite prepared. As  I  said,

Sir, it is quite impossible for me at the moment to say

whether  his  figures are right or wrong.  I  can  only

throw  some  light on the basis of how the figures  are

arrived  at, and also to say that not every able-bodied

person  in Singapore has got to pay income tax even  if

he  is  employed. Because of our Government's socialist

principles, we do not tax those who cannot bear it. The

tax net does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>

pull in anybody with an income lower than $500 with two

children and a wife to support.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Sir, I was just a little bit

surprised to hear the Member for Changi saying that the

Property Tax Department is rather slow in assessing new

houses. From personal experience, I think I have got to

come  to  the defence of the Department. I  have  moved

into a new house and, within two months, the assessment

papers came, even before the certificate of fitness was

received.  For one year now, I have been  living  in  a

house and paying property tax without a certificate  of

fitness. I do not think the Property Tax Department are

slow.  I think they are very alert. I am speaking  from

personal  experience. But the experience of the  Member

may be different.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, he is a Member of Parliament.

Not  only  that,  Sir,  he is also  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the Minister for Labour!  That  is  the

reason why the Department pulled up their socks in his

case!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not satisfied with the answer given by the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Finance.

He  agreed that the Property Tax Department is  under-staffed. Then why not do something about it?  We  need

money for defence. We are imposing a levy on

P.U.B. bills.  Why  not speed up  the  valuation  and

revaluation of properties so that we can collect  more

revenue?

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>6.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Parliamentary Secretary says,

"Wait   for  information."  Who  is  going   to   give

information if the Commissioner of Inland Revenue does

not   want  to  send  his  men  around  to  look   for

information?  I  am  not going to tell  how  much  the

Member for Anson is earning because I do not know.  It

is  the duty of the Commissioner to do something about

it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0406 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the Inland Revenue Department to have four

legal  officers in addition to a senior  legal  officer

makes  it  a branch of the Attorney-General's Chambers.

May  I be enlightened by the Minister on the duties  of

these four legal officers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as usual,

Members of Parliament would like to have their cake and

eat  it  too. I was hoping that the Member  for  Changi

would rise and say something on this amendment but,  of

course,  he  conveniently keeps quiet. The  Member  for

Changi  criticises us for not recruiting staff for  the

Department  of Inland Revenue and says that the  people

who  should  pay tax were not taxed. We are,  in  fact,

recruiting  staff. The posts of two legal officers  for

the  Inland  Revenue Department have been increased  to

four  and  the  Member  for  Anson  criticises  us  for

increasing the number of posts. I think there is also a

further amendment by the Member for Anson querying  the

increase in the number of posts of Assistant Examiners.

So  they  must make up their minds what they  want  the

Government to do. They cannot have their cake  and  eat

it too.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I do not have the same idea as the

Member  for  Anson  has.  The  Parliamentary  Secretary

should not make a mistake.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to answer the

Member  for Anson, the work load relating to the  legal

aspects  of  taxation has increased  very  considerably

over  the year. More sophisticated legislation has been

introduced,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>

particularly  the  provisions  for  incentives.   The

amount  of  litigation has also increased. There  are

more  instances  where counsel are  employed  by  the

taxpayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Records in the department show that the increase in

revenue   arising  from  the  utilisation  of   legal

officers concentrating on income tax and property tax

matters,  is  a  handsome  reward  compared  to   the

additional  emoluments  involved.  This   should   he

comfortable news to the Member for Changi.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Attorney-General's Chambers provide

general legal advice, it is desirable to have a legal

officer   in   certain   departments   where   highly

specialised and technical interpretations of the  law

are required. Sir, you will agree that the income tax

law is a very technical and specialised branch of the

law  and, therefore, the increase of these two  posts

is necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0406 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1045.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an increase of 41 Assistant Examiners over

the  present establishment of 87. This is an increase

of  about  50  per cent. Why is there such  a  sudden

increase in staff in one year? In the light

of the Government's tightening up of expenditure, may

1  know  from  the  Minister why it is  necessary  to

increase

the complement of Assistant Examiners by such a large

number?  Furthermore, is there  an  increase  in  the

income proportionate to the increase in expenditure?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the work load

has  increased  so much that it is considered  short-sighted  to  economise on the  staff  of  the  Inland

Revenue  Department. The work of this department  has

increased  since it took on these responsibilities  -

the provision of economic incentives legislation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>

the amendments to the Income Tax Act and the increasing

number of double-taxation agreements. All these add  to

the  complexities of the administration of  the  Income

Tax  Act.  The requirements of the department  had  not

been adequate earlier on, and after a thorough study it

was  decided  that, having regard to the needs  of  the

department, it was essential to increase the number  of

staff.   Further   increases  may   be   necessary   as

requirements change.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0406 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns the over-taxation of properties in

the  rural  areas. The Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Finance told us just now  that  the  Gov

ernment  practises socialism, that is, the rich  people

should  pay  more  tax and the poor people  should  pay

less  tax.  The  officials of the department  concerned

should understand this principle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the rural areas have complained to me

that  the taxes they pay to the Government are far  too

high.  Let me quote an example. A house with four rooms

is assessed at $1,000 a year and 16 per cent of this is

$160.  So  the owner has to pay more than $10  monthly.

Compare  this rate of assessment with that of a  three-room Housing and Development Board flat, which is about

$13  to  $14  per month. I think the officials  in  the

department  have not been very careful  when  assessing

the  values  of these houses in the rural  areas.  They

merely   make  arbitrary  assessments.  As  a   result,

inconvenience is caused to the people who have  to  run

around  looking  for  Members of  Parliament  to  write

letters  for  them  requesting for a reduction  in  the

assessment. Some of these requests were acceded to, but

only after repeated attempts had been made. I hope  the

officials in the department will understand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>

the  principle  of  taxation of our  Government.  When

dealing  with  poor  people in the rural  areas,  they

should be more considerate and understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided that the owner of an attap house has

to  pay $6 a year, but some of these attap houses have

crumbling roofs and walls due to old age and therefore

in   need  of  repairs  and  renovations.  But   after

renovation  these  houses were no  longer  treated  as

attap  houses. The officials would treat them as plank

or  wooden houses. This is not reasonable because when

a  house  is in a dilapidated condition it has  to  be

repaired. Without repairs how can people go on  living

in dilapidated attap houses?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the annual

value  of a property is based upon the rental that  it

can   let   out  for  a  year.  This  is  a  statutory

requirement. However, in the assessment of  properties

in   the  rural  areas,  the  values  are,  in   fact,

considerably  lower than those of the same  properties

in  the  city area. Besides, the people in  the  rural

area pay a lower rate of assessment than those in  the

city  area.  On this score, I do not think the  Member

for Sembawang can complain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of concessionary rates for attap

houses,   the   rate  of  $6  is  still  granted,   on

application,  to  owner-occupiers of  dwelling  houses

made  of wood and attap. If the roof of a house  needs

replacement  because  of wear  and  tear,  the  owner-occupier should bear in mind to replace it with  attap

instead of zinc. If he decides to renovate it and make

extensions  to the house, as is normally done  in  the

rural  areas, how can he complain when an official  of

the  Property  Tax Department reassesses the  property

and   raises  the  annual  value?  In  this  case  the

character of the property is changed and it can be let

out at a higher rental than before.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am not satisfied with the explanation given by  the

Parliamentary   Secretary.  I   have   received   many

complaints regarding this matter from the people. They

have gone through



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>

stresses  and  strains  caused  by  the  officials  and

something  should  be done about it.  The  people  have

spent  a  lot  of money and time trying to  remedy  the

situation caused by the officials' bad handling of  the

matter.  They  have gone through a lot  of  unnecessary

trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that it is fair and reasonable to continue to

charge  a  rate  of $6 a year after repairs  have  been

carried out to attap houses, but I think the Government

should  follow the principle by carrying out  the  job.

However,  although I have said I am not satisfied  with

the  explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary, I  beg

leave to withdraw the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr P.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may the Minister enlighten me on the kind of

services  being rendered or expected to be rendered  by

the Malaysian Government?

<br><br>7.00 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is for

services  rendered  by  the  Malaysian  Government   in

connection with the collection of income tax due to the

Singapore  Government by persons or companies  resident

in  Malaysia prior to the 1st of January, 1966. This is

in  respect of cases which have not been finalised  and

which  are  still  under investigation  or  study.  The

separate assessment of tax was effected as from the 1st

of January, 1966.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a reciprocal arrangement with the Malaysian

Government  and  it has worked out satisfactorily.  So

far,  the  sum for such services paid by the Malaysian

Government  to the Singapore Government  has  exceeded

the  sum  paid  by  the Singapore  Government  to  the

Malaysian  Government, except in 1968. It is expected,

however,  that  this year the sum to be  paid  to  the

Malaysian  Government may exceed the sum that  we  can

get  in return. The sum in excess cannot be accurately

assessed  at  the moment. Hence the provision  of  the

token vote of $10.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the evasion of income tax is not uncommon in

every  country. Efforts have been carried out by every

government  to  track down tax-dodgers.  Our  Republic

cannot be an exception in this respect. It is now  the

opportune time for our Government to set up the  Anti-Evasion  Unit by tapping the knowledge of  U.S.A. tax

experts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this particular moment, when our country is facing

economic  problems of a magnitude  not  known  in  the

history  of Singapore, we must endeavour to seek  ways

and  means  not only to counter the economic recession

as  a result of the British withdrawal from Singapore,

but  also  to  encourage and promote greater  economic

growth   in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors.

Therefore, in the public sector, the Government  needs

large  sums of money for public redevelopment as  well

as for building up the defence capability. Hence it is

only  natural for our entrepreneurs, as loyal citizens

of  our  country, to shoulder their burden by honestly

paying  their  taxes which are due to the  Government,

while  they enjoy prosperity and live in safety  here.

It is to be borne in mind that we are not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>

a recipient country of any financial aid from any donor

country. We always stand on our own feet and our future

will  depend on our own efforts. Therefore,  we  cannot

afford  to  overlook  the  possibility  of  a  minority

indulging  in  tax  evasion. I need not  emphasise  the

necessity  of setting up the Anti-Evasion  Unit  within

the Income Tax Division to track down unscrupulous tax-dodgers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you may perhaps agree with me that

during  the  colonial and semi-colonial  periods,  many

people  indulged in illegal business transactions  such

as  smuggling, perpetrating frauds, gambling and  other

forms of commercial crime, and they became rich in such

rackets. The profits arising there- from could hardly be

accounted  for  by the Income Tax Department.  In  this

manner,  a  lot  of  money must have  been  accumulated

inside  and  outside  our  Republic  by  these  people.

Naturally, they do not dare come out with their  hidden

capital  for  investment for fear that action  will  be

taken  against them, apart from queries from the Income

Tax  Department  as  to the sources of  their  invested

income.  This accumulation of hidden capital  must  run

well  into  hundreds of millions of  dollars.  Some  of

these  people may sincerely want to start  off  with  a

clean  state and invest their money in honest business.

Every endeavour must be made to attract this idle money

to come out from underground for useful investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, is it possible for the Government

to  work out some solution whereby this enormous sum of

under

ground capital can come out into the open without  fear

and  prejudice? If this is possible, I am sure it  will

tremendously help the economic growth of the  Republic,

otherwise this hidden money will remain idle or it will

even  be sneaked out from the Republic. The stolen hens

must  be  allowed to come out openly to lay eggs  which

can  be  shared between the Government and the  owners.

These  eggs  may,  in time to come, produce  more  hens

which in turn will produce more eggs. In other words,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>

if  the  hidden  capital can be  utilised  in  honest

investments, the Government and the owners will enjoy

a  profitable  partnership. I am sure that  our  able

Minister  for  Finance, who is an eminent  economist,

will  be shrewd enough to work out a scheme to tackle

this  problem,  if  he  considers  that  now  is  the

appropriate time to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, this is not the first

time that this subject has been raised in Parliament.

In  the  Committee  of  Supply on  the  Estimates  of

Expenditure  in  this House last year,  the  Minister

promised  to give consideration to this matter.  This

House may be interested to hear his comments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this year's

Budget  under  the Income Tax Division,  there  is  a

provision of $500,000 to set up an Anti-Evasion Unit.

I  would  like to know whether the Minister can  give

any  indication of the amount of income tax  that  is

being evaded annually. At a time when our Republic is

in  need  of  every cent for defence expenditure  and

social services, it is most appropriate that the Anti

-Evasion  Unit be set up to collect every  source  of

revenue that is due to the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that this sum of $500,000 would be more

usefully spent on the employment of staff to  prevent

tax  evasion and to streamline income tax  collection

than  to wait for persons to evade tax and then bring

them to book.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> As in other countries, it is felt

that  there  are members of the public who attempt  to

evade   paying  income  tax  by  not  making  a   full

disclosure  of their sources of income.  It  is  felt,

however, that every effort should be made to plug  the

loopholes  in the law to prevent tax evasion  wherever

possible  rather than to raise the tax rates in  order

to  increase  the total revenue. Hence an Anti-Evasion

Unit  with advanced methods of investigation to detect

tax  evasion is being set up. This should serve  as  a

warning to tax-dodgers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary to the

whether  we  can  work  out a solution  whereby  hidden

capital can be attracted to come out for investment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> The Government is not considering

the  offer  of  an  amnesty to tax-dodgers.  The  whole

purpose of setting up the Anti-Evasion Unit is to catch

tax-dodgers, that the tax which they had evaded  should

be  extracted  from them and that they  be  brought  to

book.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head

0406 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3042.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister why it is necessary to

increase   the  expenditure  in  connection  with   the

temporary staff in the Property Tax Division  by  about

200 per cent? Furthermore, what is the normal period of

service  of these temporary officers? Are they selected

by  the Public Service Commission or by the head of the

department?  If  it  is necessary,  permanent  officers

ought to be recruited into the service.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this sum of

$155,530  is  for  two  valuers  on  contract  and  ten

clerical assistants. There is a shortage of valuers  in

Singapore,  because, under present-day conditions,  the

private sector is extremely attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member for Changi on the question of

property tax earlier on, I said we were short of staff.

We  must recruit additional staff so that annual values

can  be  revised and the rates of property tax  can  be

rationalised. The intention is to obtain  such  valuers

on  contract, either locally or from overseas. The  ten

clerical assistants have been provided for to assist in

speeding   up  the  numbering  of  houses   and   their

valuation. The officers are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>

appointed from lists submitted by the Public  Service

Commission.   Provision  has  also  been   made   for

additional posts that will be required to  clear  the

arrears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the short-term requirements for

additional  staff,  it  is  considered  desirable  to

utilise temporary staff. When the requirement becomes

permanent,  consideration  will  be  given   to   the

creation of permanent posts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $35,630 provided in this vote for the next

financial   year  is  for  payments  to  the   Postal

Department  for services rendered to the Imports  and

Exports  Office  of  the  Trade  Division.  Will  the

Minister for Finance please inform this House of  the

nature  of  the payments and the reason  for  such  a

tremendous increase which, after taking into  account

the provision for the first quarter of 1970, is about

three times that of the 1968 Estimates?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, payments of

fees on documents to be processed and approved by the

Imports and Exports Office can be made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>

either  by  Singapore  postage stamps  or  by  franking

machine impressions. These methods of payment are  more

convenient  for the trading community than the  payment

of cash for each document to be processed. Such methods

of payment not only save the Imports and Exports Office

the  work connected with cash handling, receipt issuing

and  other  related  work, but  also  result  in  fewer

procedures  in processing the documents.  However,  the

work of the Postal Department will be increased in that

it  has  to take care of the postage stamp requirements

of   the   trading  community  for  import  and  export

purposes, and it has to reconcile the accounts it keeps

for  each user of the franking machine with the records

of  the  Imports and Exports Office. For all  the  non-postal   work  involved,  the  Postal  Department   is,

therefore,  paid a commission of one per  cent  of  the

total amount collected by these methods.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1968 new fees of $10 were introduced for (1)

import  licences, and (2) urgent processing of  permits

and  licences.  Also  the fees  for  declarations  were

increased  from  $1 to $2. Both these new  and  revised

fees   will   result  in  increased  collections.   The

collection  estimated  for 1969  by  these  methods  is

$2,850,000.  Therefore,  the  commission   payable   is

$28,500.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0409 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 3002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a sum set aside for the next financial

year for a population census. I would like to ask  the

Parliamentary  Secretary to the Minister  for  Finance

when and how this population census will be taken, and

whether  Members  of  Parliament and  members  of  the

Citizens' Consultative Committees will be involved  in

this exercise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, briefly, the

provision  under the subhead for population census  is

to provide funds for the planning and preparatory work

for  the main census of population scheduled for  June

1970.  A  Census  Unit has been established  and  work

relating to the preparation of the census will have to

be  carried out in 1969. This involves the preparation

of  census  schedules,  manuals  of  instructions  and

training  programmes,  detailed  programmes  of  field

operations,   tabulation  schemes  as  well   as   the

preparation  of field maps for census enumeration.  In

addition,  a  trial census will also be undertaken  by

about the middle of 1969.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds are mainly required for the recruitment of

office and field staff, programmers and draftsmen, and

for  the  expenses  relating to the purchase  of  some

office  equipment,  stationery and materials  required

for mapping work and other incidental expenses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation of the census is a large undertaking.

It is estimated that about 3,000 field enumerators and

supervisory  staff will be needed  to  carry  out  the

field  operation.  As the census involves  enumerating

every single person in the Republic, its success  will

depend  on  the  full co-operation of members  of  the

public  as  well  as  the various public  and  private

organisations  and  institutions.  The  assistance  of

Members   of  Parliament,  members  of  the  Citizens'

Consultative Committees, business and other  community

leaders  will  be  requested. Full publicity  will  be

given to the census operations in due course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0501 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the estimates of expenditure for the years 1967

and  1968,  one  could know at a glance  what  we  were

paying   our   hard-working   Ambassadors   and    High

Commissioners. For the estimates of expenditure for the

financial year 1969 and the first quarter of 1970,  the

salaries for the five Ambassadors, Grade 111, have been

lumped  together in one sum. Why must the salaries  for

these  Ambassadors be grouped together? Is it  to  hide

any  disparity in the salary scheme for the Ambassadors

who   are  all  Grade  III?  Is  this  to  prevent  any

embarrassment among the Grade III Ambassadors, as  this

must  have  been  done  when we see  the  estimates  of

expenditure for the financial year 1968? One Grade  III

Ambassador  was stated to draw a salary of $27,240  per

annum as compared to the rest of the Ambassadors, Grade

III,  who were drawing $20,040 per annum each. I  would

like the Minister to clarify this point for me, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that

the  Member for Joo Chiat has given me this opportunity

to  raise  a point which I think is quite important.  I

was  told  during the debate yesterday that the  salary

scales  for Ambassadors, High Commissioners,  etc, are

related to the whole salary structure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>

in  the  public service. But today, during the debate

on  the amendment on the vote allocated to the  legal

adviser in the ministry of Finance, we were told that

we  need to pay for talent, and that we need  to  pay

for  brains.  Will the Minister for  Foreign  Affairs

adopt  a similar attitude in the attempt to get  good

men  for our Missions abroad? For instance, we should

get people who can perform the same type of duties as

our  representative  in Indonesia.  His  performances

were  praised in this House yesterday. In the attempt

to  attract  the  best brains into this  service,  we

should  increase the salary scales and allowances  of

our Ambassadors and other representatives overseas.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

raised by the Member for Joo Chiat regarding what  he

termed  a "disparity" in the salaries of Ambassadors,

Grade  III, serving the Foreign Ministry is not quite

correct.  For  technical  reasons,  all  Ambassadors,

Grade 111, belong to the same category. But there  is

such  a  thing, as you know, Mr Speaker, as salaries

which are personal to the holders. For those reasons,

depending  on  the  importance and  location  of  the

missions, the salaries of Ambassadors vary. In  order

to attract suitable persons to become Ambassadors and

High  Commissioners from outside the career  service,

persons  have  often to be paid  more  than  what  is

provided  for  in the Estimates. We  must  take  into

account  the  emoluments they were then receiving  on

the  day  of  their appointment. In the case  of  one

Ambassador,  he  was  already drawing  a  substantive

salary of $2,000, and this is the basic salary  which

he  still  draws as Ambassador. This is  what  I  was

referring to when I say "salary personal to  holder",

even  though  the  basic  salary  for  a  Grade   III

Ambassador  as provided for in the Estimates  is,  in

the majority of cases, $1,670.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I recollect during the debate in

Committee  of Supply last December on the Estimates  of

Expenditure for 1968, the Minister for Foreign  Affairs

indicated that a number of trade representatives  would

be  sent to our Singapore overseas missions. It is  now

observed  that in the estimates for the next  financial

year,  there are provisions for one post of  Counsellor

(Commercial)  and  three  posts  of  First  Secretaries

(Commercial).  In going through the detailed  estimates

of   expenditure  for  various  overseas  missions,   I

discovered  that  only one Counsellor (Commercial)  and

one  First  Secretary  (Commercial)  are  provided   in

London and Washington respectively.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs

kindly  enlighten  the  House  on  when  and  in  which

overseas  mission  the  two remaining  posts  of  First

Secretaries   (Commercial)  will  be  filled?   It   is

surprising  to  note that in our overseas  missions  in

cities  like  Tokyo, Hong Kong and Jakarta  with  which

our  Republic  has  close trade  relations,  there  are

still  no  Counsellor (Commercial) or First Secretaries

(Commercial).

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have no

Counsellor  (Commercial)  in  Washington.  Perhaps  the

representative   there   comes   under   the   Economic

Development  Board.  There is an  Investment  Promotion

Officer but not a Counsellor (Commercial) in New York.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I

notice  that under subhead 1059, there is one  post  of

Counsellor  (Commercial) and under subhead 1061,  there

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Sir, if the Member for Mountbatten

was  referring to the Washington post, the short answer

is  that  this post has not been filled.  There  is  no

holder  of  this post. But if he was referring  to  the

post  in  London, I can explain why there has  been  an

increase. I would like to know which particular post he

was referring to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, in cities like Tokyo, Hong

Kong  and  Jakarta, trade officers or First Secretaries

(Commercial)   are  not  assigned  to  these   overseas

missions.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Sir, coming back to the particular

post which the Member mentioned under subhead 1059,  it

is actually in respect of the emoluments of one post of

Counsellor (Commercial) and does not include the  three

First   Secretaries  (Commercial)  that  he   mentioned

earlier.  The  post  of Counsellor (Commercial)  is  to

replace   the   post   of  a  locally-recruited   Trade

Commissioner   in  our  London  High  Commission.   The

contract  of the present incumbent is due to expire  in

June next year. It is intended to post a suitable home-based  officer,  that means an officer  recruited  from

Singapore,  to  London to replace the locally-recruited

Trade Commissioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post has been down-graded from Grade E to

Counsellor,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  grade   of

Principal  Assistant Secretary in the  scale  $1,300-40-$1,420.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.

Why  should  the post be down-graded just  because  the

appointee is recruited from Singapore?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Sir, that is a very intelligent

question.  As  the  hon.  Member  for  Mountbatten  has

pointed  out, there is an increase in the  salary,  and

yet I have mentioned that the post has been down-graded

and  apparently the salary is less. The incumbent,  who

is  the present Trade Commissioner in London and is not

home-based - he was recruited in London - receives  all

kinds  of  other  allowances.  Whereas  the  home-based

Counsellor who will be appointed in his place next year

will, of course, be entitled to overseas cost of living

allowance, overseas allowances for wife, children, etc.

That  is  why  in the Estimates it is reflected  as  an

increase, but

the basic salary is lower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that explanation satisfies both the Members for

Joo Chiat and Mountbatten.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Sir, I am still not satisfied with

the  explanation on the lower basic salary of the home-based officer.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member

for  Joo  Chiat is never satisfied with many things.  I

hope  his  dissatisfaction is limited to matters  which

transpire in this august Chamber and to mundane matters

like  the  Budget  Estimates and so on.  But  in  other

matters, I am sure he is satisfied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his information, the consular activities of home-based officers actually have been absorbed by the High

Commission  Chancery  officers.  In  other  words,  the

duties of the present incumbent will now be shared with

other   officers   in  the  chancery        the   First

Secretary,  the  Second Secretary or  whoever  will  be

there  to share the duties. For that and other reasons,

the salary has been lowered.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Low

Yong Nguan.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a newly independent country. We do

not  have  natural resources, but we have  managed  to

survive and live in peace and order as a result of the

talents  of  our people who have worked  towards  this

end.  At the same time, we can be proud of our  secure

economic base and of the non-aligned foreign policy we

pursue.  As  a result of this policy, our country  has

managed   to   escape  involvement  in   international

conflicts. We can say that this is a very wise  policy

of our Government. If we can continue with it, I think

the future of Singapore will be bright.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are certain problems which remain with

us.  I wish to mention a few. One of them is that  the

countries surrounding Singapore are still in  a  state

of  turbulence and restlessness. Singapore is a member

of ASEAN. There is a problem in ASEAN which gives rise

to  instability. I would like to ask the  Minister  of

State for Foreign Affairs what the present position of

ASEAN  is.  Does  he  think that  ASEAN  will  produce

concrete results? As a matter of ASEAN, what sort of a

future do we have?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everybody knows, we are faced with the problem of

increased  expenditure  on  defence  and  this  is   a

considerable sum. The economic problem facing us is  a

big  one.  As  a result of the Minister for  Finance's

efforts,  we  have  managed to  escape  from  economic

depression. The expenditure on defence is not  limited

to  what we are spending this year or next year.  What

happens  after  next year? We will  probably  have  to

spend  much more on defence with the build-up  of  the

armed  forces. In the circumstances, I would  like  to

know whether our foreign policy of non- alignment will

be affected by our commitments on defence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.45 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is this. In the 1967 Budget we

approved  the establishment of diplomatic  missions  in

Johore Bahru and Rangoon. However, up to now, we  still

do  not  have any commercial representatives in  Johore

Bahru  and Rangoon. What are we going to do about  this

next year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other place is Cambodia. According to last year's

Budget,  we  were to have an Ambassador  there  but  we

still  do  not  have one yet. Who is going  to  be  the

Ambassador  in Cambodia? I would like the Minister  for

Foreign Affairs to give me a reply.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is

generally agreed that Southeast Asia is, and has always

been, beset with trouble, confusion and conflicts. Sir,

the  throe big powers are pushing ahead with  plans  to

exert  their influence, if not domination in  Southeast

Asia.  Japan, being the third world ranking  industrial

power,  a position which it has not previously  enjoyed

throughout  her  history,  will  inevitably,  with  its

achievements  during recent years, push ahead  too  and

exert  her economic influence in this region also.  She

may  exert  her domination in the economic  field  over

those states which are in a helpless position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, Sir, in our own estimate, if the

Vietnam  war  should come to an end,  we  will  face  a

nation which has a well-trained and battle-tested  army

with  the  best military equipment. There is no  single

member nation of ASEAN which can match this nation. Let

it be known then to those member nations of ASEAN which

may have any ulterior motive or even doubts about ASEAN

that  the  political power shifts are changing  rapidly

and  that  there are many combinations and permutations

of power association to reckon with. Faced with such  a

possible situation, the logical conclusion obviously is

an approach to regionalism. I am glad to say that Singa

pore  has  recognised this as an inevitable process  in

this part of the world.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the logic of regionalism cannot and should not

be doubted. In spite of all our difficulties, can  I

have  a  clear and straightforward undertaking  from

the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs that it will do its

level  best to promote this logical development  and

play  an active role in formulating a closer  inter-state  relationship  between the  member  states  of

ASEAN?  The  members of ASEAN should not  allow  the

history of Europe -which took two centuries of  wars

of  tragedies to make them realise the inevitability

of  regionalism-to be repeated in this part  of  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on which I seek clarification from

the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is whether there  is

a better definition of what the Minister for Foreign

Affairs has so repeatedly and unfailingly said about

our  non-aligned foreign policy. Sir, can I have  an

undertaking  that  this policy should  not  give  an

assurance to any country or any power bloc  that  we

will  remain defiant to the inevitable changes  that

are taking place in Asia? Rather, that it should  be

a  flexible and adaptable foreign policy  that  will

not  commit the generation that comes after us to  a

difficult

position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that we have committed ourselves to

the  defence of democracy does not carry with it the

right for us to jeopardise our succeeding generation

to  tolerate  or  even to co-exist with  enemies  of

democracy  if  the  need arises. Readiness  to  defy

overwhelming  changes and the facts of  life  is  an

invitation to domination, whether military, economic

or otherwise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Member for Crawford has said just now that our

foreign policy has always been one of nonalignment.

Our  Minister  for  Foreign Affairs  has  announced

publicly that we do not want to be included in  any

power

bloc. But my view is different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our boat is now on the high seas and if we do not

follow a fixed course going by the compass, we  may

run  into  rocks and sink. I hope that our  foreign

policy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>

will  continue to be based upon the principle  of  non-alignment. In this way we will avoid many troubles.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must apologise

for  not being as attentive as I should have been  when

the  Member  for Mountbatten raised his question  under

subhead  1061, but I thought I heard him ask a question

on  subhead  1059 only. Actually I have the answer  for

that one and, with your permission, Sir, may I complete

it and satisfy the Member for Mountbatten?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, as a matter of fact, I do not

like to press further, but if the Minister of State for

Foreign  Affairs  would like to give an  answer,  I  am

happy to hear it.

<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Sir, in respect of the emoluments

of  the  three posts of First Secretaries (Commercial),

they  are  actually for the Embassy in Washington,  not

only   in   Washington   as  earlier   stated-one   for

Washington,  two for the High Commission  in  Canberra,

Australia, and the Embassy in Cairo. They are in  three

different places, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post in Washington has already been created this

year by an Establishment Warrant and a suitable officer

from  a  commercial firm was appointed.  The  posts  in

Canberra  and Cairo are new. The former is  to  promote

trade  with  Australia and the latter to promote  trade

with  the  Middle  East  and Africa.  The  question  of

suitable trade and commercial representation abroad  is

currently   under   discussion   with   the    Economic

Development Division of the Ministry of Finance and the

International Trading Corporation to achieve the widest

and   most   apt  representation  without   unnecessary

duplication and overlap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the comments made by

the  Members for Delta and Crawford. They have  touched

upon  matters of policy pertaining to the  Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs.  The  Member  for  Delta  was  rather

anxious to know about ASEAN. Perhaps she is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>

understandably worried about the dispute between  the

Philippines  and Malaysia. I do not know  if  she  is

worried that ASEAN will not work because of that  one

little  dispute.  As  I said yesterday,  we  have  no

illusions whatsoever about regionalism. We  have  com

mitted  ourselves,  firstly, to  the  philosophy  and

policy of regionalism. We believe in it sincerely and

wholeheartedly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When ASEAN came about, we made a policy decision to

join it and we are in it. I also said that the little

difficulty  between the Philippines and  Malaysia  is

not  going  to  shake our belief in  regionalism  and

interdependence  between states  in  Southeast  Asia.

ASEAN is only one year old and it has not yet brought

direct  benefit  to its members. How  could  it?  The

European  Economic Community is almost 20  years  old

and  yet it is having difficulties from certain  coun

tries in Europe.
