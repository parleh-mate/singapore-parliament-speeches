following  Bills were assented to by the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara on the 26th October, 1960 :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Interpretation and General Clauses (Amendment No. 2) Bill;

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE'S ROLE IN UNITED NATIONS INTERNATIONAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CHILDREN'S FUND PROGRAMME</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  (i)  what  benefits does Singapore  derive

from  the  United Nations International  Children's

Fund programme: (ii) what part does Government play

in  carrying out the UNICEF programme in Singapore;

and   (iii)  how  does  Singapore  match   UNICEF's

contribution.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to

reply to the question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The United Nations International Children's

Fund programme has supplied Singapore with skimmed

milk  and other nourishment for distribution  to

children in welfare institutions, hospitals  and

schools. The value of milk supplied in 1960 will be

about $96,000. In 1960, an order has been placed

for  the  free supply of about $9,000  worth  of

medical equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The distribution of milk and other

nourishment   supplied   by   U.N.I.C.E.F. is

undertaken by the Director of Social Welfare  in

conjunction  with  the Ministry  of  Health  and

voluntary welfare organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) This Government contributes $20,000

annually to the fund.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I ask

a supplementary question?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member should be a bit more

rapid in rising. Yes, a supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder

if  the hon. Member can tell us whether the milk is

being put to proper use?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make

myself  clear?  I  asked that  question  because  I

happen  to know that the milk supplied has  such  a

very strong flavour that school children never like

to   take  it.  I  happen  to  know  this  from  my

experience as a school principal. I know  that  the

school  children throw it into the drain.  Much  of

the  milk  finds its way into the drain instead  of

benefiting the children. I wonder whether the  hon.

Member  is aware that that is happening. I  have  a

lot  of trouble making the school children take  it

and I have to -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member stops at

the  question  whether the Parliamentary  Secretary

knows the habits of school children in this matter,

I  think perhaps she will be in order. Mr Low  Por

Tuck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> I am not aware of it.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE FROM UNITED NATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>F.A.O., W.H.O. AND T.A.A.</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance how much assistance does Singapore get from

the    United   Nations   Food   and   Agricultural

Organisation,   World   Health   Organisation   and

Technical Assistance Administration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply to the

question:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The assistance from the United Nations

Food  and  Agricultural  Organisation  has  been

limited   in   the  main  to   the   supply   of

publications,   bulletins  and  information   on

assistance  on  livestock, plant quarantine  and

on  fisheries.  In  1958, a  Veterinary  Officer

attended   an  Agricultural  Extension   Seminar

organised by the Organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The World Health Organisation has for a number

of  years  supplied specialist staff  under  its

regular   programme  and  Technical   Assistance

Programme.  These staff have helped  in  nursing

education, the preparation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



of  modern  hospital  records  systems  and  the

establishment  of  an  island-wide   domiciliary

midwifery  service. The estimated  cost  of  the

Organisation's      expenditure      on      the

aforementioned  programme  in  1960  amounts  to U.S. $76,896.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Organisation has awarded a

number    of    fellowships    for    advanced

specialised  training. In 1960, an  award  was

given for a Public Health Tutor Course in  the

United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The United Nations Technical Assistance

Administration in 1960 supplied an iron and steel

expert on a 2½ months assignment to make initial

investigations  to consider the  feasibility  of

establishing a steel industry in the State. Since

October,  there has been a seven-man  Industrial

Survey Team provided by the U.N.T.A.A. to assess

the State's potential for industrial expansion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>REINTRODUCTION OF WOMEN'S CHARTER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and  Law when will the Women's  Charter  be

reintroduced  in this Assembly and the  reason  for

the delay in reintroducing it.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Labour and Law)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker. Sir, it has been necessary to consider

carefully   the  evidence  given  to   the   Select

Committee on the former Women's Charter Bill. There

have   been  conferences  and  consultations   with

women's organisations and other interested persons.

As  a result, several improvements will be included

in  the  new  Bill. The Bill will be  re-introduced

into  the  Legislative  Assembly  as  soon  as  the

amendments have been incorporated in the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

Minister  inform the House as to when  the  Women's

Charter will be re-introduced into this Assembly?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): As I said

Just flow, this matter is being looked into by the

Ministry, and when finalised, the amendments will

be incorporated into the Bill. Therefore it is not

wise for me at this juncture to give a definite

date for the re-introduction of this Bill into the

Legislative Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>(Request for Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr C. H. Koh</b> asked the Minister for Culture

whether  any guidance is exercised, either directly

or  indirectly,  by  the Government  in  regard  to

articles   published   in   the   newspapers   with

particular   reference  to  reports   of   Assembly

Debates,  and  if he will make a statement  on  the

matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government  answers enquiries  from  the  Press  to

ascertain  the  correctness or otherwise  of  facts

connected with Government matters. It also  enlists

the cooperation of the Press in giving publicity to

important   aspects  of  Government   policy,   for

example, family planning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to reports of Assembly debates, the

newspapers  guide themselves in this matter  giving

what  prominence they think fit to the speeches  of

Government Members or of the Member for Joo Chiat.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does enlisting

the co-operation of the Press include the asking of

letters  from the Nanyang Siang Pau, Sin  Chew  Jit

Poh, Utusan Melayu and the Straits Times as to what

they will print and what they will not print?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As far as I know, we have had no

occasion  to  ask any of these newspapers  to  send

letters to us.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Really!

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Home Affairs how many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



accidents have taken place at the junction of

Haig Road and Dunman Road from January to October,

1960, inclusive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there were

six  accidents  at the junction of  Haig  Road  and

Dunman  Road  between 1st January, 1960,  and  31st

October,  1960. Of these, one was fatal,  two  were

serious, and three were slight accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Very serious!

<div align="center"><b>ERECTION OF "HALT" SIGN AND NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS AT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CORNER OF STILL ROAD AND JOO CHIAT PLACE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs (i) when was the "Halt" sign  at  the

corner  of Still Road and Joo Chiat Place  put  up;

and

(ii)  how  many accidents occurred at  this  corner

during the 10 months before and the 10 months after

the sign was put up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the "Halt"

sign  at  the junction of Still Road and Joo  Chiat

Place was put up in March 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the ten months before the "Halt" sign was

erected,  there  were three accidents - all  of  them

classified  as slight ones. During the  ten  months

after  the "Halt" sign was erected, there was  only

one slight accident.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I wonder

whether  the  Minister is aware that  there  was  a

request  from the public to the Police asking  them

whether they would put up a "Halt" sign at the Haig

Road   junction  where  there  had  been  so   many

accidents.  There were six accidents  there  during

the   specified  period  as  compared  with   three

accidents  that took place at Joo Chiat Place,  and

one  accident that took place after the "Halt" sign

was put up. This request was refused as it had been

said  that that was not necessary. I wonder whether

the  Minister  will look into it, seeing  that  the

figures show that there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



has  been  a  reduction in the number of  accidents

after the "Halt" sign was

put up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

certain   the   Police  can   handle   this   minor

administrative matter.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a letter

has  been  sent  to  the Police pointing  out  that

school  children cross the roads and that accidents

involving  school children have taken  place.  Does

the   Minister  consider  this  to   be   a   minor

administrative matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure

the  Police  are the best people to judge  in  this

matter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The answer is that the Minister will

not look into it. Mr C. H. Koh.

<div align="center"><b>(Government policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr C. H. Koh</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs what policy is adopted by the Government in

the  matter  of granting a permit for the  printing

and  publishing of a newspaper, and  what  are  the

conditions endorsed by him on such permits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the policy

at  present  followed  under the  Printing  Presses

Ordinance  is to grant permits in all  cases,  save

when  it  is considered that a publication will  be

used  for  the  publication of  material  which  is

undesirable or which contravenes generally accepted

standards  of  decency and morality or  to  promote

alien  loyalties among the people of  Singapore  or

for    subversive   purposes.   The   bona   fides,

competency,  sense of responsibility and  financial

position  of each applicant for a permit  are  also

taken into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conditions* which are

endorsed  on such permits are too long for me to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Appendix I, cols. 881-2.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



read  out, and, with your permission, Sir, I  shall

have them circulated in the Official Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of conditions handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C. H. Koh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may the Hon, the

Minister  for  Home Affairs inform  us  whether  he

considers  anti-P.A.P. articles to  be  undesirable

articles?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a matter of opinion. Mr C.

H. Koh, Question 8.

<div align="center"><b>PERMITS FOR SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF NEWSPAPERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr C. H. Koh</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs what policy is adopted by the Government in

the  matter  of granting permits for the  sale  and

distribution   of   newspapers  published   outside

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, permits for

the  publication, sale or distribution in Singapore

of   newspapers   printed  or  published   in   the

Federation of Malaya are governed by the provisions

of  section  7A of the Printing Presses  Ordinance,

whilst the importation, sale or circulation of  any

publication printed or published abroad, other than

in  the Federation of Malaya, are controlled by the

Undesirable Publications Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of such permits under the Printing

Presses  Ordinance  is guided by  the  same  policy

which  I  have  enunciated in  the  answer  to  the

previous question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the Undesirable Publications Ordinance

in  respect of non-Federation of Malaya importation

is  also  guided  by the same policy,  except  that

consideration of the bona fides and so forth of the

printers and publishers, not being Malayan persons,

is not necessary.

<div align="center"><b>"MALAYAN EXPRESS" - APPLICATIONS FOR PERMIT FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SALE AND DISTRIBUTION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Koh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr C. H. Koh</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs whether the first application for a  permit

for  the sale and distribution in Singapore of  the

Malayan  Express,  published in  Kuala  Lumpur  was

refused, what were the grounds for the refusal, and

whether the second application was allowed  and  on

what grounds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first

application  for  the  sale  and  distribution   in

Singapore of the Malayan Express was refused on the

grounds  that  the  applicant was  the  editor  and

publisher  of the "Saturday Post" which was  banned

by the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Saturday Post had published

irresponsible   articles  and  stories - not   merely

critical  articles - was admitted  by  the  applicant

himself  in  a letter to the Minister for  Culture.

The    applicant   expressed   regrets   over   the

publication of such articles and assured  that,  as

publisher  and  editor of the Malayan  Express,  he

would see to it that he would not exceed the bounds

of legitimate and responsible journalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was made clear to the applicant that the

Government was not concerned with whether the paper

was   critical   of   or  well   disposed   towards

Government,  but  that it was  concerned  with  the

accuracy and responsibility with which articles and

stories were presented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this assurance by the applicant, the second

application  was  approved. However,  I  understand

that the Malayan Express has ceased publication  of

its own accord.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first nor the last occasion when

the Member for Joo Chiat has espoused lost causes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I remind Ministers that

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1st

January  to  October  1960,  204  applications  for

and    permits   issued,   56   are   still   under

consideration,  six  have  been  withdrawn  by  the

applicants, and seven had been refused. The reasons

for refusal are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) three cases in which the publishers, or

editors, or both, were found not to be  proper

persons to be granted permits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) three cases in which the publishers, or

editors,  or  both, were found incompetent  to

produce newspapers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) one case in which the newspaper is the

publication  of  a  society  which  has   been

dissolved  under section 17 of  the  Societies

Ordinance.

receipt  of the question, two Chinese reporters  of

the  Tiger Press of Kuala Lumpur have been released

from  detention  under the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reporter made a full disclosure of his

activities and gave the assurance that his previous

prejudicial  conduct will not be repeated.  He  was

released on 27th October, 1960, unconditionally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reporter gave an assurance to the

Advisory   Committee   that  "he   would   publicly

dissociate    himself   from   all   pro-Kuomintang

activities   and  that  his  previous   prejudicial

conduct  will not be repeated." He was released  on

refrain  from  all  activities of a  pro-Kuomintang

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, I have been

informed by the Housing and Development Board that,

in  accordance  with  an agreement  made  with  the

Labour  Union, the Board's labourers are not called

out  for sweeping and collection of rubbish in  the

housing estates on Sundays. The hon. Member  is  no

doubt   aware  that  section  41  of   the   Labour

Ordinance, 1955, provides that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...in any week there shall be a rest day, which

shall  be Sunday or any other day as may be   agreed

by the employer and workman.'



<br><br>Labourers  are  called out for work on  any  public

holiday  falling on a Saturday or Monday, in  order

to avoid accumulation of rubbish in the Estates for

more than one day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been assured by the Board that no health

hazards are likely to arise from this practice,  as

the  housing  estates are well spaced out  and  the

rubbish  bins provided have been specially made  to

keep  two days' refuse. In the circumstances, I  do

not  consider that any action is called for in this

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara in respect of the  Criminal

Law (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment No. 2) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Certificate is in order. Are

typed  copies of the Bill available for the use  of

Members?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill handed in to the Clerk

and distributed to hon. Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this short Bill seeks to amend section 49A

of   the   Criminal   Law  (Temporary   Provisions)

Ordinance,  1955,  by empowering  the  Minister  to

direct  that a person, placed under the supervision

of   the   Police  under  the  provisions  of   the

Ordinance, shall not be permitted to enter any area

specified in the Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions)

Amendment  Bill was moved in August  1959,  it  was

intended  that  power  should  be  granted  to  the

Minister  to direct that a supervisee shall  remain

within  doors  and to prohibit the supervisee  from

visiting specified areas which have been the  scene

of  his past criminal activities. When the law  was

passed, the power of the Minister to direct that  a

supervisee shall remain within such area as may  be

specified in a Supervision Order was interpreted to

mean  that a person under Supervision Order can  be

prohibited from visiting any area specified in  the

Order.  In  an  appeal against the acquittal  of  a

supervisee for breaking this condition, it was held

by  the  High  Court that the power  to  confine  a

person on a Supervision Order to a particular  area

does  not  entitle  the  Minister  to  impose   the

condition that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



he shall not visit the area specified in the Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Government's campaign against secret

societies, it has been found that such a  provision

in  the  Criminal Law has been effective in curbing

secret  society  activities. The continued  use  of

this condition is therefore very desirable in order

to  prevent persons placed under Supervision Orders

from  visiting areas which have been the  scene  of

their  past secret society activities. The Criminal

Law  (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance is  therefore

being  amended to make this condition  intra  vires

the law. This condition is used judiciously and  is

applied  mainly  to those secret society  gangsters

who,  although they do not live or work in  certain

streets  or  areas,  have been concentrating  their

activities  or  exerting their  evil  influence  in

those streets or areas. These streets or areas have

been  well  rid  of the presence  of  these  social

parasites. This amendment to the law, Sir,  follows

a  similar  provision  in the Prevention  of  Crime

Ordinance, 1959, of the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the help of the powers granted under

the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance,

1955,  the  Government has dealt telling  blows  on

secret society activities and is getting on top  of

the  situation. The secret society  menace  is  now

being  dealt with under a two-pronged strategy.  On

the   one  hand,  thugs  and  gangsters  are  being

continually  kept on the run, while  on  the  other

hand those under detention are now being channelled

through the educative and rehabilitative process of

the   Pulau   Senang  scheme.  The   Pulau   Senang

experiment  has gone off to a good  start  and  its

present  progress  gives  cause  for  hope  in  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the proposed amendment to the

Undesirable Publications Ordinance (Cap. 124) is to

close   loopholes   which   purveyors   of   yellow

literature and other undesirable publications  have

taken  advantage  of. The Undesirable  Publications

Ordinance  is one of Government's main  weapons  in

its   fight  against  lewd,  obscene,  immoral  and

undesirable  publications  which  either  tend   to

corrupt  individuals or threaten  the  welfare  and

security   of  our  lawfully  and  constitutionally

established State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the law as it stands, the powers of

Government   under  this  Undesirable  Publications

Ordinance  to  prohibit the importation,  sale  and

circulation  of  any  undesirable  publication  are

restricted  to publications which are published  or

printed  outside Singapore or printed in  Singapore

otherwise  than  in  accordance with  the  Printing

Presses Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, certain local writers and

publishers have taken advantage of loopholes in the

Printing  Presses  Ordinance to print  and  publish

undesirable  material.  By  undesirable,  we   mean

writings  which  are  morally  offensive   or   are

calculated  to  endanger  the  welfare,  peace  and

security  of  the  state. Thus  lewd,  immoral  and

obscene publications are undesirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undesirable Publications Ordinance, as it now

stands, cannot adequately control local undesirable

publications  of this kind, because  certain  local

writers  and  publishers have been  cashing  in  by

taking  advantage of the definition of  "newspaper"

in  the Printing Presses Ordinance. Because of this

definition,  permits  are  not  required  to  print

publications  in the form of novels, short  stories

or  magazines containing only articles  of  general

literary interest, poems and short stories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a number of these books and magazines,

though superficially professing high moral and

literary facade, nevertheless contain articles,

poems, and short stories which are undesirable.

There may be a show of dealing with sex and morals

in an intelligent and adult fashion but those who

read between the lines know that the intention is

not so high-minded and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



literary, in other cases, though professing  to  be

literary  articles,  many  of  these  articles  are

undesirable  in  content and purpose.  But  because

these publications do not require permits under the

Printing   Presses  Ordinance, they   cannot   be

proceeded    against    under    the    Undesirable

Publications Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to amend the definition of

"newspaper"  to  cover any type of publication  but

that  would affect bona fide local writers,  poets,

dramatists, literary critics and novelists.  It  is

our  purpose to encourage local writers to  produce

good  reading material - and more of it. By  amending

the  definition of "newspaper" we would be  putting

local  writers to unnecessary trouble and delay  by

subjecting them to the procedure under the Printing

Presses Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore considered that the best way of

preventing  evasion  of the  laws  regarding  local

publications in Singapore would be not to amend the

definition  of "newspaper" in the Printing  Presses

Ordinance,    but   to   amend   the    Undesirable

Publications Ordinance by deleting from  section  3

thereof the words "published or printed outside the

State or printed within the State otherwise than in

accordance  with  the provisions  of  the  Printing

Presses  Ordinance". Such an amendment will empower

the Minister to proscribe any publication which  he

considers undesirable, whether it is printed within

or  without the State and whether it is printed  in

accordance  with the Printing Presses Ordinance  or

not.  Such an amendment will give the Police  power

to   enter   premises  and  seize  such  proscribed

publications under section 8 of the same Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it can therefore be seen that this short

Amendment  Bill  is  aimed at  solely  against  the

undesirable  local  writers  and  authors  who  are

taking  advantage  of a loophole  in  the  Printing

Presses Ordinance to serve their own ends and their

bank balances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that this short Bill will meet

with general approval since its primary purpose  is

to  suppress  touting.  The  activities  of  touts,

operating  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Courts   and

Government  and other public offices  have  been  a

source of considerable nuisance to the public,  and

hitherto  it has proved very difficult  to  proceed

against  them successfully for loitering under  the

existing Minor Offences Ordinance (Cap. 117).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These touts are not only a nuisance with their

pestering and ill-mannered ways, but they are  also

human  sharks  who swindle the poor and  illiterate

members of the public. They charge exorbitant  fees

for  filling in application forms, making Statutory

Declarations,  stamping  documents,  etc, or   for

giving them unauthorised and, more often than  not,

wrong  advice.  They are also a  potent  source  of

corruption of Government officers when they act  as

go-betweens between the public and these Government

officers.  There have been cases of  corruption  by

Government  officers linked with the activities  of

touts.  Again, touts sometimes pose as  persons  of

influence  with departmental officers, and  for  an

adequate  fee  can  be persuaded to  exercise  such

influence  in obtaining documents or in  completing

procedures without delay. They even ask  for  money

from   the   illiterate  by  pretending  to   bribe

officials for favours. What their gullible  clients

do not know is that in almost all cases the touts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



pocket   the  money  themselves.  Of  course,   the

reputation   of  the  public  service  is   thereby

besmirched. Furthermore, many of these touts do not

fill  in  forms  correctly for their customers  and

these  forms consequently have to be amended before

they can be accepted. When this occurs, applicants,

instead  of blaming the touts, criticise Government

servants  for unnecessarily giving them trouble  in

refusing to accept forms filled in incorrectly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative measures have been and are being

taken  to combat this touting nuisance and  a  good

measure  of success has been achieved, but  it  has

not been possible to eliminate the touts completely

from their happy touting ground nor to prevent them

from  accosting members of the public  even  before

they reach the Courts and public offices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the activities and behaviour of

touts,  which I have just described, this Bill  has

been   introduced  to  amend  the  Minor   Offences

Ordinance  to  make it a seizable offence  for  any

person  to tout for any purpose connected with  any

court  or  department  of the  Government  or  City

Council  or to act as unauthorised adviser  to  any

person  who  has  business in  any  such  court  or

department. It also makes loitering in or near  any

court  or  department  of the  Government  or  City

Council  for any such purpose also an offence.  The

punishment on conviction is a fine up to  $500,  or

imprisonment up to 6 months, or to both  such  fine

and imprisonment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

while  accepting the principle enunciated  in  this

Bill,   I  wish  to  draw  the  attention  of   the

Government to certain difficulties that may crop up

as a result of the implementation of this new Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the difficulties arise because the persons

who  are  set  upon by these touts are  illiterate.

They  do not understand Government procedure.  They

want somebody to help them over the difficulties of

procedure and language. It is because the necessity

exists  and because nobody else can help them  that

these so-called touts go to their assistance.  Some

of  them provide a service and some of them exploit

these  illiterates. I think it is the  exploitation

of   these  people  by  touts  which  is  what  the

Government is aiming at. The situation is, I  agree

with the Government, getting worse from day to day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remedy, Mr Speaker, Sir, to my mind is not

the  elimination  of the tout.  Because  if  we  do

successfully  eliminate the  tout,  the  need  will

still  be  there  and  somebody  must  provide  and

satisfy   that  need  so  far  as  the  public   is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see in the Bill that the phrase "an

unauthorised adviser" is used. I presume that  that

is  being  used deliberately, because an authorised

adviser, I take it, is not going to come within the

ambit  of this Bill. If one goes to the Immigration

Department one sees a number of persons  seated  at

tables providing this service to people who  go  to

the  Immigration Department. I take it  that  under

this  Bill  they  will not be touts but  authorised

persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly. Mr Speaker, Sir, if Government could

provide an authorised service for these people when

they  go  into  Court or Government departments  so

that  they will know where they are going, whom  to

see,  what  forms to get and how to fill  them  up,

then  I  think  the  tout will be eliminated.  This

naturally  will  mean that either  Government  will

have   to  increase  its  own  staff  or  authorise

somebody to provide this service either on  payment

of a licence fee or on some other basis. But merely

to  eliminate the tout and not to put somebody else

in  his  place is going to lead certain members  of

the  public into difficulties and will put them  to

undue stress and strain.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, in reply?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member

for   Farrer   Park  is  quite  right   about   the

exploitation  part of it. We do aim at  eliminating

exploitation, and in letting the House know some of

the measures so far taken, I am sure there will  be

no complaints from the Member for Farrer Park.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures taken so far are as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The appointment of clerks to fill forms and

documents on request by the public free of charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. By allowing authorised petition writers to

operate on office premises who can only charge fees

approved by the departments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Strict control of the issue of forms or blank

documents  so that they do not fall into the  hands

of touts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Rearranging inquiries and advice counters in

order  to  provide  for  more  efficient  reception

service. And of course finally,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The employing of watchmen or policemen on duty

to  prevent  known  touts  from  plying  in  office

premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is already doing as much as it

can, but it will be difficult to eliminate the tout

unless stronger measures are taken because they are

actually a nuisance to everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Bill, Sir, as stated in the

explanatory statement, is to give increased  powers

of  seizure of road vehicles to the Police  and  to

extend  the  power of the court to order forfeiture

of road vehicles. The Bill also seeks to give power

to the Police to obtain information relating to the

person  in  control  of a road vehicle  alleged  or

suspected  to have been used in connection  with  a

scheduled offence under the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of experience, the existing

Road Vehicles (Special Powers) Ordinance, No. 8  of

1960, has not been found to be completely effective

in  its main purpose of enabling the Police in  its

campaign  against  criminals  and  secret   society

gangsters to take effective action against vehicles

used  in  connection  with  or  in  furtherance  of

criminal activities. In many cases, the Police have

not  been  able  to obtain orders of forfeiture  of

motor vehicles, because in certain circumstances it

was  difficult for them to first prove as  the  law

required  that  they  had  reasonable  grounds  for

suspecting  that  there was  to  be  found  in  the

vehicle any article in respect of which a scheduled

offence  had been or was being committed,  although

they were certain that the vehicle was used in  the

commission of a scheduled offence. Again, under the

existing   Ordinance,   the   Court   could   order

forfeiture of a vehicle seized under the provisions

of  subsection  (2) of section 3 of  the  Ordinance

only when it was proved to its satisfaction that  a

scheduled offence has been committed in respect  of

any  article found in the vehicle or on any  person

found therein and seized by the Police or that such

vehicle  was  used to convey persons to  the  scene

where  the scheduled offence had been committed  or

used for the escape or to facilitate the escape  of

persons found in the scene of a scheduled offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the draft Bill, therefore, repeals

the original restrictive powers in section 4 of the

existing Ordinance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



under  which the Police and the court had  to  act,

and  the new section 4, as introduced by clause  3,

is  more definite and provides that the court shall

order  the forfeiture of the road vehicle if it  is

proved that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) (i) that the vehicle was used in the

commission of a scheduled offence; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that a scheduled offence has been committed in

respect of an article found in the vehicle or any

person found therein; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that the vehicle has been used to convey

persons to the scene where a scheduled offence has

been committed or attempted to be committed; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) that the vehicle has been used for the escape

or to facilitate the escape of any persons from the

scene of a scheduled offence; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the vehicle was seized by a police

officer; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that written application has been made to

the  court by the State Advocate-General for its

forfeiture.



<br><br>Once these three essentials, i.e. (a), (b) and (c),

are  proved,  the  power  of  the  court  to  order

forfeiture  is mandatory, notwithstanding  that  no

person  may  have been convicted of  any  scheduled

offence.  Sub-clause (2) gives power  to  a  police

officer  to  seize  any  road  vehicle  liable   to

forfeiture under the provisions of this Bill.  Sub-clause  (3) gives power to the court, before  which

the  prosecution with regard to a scheduled offence

has  been  held,  to  order the forfeiture  or  the

release  of  a  road vehicle liable  to  forfeiture

under the provisions of this Bill. Sub-clauses (4),

(5)  and  (6) lay down the procedure to be followed

in  cases where a road vehicle has been seized  but

no arrest has been made or where no prosecution for

a scheduled offence is to be instituted. Sub-clause



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



(7)  protects the Government from vexatious  claims

for  costs  and  damages in cases where  the  court

orders the release of a road vehicle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Amendment Bill is only a

consequential one due to the new clause 3  deleting

the old section 4 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with cases under this Ordinance, the

police   have  often  been  handicapped  in   their

investigation  work because they have  often  found

that the owner or the person, who should know as to

who  was  in control of a motor vehicle,  is  quite

unwilling  to  make a full and frank disclosure  of

the particulars of the driver or the person who was

in  control  of  the road vehicle at  the  material

time, with the result that the Police have not been

able  to successfully bring offenders to book.  New

section  4A,  introduced by clause 4 of  the  Bill,

therefore,  makes it the duty for the  owner  of  a

road  vehicle or any other person, who should  know

who was in control of a road vehicle which had been

used  for the commission of a scheduled offence  or

connected with the scheduled offence, to give  such

information  as  may  be  required  by  any  police

officer with regard to the identity and particulars

of the person who was in control or was driving the

road  vehicle at any specified time. He is absolved

from  this responsibility only if he satisfies  the

court  that  he  did not know and could  not,  with

reasonable   diligence,   have   ascertained    the

information    required   or   that,    owing    to

circumstances beyond his control, it was impossible

for him to furnish the information.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill amends the schedule to the

Ordinance  by  including therein  thefts  of  motor

vehicles and bicycles and their parts, and offences

of  receiving  and  assisting in  the  disposal  of

stolen vehicles and bicycles and their parts  under

sections  3  and  4 respectively  of  the  Vehicles

Ordinance, No. 9 of 1960.

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in most legislation by means of which

Government  departments  perform  their  functions,

there exist provisions for appointments of officers

to administer and carry out the requirements of the

law. In the following Ordinances of departments  of

my  Ministry - the Entertainments Duty Ordinance; the

Estate Duty Ordinance; the Income Tax Ordinance and

the Stamp Duty Ordinance -  similar provisions exist.

The appointments I am referring to are those, among

others, of Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners of

Estate Duties; Senior Investigating Officer. Income

Tax;  Commissioner  and  Deputy  Commissioners   of

Stamps; and Administrator of German Enemy Property.

Due  to  normal  posting and promotion  procedures,

officers are often changed around in these posts so

that  it  becomes necessary frequently to make  and

amend  appointments.  As the power  to  make  these

appointments is at present vested in the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara, it is necessary to refer constantly

to  His  Excellency to approve these  appointments.

This  is  vexatious  to  His Excellency  since  the

matter  is  really  trifling.  Besides,  all  these

appointments are purely administrative  in  nature,

and  are  merely made so as to enable the  officers

concerned to carry out the statutory functions  and

powers vested in the holders of these appointments;

it  is  considered  that the  power  to  make  such

appointments should be transferred to the  Minister

for Finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to inform you that His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation to with this Bill



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the 27th of August, 1880,

the    Tan   Tock   Seng's   Hospital,   originally

established for the reception of diseased  paupers,

has been constituted a body corporate under the Tan

Tock  Seng's  Hospital Ordinance, Cap.  149,  by  a

committee  of management consisting at  present  of

the  Director of Medical Services, a representative

of  the Treasury, the Secretary for Social Welfare,

the   Assistant   Director  of   Medical   Services

(Tuberculosis), the eldest male descendant  in  the

male  line  of the late Tan Tock Seng  residing  in

Singapore  and  willing to serve,  and  five  other

persons  chosen  by the remaining  members  of  the

committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets of the original foundation were in the

form  of land given by two benevolent persons,  Mr

Tan  Tock Seng and Syed Aiwi. Government had  since

acquired  more land and approved the use  of  Crown

land  for  the  use of the Hospital.  Many  of  the

present buildings were erected at the cost  of  the

Government.  Although it was intended  that  public

subscriptions  should provide much of  the  support

for the hospital, the only assistance that has been

given  since the war is almost entirely limited  to

the  T.B. dispensary built within the hospital  by

the Rotary Club of Singapore. While



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



the   functions  of  the  committee  of  management

included  the  scrutiny  of  estimates,  proposals,

dealings  with  members of the staff employed,  and

with  tenders  for  hospital supplies  and  so  on,

income   to   sustain  the  hospital  was   derived

exclusively by way of a grant from Government which

amounted  to  $5,763,130 in 1960. Income  from  the

corporation's  property  is  minute.  All  hospital

staff  apart  from  600 odd hospital  servants  and

similar  grades  employed by  the  corporation  was

supplied   by   the   Government.   This   included

specialists,  doctors and all  nursing  staff.  The

corporation,  therefore, has had  no  control  over

staff  other than the 600 persons mentioned.  Apart

from  Government  nominees  on  its  committee   of

management,  members  of  the  corporation  had  no

special  qualifications for advising Government  on

anti-T.B. measures or on the organisation  of  the

hospital as a T.B. hospital for Singapore, which it

has now become.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the original benefactions and the

landed  property,  there  is  little  left  of  the

original  trust. Government has in fact taken  over

this hospital in all but name. In view of this,  it

is  considered that Government should legally  take

over  the maintenance of the hospital and this Bill

is  intended  to effect its transfer to Government.

Since   Government   would  have   to   take   over

responsibility  for the 600 subordinate  staff,  at

present  employees  of  the Corporation,  the  only

financial  commitment  will be  an  extra  annually

recurrent   expenditure   of   increased   retiring

benefits  under the Pensions Ordinance,  1956,  for

which  these 600 employees will become eligible  on

transfer to Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anticipated increase in financial provision

for  1960  is, as explained at the end of the  Bill

under  "Expenditure of Public Money", approximately

$10,700.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as, in your opinion, this is a

hybrid  Bill because of clauses 2, 3, 4  and  6,  I

shall  therefore at the end of the  Second  Reading

move  that  the  Bill  be  committed  to  a  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

therefore move under Standing Order 65 (1),

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL THEATRE TRUST BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want, first of all, to recapitulate, very

briefly,  the events leading up to the presentation

of this Bill before the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost a year ago, a public appeal was launched

by  the  Government, on the eve of National Loyalty

Week,  for  contributions for a  fund  to  build  a

national  theatre.  Its purpose was  two-fold.  The

first  was to set up a permanent memorial  to  mark

the attainment of self -government by the people of

Singapore.  The  second was to  make  the  National

Theatre a symbol affirming our faith in our ability

to  create  a Malayan nation and a Malayan  culture

through united action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two ways in which the Government could

have approached this project. It could have adopted

the  old patriarchal approach. A benevolent and  an

all-powerful government could have voted the  money

necessary for the project; it could have built  the

theatre  and  presented it to  the  people  as  yet

another  example of the omnipotence and benevolence

of Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way was to make the National Theatre an

object lesson in self-reliance and joint endeavour.

Since  the  National Theatre was to be a symbol  of

our  will  to be a nation, it was decided that  the

National  Theatre  should be the fruit  of  popular

endeavour with Government and every stratum of  the

population participating in it. It would not  be  a

Government  theatre or a theatre built through  the

efforts of this or that group, but of every section

of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is what the National Theatre project has

turned  out to be. Funds for it have come from  all

classes and all races. Cultural organisations  from

all races have organised concerts and shows to add,

little  by little, to the fund. So have many  civic

and  sports organisations. So have trade unions and

political  parties and business concerns.  So  have

thousands of individuals ranging from the  well-to-do to farmers, hawkers and to school children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, over $600,000 have been contributed by

the  public,  and though nearly a year has  passed,

many  organisations and groups still have plans  to

put up shows and activities to increase the fund. I

should  like to take this opportunity to thank  all

those who have spent so much time, energy and money

to augment the National Theatre Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill to set up a National Theatre Trust

seeks  to ensure that the management of the Theatre

remains a public affair too. Right from the  start,

the  Government  set  up a representative  National

Theatre  Fund Committee to be in charge of  getting

funds  for the Theatre. It included representatives

of  the  Press  unions, cultural organisations  and

businessmen,  and  though  their  work   has   been

sustained and time-consuming, their enthusiasm  has

not waned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that plans have been approved for the Theatre

and  an  architect appointed, the time has come  to

create a proper machinery for the administration of

the  Theatre. In appointing members to  the  Board,

the Government will bear in mind the principle that

what has been paid for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



by  the  public should also be administered by  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also those appointed to the Board will be people

who  can  administer the Theatre properly  for  the

ends  for  which  it  was  designed,  that  is,  to

stimulate  the  growth  and  appreciation  of  art,

music,  and  drama, and through these to  foster  a

Malayan culture and a Malayan identity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first job of the Board will be to take over

the  Fund which is now held by Government in  trust

for  the  public and use it in such manner as  they

deem  fit  in accordance with the objects specified

in  clause  6  of  the Bill. When  the  Theatre  is

completed,  it  will be the duty of  the  Board  to

manage it, consistent with the objects for which it

was built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the time is ripe, it is hoped that all other

theatrical  institutions now under the  control  of

the Government will also be passed on to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 of the Bill provide for the

presentation  of  the  Board's  annual  report  and

statement of accounts to the Assembly so that  this

House is kept informed of the Board's activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential thing to bear in mind about the

National Theatre is that it is proof that people of

diverse races, creeds and classes can work together

on  their  own  for  the realisation  of  a  common

objective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it is only in common endeavours of this kind

that we learn that diversity of race, language  and

religion  are barriers only in the warped minds  of

<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> May I interrupt at this

juncture  to signify that I have the recommendation

of  His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to

proceed with this Bill?

to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to fill a deficiency in the

provisions of the Pensions Ordinance. This  relates

to  pensions, gratuities and allowances awarded  to

officers  who  have had service with the  Board  of

Commissioners of Currency as well as  service  with

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pensions Ordinance provides for the payment

of  pensions, gratuities and allowances in  respect

of Government service and other services which have

been  accepted as service counting for  a  pension.

Service with the Board of Commissioners of Currency

is   neither  Government  service,  nor  any  other

service counting for a pension. Therefore, strictly

speaking, no pension, gratuity or allowance  should

have been paid in respect of this service. However,

in  an  administrative action taken as long ago  as

July  1931,  persons  with service  both  with  the

Government  and  the  Board  of  Commissioners   of

Currency  have  been paid pensions, gratuities  and

annual allowances as if service with the Board  was

reckonable for a pension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of persons who were awarded a pension or

annual  allowance in respect of their service  with

the Board have since died, but there are at present

a small number of such persons to whom a pension or

annual  allowance  continues  to  be  paid.  It  is

therefore  necessary  to validate  the  payment  of

these pensions, gratuities and allowances, if  this

small  number of pensioners are to continue  to  be

paid their pension or annual allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an amendment to the Bill and I will move

this  amendment at the Committee stage.  Notice  of

this amendment has already been given.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to move the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Finance,

That  this  Assembly, in accordance with subsection

(2)  of  section  1 of the Control of  Imports  and

Exports Ordinance (Chapter 214), resolves that  the

aforesaid Ordinance shall continue in force  for  a

further  period of one year commencing on  the  8th

day of December, 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ordinance was first promulgated in 1950, and

had  a  life  of one year. Since then it  has  been

extended from year to year, and I now move that  it

be extended for a further period of one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance empowers the Minister to make

Orders  to  regulate  or prohibit  the  import  and

export  of  goods. In keeping with  our  policy  to

encourage trade, restrictions have been removed  to

a  bare  minimum so that almost all  goods  may  be

imported  on  open  general import  licence.  Those

under  restriction  are for  reasons  of  security,

health,  exchange  control and  protection  of  our

local  industries. Export controls  are  also  very

few.  We  must, however, retain the powers to  meet

our international obligations to control the export

of goods of strategic importance, in the event of a

sudden  shortage of certain goods, it is  necessary

in  the interests of the State to retain powers  to

restrict exports of such goods. The current  export

procedures also afford facilities for ensuring that

all export regulations are complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<div align="center"><b>A NATIONAL UNION FOR WORKERS IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

one  of  the  early declarations of policy  by  the

Government is the encouragement of the formation of

national unions of workers. The Opposition does not

find fault with this policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



In  fact, the Opposition supports and welcomes this

policy. But then, Sir, the declaration of a  policy

is  one thing, and the method employed to implement

that  policy  is  quite another  thing.  I  do  not

propose now, Sir, to go into details the many  acts

of   suggestive  intimidation  and  of   the   many

manipulations  that  are  being  practised  by  the

P.A.P. trade union leaders in an endeavour to  win

over uncommitted unions and organised workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I wish to speak on a national union for

workers  in the petroleum industry. I want to  make

it  clear that I am not speaking as adviser to  the

Singapore  Petroleum Workers Union, but that  I  am

speaking  today  as  a  trade  unionist.  Sir,  the

distribution  of  oil  has been  classified  as  an

essential service under the Criminal Law (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance. It is, therefore, imperative

that  everything must be done to  see  to  it  that

industrial  peace and justice are not  upset  as  a

result  of irresponsible activities on the part  of

employers and unions alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Government came into power in June

1959,  there  were in existence four  trade  unions

representing workers in the petroleum industry. The

Singapore  Petroleum  Workers  Union,  the   oldest

union,  was registered in 1952. The Shell Employees

Union,  the Stanvac Employees Union and the  Caltex

Employees  Union  came  into  being  in  succeeding

years.  To strengthen themselves, these four unions

formed  into a Federation of Oil Workers Unions  in

1958.  Hon.  Members will recollect that  with  the

formation  of this Federation, there  was  a  joint

demand on the oil companies for recognition and for

a bonus. And if I remember rightly, the advisers to

this  Federation  at that time were  the  Hon. the

Prime Minister and the Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the Government had made known its

policy  on  national  unions, the  Shell  Employees

Union,  the Caltex Employees Union and the  Stanvac

Employees Union held several meetings with  a  view

to  the  formation  of a national  union.  It  was

because   of  the  deliberate  exclusion   of   the

Singapore Petroleum Workers Union, which was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



then and still is the oldest registered union, that

these  discussions did not result in the  formation

of  a  truly  national union for oil  workers.  The

Shell  Employees  Union and  the  Caltex  Employees

Union  became amalgamated into a National Union  of

Oil  Workers. The Stanvac Employees Union, however,

pulled out of the discussions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the N.U.O.W., which is led by P.A.P.

members, was registered on the 27th January,  1960.

And  consequent upon this registration, the Stanvac

Employees  Union was notified by the  Registrar  of

Trade  Unions  that it would be deregistered.  This

was  obviously, Sir, due to the Government  playing

politics  in this particular field. If the  Stanvac

Employees  Union had toed the line  and  agreed  to

become  absorbed  into the National  Union  of  Oil

Workers, then the Singapore Petroleum Workers Union

would  have been deregistered for the same  obvious

reason. Sir, because of the registration in January

1960 of the P.A.P.-controlled N.U.O.W., because  of

the  deregistration of the Stanvac Employees  Union

which  refused to become absorbed into the NU.O.W.,

and   because  of  the  P.A.P.-controlled  T.U.C.'s

acceptance  of affiliation of the newly  registered

P.A.P.-controlled  N.U.O.W. and their  unjustified

non-acceptance  of  affiliation  of  the  Singapore

Petroleum  Workers Union, which was  registered  in

1952, it became obvious to people outside that  the

P.A.P. was   playing  party  politics   in   this

particular sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was also inevitable that there would be

trade union rivalry in the petroleum industry. As a

trade unionist, I could see that this rivalry would

be to the detriment of the workers in the industry.

So  when I was approached in February this year  by

the  Singapore Petroleum Workers Union  to  be  its

honorary adviser, I accepted the appointment on one

condition:  that the S.P.W.U. agreed to empower  me

to  see  the  Minister for Labour and Law  to  take

steps  towards  the formation of a  truly  national

union  of oil workers. With this authority, Sir,  I

saw the Minister for Labour and Law and offered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



my  services to bring unity among the oil  workers.

Under  the chairmanship of the Minister, Sir, there

was  a meeting with representatives of the N.U.O.W.

and  the  Secretary-General of the T.U.C.  At  this

meeting  I  put up my suggestions for the formation

of  a truly national union of oil workers and I was

told  that I would be informed at a later  date  of

the  views  of  the  N.U.O.W. No  such  information

materialised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rival union activities intensified. The

leaders  of  the  P  A.P.-controlled  N.U.O.W. in

campaigning for members made full and free  use  of

the   Minister's  name.  They  intimated  that  the

Minister had told them that he would deregister the

S.P.W.U. So why join the S.P.W.U. which had  earned

the displeasure of the Minister? The S.P.W.U. then,

in  an attempt to resolve this issue, requested the

oil  companies to conduct a secret ballot among the

employees  to  ascertain which union the  employees

would  wish to have to represent them. The N.U.O.W.

objected  to  this and intimated  that  the  proper

thing  to do was to conduct an industry-wide secret

ballot  of all direct employees to ascertain  which

union  should be the union to survive to  represent

the  workers in the petroleum industry. Because  of

the  intimation of the N.U.O.W., the S.P.W.U. then

requested  the  Minister  for  Labour  and  Law  to

conduct such an industry-wide secret ballot of  all

direct employees. This request, Sir, did not elicit

any  reply  from  the Minister for some  time.  The

S.P.W.U. then  called  a  general   meeting   and

explained  the  situation to its members.  At  this

particular meeting it was unanimously resolved that

strike   notices  should  be  issued  to  the   oil

companies to gain recognition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of these strike notices coincided

with the sending of a letter by the Minister to the

S.P.W.U. inviting them to send representatives to a

meeting  together  with  representatives   of   the

N.U.O.W. and of the oil companies to  discuss  the

arrangement for conducting an industry-wide  secret

ballot of all direct employees. Press reports, Sir,

in  this connection indicated that the Minister was

very,  very  angry  indeed with  the  S.P.W.U. for

having sent strike



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



notices,  and  it was also indicated in  the  Press

that the Minister threatened to take action against

the  S.P.W.U. unless  the  S.P.W.U. withdrew  the

strike notices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this meeting arranged by the Minister duly

took  place in the Ministry under his chairmanship.

At  this meeting the Minister quite rightly pointed

out  to  the  representatives of the S.P.W.U. that

there could be no discussion on the arrangement for

conducting  an industry-wide secret ballot  of  all

direct  employees unless the S.P.W.U. withdrew  the

strike   notices.   The  representatives   of   the

S.P.W.U.,    in    order   to    discharge    their

responsibilities  to their members,  elicited  from

the  Minister  that  the strike  notices  were  not

contrary  to the laws of the State and that  should

an  industry-wide  secret ballot  take  place,  the

union   winning  the  ballot  would  survive.   The

representatives of the S.P.W.U. told  the  Minister

that  they  had  no  power to withdraw  the  strike

notices  but that they would go back to the general

body and advise them of the wishes of the Minister.

The meeting then terminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S.P.W.U., Sir, issued a circular to their

members  calling  them  to a  general  meeting  and

informing them of what took place at the meeting in

the  Ministry  of  Labour and  Law.  This  circular

telling  the facts obviously got under the skin  or

the  Minister and he rushed to the Press and denied

that  he ever gave an assurance at that meeting  to

the representatives of the S.P.W.U. that should  an

industry-wide  secret ballot take place  the  union

winning  the  ballot would survive. As  was  to  be

expected, Sir, this caused great resentment in  the

minds  of the members of the S.P.W.U. Therefore,  I

was  asked to attend their general meeting  because

it  was  felt that the meeting might become  highly

critical  of this kind of double talk. I  therefore

attended  the  meeting. And I must say,  Sir,  that

that  meeting  was very, very firm in its  feelings

against the Minister for denying what they believed

their  representatives had  told  them  the  truth.

There  was  strong talk of not wanting to  withdraw

the  strike notices. Sir, I was able to pacify  the

meeting.  I explained to them that they should  not

take  heed of any kind of double talk that had been

going on; that if any industry-wide



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



secret  ballot  were  to take place,  it  would  be

ridiculous and foolish on the part of the Government

to  ignore the union that came out successful in  a

ballot conducted by the Government. Therefore,  the

meeting  should take no heed of whether or not  the

Minister  did or did not give an assurance.  I  was

also able, Sir, to persuade the meeting to withdraw

the  strike  notices, because I explained  to  them

that  it  was  a proper thing to do;  that  if  the

discussions  at the Labour Ministry  with  all  the

parties  concerned  were  to  be  conducted  in  an

atmosphere  of  cordiality  and  in  a  spirit   of

goodwill,   then  the  strike  notices  should   be

withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some spies of the Minister rushed to him and

misinformed  him  of  my  speech  at  that  general

meeting.  And behaving in a manner that is  typical

of  the  Minister, he rushed into press and accused

me  of  saying  things  that  I  did  not  say  and

threatened a probe into my alleged utterances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a probe in this particular context can only

mean one thing - a form of suggestive intimidation. I

read  this  Press report when I was in Brunei.  The

Hon, the  Prime Minister was also there  attending

the Sultan's birthday celebrations. And believe me,

Sir,  I  had a good laugh about how silly a  P.A.P.

Minister  could  be. Sir, this kind  of  suggestive

intimidation is really typical of the Minister  for

Labour  and  Law. The public has not yet  forgotten

the  threat  that he issued against an employer - the

threat of using the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance  on an employer. The public has  not  yet

forgotten that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if I had, as misreported by the spies

of  the  Minister,  said the  things  that  it  was

alleged  that  I had said, surely  it  was  in  the

exercise  of  my democratic rights; or  are  we  to

understand  that under the P.A.P. Government  there

is  now no longer freedom of speech as there is now

no  longer  freedom of the Press as stated  by  the

Member for Hong Lim?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the meeting then agreed to withdraw the

strike  notices, and so the representatives of  the

S.P.W.U. attended another meeting  at  the  Labour

Ministry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



At  this meeting the N.U.O.W. turned about face and

did not agree to an industry-wide secret ballot  of

all direct employees although it was their original

demand.  And  they then insisted  that  the  secret

ballot  should only be confined to members  of  the

unions. Sir, if the Minister for Labour and Law had

really been impartial, he would have insisted  that

the  N.U.O.W. stick to their original  demand.  But

then,  Sir,  could one expect a P.A.P. Minister  to

render a slap to a P.A.P.-controlled union? So  the

second meeting was again abortive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third meeting took place again on the 11th of

October. Nothing came out of it. But it was left to

the two unions to talk among themselves and find  a

way out of this difficulty. The S.P.W.U. then wrote

a  letter  after  this  meeting  to  the  N.U.O.W.,

inviting  them  to  a meeting to discuss  ways  and

means to resolve their differences and form a truly

national union for oil workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while this correspondence was going on as to

when,  where  and  how such a meeting  should  take

place,  the Justice Chua Court of Inquiry submitted

its report to the Minister for Labour and Law. This

report had been given publicity in the Press. Among

other things, the Court recommended that to put  an

end  to  this union rivalry it was imperative  that

one national union be created. The Court also found

that  the action taken by the N.U.O.W. was a strike

within the meaning of the laws of the State. As the

N.U.O.W. had not complied with the law by giving  a

14-day  strike  notice, the N.U.O.W. had  therefore

indulged  in  an illegal strike. The union  leaders

and   the   N.U.O.W. are  therefore   liable   to

prosecution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report of the Justice Chua Court of

Inquiry  came  out  in the Press  on  the  24th  of

October.  The  S.P.W.U. submitted  demands  to  the

three  oil  companies  for  better  conditions   of

employment  and these demands were given prominence

in the Press on the 25th of October. On the 26th of

October - just a big knife. The union was told by the

Registrar  of  Trade Unions that the Registrar  was

satisfied  that this union should be  deregistered.

Both unions were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



then  told  by the Registrar of Trade  Unions  that

they would be deregistered. Sir, the action against

the N.U.O.W. was called for because of the findings

of  the Justice Chua Court of Inquiry. The N.U.O.W.

had  indulged in an illegal strike. The leaders  of

the   N.U.O.W. had  behaved  in  an  irresponsible

manner.  Therefore,  it was quite  right  that  the

union should be deregistered. But why penalise  the

S.  P.W.U. also for an act committed  by  a  rival

union?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the notice issued by the

Registrar  of  Trade Unions, the  ground  for  such

proposed  cancellation was that "the  Registrar  is

satisfied that the trade union is likely to be used

against  the  interest of workmen in the  petroleum

industry." Let us take note of the operative  words

"the trade union is likely to be used" and not "the

trade union has been used" against the interest  of

workmen  in  the  petroleum industry.  Sir,  is  it

against  the interest of workmen for the  union  to

submit   demands  on  the  employers  for  improved

conditions  of  employment? Or is  it  because  the

Government is very anxious to protect the  interest

of  employers,  and that is why the R.T.U. had  to

clamp  down on the trade union which had  submitted

demands to the employers for improved conditions of

employment?  Sir, if the Registrar of Trade  Unions

had not taken that action against the S.P.W.U., the

union  and  the  employers today would  be  sitting

round  a table negotiating for a new wage agreement

for  workmen in the petroleum industry and  certain

benefits  were bound to accrue. And yet the  ground

for  the  cancellation of registration is that  the

union is likely to be used against the interest  of

workmen in the industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the general election, the P.A.P.

promised  that it would help to raise the  standard

of living and help to improve the conditions of the

workers  in  the State. I do not want  to  suggest,

Sir, that the P.A.P. has forgotten its promise, but

if  it  has not forgotten its promise, how  can  we

reconcile  this  with the fact that the  Government

had  to  close down the union one day after it  had

sent  in  a  demand  for  improved  conditions   of

employment for workmen in the State of Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the N.U.O.W. have accepted the justification

for  the deregistration. Obviously, they could  not

protest  because they were in the  wrong;  but  the

S.P.W.U. have  strongly  protested  against   this

unjustifiable  action. They claim that  it  is  not

fair  and justifiable on the part of the Government

to punish them for an irresponsible act perpetrated

by  a  P.A.P.-controlled union. They say that  they

should not be punished for what they did not do.  I

would like to know what the Government proposes to

do about this. It is not right and proper that this

union  should be deregistered. But then  again  one

can   ask  the  question,  "Will  this  solve   the

situation in the petroleum industry?" But  I,  Sir,

know the leadership of the S.P.W.U. quite well, and

I can say this, that this leadership is prepared to

reorganise  the union and bring in the  leaders  of

the  N.U.O.W. to  form a truly national  union  of

petroleum workers.



<br><br>4.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  when the Member for Cairnhill gave notice  of

his  proposed adjournment speech under the  heading

of  "A  National Union for Workers in the Petroleum

Industry", I was under the impression that  he  was

going  to  entertain  the  House  with  his  expert

experience  as the former Minister for  Labour  and

Welfare, but instead he proclaims himself to  be  a

trade unionist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the object of the hon. Member's

adjournment  speech is to find a way to  solve  the

dissatisfaction  of the workers  in  the  petroleum

industry. After hearing his speech, I rise, as  the

acting Minister for Labour and Law, to speak on the

fundamental issues, but I shall not talk at  length

by  going into the details of the negotiations  for

which the Government provided the facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, I would like to state that

the union that the Member for Cairnhill alleges  to

have been in existence since 1952 was not known  as

the  S.P.W.U.  It was not until the end  of  August

1955  that  that union changed its name and  called

itself  the  S.P.W.U.  By  that  time,  there  were

already  on the register the Shell Employees  Union

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



the Stanvac Employees Union, the membership of each

of  which was open to workers in the respective oil

company. Besides, the Caltex Employees Union, which

was registered in October 1955, was actually in the

course  of  organisation  by  then.  Moreover,  not

withstanding  the assumption of its new  name,  the

rules  of the S.P.W.U. remained confined to workers

employed  by  oil-dealers  and  were  not  open  to

workers employed by oil companies until the end  of

November 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above facts show clearly that it is not at

all  correct to say that the S.P.W.U. is the oldest

union catering for workers in the oil industry  and

that  the  other  unions in the  oil  industry  are

splinter unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has said that the

Government has deviated from its declared policy of

bringing  about  unity among  the  workers  by  the

formation of one union for each industry instead of

having splinter or yellow unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me give some facts about the emergence of

the  N.U.O.W. About six months after the assumption

of  office  of the P.A.P. Government in June  1959,

the  N.U.O.W. applied for registration  as  a  new

union. There were then already on the register, the

S.P.W.U.,  the Shell Employees Union,  the  Stanvac

Employees Union and the Caltex Employees Union. The

application was forthwith refused by the  Registrar

on  the ground that the Trade Unions Ordinance  had

already  been  amended to empower the Registrar  to

refuse  registration  of any  splinter  union.  The

applicants  accordingly withdrew their application.

Is  there then any truth in the allegation that the

P.A.P. Government was encouraging the formation  of

any splinter union?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of January 1960, the Shell Employees

Union  and  the Caltex Employees Union  effected  a

voluntary  amalgamation and adopted  the  title  of

"N.U.O.W."   with  new  rules  which   opened   its

membership to all workers in the oil industry.  The

Registrar   had   no  power  to  refuse   such   an

amalgamation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



which was accordingly registered. This was how  the

N.U.O.W. came into existence. The registration  of

this amalgamation was, in fact, the marriage of two

unions,  one  of  which was registered  before  the

S.P.W.U. came into being under that title, and  the

other one before the S.P.W.U. amended its rules  to

accept employees in oil companies as its members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was not present during the

negotiations  which were held in  the  Ministry  of

Labour, I feel that I am not in a position to state

exactly  what  transpired at  those  meetings.  The

Government has no intention of backing the N.U.O.W.

at the expense of the S.P.W.U.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter dragged on until

21st  October, 1960, when the Court of Inquiry  was

appointed   under   the  then   Industrial   Courts

Ordinance (Chapter 151) to inquire into the  causes

and   circumstances  of  the  dispute  between  the

Standard-Vacuum  Oil  Company  and  the   N.U.O.W.,

resulting  in  the  dismissal of an  employee.  The

Court submitted its Report and recommended, amongst

other   things,  the  formation  at  the   earliest

possible  moment  of  one  single  union  for   all

employees  in  the oil industry, because  otherwise

the increasing rivalry between the unions might, in

the  opinion of the Court, lead to other larger and

even more serious incidents than the one which  the

Court inquired into.



<br><br>4.59 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Member for Cairnhill prefaced his speech

with  the  remark  that  he supported  Government's

policy  of  unification  of  trade  unions.  If  he

supports that policy, then he must realise that the

unification   of   trade   unions - amalgamation   or

federation  in  the  initial stages - can  only  take

place  with  the  ultimate aim of amalgamating  the

several  unions that are in the same industry.  The

trade  unions have generally accepted  this  policy

and have, since June 1959, worked towards achieving

unification. It is in this spirit that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



Stanvac Employees Union, the Shell Employees  Union

and  the  Caltex  Employees Union  amalgamated  and

formed  the National Union of Oil Workers.  At  the

time the amalgamation was made and registered,  the

three  unions  were  affiliates  of  the  Singapore

Trades  Union  Congress. It is the normal  practice

that where three unions have been affiliates of the

Congress and have since amalgamated, the new  union

that  has  been  registered  is  considered  as  an

affiliate in place of the names of the three unions

which  will  be  deleted from the  records  of  the

Congress. The National Union of Oil Workers became

an  affiliate of the T.U.C. I must inform the House

that  before  the amalgamation, those three  unions

were  affiliated to the T.U.C. as far back as 1958.

In 1958, the Trades Union Congress did make efforts

to  bring in the Singapore Petroleum Workers  Union

as  well.  At  that time, the S.P.W.U. refused  to

affiliate  with  the T.U.C. It was only  after  the

National  Union of Oil Workers became an  affiliate

of the T.U.C. that the S.P.W.U. wished to become an

affiliate  of the T.U.C. It was at this, time  that

the  dispute  between the two  unions  reached  the

stage  where  all  parties, the  Minister  and  the

T.U.C.,  were very concerned that this dispute,  or

inter-union  rivalry for members might  develop  to

the  extent  that it might harm union  relationship

and  might  discourage members  from  remaining  in

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The T.U.C. made a conscious effort to bring about

amalgamation at the last meeting that was  held  in

the  Minister's office. That meeting was  attended

by  the  S.P.W.U. representatives, the N.U.O.W.

representatives and the T.U.C. representatives. The

object of the meeting was to find ways and means of

unifying  these  two  unions. Both  unions  adopted

different  approaches, and after  some  discussion,

the  Vice-President of the S.P.W.U. himself made  a

proposal  that a selected number of representatives

from the two unions should hold meetings to draft a

new  constitution  for  a  new  single  union.  The

proposal  was a sound one and the Minister accepted

it. The T.U.C. also accepted it. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



happened   was   that  a  paid   officer   of   the

S.P.W.U. - one  might call him a paid clerk,  not  an

executive  officer  of  the  union,  but   a   paid

clerk - protested     against     this      proposal.

Nevertheless,   the   T.U.C. and   the   Minister

recommended  this proposal submitted by  the  Vice-President of the S.P.W.U., and asked the two unions

to  consider  it. Two days later, we  read  in  the

papers that the Vice-President of the S.P.W.U. had

been  expelled  from  the unions.  After  that  the

S.P.W.U. invited the N.U.O.W. to a meeting at their

headquarters.  The  N.U.O.W. did  not  reject  the

invitation.  They accepted it, but suggested  that.

as  a  result of the inter-union rivalry, feelings

had  become so bad that it was better to  have  the

meeting in a neutral place. And the venue suggested

was the T.U.C.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is not neutral!



<br><br><!-- Mr Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kandasamy:</b> The S.P.W.U. later suggested the

Y.M.C.A.  Probably they thought  the  Y.M.C.A. was

neutral.  The  N.U.O.W. accepted the proposal.  But

just two hours before the meeting was scheduled  to

be held, the S.P.W.U. again cancelled it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Cairnhill can have only one

motive  for bringing up this question here, because

I am sure, as the honorary adviser to the S.P.W.U.,

he  is  well  aware that meetings have been  taking

place;  that  five representatives of the  S.P.W.U.

and  five representatives of the N.U.O.W. have been

meeting   on   several   occasions   to   draft   a

constitution.  And if we have the interest  of  the

unions  at heart, and if we believe that these  two

unions  should unite and that there should  be  one

and  only one union for the oil workers in the  oil

industry,  as recommended by Justice  Chua  at  the

Court of Inquiry, then we should work towards that.

But the speech of the Member for Cairnhill makes it

quite clear that it is not his intention that  this

meeting should be a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Congress, Sir, have made it very

clear  to  the representatives of the S.P.W.U. and

the N.U.O.W. that the best thing that can happen in

this situation is for the two unions to agree



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



upon  a  constitution,  and having  agreed  upon  a

constitution, then let the members elect whom  they

want  as their leaders. But not so the S.P.W.U.  As

the Member for Cairnhill himself remarked just now,

the  S.P.W.U. made this grand gesture,  "Come  and

join  the  S.P.W.U.  As for the  leaders,  we  will

arrange  that. We will fix that." If  this  is  the

attitude  of  the  S.P.W.U. as  regards  arranging

leaders  and  fixing leaders, then the trade  union

will not be a trade union, but it will be a company-controlled  union. I am surprised,  Sir,  that  the

Member   for  Cairnhill,  who  spoke  as  a   trade

unionist,  should at this juncture, when one  might

call  it "peace talks" are being carried out,  when

there is a possibility that a new constitution will

be  adopted, when there is a possibility that these

two unions will come together, make this, one might

say, deliberate attempt to keep them apart.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's order to cancel the registration

of  the  two unions was no doubt motivated  by  the

recommendation of the Court of Inquiry to have  one

single union. In order to achieve one single union,

notices  went  out  that the  registration  of  two

unions   should   be  cancelled,  and   after   the

cancellation,  a  single union should  be  created.

There  is  no suggestion, either in the  T.U.C. or

anywhere  else, as to what type of union should  be

created  or  who  should be its  leaders.  What  is

important is that there should be one single  union

in the oil industry for the oil workers and managed

by the oil workers.
