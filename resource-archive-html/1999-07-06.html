<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND RESTORATION OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CPF CONTRIBUTION RATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  (a)  what  is his assessment of the  current  economic

recovery  and whether this is sustainable in the long  run;  and

(b)  how  will  the recovery affect the Government's  plans  and

commitment for the full implementation of the recommendations of

the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister what

is the Government's time frame to restore the employer's Central

Provident Fund contribution rate back to the 1998 level.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I will take Questions 1  and

2 together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The economy has been recovering well

this  year,  faster than we had expected.  This  is  because  of

favourable   external  developments  in  the   region   and   an

improvement in the global electronics industry.  It is also  due

to the decisive measures we took to reduce business costs, which

have  helped to boost our competitiveness.  In May, MTI upgraded

its  1999  GDP growth forecast from the original -1% to  1%,  to

between  0% and 2%.  Recent data suggest that the economy  might

outperform  this  range.  MTI will revise  the  growth  forecast

again  in August, when the full economic results for the  second

quarter become available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing sector leads our economic recovery. It

grew  by  8.2% in the first five months of 1999, on the back  of

robust  expansion  in  the electronics and  chemicals  clusters.

Indicators from the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>

other  sectors of the economy show that the recovery is becoming

more broad-based, although not every sector is doing well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commerce sector will benefit from a pick up in tourism.

Visitor  arrivals grew by 7.2% between January and May, compared

to  the double-digit declines last year.  The financial services

sector  has  been  boosted by the buoyant stock  market.  Shares

transacted grew by 270% in value terms and 390% in volume  terms

in April-May 1999.  But offshore and domestic lending activities

are still lagging behind.  The construction sector remains weak,

despite the improved property market sentiment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospects for continued growth in the second half of 1999

are favourable. But whether the current recovery is sustained in

the  longer  term  will  depend on both  external  and  internal

factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Externally, we are heavily dependent on overseas markets.

So  we  need the OECD economies to stay robust and to keep their

markets open. In the region, a sustained recovery will depend on

countries persevering with their restructuring efforts. The risk

is  that  the current signs of recovery will cause countries  to

put  off painful restructuring measures.  Restructuring  by  our

neighbours will mean keener competition for Singapore, but it is

better   for   us   to  have  strong  and  healthy   neighbours,

contributing to the stability and prosperity of the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internally, we must persevere with the strategies mapped

out  by  the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness (CSC).  We

must  not become complacent just because the economy has started

to  pick up. We must upgrade our capabilities and strengthen our

competitive position.  The CSC has emphasised the importance  of

building  up  our  physical infrastructure,  technology,  market

networks  and manpower. We should make full use of  the  current

window of opportunity to do this. This is vital to maintain  our

competitiveness in the long run, as the region recovers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, we must continue to watch our business

costs carefully. We need to nurse the present economic recovery,

and not choke it off by allowing costs to rise prematurely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $10.5 billion cost reduction package announced by the

Government last November covered taxes, industrial land rentals,

utilities and transport charges, and other Government  fees  and

charges.   Some  of these were outright rate reductions;  others

were  one-off  rebates to be reviewed after one  to  two  years.

Many of the reductions came into effect only this January.   The

Government will see through these cost reductions as promised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major part of the cost-cutting package was the reduction

in labour costs, to be achieved by reducing bonuses and variable

wages,  plus  a  10%-point  reduction  in  the  employer's   CPF

contribution rate, from 20% to 10%.  The CPF cut was to  be  for

two years from 1st January 1999, after which we would review the

situation.  We  intended  to  progressively  restore   the   CPF

contribution rate as the economy recovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitive labour costs remain a critical factor to

sustain  investments  and jobs in Singapore.   Hence,  continued

wage   restraint   is   essential.   This   is   why   the   NWC

Recommendations   this   year  emphasised   caution   and   wage

flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the measures we took, the CPF cut had the most

impact  on our business costs, and contributed significantly  to

the  current  recovery. It is total wage costs - both  take-home

pay  and  CPF - that matter to our competitiveness. If we  allow

wage  settlements to go up too quickly now, we will be  negating

the  effect  of  the CPF cuts, and making it more  difficult  to

restore CPF contribution rates later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we recognise that in a strong recovery, wage

pressures  are unavoidable. Therefore, if the recovery continues

to  gain  momentum,  it will be better for us  to  manage  these

pressures,   by   beginning  to  restore  the   employer's   CPF

contribution

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>

earlier,  while  continuing  to  exercise  restraint   in   wage

settlements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will review the position towards the end of this year.

By  then  we will know this year's economic performance and  the

outlook  for  next year. We can then decide whether  to  make  a

first adjustment to CPF rates in 2000, instead of 2001 as we had

originally planned.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have two supplementary questions.  The first question is whether

the  Ministry would have the revised forecast for the GDP growth

for  1999 in view of the strong recovery of the economy  in  the

first  half.   The  second question is, in view  of  the  strong

recovery  of  the  economy,  would  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister

consider  advancing  the reinstatement of  the  CPF  cut  to  an

earlier  date than two years so as to enable depositors  to  use

their CPF money to help finance existing housing loans and  make

new investments.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained, we

will  review  the forecast when we have the full second  quarter

figures.   We  expect to make a revised forecast  come  National

Day, which is our usual timing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for advancing the CPF restoration, I had explained also

that  we  have  to  look at CPF and wage take-home  pay  as  one

package  because  it  is the total wage  cost  which  makes  the

difference  to the competitiveness of the economy.  If  we  hold

down  CPF  but  allow wage costs to rise, then we  are  actually

negating  the  effect of the CPF cut and, in effect,  making  it

more  difficult for us to increase the CPF later on because  the

wages  would  already  have risen.  If there  is  wage  pressure

because  the economy is doing well and exports are strong,  then

it may be better for us to restore CPF earlier and maintain wage

restraint longer, so that we can restore the CPF cut sooner, not

in  full, but progressively, and manage our total wage  cost  as

the economy recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early for us to commit now. We have said two years

but, as I said, if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>

the  economy  grows strongly, at the end of  the  year  we  will

revise  this  and consider whether we will begin to restore  the

CPF come the year 2000, a year ahead of schedule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether this will make a contribution to housing loans,

we  will have to consider which components of the CPF we restore

first.   When we cut the CPF we cut 6% from the Ordinary account

and  4%  from the Special account.  The Special account  is  the

first priority for CPF members to build up, because that is  put

aside  for  old  age  and as the absolute crucial  nest-egg,  as

opposed  to something a little bit more than that which you  can

use  for housing or other investments.  When we restore  it,  my

preference  would be to restore the Special account first.   But

we  will decide that later on.  I think it is premature to count

our chickens now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Two

supplementary  questions, Sir.  First, in view of  some  present

fundamental  challenges,  both  internally  and  externally,  as

mentioned  by  the  Deputy Prime Minister, whether  there  is  a

likelihood that our economy may be poised for a w-shape recovery

instead of a v-shape recovery, as most people think.  The second

question  is:  what about the Government department charges  and

statutory  board  charges?  Are we committed to  lowering  these

charges  despite the economic recovery because they do form  the

bulk of expenses for companies?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is possible that we have a w-shape

rather than v-shape pattern.  "W-shape" means you go down  again

before  you recover.  I hope not, but you cannot be sure because

the  risks are there.  The American economy looks strong but you

cannot  say  how the present boom will eventually be  managed  - whether  they will contrive a soft-landing or not.  If you  look

at  the situation in Japan, it also looks improving but not  yet

out of the woods.  China is slowing down and has less impact  on

the region now, but potentially it has a psychological effect on

the rest of Asia.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have got to look at our neighbours. Thailand

and  Malaysia are economically picking up.  Indonesia  is  still

dependent  on political circumstances.  That is why we  are  not

making  any  premature celebration now.  We are going  to  watch

carefully and take it very soberly, step by step.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other Government rates and charges, there are many

items  which  we announced - rentals, rebates on  property  tax,

utilities and so on.  They will remain for the periods which  we

have stated.  At the end of those periods, we will review them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> I welcome the Government's

decision to review the restoration of CPF earlier if the economy

is  good.  Would the Deputy Prime Minister give us more  details

such  as the time frame for the restoration, the percentage  and

the components, instead of just saying it is the Special account

that would be restored first?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> If the Member could tell me what our

growth rate will be this year and what the position will be next

year  and where the Americans next year, I will give him a  good

answer.

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC RECOVERY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b></b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  is his assessment on the prospects  of  economic

recovery  for  Singapore  this  year  and  his  advice  on   the

strategies  the business community should adopt in  response  to

the fast changing economic circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon

Yeo):    Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  DPM  Lee  has  already  given   the

Government's  assessment of the current  economic  recovery.   I

will not repeat it here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace of economic recovery has exceeded our

expectations.   With better business prospects,  more  companies

should  do better this year.  However, our companies should  not

relent in their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>

efforts  to  upgrade their operations, acquire new  capabilities

and penetrate new markets.  We have to stay globally competitive

in the modern economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During recession, it is easier to get companies to upgrade

their capabilities as it is a matter of survival. In good times,

companies   may  become  complacent.   The  region   is   slowly

recovering  and  our regional competitors will emerge  stronger,

especially  if  they follow through with serious  reforms.   Our

companies  must  prepare  for tougher competition  ahead.   They

should  press  on with upgrading their manpower  and  technology

capabilities and expand their market networks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has various enterprise support schemes and

market development efforts to help our companies.  Our SMEs,  in

particular, should take advantage of some of these programmes.

<div align="center"><b>TRADE BETWEEN SINGAPORE AND ASEAN COUNTRIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b></b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  whether  there was any improvement  in  trade  between

Singapore and the ASEAN countries from June 1998 to May 1999.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's

total  trade  with the ASEAN countries has turned  around  since

March  this year.  It expanded by 8.8% for the period  March  to

May  1999,  after declining by 12% between June  last  year  and

February this year.  The rebound was due to the bottoming out of

the  ASEAN  economies  as  well as  the  improvement  in  global

electronics demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both exports to and imports from the ASEAN countries

expanded for the period March to May 1999.  Exports rose by 8.1%

due  mainly  to  higher  exports  of  intermediate  inputs,   in

particular,  electronics and related products,  mostly  used  to

manufacture products where the final demand is in the US and the

European Union. There were also higher exports of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>

consumer goods to ASEAN, reflecting improved consumer sentiments

in  these countries.  Imports, on the other hand, grew  by  9.6%

fuelled  by  higher  imports of intermediate  goods  to  support

manufacturing operations in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board (TDB) is cautiously optimistic

that  the expansion in trade with ASEAN would continue  for  the

rest  of the year, provided that global electronic demand  stays

healthy  and  the  recovery of the ASEAN  economies  remains  on

course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Is the Minister

confident  that the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement will  assist  the

increase  in intra-ASEAN trade and that in the preparations  for

the WTO meeting, ASEAN will play a strong role?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Despite the economic crisis, there

has  been  a continuing determination by the ASEAN countries  to

stay  the  course.   I  have  just  come  back  from  the  Trade

Ministers' Meeting of the APEC economies in Auckland  last  week

and  the  results were much more than we could have  hoped  for,

given the fact that in many countries in East Asia, the economic

crisis  has  caused political leaders to turn  inwards.   Partly

because the crisis seems to have bottomed out, there has been  a

renewed determination by these countries to stay the course  and

to  prepare for a good Leaders' Summit in Auckland in  September

this  year,  and to help shape the launch of a new round  during

the WTO Ministerial meeting in Seattle in November.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Will the Minister

please  inform  the  House whether the trend  he  mentioned  for

exports  is the same for both direct exports and re-exports  and

whether the figures include trade with Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The trends are quite broad-based.

They cover both domestic exports and re-exports and for all  the

ASEAN  countries.  The numbers I gave did not include  Indonesia

as it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>

not  our practice to do so, but the general trends for Indonesia

are the same.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education, pending the results of the investigation in  relation

to  the  Compassvale Primary School accident, what measures  his

Ministry has taken to ensure that all other schools with similar

structures   are  being  re-evaluated  as  to  their  structural

integrity and potential danger to lives.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>

<b>Wong) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

hitherto all development of Government schools undertaken by MOE

has  been  implemented through PWD (now known as PWD Consultants

(PWDC))  after  the PWD was corporatised with  effect  from  1st

April  1999.  The handling of these projects comes under one  of

the following three arrangements:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The entire project from design to construction is fully

taken charge of by PWDC's in-house professionals;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Private sector consultants and contractors are engaged

for  the  project under  the Design and Build (D&B)  procurement

method  which  requires  the private sector  consultants  to  do

design  development  based on  PWDC's concept  design,  and  the

contractors  to execute the works under the supervision  of  the

private consultants; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Government farms out the entire project from design

to  construction including construction supervision  to  private

sector consultants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the projects designed and supervised by PWDC, the PWDC

is fully responsible professionally for the proper completion of

the   projects.   Similarly,  private  sector  consultants   are

responsible professionally for the Design and Build  and  farmed

out  projects.  They must ensure that the design and  the  works

executed by the contractors are in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>

compliance  with all building regulations and standards  set  by

the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and other relevant

Authorities.   Compassvale  Primary  school  is  a  farmed   out

project, hence the design of the school and supervision  of  the

construction  are  under  the responsibilities  of  the  private

sector consultants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, PWDC also serves as the project manager.

Besides  being responsible for the budget and time  schedule  of

the projects and that the user's requirements are met, PWDC must

ensure  that  PWDC's in-house professionals  or  private  sector

consultants,  as  the  case may be, obtain clearances  from  the

relevant  Authorities  before  handing  over  completed   school

premises   to  MOE  for occupation.  All school buildings,  like

other  public buildings, are required by BCA to undergo 5-yearly

checks  on  structures.  This  BCA  requirement  has  been  duly

complied with by MOE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has taken the precaution to ask both PWDC and HDB to

check  independently for the structural safety of all  completed

schools  that have the involvement of the Professional Engineers

and  Accredited Checker engaged in the Compassvale project.  The

schools  have  been found to be safe.  BCA engineers  have  also

checked these schools to ensure that there is no danger from any

design fault or physical defect.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> From what I

read in the newspapers, it is not an architectural problem but a

structural one.  Could the Minister consider releasing the  name

of  the structural consultant so that other owners of buildings,

and  not  of school buildings, can also check on the  safety  of

their buildings.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, since the case of Compassvale is still

under  investigation, it is not advisable to disclose the  names

of the consultants or the engineers who are the checkers at this

point.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> May I then have the assurance

that once all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>

information  is in, and the report is done, the  names  will  be

released  to the public so that private owners of buildings  can

carry  out  their private investigations and evaluation  of  the

safety of their buildings?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> The question should best be answered by the

Minister  for  National  Development because  it  is  under  the

purview of the BCA.

<div align="center"><b>COMPASSVALE PRIMARY SCHOOL ACCIDENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up of Commission of Inquiry)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

National Development if he will consider setting up a Commission

of   Inquiry  to  investigate  the  Compassvale  Primary  School

accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

National  Development  (Assoc. Prof.  Koo  Tsai  Kee)  (for  the

Minister for National Development):  Mr Speaker, Sir, since  the

collapse of the roof of the uncompleted school hall on 15th June

this  year,  the Building and Construction Authority  (BCA)  has

conducted  an  investigation,  and  many  other  investigations.

Their  preliminary findings show that the collapse of  the  roof

was most likely the result of a design error.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA has conducted precautionary checks on buildings

designed or checked by the same individuals responsible for  the

Compassvale  Primary  School.   These  checks  include  physical

inspection  of the buildings for signs of defects.  The  BCA  is

satisfied that all existing schools designed or checked  by  the

same  individuals are safe for occupation.  In other words,  the

individuals responsible for designing Compassvale Primary School

did not commit the same error elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to report that as of today the BCA has

visually  inspected  all  the  362 schools  in  Singapore,  both

Government-aided and Government schools, and has found  them  to

be structurally sound.  We are confident that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>

present  system of building control and checks has  created  and

will  continue to ensure a safe built environment.   The  record

speaks for itself.  In fact, the feedback in the past, and  even

today,  has  been that our system has been overly  cautious  and

stringent.  Nonetheless,  the  BCA  was  asked  to   carry   out

precautionary checks on other similar structures in  schools  to

make  sure that they are absolutely safe.  The BCA will continue

to review the current system to further minimise the possibility

of  accidents  like Compassvale occurring ever again.   The  BCA

will  also  work with the various professional bodies and  other

parties  in the construction industry to safeguard the integrity

of our system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, the Ministry does not see the need to

convene a Commission of Inquiry.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Will the Senior Parliamentary Secretary

also  inform the House whether similar checks are made with  all

buildings,  rather  than  just  schools,  that  this  particular

designer has contributed to the design?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, because of time constraint,

the  BCA enlisted the assistance of the other agencies like  HDB

and  the  corporatised PWDC to check in the first  instance  all

Government  and Government-aided schools.  It will  then  extend

this surveillance to public buildings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for private buildings, it is actually not the BCA's on-going activities to check for their structural integrity. The

Senior Minister of State for Education has already reported that

within  our system all buildings need to be audited structurally

every five or 10 years.  Residential buildings are audited every

10  years, and the others every five years.  Completed buildings

do  not  just collapse overnight.  There will be degradation  in

structures resulting in cracks, subsidence, leakages and  things

like  that.  These will usually be reported by the residents  or

the Town Councils, the principals or whoever is in charge of the

building.   It  is  not necessary to inspect  all  buildings  in

Singapore.  In

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>

any  case,  there are no resources.  We have to  depend  on  the

integrity of the professional engineers who design the buildings

in  the  first  place and the accedited checkers who  check  the

buildings.    Having  said that, I am very  sure  that  all  the

buildings in Singapore are safe.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, may I

follow  up  on  the  question asked by Mdm Claire  Chiang  about

releasing the names of the structural consultants?  We were told

that  it cannot be released.  May I know why not?  What  is  the

reason  for  not  releasing the names?  The second  question  is

this.   We were told that there will be no Commission of Inquiry

but  there is an investigation underfoot.  Has the investigation

been  completed  and  will it be made  public?   When  they  are

completed, will we have a full report?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, while a Commission of

Inquiry   is   not  necessary,  the  BCA  has  done  preliminary

investigations and they would likely prefer charges against  the

engineers or parties involved in the faulty design.  The  Senior

Minister of State for Education did not release the names of the

engineers involved because this is already obvious.  If he  goes

to the school that was under construction, he will see the names

of  the developer, the consultants and the M&E plastered on  the

board.   Because we are taking legal advice from  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers, and there are likely  to  be  some  charges

preferred  against the parties concerned, we would  not  release

their  names in this Parliament.  But if he wants to know  their

names,  he  could just go to the school and he would  see  their

names plastered on the board there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Give the name of the company.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The names of the developer, the

contractor, the M&E engineers, the structural engineers and  the

quantity surveyors are all there.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I want to ask the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary what sort of compensation would be given to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>

foreign  workers who have been hurt in the accident  because  it

seems  that some of them were very seriously injured  and  could

actually have been impaired for life.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, that is a matter for the

Ministry of Manpower to answer.  She may want to file a Question

for the Minister for Manpower to answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask whether the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary   will   answer  my  question  about   releasing   the

investigation report when it is all completed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Yes, of course. Once the

charges  are  preferred the Professional Engineers' Board  would

take  action, and at the same time the Building and Construction

Authority  is likely to prefer charges.  Once these charges  are

made, the due process of appeal must be allowed, and these would

obviously be made public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Since the problem

is  most  likely  due  to design, can the  Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary  tell  the  House whether the person  responsible  has

carried enough insurance policy to cover the losses and damages?

If not, would the Ministry ensure in future that all consultants

should carry the appropriate insurance policy?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> The Professional Engineer must

carry his own professional liability insurance and it is for him

to ensure that he is covered himself.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> I understand from the industry that a

good number of professionals do not carry insurance at all.   If

such   an   accident  occurs  again  when  one  of  the  houses,

condominiums  or  schools collapses and the  contractor  is  not

insured,  the residents will get nothing out of it  because  the

person  can  just  declare himself to be a bankrupt.   Nowadays,

with  the new Bankruptcy Act, after three years, he is all right

again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think your question is hypothetical.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Let this be a lesson for the

professional engineer.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Sir, I am not satisfied with

the answer that we do not need a Commission of Inquiry.  Just by

pure chance, we had averted this disaster, it could have been  a

tragedy.   Therefore, in the interest of the public,  should  we

not  carry  out  this commission?  Because it  has  far-reaching

implication  as  well  on  the building  guidelines  and  public

safety.   If not, could the Senior Parliamentary Secretary  also

clarify  what  level  of disaster must we  reach  to  justify  a

Commission of Inquiry?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while I said

that  a  Commission of Inquiry was not necessary, there  was  an

internal  committee  of inquiry within the BCA  and  within  the

Ministry.   So  we  will find out what is the problem.   We  are

satisfied at this point that the problem is an isolated  one  as

opposed  to  the Hotel New World disaster where a Commission  of

Inquiry was convened.  In that incident, of course, deaths  were

involved, but the nature was different.  In that instance, there

was   a   combination   of   problems  -  design,   maintenance,

construction  -  resulting in a necessity for  a  Commission  of

Inquiry.  In this case, we have isolated the problem.  It is, to

our  mind,  based on our preliminary findings, a clear  case  of

design error.  So it is an isolated one-off accident.  The fault

lies mainly in the designer and probably the checker.  So it  is

not a comprehensive problem that we cannot isolate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  if  his  Ministry has  plans  to  improve  the

dissemination of essential information round the  clock  to  the

public  in an emergency situation like the sudden ban on imports

of  all meat and egg products from Europe; and (b) if there  are

any  economic  defence strategies in place  to  ensure  adequate

ban on imported food from major food supply sources.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Government is committed to  act  rapidly  to

prevent  contaminated  food  from reaching  our  consumers.   We

cannot  afford to take chances when it comes to the  health  and

safety of our people.  Arising from the recent dioxin scare, the

Primary  Production Department (PPD) will work with the Ministry

of  the  Environment  to  review  our  system  of  disseminating

essential  information  to the public.  The  experience  of  the

recent incident will be taken into account.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure a stable and adequate supply of safe primary

foods such as meat and vegetables, PPD has an on-going programme

to  diversify  our external sources of supply of  primary  food.

Imports  are  encouraged from as many countries as possible,  as

long  as  they  are  able  to  meet our  stringent  food  safety

requirements.   This diversification of supply sources  provides

resilience to our primary food supply.  Any shortfall  from  any

one source can be quickly replaced by supply from other approved

sources.

<div align="center"><b>PESTICIDES IN VEGETABLES AND ORGANIC FARMING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b></b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for National

Development what are the safe levels of pesticides in vegetables

and  whether,  in setting guidelines for farms and suppliers  of

vegetables,  he  will also consider allowing and  promoting  the

alternative   of   organic   farming  without   artificial   and

potentially harmful pesticides.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the Primary Production Department

(PPD) closely monitors both imported as well as locally produced

vegetables  to  ensure that they are safe for  consumption.   In

deciding what levels of pesticide residues are safe, PPD  adopts

the  Maximum  Residue  Limits (MRLs) recommended  by  the  Codex

Alimentarius Commission, which is internationally recognised  as

the  authority  on  food safety matters.   Vegetables  found  to

contain   pesticide  residues  in  excess  of  these  MRLs   are

destroyed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for organic farming, PPD has recently tendered out land

which  could  be used for organic vegetable farming.   PPD  will

continue  to  support and render technical assistance  to  farms

that  are interested in organic farming, hydroponics as well  as

conventional soil cultivation of vegetables.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform the House that our local farms are

able  to  produce both pesticide-safe as well as  pesticide-free

vegetables for consumption.  This is because PPD encourages  our

local  farms  to  adopt  good  agricultural  practices  such  as

regulating  the  use  of pesticides and growing  the  vegetables

under   protective  netting  to  reduce  pest  infestations   in

vegetables.   Contrary to perception, vegetables which are grown

with  the  use of pesticides are safe if the farmer  adheres  to

sound agricultural practices.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Malaysian authority claims that the PPD bans the use of

seven  types  of  pesticides  which  are  actually  allowed   in

Malaysia.  They claim that this is a form of non-tariff barrier.

Is there any truth in the allegation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> All I can say is that there is no basis

whatsoever for such an allegation.  PPD's move to impose  strict

controls  and  conditions  is  to  protect  our  consumers  from

exposure  to excessive pesticide levels in vegetables  that  are

imported from Malaysia.  Our local vegetable production accounts

for  something  like 6% of total consumption in  Singapore.   So

that  is  why  we  have  to  import vegetables  from  almost  40

countries.  In the last count, it was 39 countries.   So  really

it  is not in our interest and neither is it our policy to erect

non-tariff barriers for vegetables or for any other product  for

that matter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the reports from the media are that the

Government's practice is to allow a certain percentage above the

limit set.  I think a figure of 20% has been suggested.  If this

is  so, why is this so?  Why do we allow a variance of 20% above

the limit we set?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can I remind the Member that the

question should not be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>

based  on  reports  in the media?  Could you ask  your  question

again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, if I may simplify then. Is there a

variance  allowed  on  the  limits  that  we  set?   The  second

supplementary  question is: is the Minister convinced  that  our

standards  are  consistent with the Sanitary  and  Phytosanitary

Agreement under the WTO?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in so far as the limits are

concerned,  as  I  explained earlier, there are  certain  limits

which  are set by internationally recognised bodies such as  the

Codex  Alimentarius Commission.  They specify  different  limits

for  different  types  of pesticides.  For example,  there  were

reports  that we do not allow certain pesticides to be  used  in

Singapore whereas they are allowed in other countries.  In those

cases,  what happened was that these pesticides have zero  MRLs,

perhaps  because the Commission feels that these are  much  more

dangerous  than  the  other pesticides.   So  whichever  MRL  is

specified by the international commission, that is the level  we

adopt.   The  next  step is to do sampling or  random  tests  on

consignments that come in.  All the consignments that  come  in,

that   are  imported  into  Singapore  from  whichever   country

(Malaysia,  Indonesia, Australia, and so  on),  are  subject  to

quality control tests.  And the rule of thumb by the PPD is that

not  more  than 5% of the samples that are tested should  exceed

these  limits.   So  there  is  a  margin  of  error  built  in.

Obviously,  it is not possible to completely eliminate  all  the

contaminated batches, so there is a sampling error allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finding so far has been that the batches from Malaysia

have  exceeded this 5% guideline.  In fact, it has gone as  high

as  30%, 40% for some species of vegetables.  This is the reason

why  with effect from 1st July, the PPD has implemented  a  much

more  stringent checking and testing procedure to try and  focus

on  some  of  these more, should I say, "dangerous"  vegetables.

There  are  about  22  of them, out of 100 vegetables  that  are

imported into Singapore that are subject now to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>

these  new  regulations.  In fact, the result shows  that  as  a

result of these very stringent checks, we have been seeing  much

cleaner batches of vegetables coming in over the last two  weeks

or  so.   It is a little bit too early to tell.  But I think  we

should persevere with these more stringent checks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the other question about whether they violate any WTO

regulations, the answer obviously is no.  These are checks which

are  necessary in order to protect the health and safety of  our

consumers, and I think every country practises this to a greater

or lesser degree.

<div align="center"><b>SELECTIVE EN-BLOC REDEVELOPMENT SCHEME IN HILLVIEW ESTATE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether he is willing to exclude the three  Housing

and  Development Board point block flats, namely Blocks  12,  13

and   14   of  Hillview  Estate,  from  the  Selective   En-bloc

Redevelopment Scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Selective En-bloc

Redevelopment  Scheme (SERS) is a "win-win" situation  for  both

the  nation  as a whole and the affected residents.  With  SERS,

the Government can renew and rejuvenate older HDB estates.  More

flats of improved design can be built to make better use of  our

limited  land.   This  will  also encourage  and  allow  younger

families to move into these older estates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affected residents enjoy many benefits under SERS.

They  can  move to newer and better HDB flats, with a fresh  99-year  lease, at subsidised selling prices.  They are also  given

market  compensation for their existing flats as at the time  of

announcement  of SERS.  Those who are eligible  to  buy  a  flat

directly from HDB can enjoy a further 20% discount, subject to a

maximum  of  $30,000, off the selling prices of the  replacement

flats.   In  addition, SERS lessees need not move out  of  their

existing flats until their replacement flats

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>

are  ready.  In most instances, the replacement flats are  built

in  close proximity to their existing flats so they do not  have

to move out of the neighbourhood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of SERS in 1995, 31 sites involving

some  12,500 HDB sold flats have been identified for the Scheme.

They  are  located in the older HDB estates such as  Queenstown,

Bukit  Merah, Bedok, Jurong, Toa Payoh, Kallang/Whampoa and  the

Central  Area.   SERS  has been well received  by  the  affected

lessees in these precincts.  For all the SERS sites announced so

far,  the  average support level from affected lessees is  above

90%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SERS for Hillview Estate was announced on 21st March

1999.   It  involves the entire Hillview Estate,  comprising  12

sold   apartment  blocks,  one  rental  apartment   block,   the

neighbourhood centre and the Bukit Gombak Community Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducted a survey among the affected flat lessees

after the announcement.  As at 28th June 1999, 86% of them  have

responded to the survey.  Of these, 86% are in support of  SERS.

Among  the five-roomers at Blocks 12 to 14, 70% supported  SERS.

The scheme has clear support from the majority of residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I understand that a small group of residents

are unhappy with the scheme for various reasons.  The Government

will  do whatever it can to ensure that they are treated  fairly

and will try to help them resolve their problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Government will proceed with the original

plan  to include the three 5-room blocks at Blocks 12 to  14  in

the redevelopment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first of all, I wish to thank the Minister for a  positive

answer.   I believe that this answer will satisfy the wishes  of

the  residents of Hillview Estate.   I would like to raise a few

questions with the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, for the replacement flats, can the Minister

consider building bigger flats,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>

such as  the 4-room or 5-room flats, to satisfy the needs of the

residents?  Secondly, can the resale levies be packaged in  some

way  to  lighten the burden of the residents?  Thirdly, can  the

single residents also enjoy the discount in the purchase of  the

replacement flats? Fourthly, can some coffeeshops and shophouses

be  built  in  the replacement flat precinct to  provide  better

services to the residents?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, since the announcement of the SERS

programme  at Hillview Estate in March and also the announcement

of the Tronoh Road redevelopment, both the MPs, Mr Ang Mong Seng

as  well  as  Dr Lee Boon Yang, have met with the residents  and

given very valuable feedback to HDB on the concerns and requests

of the residents.  In view of the MPs' feedback, my Ministry has

decided to fine-tune the SERS programme for these two sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes are as follows. First of all, on the question

of flat sizes.  HDB will be providing some 4-room and 5-room new

replacement flats which will have slightly bigger floor areas to

match the current flat sizes in these two areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the premium and levy, to help the

residents  affected by the HDB's revised resale levy policy,  my

Ministry has decided to give them the option to pay the standard

20%  premium  on the selling price of the replacement  flats  in

view  of the revised resale levy.  This would help some  of  the

residents pay a lower amount.  The resale premium will  also  be

incorporated  as  part of the selling price of  the  replacement

flat.   In  this way, it can be paid either through the Members'

CPF  accounts or they can get a mortgage loan from  HDB  to  pay

this  amount.   Those who opt to pay the resale  levy  can  also

contra  the payment from the compensation that they will receive

for  the  sale of their existing flats.  So this is in  lieu  of

paying cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further help their cashflow, my Ministry will also allow

affected residents who are liable for resale premium or deferred

levy to pay only $30,000 of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>

premium  or  levy  upfront.  The rest  of  the  amount  will  be

deferred.   This will be held as a contingent liability  by  the

HDB  which  will only need to be paid if and when they  sell  or

transfer  the  replacement  flat allocated  under  SERS.   As  a

goodwill  gesture, HDB will not charge interest on the  deferred

amount.  These concessions are also extended to affected lessees

in  other  SERS sites announced earlier if they are in the  same

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the question of mortgage loan, HDB will also be

considering  on  a  case-by-case basis to  provide  up  to  100%

mortgage  loan for the purchase of replacement flats.  HDB  will

give fuller details of these changes later on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for SERS lessees who are singles, HDB has decided that

it  will  not extend the full rehousing benefits to them because

as  it  is,  under SERS, singles are already enjoying some  very

major concessions.  For example, they are now able to get a  new

replacement  flat  as a single lessee and this  new  replacement

flat  will  of  course be at subsidised prices.  They  are  also

allowed  to  buy  a new 4-room flat and, as the  Member  may  be

aware,  under normal circumstances, singles are not eligible  to

buy  a  new flat directly from HDB and even then, they can  only

buy up to a 3-room resale flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked about shops in the area. The

assessment of HDB is that in the new redeveloped area, there are

sufficient  shops  and  eating houses in  the  vicinity  of  the

replacement  site.   So  HDB  has  not  planned  to  build   any

commercial  facilities  there.  But  in  view  of  the  Member's

appeal, I will ask HDB to look into the feasibility of providing

a few shops in the area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, these three blocks

of  flats  are point block flats.  They have 25 levels each  and

are  densely occupied.  Also, Sir, there are precedents in other

places,  which have been compulsorily acquired, where the  point

block  flats  are left alone.  For example, at  Depot  Road  and

Teochew Street, the point block flats which are densely occupied

are not demolished.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can you proceed with your question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> My question is, in view of the fact

that HDB is going to use the land at Hillview Estate intensively

and that these point block flats are already an intensive use of

the land, why can they not be left alone?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the first point that Mr Chiam made

was  that  these flats are already densely built  and  therefore

they  should  be left alone.  That is not the only consideration

in  so  far  as  the  redevelopment of the  Hillview  Estate  is

concerned.   If  Mr Chiam is familiar with Hillview  Estate,  he

will realise that that estate is quite separate from the rest of

the  estate.  So one of the considerations has been that if  the

three  point block flats are left remaining behind as HDB flats,

the  maintenance and redevelopment of the area will  not  be  as

optimal as they should be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also complaints about the flats in the area in so

far  as the condition of the flats is concerned.  Many residents

have  given feedback to the Member of Parliament that there  are

problems  with maintenance, public transport facilities  in  the

area,  and so on.  So this is the other consideration  that  was

taken  into account in the overall redevelopment of the  estate.

It is of course not a hard and fast rule because it depends very

much  on different estates in different areas.  Indeed, Mr Chiam

mentioned  two  other places where point block  flats  were  not

involved  in SERS.  So it really depends on what the  plans  are

for  the  overall  redevelopment of the estate and  whether  the

existence   of  these  point  block  flats  would   hinder   the

redevelopment plans.  It is for these reasons that consideration

was  given  to the inclusion of the three point block  flats  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, of course, ultimately, when the

residents  were polled for their response to the SERS programme,

the  response in these point block flats also indicated that the

clear  majority of the residents do support the SERS  programme.

There are some residents I know in the point block flats who are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>

against the redevelopment of their blocks.  However, we have  to

bear  in  mind  that  the  whole  SERS  programme  is  a  public

redevelopment programme that is intended to generate benefits to

the  majority  of the residents as well as to the nation.   Yes,

there  are  some people who are against the SERS scheme.   As  I

have indicated earlier, we will try our best to mitigate some of

their concerns.  But it is not possible for us to stop the  SERS

programme for these three blocks just because of a few residents

who are against the scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I do not know how the Minister

arrived  at  this 70% approval.  But from our own  research,  we

found  that  almost everyone we approached was not  happy  about

moving out from these point block flats.  They stand to lose  an

average ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can I ask you to proceed to your

supplementary question.  You appear to be making a speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am coming to my question, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you please proceed right away to your

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, as far as we know, most of these

residents  at  the point block flats are unhappy  because  their

compensation  is only $300,000 and many of them  bought  at  the

resale  value  of  $360,000  for a  start.   They  already  lose

$60,000.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, if you have no question, I will ask

you to resume your seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I have a question, Sir. I would like

to  ask  when would these buildings be demolished.  I just  want

another  clarification.  He said that the floor  area  would  be

bigger.   Is  this  in respect of the new flats  that  they  are

moving to or the ones that are going to be rebuilt?  If they are

going  to  be  for  the rebuilt flats, it does not  benefit  the

residents there now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Let me try and answer Mr Chiam's

questions.  The first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>

one  is  on the support level.  What HDB does is to send  out  a

survey form to each of the residents and the residents are asked

to  indicate, among other things, whether they support the  SERS

scheme  and  also  what  kind of flat types  they  want  in  the

replacement site.  This is to facilitate the planning for  flats

in  the replacement site. The returns are collected and collated

by  HDB and that is how we get the 70%.  It is not a figment  of

my  imagination.  It is part of a survey done by HDB.  It is  in

writing  and  all the residents actually signed the returns  and

indicated in writing whether they support or otherwise.   So  it

is, I believe, a fairly reliable indicator of the support level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that he made is that residents who had

bought  at  $360,000 will now get compensation of  $300,000.   I

think  that  is  only half the story.  If he  goes  into  it  in

greater  detail, he will find that the majority of the residents

will  come out very much ahead.  They will get a new flat.  They

will get a flat which has got a brand new lease.  They will  get

a  new  subsidised  flat  in a better area.   They  will  get  a

discount  of  20% over and above all that, plus  all  the  other

benefits.   It is a deal which is simply too good to refuse  for

many  people.  But there are a few, as I have indicated earlier,

who  may still not be happy with the total package.  We will try

and help them.  But, by and large, the majority of the residents

do  benefit  from  the SERS scheme and that  is  indicated  very

clearly  by the kind of written support level that we have  been

getting over the last 30-over sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as floor areas are concerned, it is for the new

replacement  flats  because there were some  concerns  that  the

replacement  flats  in  some cases may  be  too  small  for  the

residents  in  Hillview Estate.  Mr Ang Mong  Seng  did  make  a

representation and HDB has found it possible to build a  few  of

these  larger flats.  Not everybody would be interested in these

flats, but for a few of them who are interested, HDB has found a

way  to  cater to their interest.  So these are for  replacement

flats, not for the existing flats.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would HDB consider building larger

flats in new estates if there is such a demand?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Very good question. I have asked HDB that

myself.   The  design of the new estates will take into  account

the  demands for the new flat types that are being requested  by

residents, not just the size of the flat but also the pricing of

the flat.  So in this regard, the sizes that are being built  in

the  new  estates are just right, not only in terms of household

family  size, but also in terms of pricing.  We can build  flats

which are much larger than what they are today.  But at the  end

of  the day, there are so many types of flats and so many number

of  flats  that we can build of that particular  size.   We  can

build  all  5-room flats of 150 sq metres.  But  there  will  be

fewer 5-room flats for us to build.  Then what?  After that, the

MP  will  come back and make a representation on behalf  of  his

residents who cannot get flats.  Our policy is very simple.   We

will  try  and house as many Singaporeans as possible  in  flats

which are comfortable, which meet their requirements and, at the

same time, are affordable.  These are the key criteria.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Three more supplementary questions,

Sir.   First,  when  will  these residents  have  to  move  out?

Second,  for  the  point  block flats,  will  HDB  review  their

compensation  rate?  And third, I believe in  the  last  general

elections, the residents there were promised upgrading.  Did HDB

inform the PAP candidate there that there would be upgrading?

<div align="center"><b>SULTAN HUSSAIN (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the former Minister for

Information  and the Arts had announced in this  House  on  12th

March  1999  that  the Government planned  to  develop  a  Malay

Heritage  Centre which would involve conserving and redeveloping

the Istana Kampong Glam and the adjoining Lot 53.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also recall that on 15th April 1999, I

informed  the  House  of the Government's proposed  new  payment

scheme under the Sultan Hussain Ordinance.  This Bill is to give

effect to that proposed new scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained in this House on 15th April 1999, there are

some  79  beneficiaries  who are receiving  payments  under  the

Ordinance, many of whom are not residing in Singapore.  Of those

who are residents in Singapore, only a handful (14) are actually

living  in the former Istana Kampong Glam.  The former  Minister

for National Development, Mr S Dhanabalan, had explained to this

House  on 12th March 1991 that the Kampong Glam Estate including

the  former Istana had reverted to the State as confirmed by the

Court of Appeal in 1897.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sultan Hussain Ordinance was enacted to take care of

the financial needs of the late Sultan Hussain's family at that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>

time.   Since  then,  the number of beneficiaries  has  steadily

increased  and the payments have been diminishing as the  income

from  which  the  payments were made declined.   The  individual

payments  would become even smaller over time if the  number  of

beneficiaries  increases.  The Government had therefore  decided

to  implement  a new scheme that would work to the advantage  of

the  beneficiaries.   Under  this scheme,  the  Government  will

increase the amount of payment from the current level of $29,231

per annum to $350,000 per annum, which is more than 10 times the

current annual payment.  This revised sum will be maintained for

a  fixed  period  of  30 years, starting  from  this  year.   In

addition,  the Government will offer any beneficiary the  option

of  receiving a lump sum payment up-front instead.  The lump sum

would  be equivalent to the present value of the 30-year payment

stream.  From the beneficiaries' point of view, this would  work

out to be more advantageous than the current system of receiving

a dwindling annual sum indefinitely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office has informed all the beneficiaries of the

proposed  new  scheme.  So far, an overwhelming majority  of  64

beneficiaries  or  81% have informed the Land Office  that  they

wish  to opt for lump sum payment.  When the amendments  to  the

Ordinance  come  into  force,  payments  can  be  made  to   the

beneficiaries  who have opted for a lump sum payment  under  the

new scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to the actual provisions of the Bill, new

section 4A enables the establishment of the proposed new payment

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed scheme will apply to members of the family of

the late Sultan Hussain who, before 4th May 1999, were receiving

an annuity under the Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 4A provides that sections 3 and 4 of the main

Ordinance  shall cease to have effect on the day the new  scheme

is  established.   What this means, Sir, is  that  the  existing

scheme of payments will cease upon the establishment of the  new

improved scheme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing section 4 of the main Ordinance also contains

the declaration that the lands in Kampong Glam were Crown lands.

The  amending  Bill  does  not in  any  way  derogate  from  the

legislative  effect of that declaration.  That  declaration  had

come  into  effect when the Ordinance was enacted in 1904.   The

lands remain as State lands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 4A also provides for regulations to be made

for the detailed implementation of the new scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof) (In  Malay):   Mr

Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join in

the  debate.   I support the proposed Sultan Hussain (Amendment)

Bill  1999  tabled by the Minister for Law and wish to  give  my

opinion on the Malay Heritage Centre project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law, in his speech in Parliament on 15th

April,  mentioned about the new payment scheme under the  Sultan

Hussain   Ordinance.   Today's  debate  is  held  to  pass   the

Ordinance.   I  support that this scheme  be  enforced  for  the

benefit of its recipients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy when I heard the Minister's statement that the

majority (64 people or 81%) of the descendants had informed  the

Land Office that they had opted to receive lump sum payments.  I

believe they have made careful consideration on the advantage of

the  option  over  annual payments.  The  increasing  number  of

descendants  and  inflation have caused the annual  payments  to

decrease  to  an  insignificant sum.  They must have  definitely

considered this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in my opinion, the offer under the new scheme

is  very  attractive, especially on the lump sum payment option.

At  a  rough estimate, the payment under the new scheme, if paid

annually, will total about $10.5 million.  (This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>

based  on  an  annuity of $350,000 annually for 30  years.)   If

shared among 79 people, it means every person will receive about

$133,000 each.  We are also told that a majority of them do  not

even live in Singapore.  (If some of them live in Malaysia, this

means that they will receive about RM$295,000).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount is not small. I am confident that such a hefty

sum  is  offered  based on the Government's spirit  of  goodwill

towards  the  descendants.   This  is  in  accordance  with  the

original  spirit  of  the  formulation  of  the  Sultan  Hussain

Ordinance,  which  is to meet the financial needs  of  the  late

Sultan Hussain and his descendants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the main issue that emerges from this proposed

amendment  is actually connected to new section 4 which  retains

the  declaration that lands, as mentioned in one part of the old

section 4, in the Kampong Glam area remain as lands belonging to

the  British  government (Crown lands).  The Minister  has  said

that  the Bill that was tabled does not in any way derogate from

the  legislative effect of that part of section 4  which  states

that  these  lands are Crown lands.  This section   took  effect

when the Ordinance was drawn up a long time ago and hence, these

lands now remain as State land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the legal position, whether of the original

law or the amended one, is clear, that these lands are no longer

the  property  of any descendants of Sultan Hussain.   This  was

decided  by  the  Court of Appeal in 1897 and remains  effective

today.   As  far  as I am aware, the legitimacy has  never  been

challenged in court in the last 100 years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the issue is very clear, I am disappointed to find

that  there are certain quarters in Malaysia who have taken  the

opportunity  to  try  to confuse public  opinion  in  their  own

interest and for their own benefit.  I refer to Malaysian TV and

print media that distort facts, coming up with what is not there

and  burying  the  truth.   After the Government  announced  the

Kampong  Glam Malay Heritage Centre project, it seems  that  the

media in that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>

country  is  very enthusiastic in having coverage of the  issue.

What  disappoints me is that most of the news reported  are  not

true.  Among those reported are, first, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Residents also reject the government's offer to pay

US$350,000  (RM782,340) to them in the period of 30  years.'   - Utusan Malaysia, 3rd May 1999, page 19.



This  is totally incorrect.  The actual amount is S$350,000  per

year  for 30 years, and the total amount is estimated at  S$10.5

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, that the Istana Kampong Glam, "Singapore's last

Malay  bastion  will  be destroyed"  -   front  page  of  Utusan

Malaysia,  13th  May  1999.   We, in Singapore,  know  that  the

Government  will  spend  millions of  dollars  to  conserve  and

restore Istana Kampong Glam as a Malay Heritage Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Mingguan Malaysia dated 9th May 1999, pages 24 and

25, published a two-page article entitled "The disappearance  of

Singapore's  Malay  bastion"  and  "300  descendants  of  Sultan

Hussain  refuse to move out to preserve the historical  heritage

of  the  Malay  sultanate."  It quoted someone saying  that  the

Istana  Kampong Glam project would end and erase the  historical

heritage  of  the  Singapore Malay sultanate.    Fourth,  Utusan

Malaysia, 14th May 1999, published a letter from a reader  named

Zia-Ul-Arief with a sensational news headline, "Singapore  wants

the  history of Malay supremacy to vanish" on page  7.   Let  me

quote some of the fiery words used:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Istana Kampong Glam episode in Singapore is a tragic

incident  about the fate of the Malay race.  It is not about  an

old  building being demolished for development purposes  but   a

final  episode  to eliminate the history of Malay  supremacy  in

Singapore."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Singapore's intention to build the Singapore Malay

Heritage Centre is merely an excuse.  To it, the Malays have  no

right to step in Singapore.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Finally, the Malays in Temasek will disappear with time.'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Malay community must realise and understand. If the

Malay  race  is  destroyed, our supremacy in this  country  will

vanish.   Perhaps the words of Hang Tuah that 'the  Malays  will

not  disappear from the world'  will not be a reality in Temasek

and our homeland.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I find such words are highly inflammatory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, Awang Sulung in his column Bisik-bisik or Whispers

in  Utusan Malaysia and Utusan Melayu dated 4th June, made these

comments:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As expected, the descendants of Sultan Hussain Shah who

live  in  Istana Kampong Glam in Singapore will not be  able  to

bear  up  for  long  in their struggle to defend  their  istana.

Instead,  they  will have to be content with  some  compensation

that does not match their position as descendants of the sultan.

Therefore,  they  have  to  move from  a  "palace"  to  ordinary

people's  flat.   Thus, that is the end of the  last  symbol  of

Malay  supremacy in the republic once known as Temasek.  Nothing

can  change  the  situation.  The glory of the  past  will  only

remain a sad memory.  What could be useful to ponder now at this

sad moment is why the Singapore Malays become like that.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, the word "seize" was used repeatedly in several of

their reports.  A commentator of the Analisis programme  by  TV3

which  was  telecast on Wednesday, 30th June at 7.30  pm,  which

could be viewed by Singaporeans, made the same allegation.   The

TV  programme commentator accused the development of  the  Malay

Heritage Centre as "a subtle move to abolish the only symbol  of

Malay  glory  in Singapore."  Mr Speaker, these allegations  and

statements are untruths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, the TV3 commentator also claimed that, "the

Singapore Government suddenly seized the Istana and evicted  the

approximately 300 residents around the Istana."   She  added  by

saying,  "the  now powerless descendants of Sultan  Hussain  are

being   trapped  by  the  PAP's  urbanisation  and  resettlement

policies.   It is made an excuse to acquire the Malay  sultanate

land   or   clearly,  Malay  rights."   Sir,   this   is   gross

mispresentation of facts.  The fact is that the former  Minister

for  Information and the Arts, BG George Yeo, had announced  the

formation of a committee to study the development of the  Istana

Kampong Glam as a Malay Heritage Centre as early as seven years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>

ago.   As  far  as  I can remember, the number of  residents  of

Istana Kampong Glam that are affected by the resettlement is 170

persons,  not  300, as claimed.  Why do they have  to  lie?   Mr

Speaker, we know what is going on by the look of things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighth, is it appropriate for Zain Mahmud, an ex-senior

officer in the former Radio and Television Singapore who is  now

a Malaysian citizen, to write in MASSA (issue of 26th June 1999)

saying,  "Singapore  forces the heirs of the  former  Sultan  of

Singapore  to break up and move to flats to enable the inherited

Istana  to be made into a Malay Heritage Centre.  Could this  be

seen  as  a move to put the Malays into the museum?"  Are  these

words not mischievous,  to say the least?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the list of media reports which I quoted

earlier shows that they have an axe to grind.  The setting up of

the  Malay  Heritage Centre at Istana Kampong Glam  is  part  of

Singapore's  national  project.  The problem  arising  from  the

resettlement of Istana Kampong Glam's residents is  an  internal

affair  of  Singapore.   Such false and  distorted  articles  on

sensitive matters, on our internal matters are trying to sow the

seed  of  discord and stir up ill feelings between  races  in  a

multi-racial  Singapore.   Singaporeans  have  to  be   vigilant

against  such attempts.  We in Singapore must not be trapped  by

their  remarks because we in Singapore know the facts,  and  are

aware of the truth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me add that these acts of interference in

our  internal affairs were made at a time when their leaders and

their  media took exception and strongly criticised the Business

Times editorial recently, while at the same time they were doing

what  they  were  condemning.  Is this not  sheer  hypocrisy  or

double standards?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Malay Heritage Centre has actually

received wide support of the Malay community.  Allow me to quote

the  words  of  Haji Ridzwan Dzafir, the Chairman of  the  Malay

Heritage Foundation, last Friday in Berita Harian:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Malay community accepts the proposal well. This is a

major  opportunity  for  us to develop a Malay  Heritage  Centre

based  on  our  own  knowledge, and we will  also  invite  Malay

experts  in  all areas of history.  We will surely  be  able  to

manage it well.'

<br><br>I  have  not  actually heard the Malay population  in  Singapore

expressing  their  displeasure  on  the  Malay  Heritage  Centre

project   in   Istana   Kampong  Glam.    The   willingness   of

distinguished,    highly   qualified   and    independent-minded

professionals  to  sit on the Board of Directors  of  the  Malay

Heritage  Centre  is proof of the strong support  of  the  Malay

community for the project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should not lose sight of the underlying

reasons for the setting up of the Malay Heritage Centre and  why

the  Istana  Kampong  Glam was chosen as the  site.   The  Malay

Heritage  Centre is intended to complement the  museums  of  the

National  Heritage  Board.   It will  capture  the  history  and

cultural  heritage  of  the Malays in Singapore  and  trace  its

linkages with kinsmen in this region and beyond.  Personally,  I

see it as our way of showing respect for the past, including the

history  of the Malay sultanate, just as we appreciate our  past

by not changing the names of our roads and streets, because they

are  part of our heritage.  It is also our way of preserving our

culture  and  heritage and to share it with fellow Singaporeans,

people in this region and the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not forget that Istana Kampong Glam is located in

the  midst  of a historic area bordered by Rochore  Road,  Beach

Road, Jalan Sultan and Victoria Street.  Its choice as the Malay

Heritage Centre itself is an opportunity to turn it into a major

landmark.   For  it  was  an area that  had  located  the  Malay

Sultanate.   It  was  also a place, the vicinity  of  which  had

witnessed  the birth of Malay/Muslim entrepreneurs, businessmen,

writers,  printers,  haj agencies, together  with  the  rise  of

Muslim  education  centres, publishing  houses,  a  place  where

songkoks  were made, Malay leather slipper-making, polishing  of

diamonds,  sailing and accommodation of travellers.  It  is  the

heartbeat  of the Malays of the olden days.  This is the  spirit

we wish to revive as we face the new millennium.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Sultan Hussain (Amendment) Bill proposed by

the  Minister for Law based on the explanation and clarification

made  by  him  when  he  brought forward the  proposed  Bill  in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the proposal was read in Parliament, I went down to

various  coffeeshops, hawker centres and places of  worship.   I

found  out  that not even one member of the Malay  community  in

Singapore  questioned  the status of the  Istana  Kampong  Glam.

Only  a  handful  of  individuals wanted to  know  the  type  of

compensation to be given to the rightful descendants  of  Sultan

Hussain.   The  majority of them welcomed the  proposal  by  the

Minister  for  Law because the Malay community had long  thought

that  the  Government has to do something about  Istana  Kampong

Glam.    They  also  wanted  to  know  whether  the   cost   for

refurbishing and preserving the Istana is sufficient and how the

Malay community could raise funds for the Malay Heritage Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, I wish to pose several questions to the

Minister  for  Law.  Even though we have  heard  about  the  new

payment scheme mentioned by Mr Yatiman Yusof, I believe that  it

would  be  much  better if the Minister for  Law  himself  could

explain further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Am I right that the proposal made by the Minister is in

accordance  with the law and not based on the whims and  fancies

without  taking  any  consideration  of  the  interest  of   the

descendants of Sultan Hussain?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is it true that the descendants of Sultan Hussain are

forced to move out without being fairly compensated?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Is it true that they have been poorly compensated?

Perhaps  the  Minister  can  give us  some  information  on  the

resettlement progress.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, slanted and distorted reports in the newspapers and

television in Malaysia, particularly a TV3 programme  which  was

telecast  on  30th  June 1999, appear to have the  objective  of

bringing about uncomfortable feelings among the Malay community.

Also,  there  will be bad elements from those outside  Singapore

wanting  to  shake  our racial harmony through  their  atrocious

articles and statements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who wish to do such a thing should realise that

Singapore Malays value the importance of education and  tertiary

learning.  Do  not  make the Malays as pawns in  their  game  of

chess.   We  have  learnt a lot from past experience  where  the

words  "race"  and "religion" had been used by certain  quarters

for their interest. The Singapore Malays are now open-minded and

rational in their thinking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign media, whether in print or electronic, should

not  interfere  with  the internal affairs of  Singapore.   When

Singapore  newspapers  made inadvertent  mistakes  in  reporting

about  their country, not only their media were angry  but  also

their  leaders  will condemn Singapore and insinuate  about  our

leaders.   It  is best that the media of the said  country  find

ways to overcome their problems pertaining to housing, drugs  or

the  education  of the Malay community as voiced  out  by  their

leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Malay community is aware of the game played

by  the  media of our neighbour.  Remember, the Singapore Malays

are not the pawns in the game of chess of the said country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the amendment to the Sultan Hussain Ordinance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Member of Parliament for Kampong Glam,

obviously I have a very keen interest in the issue of this  very

sensitive and delicate nature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In introducing the new scheme for the payment of annuity or

commuted gratuity

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>

to  the  family  of the late Sultan Hussain, the Government  has

increased  the quantum from $250,000, last revised in  1991,  to

$350,000  this year.  This amount is fixed for a  period  of  30

years.   The  eligible  persons are also  given  the  option  of

receiving a lump sum payment upfront.  The next-of-kin or estate

is  assured  of  the  annuity even on the death  of  the  person

eligible for payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known from the long established records that the

intention of the Sultan Hussain Ordinance enacted in 1904 was to

take  care  of  the financial needs of the family  of  the  late

Sultan  Hussain at that time.  I think the emphasis is "at  that

time".   The  then  British  Governor described  them  as  "very

improvident people".  These payments were not intended to be  in

perpetuity  but  made  only to the family  of  the  late  Sultan

Hussain at the time the Ordinance was enacted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been generous in continuing with the

practice   of  paying  the  allowance  even  to  the  subsequent

generations  of the late Sultan Hussain's family.  This  payment

of  allowance  should  have  stopped with  the  original  family

members  at the time of 1904.  Many descendants could have  been

better  off  over the years and are no longer improvident.   Yet

the  Government continues to pay them the allowance irrespective

of  their wealth and status.  A number of beneficiaries also  no

longer  reside in Singapore, yet the Government gives  them  the

allowance regardless of where they are.  In fact, our Government

has  done more than meeting its basic legal obligations  to  the

family  of  the late Sultan Hussain.  The gesture  and  goodwill

demonstrated by our Government reflects its care and concern for

the well being of the late Sultan Hussain's family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my two colleagues have alluded to earlier about the

Malaysian  media, the Malaysian TV3 Malay programme,  Viewpoint,

did  the  interview  with the Chairman of  the  Singapore  Malay

Heritage Foundation, Mr Ridzwan Dzafir on 10th June

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>

1999.  The  topic discussed was the redevelopment of the  former

Istana  Kampong Glam as the Malay Heritage Centre.  I  have  the

opportunity  to  read  the  full  transcript  of  Mr   Ridzwan's

interview.   It is amazing how TV3 has distorted a  very  candid

and honest expression of the vision of the Malay Heritage Centre

in Singapore.  Through selective quotation, TV3 has done a great

disservice   to  their  Malay  viewers  both  in  Malaysia   and

Singapore.    Clearly,  the  Malaysian  TV  channel   has   been

mischievous, misleading and provocative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are aware, the Malaysian political leaders took

umbrage  at  the  Business Times' editorial on  the  subject  of

political  succession  in  Malaysia  when  commenting   on   the

forthcoming Malaysian general elections.  Singapore leaders must

also  express our disgust at TV3 for incorrectly and  improperly

depicting  the redevelopment of Istana Kampong Glam to  a  Malay

Heritage  Centre  as  an issue of Malay  rights.   Perhaps,  the

Malaysian Malays are fearful that Singaporeans would do a better

job  in promoting Malay culture, history and tradition with  our

Malay Heritage Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore do not wish to interfere with the domestic

politics  in Malaysia.  This is in line with what the  Malaysian

political  leaders  had asked our media not  to  interfere  with

theirs.  The Chinese community in Singapore has been careful not

to  champion  or speak out against the Malaysian authorities  on

Malaysian  Chinese issues, whether on Kampong  Cina  or  Chinese

ancestral  places in Malacca, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh or Penang.   It

is  important that the media on both sides be considerate not to

interfere in the domestic politics in each neighbouring country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it instructive to learn from the interview that many

in  the Malay community in Singapore are made up of Arab, Indian

and  even Chinese origins.  Even as the Singapore Malay  leaders

express  concern  over the trend of young  Malays  knowing  very

little  about  Malay culture and history in Singapore,  we  also

have a new generation of young

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>

non-Malay  Singaporeans  who do not speak  and  understand  even

simple Malay.  The Malay Heritage Centre will not only serve  to

educate young Malays but will also promote better knowledge  and

understanding  in the Malay heritage among Chinese,  Indian  and

other  Singaporeans.  We must continue to work hard  to  promote

and  sustain  the inter-racial harmony into the  psyche  of  the

future generations of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a number of residents of Istana Kampong Glam have

received  resettlement notices.  I wish to  find  out  from  the

Minister the progress of the resettlement exercise of my Kampong

Glam  residents.   Are  all residents  in  Istana  Kampong  Glam

eligible for their resettlement benefits?  Will they be able  to

afford the HDB flats with the resettlement benefits given?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can give us an update of the

resettlement of the Istana Kampong Glam residents.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been many discussions, both in Singapore

and  quite surprisingly and cheekily across the Causeway,  about

the  many implications of this Bill.  But I would like to  touch

on  a  few  issues that were not covered by perhaps the previous

three speakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the overall intention of the Bill, that is, to

support  the overall conservation and preservation of the  area,

and specifically Istana Kampong Glam.  But here I would like  to

give four points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I think this is not about the interest of the

descendants of the late Sultan Hussain.  This is also not  about

the  interest of the Malay community.  I think this is about the

interest of Singaporeans as a whole.  All Singaporeans  have  an

interest in that area, in Istana Kampong Glam, because it is our

shared  heritage of past history which we want to  preserve,  to

reflect and share not only to record the historical developments

of this country

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>

but also as preservation for our future generations.  So this is

about Singapore as a whole.  The development of Singapore is not

just  the  role played by Singaporeans.  It has been  played  by

many people in the region, including the Sultanate of Johor, who

are  still  in  Johor Baru, in Malaysia, including other  people

from  India,  from countries as far as Arabia,  China,  Myanmar,

including  the  British interest.  And here I want  to  make  it

clear  that  in  the best interest of these people  who  are  no

longer Singaporeans, whether British interest or state of  Johor

and  their  descendants, the best is in  keeping  this  interest

alive,  by  making  sure that the historical  improvements,  the

redevelopment of the Malay Heritage Centre, are done well,  that

will reflect their role in the development of Singapore.  To  do

otherwise, to sabotage and cast all types of allegations is  not

serving  their  best  interest, let  alone  our  own  collective

interest.   And this is where I appeal to all parties  who  have

made statements, including Singaporeans, to see this in a larger

perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that this project represents an

opportunity.  Some people have forgotten that, and that is,  the

whole  purpose of the Heritage Centre cannot be achieved without

the  cooperation of the people I have mentioned, who have  taken

part  in this historical development of Singapore.  In order  to

make  it  more than just a museum, but a living archive  of  our

past, we need the cooperation of the Sultanate of Johor and  the

many descendants all around to be part of this project.  I think

it  represents  a  wonderful opportunity for all  of  us.   That

spirit of opportunity and cooperation has been lost because each

of them has got his own specific interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to stress is that there is also a

role for the descendants themselves.  I think there is fear that

by  the  time they are compensated, and relocated, they  do  not

have  a  role.   Today,  many of them are staying  there.   They

actually,  I understand, do still continue to practise  some  of

their very unique court customs and traditions.  And, really,  I

think  they have a very large role to play in making  sure  that

some of these customs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1717</b></font><br><br>

and  traditions are documented, and perhaps even at this  stage,

they  can  provide a consultative role in the process.   But  my

sense  is that if you really want to share with Singaporeans  or

with  others who have an interest in Singapore about  our  past,

what  better way than to have people who are familiar  with  the

customs  and  traditions,  people  who  have  linkages,   either

historical  relations or family linkage, to really be  part   of

the  process, because they are the best persons to really  share

with  Singaporeans what really took place, what are the  customs

and  traditions.   In the process, I think we can  have  a  more

effective way of teaching future generations about this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, my fourth point is that we cannot afford not to

succeed.   We must succeed.  Some of the reservations  expressed

by  the  people and community is that, I must say quite frankly,

the past project of the Malay Village has raised quite a lot  of

expectations.  People wanted the Malay Village to serve  exactly

the  same purpose that the Malay Heritage Centre is supposed  to

serve.   But quite unfortunately, things did not quite work  out

the way it should be.  To a lot of people in the community, they

feel  this is a last chance as there is no other parcel of land,

no  other location, where we could preserve this and do  a  very

good  exercise.   Therefore, there is a lot of concern  to  make

sure  that  it will succeed this time.  I think to  succeed,  we

must make sure that every available relevant person is involved,

the  resources  of the state are also given,  in  the  sense  of

expertise  and  funding, to make sure that we  succeed  in  this

exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would just like to end by appealing to the Minister,

in  view  of  the four points I have mentioned, that perhaps  he

could  help to get resources from the other neighbours  that  we

have  in  Johor, and how we can borrow some of their  historical

annals  and archives to preserve that.  I understand  that  some

are  also  in  Riau.   But,  more  importantly,  are  the  other

financial   resources  and  the  expertise  that  are  currently

available in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1718</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education

(Encik  Mohamad Maidin B P M):  Mr Speaker, Sir, I see two  main

impact of the proposed amendment:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to establish a new scheme of payment of up to

$350,000  to  be paid annually to the descendants  of  the  late

Sultan  Hussain  for  up  to 30 years, and  allowing  individual

beneficiary to ask for a one-time commuted gratuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to pave the way for the Istana Kampong Glam

premises  to  be  conserved and turned  into  a  Malay  Heritage

Centre,  a  project,  I am sure, Malays in Singapore  and  other

Singaporeans happily welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I would like to ask if the Minister could

inform  the House how much the proposed amendment is  likely  to

cost  the  Government, aside from the $350,000 gratuity.   There

are  resettlement benefits involved and resettling those who are

still  staying in the Istana compound.  How soon are they likely

to  vacate  the  place and thus make way for the Malay  Heritage

Centre project?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am asking these questions partly because I was

informed  that not all of them have agreed to accept  the  offer

made  by the Land Office.  Some are even thinking of challenging

the Government's right to conserve the place and turn it into  a

Heritage Centre.  In fact, they believe that the Istana and  the

entire  Kampong  Glam  estate should rightfully  belong  to  the

Sultan's descendants indefinitely.  They maintain that it is not

state land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, and to some extent explained by the

Minister  earlier, it has been over a century long now that  the

land  in  Kampong  Glam,  including  the  Istana  compound,  had

reverted to the country - first as Crown land when we were under

the  British, and later as State land of independent  Singapore.

Sir,  I  would  like to ask again whether this  is  an  accurate

explanation of the status of the land, and whether there are any

disputes  or  grey areas involved here.  I recall that  sometime

ago  the  Minister had stated the legal position  of  the  land.

Perhaps he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1719</b></font><br><br>

should  re-state  it  again so that the  descendants  and  other

Singaporeans could have a clearer picture on this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can say confidently that the Malay community in

Singapore  look  forward to see an upgraded and improved  Istana

Kampong Glam.  They are also waiting for the day that it becomes

a  heritage centre and hopefully play a major role in preserving

and propagating the heritage of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geylang Serai may be regarded by many as an emotional

umbilical cord of the Malays in Singapore.  This is due  to  its

recent history and the existence of a certain "Malay flavour" in

the area.  However, the real and actual important history of the

Malays  and  Singapore  emanated  more  from  the  Kampong  Glam

district.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that account alone, I think the Government makes the

right  decision  by  choosing  to  conserve  and  upgrade   this

historical  district.   Generally, Singaporeans,  including  our

Malay  community  leaders, accept the  decision.   Kampong  Glam

deserves to be awarded that position and status.  We should also

find more ways to bring life and add colour to the district.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the media in Malaysia, as mentioned by my

esteemed  colleague earlier, seem to see it differently,  and  I

suspect with some dubious intention.  The most recent example  I

could  recall  was a TV3 programme aired on 30th June  1999.   I

notice  that  TV3  and  the other media in Malaysia  were  quite

consistent in reporting that the whole exercise of setting up  a

heritage  centre  at  the  old  Istana  was  intended  to  close

permanently  an important chapter of Singapore's history  linked

to the Malay kingdom which once ruled this island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how such a thing could possibly be done. As

far  as  I  know, history cannot be changed.  It is a well-known

fact  that  Singapore was once part of the Johor-Riau sultanate,

that  we  used  to  be administered from Kota  Tinggi  (the  old

capital of Johor) and from Riau.  We also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1720</b></font><br><br>

know that the powers of the last surviving sultan ended abruptly

the day he transferred the administrative power of Singapura  at

that  time to the hands of the British, I was told, for a meagre

sum of $5,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, if the core ideas of the plan outlined by

the  Malay Heritage Centre committee are implemented, I  say  it

would only heighten our awareness about that part of Singapore's

history  and  not closing it as a chapter of our  history.   The

history of the Malay sultanate here and its linkage to the Malay

kings  in  the region, form part of that history.  In fact,  all

these  could  be  brought back to life by way of exhibitions  as

well  as through dance and drama performances.  I was told there

was  even a plan to do further research into the different  sub-ethnic or ethnic groups of the Malay community in Singapore  and

how they link up to the whole region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centre would provide Singaporeans from every racial

group,  including  the younger generation of  Malays,  and  even

tourists  from  every  nation, including Malaysians,  a  greater

opportunity to have a better understanding of our history.  When

it  is  ready, I believe, a visitor could practically walk  into

our past and get a feel of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is most unfair and misleading on the part

of  the  media in Malaysia to portray the project  in  the  most

negative  light.  What they are saying is that because Singapore

is  not  a  Malay-majority state, it is only  natural  that  the

Government  here  will  erase any trace  or  symbol  of  history

linking this island to the Malay rulers of the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if at all it is true that the Government is race-biased and has ill-intentions against the Malays and their

historical position in our country, I can assure you that I, and

most  likely all my Malay MP colleagues, would not  be  here  in

this House as a member of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: is the Malaysian media trying to provoke

the Malays in Singapore to be angry against our Government over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1721</b></font><br><br>

this  issue?   Why  are they against the fact  that  a  Chinese-majority Singapore is making the effort and is willing to  spend

millions  of  dollars to set up a Malay Heritage Centre?   If  a

similar  effort  is  regarded as unthinkable  in  Malaysia,  why

should they say it is bad for us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are they saying we want to eradicate Malay history and

culture  in Singapore when we are actually taking a step further

to  conserve Kampong Glam into a heritage centre and  giving  it

the  pulse it deserves?  If a similar effort is regarded as  not

do-able  in Malaysia, why should they say we should not  venture

into this?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that almost all the media in Malaysia were

saying  about the same thing in this matter seems to  suggest  a

planned  salvo  against Singapore.  While such a wayang  may  be

useful for a certain party to regain its lost ground, it is most

unkind  that  in the same breath it tries to undermine  that  of

another.   It is strange and absurd to me, Sir, that while  some

Malaysian  leaders  are  angry against a  certain  newspaper  in

Singapore,  namely,  the  Business Times,  and  accusing  it  of

interfering in Malaysian domestic affairs, the media in Malaysia

have  almost  simultaneously  and blatantly  interfered  in  the

internal affairs of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have our heritage and we have every right to

preserve it.  And just as the various communities in Malaysia, I

am  sure, can look after themselves, we can look after ourselves

and  protect our interest.  Outsiders should not interfere.  And

worse still, Sir, if they employ misleading reports to create an

air  of  distrust and suspicion of the Malays here  towards  our

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I know, following our separation from Malaysia,

there  was tacit agreement that we do not try to influence  each

other's  domestic ground.  And for that reason,  our  respective

newspapers do not circulate in each other's country.  It may  be

necessary  to  say  that  greater  care  should  be  applied  to

television which can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1722</b></font><br><br>

transcend  borders.   It  is  also a  more  powerful  medium  in

influencing and affecting the emotions of its viewers.  That  is

why  the  recent  TV3 programme is a gross interference  in  our

domestic affairs.  I thought the tacit agreement between the two

countries  in 1965 was a sensible one and should be  adhered  to

closely,  especially  as  it concerns matters  of  race  in  two

closely  linked independent states.  I hope that  the  media  in

both countries will bear this in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in

support  of  the Sultan Hussain (Amendment) Bill.  I also  share

the sentiments and views of my hon. colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the Malaysian media, especially TV3,

have  chosen  to  join in this debate.  TV3  is  a  private  and

politically  connected television station in Malaysia.   In  its

Malay broadcast, which my colleagues have mentioned in Viewpoint

on  30th June 1999, the programme and the presenter deliberately

and  selectively slanted the report on this issue.  It has  gone

to  the  extent of accusing the Singapore Government  of  taking

away  Malay  rights.   The interview of Mr  Ridzwan  Dzafir  was

edited  to  fit in with their slant reporting.  Facts  which  Mr

Ridzwan Dzafir took great pains to state in the full transcript,

which I read, were ignored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, had this been a Singapore media report on Malaysia, it

would  have  caused no less than an uproar.  When  the  Business

Times  penned an editorial on 18th June 1999 on the  subject  of

the  Malaysian election and its leadership, the event  caused  a

storm.   Malaysia's  Foreign Minister,  Syed  Hamid  Albar,  was

reported  to  have  told Asiaweek that "it is appalling  that  a

paper  from a friendly country should take upon itself to meddle

in our internal politics."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the TV3 broadcast is not more than meddling in our

internal  affairs, then what is?  We do not tell the  Malaysians

how to run their country.  They should do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>

likewise.  Unfortunately, Malaysian politicians and their  media

indulge  in  double  standards.  They act  as  if  they  have  a

monopoly  and  a  right  to criticise and  make  comments  about

Singapore as it suits them.  Just this very morning, there is  a

report  in  the Straits Times and the headline reads  "Singapore

rapped  for  looking  down  on  Malaysia".   The  commentary  in

Sunday's  Mingguan Malaysia by the former Chief  Editor  of  the

Utusan  Malaysian  group  criticised the  so-called  media,  our

media, of course, and SM's negative views on Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the short response is that this is sheer paranoia.

There  is  nothing further from the truth.  It is in Singapore's

interest to see a prosperous Malaysia, and we have stated in  no

uncertain terms and on many occasions that we believe and act no

less  on the "prosper thy neighbour" philosophy.  Nothing  hurts

Singapore  socially  and  economically  more  than  a   troubled

Malaysia.  When Malaysia sneezes, Singapore catches the flu.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implying that Singaporeans can be easily manipulated by

western  powers,  the commentary goes on to play  the  "foreign"

card,  which  is  very  popularly used in Malaysia  these  days,

especially in the last two years.  To say that the west is  more

comfortable  with  SM Lee and not so with the  "anti-western  Dr

Mahathir" is in my view laughable.  Everyone knows that  SM  Lee

has  more  than his share of detractors in the west and  in  the

western media with the likes of William Safire.  It is only SM's

intellect that has earned him and Singapore grudging respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, negative reports on Singapore in the Malaysian media

are  often  received with stoic silence in Singapore.  Singapore

leaders and Singaporeans who are riled often take it quietly  in

our  stride.  We cannot choose our neighbours, but we can choose

the  way  we respond to intimidation and bullying tactics.   But

the report on TV3 on the Sultan Hussain (Amendment) Bill takes a

dangerous  and  provocative line, and this has to  be  debunked.

This my colleagues have done so.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's response to the Business Times' editorial,

which  I mentioned earlier, is a criticism of the Business Times

by our Prime Minister.  Will a Malaysian leader do likewise with

the TV3 report?

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  like my colleagues, I wish to seek clarification from  the

Minister  in  regard to the legal status of the land  at  Istana

Kampong  Glam.   Just  now,  in his  speech,  the  Minister  has

confirmed that it is State land since 1897.  The question is: if

it  is  State  land, why is it that the Government is  providing

annual  payments  of  monies to the beneficiaries  of  the  late

Sultan  Hussain?   Are there avenues for these beneficiaries  to

claim  that  the land belongs to them and not to the Government?

Are there any attempts by them, through legal channels, to stake

their claims?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask all these questions because there have been some

statements  made  by  some beneficiaries,  as  reported  in  the

foreign media, that the land still belongs to them and that  the

Singapore  Government suddenly confiscated Istana  Kampong  Glam

and chased out about 300 residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I wish to ask the Government's stand with regard

to the distorted reports from the foreign media, as mentioned by

my  colleagues  just  now.   There have  been  many  mischievous

reports from the foreign media accusing the Government of trying

to erase the last symbol of the Malay Sultanate in Singapore and

also  to  erase  the history of the Malays in  Singapore.   This

statement  is  very mischievous.  My question is:  what  is  the

Government  going  to  do  to correct  this  distorted  picture?

Personally,  I  strongly  object to the  interference  from  the

foreign  media  with  regard  to our local  matters,  especially

pertaining to the Malays in Singapore.  The examples given by Mr

Yatiman  in his speech is a clear move by some foreign media  to

meddle in our internal affairs.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish to ask the Minister about the progress

on  the  resettlement process of the tenants of  Istana  Kampong

Glam.   Are  the  Government agencies giving them assistance  to

facilitate their move to their new homes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very generous offer by the Government to the 79

beneficiaries  of  the late Sultan Hussain is much  appreciated.

Apart  from  receiving  monetary  payments,  tenants  of  Istana

Kampong  Glam who are eligible would be getting their own  flats

and be able to live in a better environment as compared to their

living  environment  now.   But above all,  the  most  important

aspect  is the noble intention of the Government to establish  a

Malay  Heritage  Centre at Istana Kampong Glam.   This  Heritage

Centre will portray the Malay culture, arts, history, traditions

and everything that is related to the Malays in Singapore.  I am

sure   the  future  generation  will  be  able  to  gather  more

information  with  regard  to the Malays,  including  the  Malay

Sultanate, before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malays are proud of the history of the Malay

Sultanate  in Singapore.  However, that era is now part  of  our

history.  The Malays now look towards the future with confidence

in  a meritocratic Singapore.  While some hearts still hold  for

the  golden past, the Malays are now more realistic and want  to

move along with the mainstream to face the challenges of the new

millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill as it will benefit not only the

Malays but, most importantly, all races in Singapore because the

Malay Heritage Centre shall be a part of the heritage of a multi-racial Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the

Members  who have spoken - Mr Yatiman Yusof, Mr Harun Ghani,  Mr

Loh  Meng See, Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, Mr Mohamad Maidin, Mr Chng

Hee  Kok  and Encik Ibrahim Othman.  Let me touch on the  points

that they have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the matter of clarifying the legal aspects which

some of my colleagues,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Yatiman  Yusof, Mr Mohamad Maidin and Encik Ibrahim  Othman,

referred  to.  I have already outlined the legal position  at  a

previous  sitting  but in response to the  questions  raised  by

Members, let me reiterate that the legal position is very clear.

In  fact,  the  former  Minister for  National  Development,  Mr

Dhanabalan, said in this House on 15th April 1989, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1896 towards the end of the last century, there was a

dispute  among the family of Sultan Hussain as to  who  was  the

successor  to the Sultanate and to the estate, ie,  the  Kampong

Glam  Estate.   This matter went to court and in December  1897,

the  Court of Appeal ruled that there was no one who could claim

to  be  successor.  The estate therefore reverted to the  Crown.

It  became  State  Land  and it was no  longer  subject  to  the

treaties which previously affected it."

<br><br>Since  then,  Sir, that is for more than 100 years, the  Kampong

Glam  Estate, including the former Istana, has been State  Land.

Furthermore, this legal position has been made very clear in the

Sultan  Hussain  Ordinance, which  was  enacted  in  1904.   The

Ordinance,  Sir, (and I am referring to the main Ordinance,  not

to  the  amendment Bill) has several provisions which  reiterate

this  position.  For example, section 2, and I quote, "The  said

land  situate in Kampong Glam having reverted to the Crown shall

be  administered by the Collector of Land Revenue  in  the  same

manner as other Crown lands."

<br><br>And  section 4 reads, "If the said lands in Kampong  Glam  which

are hereby declared to have reverted to the Crown as decided  by

the Court of Appeal of the Colony."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legal position is very clear that these have been and

are  State lands.  In answer to the specific questions by  Encik

Ibrahim  Othman  on why we have the annual payment,  as  I  have

stated  in  my  main  speech today as well as  in  the  previous

sitting, it was especially provided for in the Ordinance  as  an

obligation of the Government to pay.  But as I also said in this

House  the rationale was to take care of the then family of  the

late  Sultan Hussain who was described by the Government at that

time  as  being  financially  improvident.   So,  that  was  the

background to that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked by some who spoke about the progress on

resettlement  of  occupants.   I  would  say,  Sir,   that   the

resettlement  exercise  is proceeding  well.   Of  course,  this

process  takes time because the Land Office has to identify  and

ascertain  who  were  the occupants and  who  are  eligible  for

resettlement benefits.  For example, I was told that a  few  who

were staying there were foreign workers.  Some are eligible  for

certain  kinds  of  benefits and some are  eligible  for  lesser

benefits.  Some were occupants of HDB flats or were actually  in

ownership   of   HDB   flats.   Under  the  normal   rules   for

resettlement, we have to assess their different eligibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether the resettlement payments and benefits will

enable  them  to  pay  the downpayment  for  HDB  flats,  in  my

discussion with my officials, I was assured that those who would

qualify for HDB flats would have the ability to pay for whatever

initial payments for the HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the progress of the resettlement exercise, as of

today,  the Land Office has processed the majority of cases  and

almost three-quarters, some 122 out of the 170 individuals, have

already accepted the resettlement package and have moved out  or

are in the process of moving out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about the cost and expenses to the Government.

The  final  cost of the annual improved payments  will  actually

depend  on how many finally opt for annual payment and how  many

opt  for the lump sum payments.  Taking into account the  number

of  people  who have opted for lump sum payment, the new  scheme

may  cost  the Government close to $6 million at today's  value.

But  the Government also incurs cost as regards the resettlement

benefits  but  I am unable now, in this House, to state  exactly

what  the cost will be as the exercise is still in progress  and

individual  claims are not identical.  But we expect  it  to  be

around $1.5 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin made some comments about the Malay

Heritage Centre which will be taken into account, I am sure,  by

both MITA as well as the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>

Malay Heritage Foundation.  He made some specific points on  the

need for involving other descendants, the need for being open to

cooperation  from different quarters and different  sources.   I

have  had  a  discussion with Mr Ridzwan Dzafir and  from  these

discussions I have a clear impression that he is a man receptive

to  ideas and suggestions from all quarters and I have no  doubt

that,  with  that kind of willingness, he will  be  prepared  to

consider cooperation and ideas from all sources, whether  within

Singapore  or  outside,  as to how to make  the  Malay  Heritage

Centre a truly, lively and effective heritage centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the other main points raised by colleagues

concerning  the comments, false reports, distorted  reports  and

even  mischievous reports which have appeared in  the  Malaysian

media,  including the more recent TV3 programme.  Let me recount

some of these false allegations and distortions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it had been erroneously reported that the Istana

building  will  be demolished.  This is of course  untrue.   Not

only  it  is  not  to be demolished, but the  building  will  be

conserved  and  used for purposes of the Malay Heritage  Centre.

This has been made clear right from the beginning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it was erroneously reported that the

beneficiaries  would  receive a total of  only  $350,000.   This

again  is  not true.  The truth is that they would get  $350,000

per annum over 30 years, if it is on an annual payment scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, some reports also stated the Government had

"suddenly seized the land and evicted the 300 residents".  As Mr

Yatiman Yusof pointed out, it is not 300, but 170.  But the main

sting  of  this  mischief is that we suddenly seized  the  land.

This  is also untrue.  The Government had, on several occasions,

as  far  back as 1993, announced in this House, the Government's

plan  to  develop the Istana Kampong Glam into a Malay  Heritage

Centre.  In May 1993, the then Minister for Information and  the

Arts,  my colleague, BG George Yeo, informed the House  that  Mr

Ridzwan Dzafir was chairing a working

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>

group to look into this project.  So, it is untrue to say it was

"sudden".  Furthermore, no one has been suddenly evicted because

normal   resettlement  procedures  have  been  followed,  giving

everyone  ample  time to make arrangements.   Also,  as  I  have

mentioned, the Kampong Glam Estate has been State land for  more

than  100  years. The question of the Government  "seizing"  the

land therefore does not arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke about the resettlement exercise. Some of these

Malaysian  media  reports  had distorted  the  facts  about  the

resettlement scheme and gave the impression that they were being

evicted without any resettlement benefit.  Mr Harun Ghani  asked

me  about this.  Sir, the truth is that the occupants have  been

offered   attractive   resettlement   benefits   which   include

alternative   HDB  housing,  removal  allowances,  payment   for

individual  structures in the vicinity of the Istana from  which

they  are  vacating  and  also ex-gratia  payments.   The  media

reports  in  Malaysia have also conveniently ignored or  omitted

the  fact  that the project was to establish the Malay  Heritage

Centre which would benefit not only the Malay community but also

preserve Singapore's multi-cultural heritage.  Several  MPs,  Mr

Zulkifli,  Mr  Loh  Meng  See and others,  have  emphasised  the

important point that this is not an issue of just preserving the

Malay  heritage, but the heritage centre is a project  which  is

going to benefit the entire Singapore community.  It is a symbol

of our shared heritage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also referred to the recent TV3 programme

which   is  a  good  example  of  suppression  of  facts.    TV3

interviewed  Mr  Ridzwan Dzafir, Chairman of the Malay  Heritage

Foundation.  However, it suppressed the important points made by

Mr  Ridzwan.  For  example,  Mr Ridzwan  had  said,  "the  Malay

community greatly welcomes the Malay Heritage Centre." This  was

not carried by TV3.  He also said, "Regarding the land or Istana

Kampong  Glam  and the Bendadara House, they have  become  State

land for almost 100 years so it is not a problem

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>

for the Government here.".  This was also not carried.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV3 had also mischievously portrayed the development of the

Malay  Heritage  Centre  "as  an excuse  to  acquire  the  Malay

sultanate land", deny Malay rights and "erase the history of the

Malays".  How can the intention be to erase the history  of  the

Malays when so much efforts and so much money have been expended

by  the  Government to preserve and project the heritage of  the

Malays, which is part and parcel of the Singapore heritage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore share the views of Members that such

irresponsible   and   mischievous  media   reports   amount   to

interference in our internal affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These media reports have deliberately distorted and played

up  the  facts  of  a sensitive racial internal  issue,  without

regard  to the possible damage to the racial harmony and  social

stability  in Singapore.  They could have easily worked  up  our

Malay   ground,  caused  ill  feelings  between  the   different

communities  and soured race relations.  Fortunately,  Sir,  the

facts were well publicised and known to all Singaporeans so that

these  slanted  reports  failed  to  provoke  a  response   from

Singaporeans or to damage our racial harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently Malaysian media and others had accused the

Singapore  Business  Times  (BT) of  interfering  in  Malaysia's

internal affairs by commenting on political developments  there.

Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong's Press Secretary wrote to the  BT

to  put  on  record  the  Government's  disapproval  of  the  BT

editorial  in  question.  As the Members who  have  spoken  have

pointed out, non-interference cannot be a one-sided matter.  The

Malaysian  media  should  not practise  double  standards.  They

should  heed  their own advice and refrain from  interfering  in

Singapore's internal affairs.

<div align="center"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits)

Act, or the DTA in short, was enacted in 1993, global efforts to

curb  money laundering have intensified substantially.  As trade

and  capital  flows  become increasingly  international  and  as

Singapore  expands  its  role as a financial  centre,  there  is

increased  scope  not  only  for cross-border  crimes  but  also

international money laundering to occur here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, further amendments to the DTA are necessary to

enable  us to deter and combat money laundering more effectively

as well as to deprive criminals of the enjoyment of the benefits

of   their  crime.   The  amended  legislation  will  give   our

enforcement agencies and financial regulators sharper  tools  in

their  work to help maintain Singapore's reputation as  a  well-regulated financial centre and a city largely free of crime.

<br><br><i>Serious Crimes  -  Money Laundering</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DTA was enacted to criminalise the laundering of

benefits derived from drug trafficking, as well as to allow  for

the  investigation and the confiscation of such benefits.  Money

laundering,  as  is commonly known, consists of  concealing  the

origin  of  moneys derived from illicit activities  and  passing

them off as the legitimate proceeds of lawful activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>

When   the   DTA  was  enacted,  drug  trafficking  was   viewed

internationally,  and  in Singapore, as the  primary  source  of

funds for money laundering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since then, there has been overwhelming evidence

that  transnational crime, which is a growing  problem  for  the

world community, is not restricted to drugs or proceeds of  drug

trafficking.  Criminal organisations are multi-faceted and other

serious  offences constitute an important and growing source  of

illegal wealth entering legitimate financial channels.  This has

led to an international trend of criminalising the laundering of

not  only  drug  money but also the proceeds  of  other  serious

crimes as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), or an

inter-Governmental  body formed in 1989 by  the  G-7  to  combat

money  laundering  globally,  started  first  by  requiring  its

members to take measures to combat drug money laundering.   Then

in June 1996, it required its members to extend money laundering

predicate  offences to beyond drug trafficking.   All  Financial

Action  Task  Force members, which include most of  the  Western

developed  countries  and Hong Kong among others,  have  already

extended  or  taken measures to extend the scope of their  anti-money  laundering  regime  to include the  proceeds  of  serious

crimes.    Singapore,  which joined the  Financial  Action  Task

Force  in 1991, should do likewise, to demonstrate that  we  are

committed  to  being  a  responsible  partner  in  international

initiatives to combat crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from international trends, it is also important for

our  local enforcement efforts to target the proceeds of a  wide

range of serious crimes.   Firstly, drug trafficking is not  the

only  crime  that  results  in significant  amounts  of  illegal

proceeds.   Crimes, such as fraud and criminal breach of  trust,

do  too.  We do not want criminals or their families to be  able

to  enjoy  the fruits of such crimes.  Secondly, our enforcement

efforts against money laundering have sometimes been hindered at

the  investigation stage.  For example, to obtain  an  order  to

investigate into the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>

accounts  of  a  suspect, the authorities have  to  be  able  to

satisfy  the  courts  that, among others, there  are  reasonable

grounds for suspecting that the suspect has carried out  or  has

benefited from drug trafficking.  This may be difficult to do as

criminals,  nowadays, can be involved in several  crimes,  where

the proceeds are mixed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, this Bill seeks to amend the DTA to extend the asset

confiscation  and anti-money laundering provisions  of  the  DTA

beyond drug trafficking to cover other serious crimes.   To give

effect  to  this, clauses 23 and 25 of the Bill seek to  provide

for  the  money  laundering offences arising  from  benefits  of

serious  offences.   These  include the conspiracy,  incitement,

attempt  and abetment of these offences.  Clause 30 of the  Bill

inserts  a  Second Schedule to the DTA to specify  the  list  of

serious  crimes  to be included in the Act.  The  list  includes

crimes  that  are serious in nature but excludes serious  crimes

that  cannot be linked to money laundering (for example,  bigamy

and  incest).  Many of the amendments in the Bill merely  extend

current provisions covering drug trafficking proceeds to serious

crimes  proceeds.  For example, clause 7 of the Bill  inserts  a

new section 4A.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In extending our measures to deal with serious crimes, we

are  mindful  that  the  Bill should not  adversely  affect  the

operations  of the financial institutions in Singapore.   Hence,

the  Bill provides similar safeguards, found in the existing DTA

for  investigations into drug offences, to prevent third parties

from  being able to pry into a person's financial accounts under

frivolous  pretext  or  under the guise of  investigations  into

serious  offences.  These can be found in the new sections  26A,

26B  and  34 and the amendments to section 31.  In the  case  of

foreign  requests  for  financial  information,  some   of   the

safeguards  include the need for the existence  of  a  bilateral

agreement  or  treaty with the requesting country,  the  offence

being  a  crime in both countries and the assistance  not  being

contrary  to  public interest.  The amended legislation  is  not

more liberal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>

than  those  of other financial centres in releasing information

to foreign enforcement agencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also introduces various amendments to fine-tune the provisions of the DTA to make it a more effective tool

to  combat money laundering and deprive criminals of their  ill-gotten gains. Let me explain the more important ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clauses 22 to 25 amend the money laundering

offences to clarify that the prosecution need not prove that the

accused  had  actual knowledge of the relevant facts,  that  is,

that  the person is a drug trafficker, or that his proceeds  are

derived from drug trafficking or other serious crimes.  Instead,

the  accused can be convicted based on evidence showing that  he

had  "reasonable grounds to believe" that the person  trafficked

in  drugs or the proceeds were derived from drug trafficking  or

other   serious  crimes.    This  would  facilitate  enforcement

because  in practice, proof of actual knowledge is difficult  to

produce. This is in line with the laws of many countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also increasing the penalties for money laundering

from  seven years jail and/or $100,000 fine to seven years  jail

and/or  $200,000.   As  money laundering is  primarily  a  crime

involving  large  amounts  of  money,  the  current  maximum  of

$100,000 should be increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 20 inserts a new section to make the

reporting of suspicious transactions mandatory for all  persons,

including financial institutions and non-financial institutions.

This  means that a person who, in the course of his professional

duties,  comes  to know or suspect that any property  represents

the proceeds of drug trafficking or serious crimes is obliged to

disclose  the  knowledge or suspicion to the  authorities.   The

maximum  penalty  for non-disclosure is a  $10,000  fine.   Some

permissible exceptions are mentioned in the new section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspicious transactions reporting is already mandatory for

banks under current MAS Guidelines which have the force of  law.

This new section extends the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>

obligation  to  non-financial institutions and  centralises  the

provisions in the DTA.  Many countries, especially those in  the

FATF,  have  already  enacted similar  provisions  as  there  is

worldwide   recognition   that  the  reporting   of   suspicious

transactions is a key source of intelligence for law enforcement

authorities tackling money laundering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the new sections 26B and 34 lower the standard

required  for foreign offences in respect of applying for  court

warrants   or  orders  to  obtain  information  from   financial

institutions from "prima facie case" to "reasonable grounds  for

suspecting".   As I have mentioned, money laundering is often an

international  crime  and  hence  international  cooperation  is

vital.   However,  in  our experience of  forging  international

cooperation  with foreign countries, "prima facie case"  is  too

high  a  hurdle  to meet in order to assist other  countries  in

their  investigations. "Reasonable grounds  for  suspecting"  is

also the test in many countries.  Hence it is necessary to lower

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, clause 25 inserts a new section 43B to make it an

offence for a person who has reasonable grounds to suspect  that

a  money  laundering  investigation is  being  or  about  to  be

conducted  to tip-off another person with information  which  is

likely to prejudice the investigation.  Since the new offence of

tipping off is merely an extension of the offence of prejudicing

investigation, the penalty for this will be the same as that for

prejudicing  investigations under section 44, ie, a  maximum  of

three years imprisonment and/or a $30,000 fine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, as drug money laundering offences are already

extraditable, clause 31(3) similarly amends the Extradition  Act

to make serious crimes money-laundering offences extraditable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also provides for repealing the

Corruption (Confiscation of Benefits) Act in clause 31(2).  This

is  because  the amended DTA would apply to corruption  offences

and  would  have a scope wider than the Corruption (Confiscation

of Benefits) Act as it also includes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>

provisions   relating   to  foreign  corruption   offences   and

criminalises  the money laundering of corruption  proceeds.   In

addition,  the Bill provides for the amended Act to  be  renamed

the  "Corruption,  Drug  Trafficking and  other  Serious  Crimes

(Confiscation of Benefits) Act" to reflect its wider scope.  The

word "Corruption" is placed in the title as we want to send  the

signal  that  corruption will continue to be tackled  even  more

seriously  in  Singapore  after the  repeal  of  the  Corruption

(Confiscation of Benefits) Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, the new laws, by confiscating the illegal

proceeds  of  serious  crimes  and  preventing  criminals   from

enjoying  the fruits of their crimes, would render  many  crimes

unprofitable  ventures.   These will be  additional  weapons  to

fight  against  crime in Singapore.  In addition,  the  proposed

amendments  would also allow my Ministry to keep  ahead  of  the

ever-changing  transnational crime and global  money  laundering

situation.  In particular, although Singapore is one of the  key

financial  centres  in  the world - it is  open,  efficient  and

sophisticated  -  we  also  want  to  ensure  that  she  is  not

susceptible  to  money  laundering.  These  proposed  amendments

would  in  fact enhance Singapore's growth and reputation  as  a

modern international financial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, thank you for giving

me the opportunity to join in this debate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that the proposed amendment to the Drug

Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act to include corruption

practices  and other serious crimes be introduced  to  safeguard

the  interest of our country.  Singapore has come a long way  to

be  what  it  is  today and it is vital that we  equip  our  law

enforcement agencies with a more effective legislation to combat

corrupt practices and other serious crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that with the amendment Bill there will be a

positive effect on the political, social and economic aspects of

our  country.   Those who have the intention of committing  drug

trafficking, corrupt practices and other serious crimes  at  the

expense  of  the interest of Singapore will have to think  twice

before  committing  such crimes.  With the amendment  Bill,  the

relevant  authorities  will have the powers  to  confiscate  the

proceeds  acquired  by  the  criminals  through  their  criminal

activities and hit them hard in their pockets.  This  will  also

deter others from committing such offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation

of Benefits) (Amendment) Bill on the following grounds:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It is hard on the criminals and deters others from

committing such crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It helps to maintain low crime rate and enhance the

confidence of foreign investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) It helps to maintain political, social and economic

stability  of our country. In doing so, it could help to  create

more employment opportunities in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) It helps to achieve our vision in making Singapore a

safe and best home for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill not only benefits both Singaporeans

and  foreign investors alike, it also enhances Singapore's image

at  the  international level. I believe that this  amendment  is

necessary   if  we  were  to  see  stability  in  our   country.

Evidently, it is vital

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>

that  the  amendment  to the Drug Trafficking  (Confiscation  of

Benefits) Act be amended to include corrupt practices and  other

serious crimes for the interest of our country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

thank you for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has given the background why this

legislation is necessary.  I am generally in support of most  of

the  provisions.  I have some reservation on some of the clauses

which I will come to later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me address the basic philosophy why we need to

have this legislation.  We had for a long time in the early  70s

taken  seriously the question of drug and drug trafficking.   It

is important that our legislation takes care of drug trafficking

and  money  laundering.   In  many  parts  of  the  world,  drug

trafficking  is  becoming an acute problem.   We  need  to  have

legislation that will take care of this, and I am glad that  the

Government has taken the step.  I am a little unhappy that under

new  section 43 the fine is only $30,000.  $30,000 is  a  paltry

sum  for  traffickers and those who are helping the traffickers.

I hope that this will be reviewed in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned with clause 22. As a lawyer,

knowledge  is  a  very important factor in a crime.   But  I  am

prepared  in  this  instance to support the  proposed  amendment

because we have to seek from actual knowledge to one where there

is a reasonable ground to believe, and I think the court will no

doubt  take  a great deal of pain to see that this is  observed.

Initially,  I  have my doubt whether this piece  of  legislation

should be worded this way.  But after carefully considering  the

fact, I am prepared to support the provisions in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, initially I have also reservation on increasing the

penalty  from $100,000 to $200,000.  But I support again because

I  think  it  is  timely to increase the fine from  $100,000  to

$200,000.  In fact, I would have been happier if it was  higher,

but let us go stage by stage.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally, we have a balanced legislation here, and I

hope that the whole House will join me in supporting the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the speakers for supporting

the  Bill.   I have explained why we have pegged the penalty  of

$30,000  for those who were convicted of tipping off information

to  the  people  concerned.   This is actually  consistent  with

section  44  of  the current DTA.  So we are not doing  anything

new.  Similarly, for the other provisions, it is also consistent

with  the  current  DTA, and we have from experience  no  reason

right  now  to  increase that penalty.  And on  some  subsequent

occasion if we need to do that, we will consider the change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we should have imposed "actual knowledge"

instead  of  "reasonable ground to believe",  the  latter  is  a

standard set in many other countries, and I do not believe  that

we  should be more stringent than the other countries.  Since we

are  part of the international community in this area, we should

therefore  be in line with what the other countries  are  doing.

We  are  not doing more; we are not doing less than what  others

are  doing.  We are in keeping with the international  mood  and

climate and the trend as required of the other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].

<div align="center"><b>DENTISTS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to provide for the registration of dentists

and  for matters connected therewith, and to repeal the Dentists

Act  (Chapter 76 of the 1985 Revised Edition).  It will  enhance

the role of the Dental Council so that it can perform

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>

its  functions  more  effectively and  raise  the  standards  of

professional conduct and practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore enjoys a high standard of dental care. Today

there  are  almost 1,000 graduate dentists and  67  Division  II

dentists.   And  amongst  our graduate  dentists,  more  than  a

quarter have postgraduate qualifications, providing a wide range

of specialist dental care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain this high standard of dental care, we need to

ensure   that  dental  students  are  trained  effectively   and

registered practitioners are kept abreast of advances in  dental

sciences to meet the needs and expectations of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the major new provisions that are

being introduced in this Bill.

<br><br><i>The Dental Council</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Act provides for a Dental Board of eight

appointed  members  and two ex-officio  members.   There  is  no

provision  for the election of members to the Dental Board.   To

bring  it  in line with the corporate governance of the  medical

and  other  professions,  the Bill proposes  a  Council  of  six

appointed and five elected members.  The appointed members  will

represent  the cross-section of dentists, with one  member  from

the  academia, one member from the non-graduate dentists and the

rest  from the public and private sectors.  The election of five

council  members  will provide the mechanism for representatives

to be elected by their peers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current Act, the Director of Dental Service is

designated  as  the President of the Dental Board.   In  future,

members of the Council shall themselves elect one of its members

to  be  the  President.   This will  give  the  Council  greater

autonomy and self-regulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that Council members take their appointments

seriously, clause 8 provides for the removal from office of  any

member  of  the  Council who is absent without leave  for  three

consecutive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>

ordinary meetings of the Council or its Committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will make it compulsory to vote for the elected

members  to  the Council.  This is similar to the provisions  in

the Medical Registration Act and the Legal Profession Act, which

also  provide  for compulsory voting of members to  the  Medical

Council and the Law Society respectively.

<br><br><i>Functions of the Dental Council</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the current functions of registering

dentists,  issuing  practising  licences,  and  regulating   the

professional conduct of dentists, the Bill seeks to broaden  the

functions  of the Dental Council.  Clause 4 enables  the  Dental

Council  to  make recommendations to the appropriate authorities

on:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the content and nature of courses of instruction and

examinations leading to the dental degree at NUS; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the training and continuing education of registered

dentists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is to ensure that our dental students and practising

dentists continue to receive appropriate training, and  to  keep

abreast  of advances and developments in order to maintain  high

professional standards.

<br><br><i>Register of Dental Specialists</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the increasing number of graduate dentists and the

trend  towards  specialisation,  there  is  a  need  for  us  to

establish a dental specialist register.  Clause 31 provides  for

the  establishment of a Dental Specialists Register through  the

publication of Regulations to be made under this Act as and when

necessary.

<br><br><i>Disciplinary Procedures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to disciplinary procedures. To

expedite  the  handling of complaints, and to  allow  for  wider

representation from dentists in general and from the lay public,

the Bill allows for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>

setting  up  of Complaints Committees to include Dental  Council

Members,  other dentists and lay persons.  Presently, there  are

no  provisions for lay persons in the disciplinary process.  The

concept of lay persons being involved in disciplinary procedures

is in the Medical Registration Act, the Legal Profession Act and

Accountants  Act.   It  makes  the  disciplinary  process   more

transparent and open.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, dentists are disciplined only if they are convicted

of  any heinous offence, or are guilty of infamous conduct in  a

professional  respect.  The proposed amendments will  allow  the

Council  to  discipline dentists who have  been  guilty  of  any

improper   act  or  conduct  which  brings  disrepute   to   his

profession,  or who have been guilty of professional misconduct.

This is also in line with provisions in the Medical Registration

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a dentist is guilty of infamous conduct in a

professional  respect,  the existing  Act  prescribes  only  one

penalty, that of striking his name off the register.  This  does

not  allow for a graded penalty according to the severity of the

offence.  The Bill addresses these shortcomings by enhancing the

penalty  options available to the Dental Council.   It  empowers

the Council to:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) remove the name of the dentist from the Dentists

Register;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) suspend the dentist from practice for a maximum period

of three years;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) impose a fine of not more than $5,000; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) censure the dentist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council shall also be empowered to order the suspension

or  removal of name to take effect immediately, instead of after

30  days, if it is deemed necessary in the public interest or in

the best interest of the dental practitioner concerned.

<br><br><i>Restoration to the Register</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a dentist has his name removed from the Register

pursuant  to  a disciplinary inquiry, it does not mean  that  he

cannot practise his profession anymore.  There is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>

provision  for the dentist to apply for his name to be  restored

after a minimum period of three years.

<br><br><i>Health Committee</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a dentist who is unfit to practise because of

psychiatric condition, drug or alcohol dependency or  any  other

physical  or  mental  condition,  cannot  be  removed  from  the

Register.   Clauses 48 and 49 provide for the setting  up  of  a

Health Committee to review any dentist whose fitness to practise

is  impaired by reason of his physical or mental condition.   It

will be empowered to restrict or suspend the dentist's practice,

or  recommend  that his name be removed from the Register.   The

Medical  Registration Act and the Dentists  Act  of  the  United

Kingdom also provide for the establishment of a Health Committee

with similar functions.

<br><br><i>Proposed increase in penalty for unauthorised persons acting  as dentists</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem, which we face from time to time, is the

illegal conduct of dental procedures by unqualified persons, eg,

the  making  of  dentures.  Often these are done  improperly  or

under  non-hygienic conditions.  Clause 28 increases the maximum

penalty for a first offender from the present $2,000 to $25,000.

For  subsequent  offences, the penalties will  be  increased  to

$50,000  or  imprisonment of up to six months  or  both.   These

enhanced  penalties very clearly signal that the  Government  is

determined to stamp out such cases of illegal practice.

<br><br><i>Consequential and other minor amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes consequential changes as a result of

the  proposed amendments that I have just described,  and  other

minor  amendments to delete obsolete terminology and  to  update

the existing provisions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have come a long way in the provision

of dental care.  The general state of dental health in Singapore

is good.  It is that way because we have well trained and highly

competent dentists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenges facing the dental profession and the entire

healthcare sector will be greater in the years ahead.   We  will

continue to see the development of new materials to treat dental

decay,  new techniques and new methods to replace missing teeth.

The  dental profession must ensure that its members are properly

qualified  before they are allowed to use the new materials  and

technology.   At  the  same time, we must  deter  dentists  from

advising   their  patients  to  undergo  unnecessary   high-tech

procedures for financial or other reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help to achieve these objectives. It will

enhance  the  role  of the Dental Council,  and  empower  it  to

safeguard the high professional and ethical standards of  dental

practice, and to uphold the integrity of the profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to speak in support of the Dentists Bill.  As it repeals and re-enacts,  with  amendments, the Dentists Act  of  1985  that  has

become  outdated and inadequate in many areas, its  introduction

is necessary and timely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are several details that merit concern and

comment,  I  feel  that the setting up of a  Dental  Council  to

replace  the  Dental  Board  is significant  and  very  welcome.

Unlike  previously, the registered dentists will now have  their

own representatives as spelt out in the amendments in clause  3,

in   this   important   "watchdog  body"  of   the   profession.

Furthermore, the role of the Dental Board is not replaced by a 6-function  regulatory role of the Dental Council, as  defined  in

clause  4.   All this should place the "watchdog  body"  of  the

dental  profession in good stead in the eyes of both the  dental

practitioners as well as the general public.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to comment on other aspects of the

Dentists Bill as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4. This clause defines the functions of the Dental

Council  and the function to determine and regulate the  conduct

and  ethics of registered dentists is welcome indeed.  This will

provide  the  avenue  for patients to bring  complaints  against

their  dentists.  Furthermore, this will establish  a  means  to

protect patients from unscrupulous or unethical dentists as well

as  to  ensure the high standards of the dental profession here.

Many  are concerned about the Dental Council having full control

over  the  dentists in Singapore because the application  for  a

Practising Certificate shall be made in such form and manner  as

the  Dental  Council  may require.  Sir,  this  can  become  one

control  too many for the dentists and be an extra "bitter  pill

to  swallow" for all the dentists, especially if the "such  form

and  manner"  becomes  too restrictive and expensive  to  comply

with.   I  would like to urge the Council to practise  restraint

and  not to use the issuing of the Practising Certificate  as  a

tool  to  pressurise and to cause extra demands  on  the  dental

profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15(5)(b). In this clause, the words "is not of good

reputation and character" are undesirably vague and wide.   This

criterion, Sir, is also very subjective.  Perhaps, it should  be

qualified  by  adding the words "such as to  render  the  person

unfit,  in  the interest of the public, to practise his  or  her

profession."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17(6) and (7). There are no guidelines as to what

premises  or  conditions  are deemed unsuitable  for  practising

dentistry.   There is also no avenue of appeal.  This  makes  it

draconian and unsatisfactory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21(1)(e). This appears to be targeted at "bond

breakers".  There is inevitably a penalty imposed where there is

a  breach of undertaking.  It seems inequitable and unduly harsh

to deregister a dentist merely on this ground.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34(1). This clause requires the Dental Council to

appoint  not  less than five and not more than  10  lay  persons

together  with not less than 10 and not more than 20  registered

dentists as part of its Complaints Panel.  This means a ratio of

two  registered  dentists to one lay person is possible  in  the

Committee  of Complaints.  Some people may argue that this  will

result  in  a  bias  in the assessment of a patient's  complaint

since  there is an easy majority of dentists.  The public  would

probably  prefer a more balanced representation in the committee

for   assessments   to   be  open  and  fair.    An   unbalanced

representation  may  cause the Committee  of  Complaints  to  be

perceived as a "peer review or internal audit panel".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36(7) and (10). These subclauses state that the

dentist  concerned shall not have the right to be heard  by  the

Complaints   Committee  and  shall  not  have  access   to   all

information used by the Complaints Committee.  Sir,  this  is  a

denial of natural justice since it is only fair and logical  for

the  dentist  to  be allowed an opportunity to  defend  himself.

This  is  especially  when the findings  on  each  case  of  the

Complaints Committee has such important repercussions as  stated

in  clause 38.  Furthermore, I am concerned whether the findings

and  recommendations of the Complaints Committee are  admissible

as evidence in any legal proceedings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39(2) and (3). There is no obligation on the part

of  the Committee to give its grounds of decision.  How then  is

it  possible  for  the  aggrieved dentist  to  appeal  with  any

substance?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 44(1). The appointment of a Disciplinary Committee

as  in  this  Dental Act has been long overdue and  is  urgently

required to deal with the area of misconduct and the appropriate

disciplinary actions to be meted out.  Clause 44(1) has  rightly

categorised  offences  into  either professional  misconduct  or

improper act or conduct and five different ways to deal with  an

offence.   This  is  superior to that in the  old  Act  where  a

dentist  could be deregistered for heinous offence or guilty  of

infamous or disgraceful conduct in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>

professional sense.  There was only one penalty in the old  Act,

regardless of the severity of the misconduct - the wrongdoer had

to  be struck off the register of dentists.  Clause 44(1)(i)  to

(v)  of the new Act provides for different types of disciplinary

actions  from  fine  alone  to temporary  deregistration  before

removal of name from the register.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, I would like to say that with this

Dentists  Bill,  we  could have avoided the  awkward  situation,

where  the judgement of the Dental Board last year, in the  case

of  a  dentist  who was implicated in breach of the  Advertising

Guidelines, was reversed by the High Court.  While I agree  with

the  judgement  of the High Court in this case, I  am  concerned

about  conflicting  judgements that may  arise  in  the  future.

Would that case set a precedent for future cases of disciplinary

actions by the Dental Council to be freely brought to the Courts

of  Appeal?  Would that lead to undermining of the authority and

judgement  of  the Dental Council?  If so, is there  a  question

mark  over  the legitimacy of the Dental Council and  since  the

Dental Council follows the guidelines of the Dentists Act, would

this Act be redundant?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill. My

interest  in  this  Bill  arose after a  judgement  by  Judicial

Commissioner  Amarjeet  Singh  which  was  referred  to  by   my

colleague  earlier.   In  that  case,  he  mentioned,   in   his

judgement,  that it is time the Dental Act be  reviewed.   I  am

glad  that the Government has done that.  In fact, I have  never

expected  it  to be done in such a fast speed and I congratulate

the Ministry for doing it so quickly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for this Parliament to review from

time to time legislation which are out of time and to repeal and

re-enact them in keeping with the needs of the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has mentioned some of the provisions but I

would  like to mention some other provisions.  In particular,  I

am gratified that now, the Dental Council will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>

be  made up of both elected and appointed members.  My regret is

that  the  appointed members would be in the majority.   I  hope

that, in keeping with the other professional bodies like the Law

Society, where only two representatives from the Ministry sit in

the Council, we should have more elected persons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that I would also like to commend and

applaud  is  the  compulsory voting.  It is very  important  for

professionals  to  take an interest in their professional  body,

just   like  every  Singaporean  is  required  to  vote   in   a

parliamentary  election.  I think this is a healthy  trend.   We

should require that if every professional wants to practise,  he

must vote unless he has got exceptional reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the functions of the Council have been well laid down

and  it  will  help in the growth of the dental profession.   My

only concern is on clause 7 "disqualifications for membership of

the  Council".   Why  should a person  who  is  an  undischarged

bankrupt not be allowed to sit on the Council?  I can understand

the position of an accountant or a lawyer who is handling money.

But  a  dentist who is bankrupt can practise but could not serve

on  the  Council.   I  find that this is  a  very  contradictory

position.  I hope that this provision could be reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other clause that I am a little concerned is this.

Clause 15(5)(b) refuses to register any applicant who is not  of

good  reputation   and  character.  These  are  very  subjective

tests.   What happens if the dentist has a girlfriend?  Does  it

mean  that  he is not of good conduct?  I think we must  have  a

definition, Sir.  But I am just stating the worst scenario as an

example.  I am asking this House that when we have a legislation

of  this nature, which is going to be interpreted by the  Dental

Council,  possibly by the court if it goes before the  court,  a

definition  ought to be put in.  In fact, I do  not  think  this

clause  should be in the Bill at all.  But if we insist  on  it,

then we should provide for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other worrying trend is that, with due respect to the

Minister, the Minister's

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>

decision  is going to be final in clause 15.  This would  affect

the  livelihood of a professional colleague.  It would  be  very

important for us to provide an avenue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a refusal, he should have right of audience to

the Court.  I may be the only lone voice in this Chamber where I

think  it  is very important for us to have a safeguard.   I  am

quite sure that there would be no abuse but the question is  the

precedent  that we are going to set in this House.  I  hope  the

Minister  will consider this because it is going to  affect  the

career and livelihood of the man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has, more than a lawyer, argued the case

so  well that I cannot add anything further other than those two

comments and I ask the Minister to consider the proposal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank

the  two  Members  for  their support  of  the  Bill  and  their

comments.  Let me take the detailed comments in turn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo made the comment that in clause 4, applications

may  be  made in such form or manner and that she hopes that  in

administering  the practising certificates, the  Dental  Council

would  not  be  too restrictive.  I assure the  House  that  the

purpose  of the Dentists Bill is to register and make sure  that

all  dentists have the qualifications, that they are  physically

and  mentally  fit  to  practise and  that  they  are  of  sound

character and reputation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Members questioned the need for clause 15 that

practising  dentists must be of good reputation  and  character.

As  I  said, all dentists, and indeed all professions, must  not

only  have  the  qualifications to practise.   I  think  society

requires that all professions have certain set standards and one

of  the  standards  is  that  they be  of  good  reputation  and

character.  I think that is quite well defined.  The Bill allows

for  any person who is not registered because of that clause  to

have an avenue of appeal.  This requirement incidentally appears

in many professional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>

Acts.  Dr Lee tells me it also applies to veterinarians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Lawyers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not know about lawyers. Maybe

lawyers do not need to be of good reputation and character to be

registered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I object to that remark.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> My apologies. So it is also in the

Legal  Profession Act.  In that case, there should  not  be  any

objection   to  having  this  clause  of  good  reputation   and

character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17(6) and (7) talks about the premises for a dentist

to practise.  The requirement is for practising in the premises.

It  is  not laid out in the Dentists Bill.  In fact, it is  laid

out  in the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act.  In  that

Act,  the  criteria  for  premises to  be  registered  for  such

practices  are quite clearly laid out and also if  the  premises

are  not registered, the licensing authority is required to give

reasons why the criteria are not met.  So the applicant can make

good the shortfalls and allow their premises to be registered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21(1) talks about bond breaking. We have gone

through  this debate the last time when we discussed the Medical

Registration Act.  Basically, the number of applicants  to  both

the  medical and dentistry faculties in Singapore is very large.

We  have to restrict the numbers.  The courses are conducted  at

great  expense  to  the public.  The courses  are  very  heavily

subsidised and therefore we require students entering these  two

faculties  to give an undertaking that they serve the  community

after their graduation.  If they break the bond, we will require

them to pay up the liquidated damages for breaking the bond.  If

they  do not pay the liquidated damages, of course they run  the

risk  of being de-registered as a dentist.  I think that is fair

because they are educated at great expense by the community  and

it is not unfair of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>

community to expect them to serve the community in return.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also asked about the way the Complaints

Committee  is  conducted.  Let me explain  that  the  Complaints

Committee  is intended as a screening process before a complaint

is taken up by the Disciplinary Committee.  We want a process by

which  a  complaint by the public or by other  professionals  is

assessed  to  see whether that complaint is bona  fide  and,  in

fact,  should be taken up by the Disciplinary Committee.   There

is  no  need for the dentist who is complained against to appear

before  the  Complaints Committee.  If he is  required  to  show

cause,  he  will  have  plenty  of  chances  in  front  of   the

Disciplinary Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Rai and Dr Lily Neo also referred to a recent case

where a dentist who advertised his services was penalised by the

Dental Board.  He appealed to the High Court and the High  Court

felt  that the penalty was too severe, and part of this Bill  is

in  response  to  that  case to give a  different  gradation  of

penalties.  It also illustrates that the mechanism that we  have

set out in the current Bill is the right one and that there is a

due   process   through  the  Complaints   Committee   and   the

Disciplinary  Council,  and if the  dentist  feels  that  he  is

aggrieved,  he can still appeal to the High Court.  And  in  the

High  Court,  we  get  the chance to hear  the  appeal  and  the

judgement can then be taken.  I think the process works well and

that is in fact proposed in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;

read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to signification of

support of any other Member?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I support, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House resolves that in all the circumstances it

is only right and proper a Writ should be issued now to fill the

vacancy in Parliament created by the resignation of Mr Choo  Wee

Khiang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this motion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am asking for answers to

questions  which  my  Party has asked and which  have  not  been

answered.  I hope to demonstrate in the time allotted to me  the

importance  of the Government, the party, that is, in  Singapore

responsible  for  elections, unlike other countries  where  they

have   a  National  Elections  Commission,  giving  proper   and

satisfactory  reasons for not holding elections.  We  boast  all

the  time  of being accountable, transparent in all our actions.

But  we  see  very  little  of it in practice  coming  from  the

Government.   As  I said, we have asked questions  which  remain

unanswered.   We have asked for further clarification.   All  we

get is silence.  Sir, I am asking in this House today and hoping

that we will get the answers here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there no by-election for the constituency in Jalan

Besar?  This is a question that not only my Party has asked, but

several  Singaporeans have asked.  I have been asked by  many  a

person,  "Jeyaretnam, do you think there will be  a  by-election

for  Jalan  Besar?"  And even before I could answer  them,  they

say,  "There  never  will, lah. The PAP  will  not  hold  a  by-election.  You know."  So, I hope that we will have satisfactory

answers if the decision is still not to hold a by-election.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.28 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question on whether there should be or

should not be a by-election depends, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  on

what  we  understand to be a Parliamentary system of government,

and  whether  we believe in what we say.  That when we  proclaim

ourselves to be practising a Parliamentary system of government,

do we really mean it and do we believe in it or is it merely lip

service?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>

May  I  say that a parliamentary system of government  does  not

consist of having a fine building for Parliament.  I do not know

how  much  will  be spent on the erection of the new  Parliament

House.   But  fine buildings do not equate with a  parliamentary

system of government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parliamentary system of government can only be found in

countries where Parliament is encouraged and allowed to play its

full  role in the parliamentary system of government, and  that,

as  I shall say later, is only possible if every opportunity  is

given  for Parliament to play its role.  And the central gem  of

Parliament is that it is an institution where every voter has  a

representative  in  the institution.  The  parliamentary  system

requires   that   in  every  Parliament  there   should   be   a

representative, representing every single voter in the land, and

if  he  is  denied  that right, then it  is  a  mockery  of  the

parliamentary  system of government.  So, it is  essential  that

every  voter  be  represented in the institution  that  we  call

Parliament.   And this right, of course, was inherent  when,  in

the  1950s,  we  chose,  as a people, the  parliamentary  system

through the All-Party Delegation to the United Kingdom.  That we

would  prefer  to have a parliamentary system of  government  in

preference  to  any  other  system  of  government.   We  wanted

Parliament  with  representatives elected by the  people,  every

single  voter represented in Parliament to be the supreme  body.

This  right was recognised and enacted in the Constitution  that

was handed to us in 1954, and after that.  It recognised that no

single   voter   should  remain  without  a  representation   in

Parliament  for any length of time.  This right was  secured  by

Articles in the Constitution which required the holding  of  by-elections to fill any vacancy.  You will find that in Article 54

of  the  Constitution of Malaysia which became our  Constitution

when  we broke away from British rule and went into Malaysia  as

part of an independent country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may read Article 54 of the Constitution which we, as I

said, accepted for ourselves as part of Malaysia:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever there is a casual vacancy among the Members of

either House of Parliament, it shall be filled within 60 days [I

repeat,  it  shall be filled within 60 days] from  the  date  on

which  it is established that there is a vacancy and an election

shall be held.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I repeat from that Article, "it

shall be filled within 60 days . and an election shall be held."

That  was the Article in the Constitution when we were  part  of

Malaysia.   When  we  came  out of Malaysia,  that  Article  was

amended,  and  that was possible because there were  not  enough

Opposition  Members  in  Parliament,  probably  not   a   single

Opposition  Member in Parliament, and substituted by Article  49

of  our  present Constitution.  If I may read the first part  of

the Article:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the seat of a Member, not being a non-constituency Member, has become vacant for any reason other than

a  dissolution  of Parliament, the vacancy shall  be  filled  by

election in the manner provided by or under any law relating  to

Parliamentary elections for the time being in force.'



That is all I wish to read from that Article.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I again point out that whilst this Article removes the

requirement  of  60  days within which the  vacancy  had  to  be

filled, it still requires the vacancy to be filled, because  the

words are "the vacancy shall be filled by election".  It is  not

"may  be  filled at the discretion of the government or  of  the

ruling  party", but "shall be filled".  That was ignored by  the

ruling  party  after  a  by-election,  which  they  have   never

forgotten,  which took place in 1981.  Previous to  that,  there

were regular by-elections to fill vacancies.  But after the  by-election on 31st October 1981, suddenly the ruling party woke up

to the fact that it would not be in the interest of the party to

hold a by-election if it might mean an Opposition Member getting

into   Parliament.   The  voters  in  Anson  were   denied   any

representation in Parliament after the Member was forced out and

they  were  told,  "Oh, don't worry, we'll have  caretaker  MPs.

We'll  have caretakers for you."  But you cannot fend off voters

with  nannies/caretakers.   Their  constitutional  right  is   a

representative in Parliament, chosen by them, not  appointed  by

anyone, but chosen by them.  So the Anson voters were denied any

representation in Parliament for quite a while from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>

1986  until the 1988 elections, and that was for 2-2 1/2  years.

It  was  a blatant denial of their rights and a total breach  of

the  parliamentary democracy requirement that every voter should

have a representative in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it will, of course, be said, "but you have other MPs

in   Jalan  Besar,  have  you  not?"   And  so  they  are  being

represented in Parliament.  But are they?  And I am referring to

the  voters in Whampoa where Mr Choo Wee Khiang represented  the

voters.  I know the Workers' Party has never had a GRC, but if I

may  explain, as I understand the anatomy of the GRC, it is that

you  merge  three  or four constituencies into  a  single  group

representation constituency.  What happens is that  the  MPs  in

the previous single constituencies come together and continue to

look  after their particular constituencies.  And so it was  the

case  in  Jalan  Besar GRC.  In 1988, when Jalan Besar  GRC  was

formed,  Dr  Lee  Boon Yang, who was already the  MP  for  Jalan

Besar, continued as one of the group MPs for Jalan Besar, and  I

have no doubt that he was looking after the constituency that he

had   been   representing  in  Parliament  in  previous   years.

Similarly,  Mr  Sidek Saniff came over from Kampong  Glam,  when

Kampong   Glam   became   part  of  the   group   representation

constituency.  I see Dr Lee is shaking his head.  Maybe  I  have

not  got it right.  But the point is that you continue with  the

particular constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, when Whampoa was added to Jalan Besar GRC, Mr Choo

Wee Khiang took the place of Dr Augustine Tan who was the MP for

Whampoa.   Clearly, there was a delineation.    I  do  not  know

whether it happens.  Members are all shaking their heads, and  I

do not know how they do it.  But, obviously, that must have been

the practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been confirmed by the fact that someone has been

appointed to look after the voters in Whampoa.  He is to go  and

advise them and take care of their affairs.  They are to have  a

caretaker.   They  are  to have a man appointed  by  the  ruling

party.  So they are not to worry.  The appointment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>

confirms what I say.  But it is not just the Whampoa voters that

I am concerned with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution as introduced by the ruling party

itself,  Jalan  Besar GRC voters are entitled  to  four  MPs  in

Parliament.  That is their constitutional right.  But  now  they

have  not got four MPs in Parliament.  They have only three  MPs

in  Parliament,  if  you take the voters collectively  in  Jalan

Besar   GRC.   Is  that not a diminution of their constitutional

right?   I know that Singapore motorists going over the causeway

have  to  have a three-quarter tank.  Why should the  voters  of

Jalan Besar be told: "Be content with the three-quarter tank  in

Parliament.  You cannot have a full tank.  We will  give  you  a

three-quarter  tank."   Why  should  they?   Is   that   not   a

discrimination from the other GRCs which have a full  complement

of  their representatives in Parliament?  In failing to  provide

for  a  by-election,  may I say that the ruling  party  and  the

remaining MPs are failing in their primary duty to the voters in

Jalan Besar GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Edmund Burke, the great

parliamentarian, in his essay wrote about the primary duty of  a

Member  of  Parliament to constituents, and he  said  that  must

remain  above  all the primary concern.  Should it  not  be  the

primary   concern  of  the  MPs  in  Jalan  Besar   that   their

constituents,   their  voters,  have  their   full   rights   in

Parliament,  and not just be content with having a three-quarter

representation in Parliament?  I say that the remaining MPs have

a  duty to ensure this if they are to serve the voters in  Jalan

Besar GRC, let alone the voters in Whampoa.  I say to them  that

if they want to discharge their duty, the only thing they can do

is  to allow another MP to be elected.  If it needs for them  to

resign  and to offer themselves for re-election, that should  be

done.   Their  own  convenience and the administrative  problems

that  they  think may arise should not stand in the way  of  the

rights of the voters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This refusal to hold a by-election is seen and perceived,

not just by the Workers' Party, but by many a Singaporean, as  a

blatant refusal to give the opposition

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>

parties an opportunity to get into Parliament.  That is again  a

total breach of the parliamentary system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one Mr Andre Mathiot, writing about the British

political system in 1958, had this to say:  "If asked to give  a

single criterion of the democratic Government, I should say that

it  depended  on  the status of opposition."  An  opposition  in

Parliament and an opposition of sufficient numbers, is essential

to a proper working of parliamentary democracy.  That is what he

is emphasizing:  "If I am asked to choose a single criterion,  I

would  say  it  depended on the status of opposition."   So  the

question that will be asked by visitors to Singapore is: what is

the  state  of  the opposition in Singapore today,  if  you  are

claiming  to  be a democratic Government?  I am not saying  that

you  should  therefore lay out the red carpet for the opposition

and  just  invite them in.  What I am saying is that the  ruling

party  should not go out of its way to deny the opposition party

an  opportunity  to get its representatives into  Parliament  on

behalf of citizens who want to see an opposition in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with no disrespect to Members, may I say that no

amount  of Government Backbenchers asking questions of Ministers

or  no amount of NMPs are a substitute for opposition.  So  this

denial  of the opportunity to opposition parties to further  the

cause of democracy in Singapore by giving them an opportunity to

have further representation in Parliament is a blatant denial of

the  Government's  often  claim  that  we  are  a  parliamentary

democracy.   It  is  the same as the denial  to  the  opposition

parties  outside Parliament, the refusal to let them have  their

meetings,  the refusal for them to publicly address the  people,

the refusal for them to undertake any political activity without

getting a licence first.  They are all deliberate hindrances  to

the  advancement  of  the  parliamentary  democracy  system   in

Singapore.   But the worst of it, of course, is to deny  through

extra-parliamentary  means  the  opposition  parties   obtaining

representation in Parliament.  I say that is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>

"extra-parliamentary"  because  the  Constitution  speaks  quite

clearly  that they should be allowed.  You have to  have  a  by-election  to fill any vacancy and that means an opportunity  for

the opposition parties to take part in it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is for two reasons. One, for the rights of the

voters  in Jalan Besar GRC in their interest, and second in  the

national  interest  of  the country that the  Government  should

consider very seriously whether it is right to continue  denying

the  voters  and  the  people in Singapore  the  right  to  have

representation  in  Parliament.  I will deal  briefly  with  the

answers given by the Prime Minister.  I am sorry that he is  not

here  to  answer these questions.  After all, it is his Ministry

which  is  responsible for holding elections.  That  is  another

thing.  It breaches the system of parliamentary democracy if the

holding  of  elections is left entirely  in  the  hands  of  the

Ministry, and that is the Prime Minister's Ministry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One reason given by the Prime Minister appears to be that a

by-election would distract the nation from the task of  economic

recovery.  We could not understand what he was saying.  That  it

would  distract  the nation from its task of  economic  recovery

seems to us a no answer to our question.  So we asked: would you

please explain what you are saying?  Are you saying that if  you

held  a by-election, all economic activity would come to an end?

That people will no longer do any business?  People would not go

to  work?   The  Stock Exchange would be closed?  And  Singapore

would  be at a standstill?  It has only got to be stated  to  be

dismissed.  So that cannot be a valid reason.  It does not stand

up.   So we asked: could you explain?  We have never heard  from

him.   I hope we will hear today, from whoever is replying,  the

true  reason  for this refusal to hold a by-election  for  Jalan

Besar  GRC.   Is  it because - and I am asking  this  seriously,

could  we have an answer to it - the ruling Party fears  defeat?

If  that  is so, then may I say it does not do the ruling  Party

any  credit.  It will be dismissed by the electorate as being  a

totally irresponsible party, putting its party's interest  above

the country's interest.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1992, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister, partly in

answer  to  the questions that were asked as to why the  general

election held in 1991 was brought forward, and whether it was to

keep me out, because I was still disqualified, only waiting  for

another  two months for the period to run out, decided  that  he

would hold a by-election in 1992.  Unfortunately, we were unable

to go into it for reasons which had been explained.  And we were

taunted by remarks that we chickened out.  May I ask: is the PAP

chickening  out  this time?  If the PAP is not  chickening  out,

then why are we not having a by-election?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just as in the case of Anson, the

general  elections, if this Government decides to  go  its  full

term  under the Constitution, elections will not take place  for

another  two-and-a-half years.  So for two-and-a-half years  the

voters in Whampoa will not have their man chosen by them.  May I

return  to  that?  I have no doubt that when they  canvassed  in

Jalan  Besar GRC, it must have been Mr Choo Wee Khiang who  went

round  the homes in Whampoa district asking the voters  to  vote

for  him, albeit as a member of a team, unless, I am told,  "No,

we  all  four  went round."  But I would have thought  that  the

arrangement would have been for Mr Choo Wee Khiang to go  around

in  Whampoa.  I see Dr Lee shake his head.  He is going to  tell

us  that all four went round each house in Jalan Besar.  Let  us

know.   But Mr Choo has been popularly referred to all the  time

as the Member from Whampoa.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps may I also say that we suggested to the Prime

Minister that if he is worried about economic activity coming to

a  standstill  and  the by-election a waste of  time,  he  could

combine the by-election with the Presidential Election which  is

due  under the Constitution by the end of August this year.   Or

are  we  going  to  be told, "No, we're not going  to  have  the

Presidential  Election,  because that  will  also  distract  the

nation from its economic activity."?  Is that going to be  given

as  a  reason and the Presidential Election put off?  I  suppose

that  will be more difficult because the ruling Party will  have

to bring an amendment to the Constitution.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, of course, aware - I do not want to be told that I

did  not mention this - that section 24(2A) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act which spells out what should happen in the case of

a  vacancy  -  that a writ shall be issued, but  goes  on  in  a

subsection  to say that no writ shall be issued in a GRC  unless

all  members of that GRC have vacated their seats.   May  I  say

this.   It  seems  to me, in the first place, to  conflict  with

Article 49 of the Constitution which says "shall be filled", and

there  is a vacancy.  The Speaker announced at the beginning  of

this  sitting today that there is a vacancy in Parliament.   You

cannot  pretend that there is no vacancy.  And the Article  says

that  the  "vacancy shall be filled".  So the question is,  does

section 24(2A) of the Parliamentary Elections Act conflict  with

Article 49 of the Constitution?  Of course, the Constitution  is

supreme.  It takes precedence over all other laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, quite apart from that, section 24 (2A) is purely a

procedural  section.  The substantive section is  still  Article

49.   And if the only way to satisfy Article 49 is for the other

members to resign, it should be done.  They should resign  their

seats so that the by-election may be held to comply with Article

49.   If that is not thought desirable, because the ruling Party

fears  that it may lose a Minister in Parliament, and that would

be  terrible, then the other alternative is to take Whampoa  out

of  the  Jalan Besar GRC and arrange for a by-election for  that

particular  constituency.  It is not good enough to say,  "Well,

that's going to create problems.  You got to have a committee to

re-draw  the boundary again."  In Singapore, that is no problem,

as  we  say,  because the committee is appointed  by  the  Prime

Minister.  Election is all controlled by the Prime Minister.  It

may  be a problem when you have a national elections commission.

They  might say, "Well, we don't think we are going to  do  this

for you."  But in Singapore it should present no problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that there is a precedent for it. Before the

last general elections, MacPherson was taken out of Marine

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>

Parade  GRC and made into a single constituency.  So you have  a

precedent there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I ask in this House: what are your reasons then for not

holding any by-election in Jalan Besar GRC?  And I do appeal  in

this  House  to the Prime Minister, to the Government,  and  the

remaining  Members  in Jalan Besar GRC, that  they  should  rise

above  party interest, and not decide the question whether there

should be a by-election purely on whether it suits the party  or

not, whether it may result in losing a Minister, but whether  in

the  national  interest, the Constitution  requires  that  there

should  be a by-election.  So I do appeal to the Government  and

to  the  Members  because they can do something  about  this  by

resigning their seats in Parliament and contesting the seats all

over again.  If that is done, then may I say the world will see,

and  Singaporeans will see and understand, that this is a party,

that  is  the  ruling  Party,  which believes  in  parliamentary

democracy,  which believes in giving voters their  rights  under

the  Constitution,  which  believes  that  there  should  be  an

effective  Opposition in Parliament and not just  a  party  that

pays  lip  service every time but does not believe  in  what  it

says.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Prime Minister, if he is the only one who has

got  to  decide this question, will reconsider and if there  are

good  reasons,  let us have them, but not facile  reasons  about

economic activity coming to a standstill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

although  we  are  now  debating  this  motion  that  Parliament

resolves that there should be a by-election in Jalan Besar  GRC,

we  can  envisage  that the motion will not be  passed   because

Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong has already made his stand  before

this sitting that there will not be a by-election in Jalan Besar

GRC.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh said that there would not be a by-election because he did not want to divert the people's focus on

our economic recovery.  I feel that this is just an excuse.   As

we  all know, in Singapore, even in general elections, the whole

process  can be finished within 10 days.  Now, only one  GRC  is

involved.   How  would  this affect our economic  recovery?   In

fact, there is no need for Prime Minister Goh to seek an excuse.

He   could  simply  say  that  according  to  the  Parliamentary

Elections Act, there is no need to hold a by-election.  The  PAP

Government  had in 1988 amended the Parliamentary Elections  Act

to  the effect that only when all the seats in a GRC are vacant,

will  it  be mandatory for a by-election to be held.  Under  the

circumstances,  in  a six-seat GRC, even if there  is  only  one

Member  left in the GRC, there is no need to hold a by-election.

The PAP can just ask some others to help out in the constituency

work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as this motion is concerned, whether or not we must

hold  a by-election, it is a foregone conclusion.  Nevertheless,

it  still makes sense for us to discuss this issue of whether  a

by-election  should  be  held under the  present  circumstances,

because  the law in Singapore is often amended again and  again.

Let  us  go to the   crux of the matter. The crux of the  matter

lies  with  the Parliamentary Elections Act.  Although  the  Act

provides that a by-election is necessary only when all the seats

in the GRC are vacant, there is no express provision to say when

a  by-election  must be held.  This is a loophole.   Under  such

circumstances,  it is for the ruling Party to   decide  when  to

hold  a  by-election.  They could just drag on  until  the  next

general election, as they had done in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, when the Anson constituency was vacant, they made

use  of  this  loophole in the Parliamentary  Elections  Act  to

refrain  from holding a by-election.  The seat was  left  vacant

all  the time until the general election in 1988 when they split

Anson  into three parts and have them absorbed into a  GRC.   If

the  PAP  Government  is a responsible government,  they  should

amend the Parliamentary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1763</b></font><br><br>

Elections  Act to provide that whenever there is any vacancy  in

any constituency, a by-election should be held within a specific

period  even  if  there is only one seat in  the  GRC  which  is

vacant.  In the present situation in the Jalan Besar GRC,   even

if  all the Members have vacated their seats necessitating a by-election,   there  is no provision to say by when  the  election

must  be held.  So if the PAP is a responsible government,  they

should urge all GRC Members to resign their seats so that  there

will be a by-election.

In  the event that the PAP is saying that it is not fair to  ask

the  other  Members  to resign, then they  should  consider  the

suggestion  by my Secretary-General that  Whampoa be  taken  out

from  the  GRC  to form a single constituency, and  hold  a  by-election there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the opposition is the voice of the

people.  Presently, the people want a by-election at Jalan Besar

GRC.  The opposition must voice their desire in Parliament.  But

the  Government has a contrary view.  It says that there  is  no

need to have a by-election in Jalan Besar GRC.  If a by-election

is  held  in Jalan Besar GRC, it shall distract the people  from

the  Government's  effort in turning the  economy  around.   The

Government's  excuse is of course unacceptable.  It  is  a  lame

excuse.   How  can  a by-election in one GRC suddenly  stop  all

economic  activities in Singapore, stop foreign  investors  from

wanting  to  invest in Singapore or stop their investments  from

coming into Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, I remember in the late 1970s, the Government

said   that  should  one  Opposition  Member  be  elected   into

Parliament,  it  would  drive the foreign  investors  away  from

Singapore.   Since then, more than one Member of the  Opposition

has been elected to Parliament, and yet Singapore has prospered.

The economy has done so well that the Government is able to reap

unprecedented surpluses each year.  In similar vein, the  excuse

that  one  by-election  in Jalan Besar  GRC  will  distract  the

Government  from its efforts to turn the economy around  is  one

that  cannot be accepted by the people.  The real reason  is  of

course the memory of Anson.  It was at

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>

Anson, in 1981, that the PAP suffered its first defeat after  15

years  of  one-party rule.  Mr Jeyaretnam of the Workers'  Party

broke  the  one-party  rule by winning the by-election  in  that

constituency.   The  defeat jolted the PAP.  The  PAP  machinery

quickly  started to work and find ways and means to stop another

Anson from happening.  The best solution of course is to do away

with  by-elections altogether.  This solution is 100% foolproof.

If  there are no by-elections, there shall be no defeat for  the

PAP.  It is as simple as that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were vacant seats after 1981. One was at Havelock

when  the  then Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen died in  office

and  later Anson itself became vacant due to the ouster  of  its

incumbent   MP   from   Parliament.   For   those   two   vacant

constituencies,  their  terms  were  not  ended  and,  yet,  by-elections  were not called for.  The Government  gave  the  lame

excuse  that the Constitution did not state a time frame  within

which  by-elections  have to be called.  Normally,  if  no  time

limit  is given for doing an act in the statute, then the  court

would  normally  interpret it as an act  to  be  done  within  a

reasonable  time.  The common law therefore states  that  a  by-election  at Havelock and Anson should have been held  within  a

reasonable  time  of becoming vacant. I would  say  that  within

three months would be a reasonable time.  Yet, by-elections were

not held in those two constituencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP knew that if they maintained only single seat

constituencies,  inevitably  in mid-term,  there  shall  be  by-elections.   For example, there were four vacant wards  in  1979

and, before the 1984 elections, there were two vacant wards  but

no  by-elections were held.  After Anson, I would say  that  the

Opposition  had a good chance of winning the by-elections.   The

people  know for sure that the Government is already  firmly  in

place  and  it  cannot  be toppled by a by-election.   For  this

reason, Singaporeans are more amenable to vote the Opposition at

a  by-election  and the PAP knows that.  That  is  why  the  PAP

invented the concept of GRCs and keep the number of single  seat

constituencies  to a minimum.  Currently, there  are  only  nine

single seats,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>

down  from 22 out of 83 elected seats in Parliament.  Under  the

GRC system, legally, there is no need to hold a by-election when

one  of  the  component  MPs in the GRC  drops  out,  either  by

resignation  or  whatever reason.  There shall  only  be  a  by-election  in the GRC when all its MPs are no longer  Members  of

Parliament.  It is almost impossible for this kind of  situation

to  happen after the election laws were amended at the beginning

of 1988.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the amendments, the GRCs currrently are made up of

four,  five  or six MPs in a GRC.  It is difficult therefore  to

envisage a situation when all four, five or six MPs in  one  GRC

completely leave Parliament.  In these days, the new MPs are  in

their 30s.  They are well-fed, strong and healthy.  I cannot see

any  one  of  them  falling ill and opting  out  of  Parliament.

Besides,  I  cannot see young MPs, with so much to  look  ahead,

voluntarily resigning unless they are forced to do so like  Choo

Wee Khiang's case at Jalan Besar GRC this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the GRC scheme is aimed at wiping out by-elections. It is noted that the Prime Minister did not use the

legal  reason  for  not wanting to hold a by-election  at  Jalan

Besar  GRC,  but instead use an economic reason.  If  the  Prime

Minister  has said that he need not hold a by-election at  Jalan

Besar  GRC  because the law does not require him to do  so,  the

people  will be quick to point out that he held one at  his  own

constituency in Marine Parade GRC in December 1992.  A precedent

has been set at Marine Parade GRC that if he wanted to, he could

call  a  by-election   despite the fact that  the  law  did  not

require  him to do so.  In Marine Parade's case, it was  obvious

to  the PAP that they would win that by-election because it  was

the  Prime Minister's ward and he was an incumbent MP  for  many

years.   As regards Jalan Besar, it is no sure winner.  That  is

why the PAP is not willing to announce a by-election there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jalan Besar GRC comprises a large part of the former

Rochor constituency.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>

The PAP still remembers that they nearly lost in Rochor in 1963.

The  PAP's  Chairman then, Dr Toh Chin Chye, narrowly  beat  the

Barisan  Sosialis candidate, Dr Lee Siew-Choh, by less than  100

votes.   The  PAP old guard shuddered when they  talked  of  the

election at Rochor constituency in 1963.  They won that election

only  by the skin of their teeth.  After that experience,  I  do

not think that the PAP is going to chance a by-election at Jalan

Besar.   A mid-term by-election is normally a good time for  the

people  to  assess the Government's policies.  The last  general

election  was held on 2nd January 1997.  At this point of  time,

it  is exactly half way through the term before the next general

election is held.  So it is a good time for the people to  audit

what  the Government has done up to now, ie, whether the  people

are  happy  with the Government's policies such as cost  cutting

measures  and  other  policies to  revive  the  economy  or  the

Government's handling of Singapore's relations with Malaysia and

its other policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should allow itself to be judged purely on

its performance without massive incentives offered to the people

like  in  the last election such as the upgrading of flats.   If

the  PAP really believes in democracy, then it should hold a by-election  at  Jalan  Besar  GRC.  The essence  of  democracy  is

representation  and choice.  The residents at  Jalan  Besar  GRC

elected   the  original  four  persons  to  represent  them   in

Parliament.  But now the slate of four is left only with  three.

The  PAP has sent a former failed candidate at Hougang, Mr  Heng

Chee  How, to fill in that place of the resigned MP.  He may  or

may  not be good.  We do not know.  But what we do know is  that

he  is  not the choice of the voters at Jalan Besar GRC.  He  is

the  choice of the PAP.  The voters at Jalan Besar GRC  must  be

given their democractic right to choose their own representative

in  Parliament,  not  to force one upon them.   The  PAP  should

uphold  democracy  and call a by-election at Jalan  Besar.   The

next  general election, if it goes its full-term, is to be  held

in  early  2002.  This Parliamentary term has still 2 1/2  years

more to go.  A by-election should be held at Jalan Besar GRC.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

first like to refer to the comments made by the hon. NCMP saying

that  the  number of opposition is an indicator of the state  of

Parliamentary  democracy in Singapore and  that  the  number  of

backbenchers or NCMPs does not matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that what is more important is to have

a free and fair election.  We have seen that in the region.  You

cannot predetermine the outcome of elections if you have a free,

fair  and transparent election like what we have here.  Speaking

for  the NMPs, I would like to perhaps remind the hon. NCMP that

the NMPs, representing a non-partisan section of the population,

has played a useful role not only in Parliament but in the whole

range  of  social and community institutions and developing  and

supporting a very strong people sector which certainly must be a

very important and strong indicator of the state of democracy in

this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the motion, Sir, I would like to say that

one  of  the  objectives of GRCs is the  ability  of  the  other

elected members in the GRC to carry out its function and  duties

of  another member in the absence which may be caused by  either

death,  disability or other unforeseen circumstances.   What  is

more  difficult in this case is that the constituents in Whampoa

have lost their elected Member, not by an act of God, but by  an

act  of crime.  I suppose in most cases a reasonable voter is  a

lot more understanding and can be persuaded to see the practical

arguments  against by-election because of the  current  economic

crisis and the ability of the other elected Members to carry  on

with  the additional responsibilities brought about by the  loss

of  an  elected Member.  However, there are others who  place  a

much  greater  moral obligation to replace  the  MP  with  other

elected representatives.  Here, in my own sense is that the  PAP

suffers from a very high moral position it occupies of not being

corrupt  and taking a firm and strong position even against  its

own members.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>

For  this  reason, some may then want the PAP to take that  high

moral  position  by calling for a by-election  in  Jalan  Besar.

There  are some questions that come to mind in trying to balance

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, even if there is a general perception, which I tend

to agree, and the feeling that the constituents do not want a by-election, and they see that the other Members are able to  carry

out  their duties quite effectively because of their good  track

record,  the question then is:  should not we then leave  it  to

the  voters through the election process to decide whether  they

really want to have their Members of Parliament re-elected?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to ask if we need clearer guidelines

in  fact to determine the circumstances where a by-election  may

be  required, if, say, two Members of Parliament in  a  GRC  are

unable  to continue office for whatever circumstances.   Because

then it can be argued that the remaining MPs would be physically

incapable of carrying out the functions and duties in  the  GRC.

I must say that I, like most Singaporeans, can see the practical

argument for not calling for a by-election in Jalan Besar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, Sir, some Singaporeans are a little

bit  confused  because  recently  we  heard  that  the  PAP  has

announced that Mr Heng Chee How will be sent to the GRC to  look

after  some of the duties left behind by the former MP.  Why  is

there  a  need to have Mr Heng carry out this duty if the  other

three  Members  can effectively perform those  roles?   I  think

there  is  some  confusion there.  Perhaps,  we  may  need  some

clarification. And the clarification is really the role that  Mr

Heng   will   play  there.   I  do  understand   that   in   all

constituencies, we have advisors and helpers, but I  think  what

people  would like to see is Mr Heng playing the role,  and  not

necessarily  the  same role as has been played  by  the  elected

Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, not having a by-election is actually a loss to the

PAP,  more  than to the Opposition.  In my view, it can  perhaps

demonstrate  that Singapore is different from the  rest  of  the

region.  Because in an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1769</b></font><br><br>

economic  crisis,  contrary to the experiences  in  the  region,

where  the  economic  crisis has brought  about  a  more  vocal,

prominent Opposition in local politics, I would think even if  a

by-election were to be held, it could demonstrate that Singapore

is  quite  different that despite the crisis, the Government  is

able  to win elections, because it has, I think, in most  cases,

demonstrated  that the Government is a very strong  catalyst  of

change  and  reform in Singapore.  I personally do not  see  the

Opposition  playing  that  role.   So,  that  is  quite  a   big

difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard Mr J B Jeyaretnam, I feel that he has not made

a  very strong case for calling for a by-election.  The vacancy,

as  I said, was brought about by a crime.  But Mr J B Jeyaretnam

has  not made a case of that crime basically perhaps because  of

the  Government's own firm and open attitude in dealing with  it

very openly and fairly.  And it is for this reason, Sir, that  I

cannot give my support to Mr J B Jeyaretnam and his motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want

to  thank  you for giving me this opportunity to rise  to  speak

against  the motion standing in the name of the Non-Constituency

Member of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, has once again called for a by-election to be held in Jalan Besar GRC on account of the

resignation of our erstwhile colleague, Mr Choo Wee Khiang.   Mr

Jeyaretnam  seems  confident that if a by-election  were  to  be

called  at this time, he will be able to give the PAP a beating,

something  which  he has tried to do in the  last  election  but

failed  dismally.   Even in this House, Mr  Jeyaretnam's  tirade

against  the  Government  and  the  Party  sounds  like  an  old

gramophone  record,  which he plays over  and  over  again.   He

begins  by  suggesting that there is a lack of  a  tradition  of

Parliamentary  democracy, the lack of freedom of expression  for

the  Opposition  and  an inability to allow  the  Opposition  to

express themselves in a forum such as this.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask the NCMP to account for his presence here in

Parliament today. He is a loser in the last election, as I  have

said  previously.  But for the grace of this present Government,

he  is able to sit in this Parliament together with the rest  of

the  duly elected Members and make his points known in an august

body  such as this.  How can Mr Jeyaretnam then say that we  are

short  in  the  standards  of  representation  expected   in   a

democracy, as he has described?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> You missed the point.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> He thinks the PAP is out of sync with the

aspirations of our people.  Perhaps, at this moment, one wonders

whether  the issues he raises in this House clearly reflect  the

aspirations of the common man he claims to represent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a lawyer, Mr Jeyaretnam would have realised that

under  the  Constitution and relevant laws, there  is  no  legal

obligation on the part of the Government to call for an election

after an MP resigns his seat in Parliament.  The essence of such

a  legal requirement in the Constitution applies both to single-seat  constituencies and to Group Representation  Constituencies

as  well.  Mr Jeyaretnam cites Article 49 of the Constitution in

which  he used to support his case.  If I may just read  Article

49 of the Constitution, it simply states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever the seat of a Member, not being a non-constituency Member, has become vacant for any reason other than

a  dissolution  of Parliament, the vacancy shall  be  filled  by

election in the manner provided by or under any law relating  to

Parliamentary elections."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Article in the Constitution is therefore largely qualified

as opposed to what Mr Jeyaretnam appears to have suggested, that

there  is  a  legal obligation on the part of our Government  to

call an election as long as there is a vacancy in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the NCMP has created a mischief by alluding to a

duty,  that  there is a legal obligation which is obviously  not

true.   If  it  is  an  election to  be  called  in  the  manner

prescribed  by law, the law is the statute that we  have  before

us, and that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>

is  the Parliamentary Elections Act.  As a lawyer, I am sure  Mr

Jeyaretnam  knows  the  Parliamentary  Elections  Act  does  not

prescribe any particular time limit within which to call for  an

election.   That, Sir, is clearly the prerogative of the  ruling

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue was specifically dealt with after we became

independent  in  1965.   During that time,  our  Government  has

specifically  amended the provisions of our law  to  require  an

election  to be held within a period of time after the seat  was

vacated.  Mr Jeyaretnam so much as conceded that that has  since

been  amended after the election.  Obviously, I could  be  wrong

and  Mr  Jeyaretnam could be right.  But the  point  is,  if  Mr

Jeyaretnam still thinks that there is a legal obligation to hold

an  election  at the moment in Jalan Besar GRC, then  he  should

apply for a writ of mandamus to compel the Government to do  so.

He  is capable of doing it and nobody is ever going to deny  him

the  right to petition to Court to issue such a writ.   However,

Mr  Jeyaretnam obviously knows that there is no legal obligation

to hold an election at this moment for Jalan Besar GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no legal obligation to hold an election

at this moment, Mr Jeyaretnam is perhaps saying that, as opposed

to  a  legal obligation, there is a moral obligation to hold  an

election instead, and that obviously is the other thrust of  his

argument.   If so, we should perhaps examine closely whether  or

not  such an obligation exists.  By moral obligation, Sir,  what

one  supposes it to mean the expectation based on the values and

beliefs of the people comprising the society at large.  By this,

one  would  ask whether or not it is the expectation  placed  on

Parliament and indeed the Government by the people of Whampoa at

this  moment to hold a fresh election and to seek a new  mandate

from  the  people of Whampoa to act as their representatives  in

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one would imagine that when the MPs from Jalan Besar

GRC  went  to the people at the last election for an endorsement

of their candidacy , the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>

people  of  Whampoa  voted categorically that  they  wanted  the

present  team  to  represent them.  When the  Whampoa  residents

voted for their Members of Parliament in the GRC, they did  not,

in  the  way  in which the election was conducted,  specifically

vote  for  any  particular  MP to  represent  their  ward.   The

endorsement was placed on all four Members of Parliament  to  be

their  representatives  and  it  is  on  that  basis  that   the

candidates were returned.  Mr Jeyaretnam obviously has  not  got

his  laws right.  He seems to think that in a GRC, it is a  just

convenient  arrangement  where  you  tie  all  these  individual

constituencies together and therefore each Member of  Parliament

is  specifically  voted by the constituents  in  his  particular

ward.   But  bear  in mind, in the Parliamentary Elections  Act,

when the people vote within a GRC, they voted for an entire team

and not for any specific individual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore be ludicrous for anyone to suggest that

since   the   mandate  was  given  to  four  MPs   to   act   as

representatives  in  Parliament,  the  absence  of   one   would

necessarily  mean  that  the  rest  have  lost  their  electoral

mandate.    Such  an  argument,  if  carried  to   its   extreme

conclusion,  would also mean that at any time if  Mr  Jeyaretnam

steps  down as Secretary-General of the Workers' Party,  Mr  Low

Thia  Khiang  would  have  to  resign  his  seat  as  Member  of

Parliament for Hougang since it can be argued that some  Hougang

residents may have voted him because of the leadership  provided

by Mr Jeyaretnam.  Just because a member of the team resigns his

seat, it does not necessarily follow that the people would  have

withdrawn  their support for the remaining Members of Parliament

in  the  GRC.   Mr Jeyaretnam must understand that the  existing

team for Jalan Besar stood for election and won the election for

what  the PAP stands for and not because Mr Choo Wee Khiang  was

popular so that without his representation, the mandate  of  the

people would be withdrawn in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such an argument against the call for a by-election is

not extreme and there are parallel examples found elsewhere.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>

For  instance, taking a leaf from corporations, if a  member  of

the  Board of Directors, having been elected to the Board by the

shareholders and who, before the expiry of the term, resigns his

Board  seat, there is no obligation on the part of the Board  to

go   back  to  the  shareholders  for  a  fresh  election.   The

management  of  the company goes on so long as the  Board  feels

that  they are not hindered or incapacitated in any way  by  the

absence of the member of the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Jalan Besar GRC, what is most critical in

the  minds  of  the residents at this moment is whether  or  not

their  interest,  will just be as well-served by  the  remaining

representatives  within the GRC.  If the level  of  service  and

commitment to the residents continues to remain as it was before

the  MP  resigned his seat, there is therefore really no  reason

for  calling for a fresh election.  The point is how much better

served will the people be by calling for a fresh election.  What

it  means,  however, is that the three existing  MPs  for  Jalan

Besar  GRC would have to work much harder in order to  meet  the

demands of the constituents or otherwise they would have a  poor

showing at the next general election.  If the people are  indeed

very, very unhappy because they feel they have been shortchanged

by  the  resignation of their MP, then obviously,  there  is  an

avenue  for  them  to  register their unhappiness  at  the  next

election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are half-way through the present term of this office and

it  is  only  approximately another 21/2 years  before  we  are

required  by  law  to go into another general election.   Rather

than  calling for a fresh election, we should focus our mind  on

how  we  can serve the residents better during this  period.   I

have spoken to many Whampoa residents and they feel that a fresh

election is not what they want at this moment.  I think it  will

be  rather presumptuous on the part of the Opposition Members to

assume  that this is really what the residents of Whampoa  want.

What  matters  to  them is whether the present  MPs  can  really

attend to their needs.  I have no doubt that my

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1774</b></font><br><br>

colleagues, including the appointed second advisor, would be  up

to the task at this moment in serving the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes us wonder, therefore, whether the NCMP's call for

a  by-election is really to serve his purpose and his  political

party's  purpose  or to serve the residents' purpose.   Bear  in

mind  the  huge  expenses involved in calling for a  by-election

when  there is no legal obligation to do so, let me repeat, when

there is no legal obligation to do so.  It would be just another

occasion to show that Mr Jeyaretnam is absolutely callous  about

the way public monies are spent, since it is quite obvious to us

that his call for a by-election is to serve the interest of  his

party, and not of the residents of Jalan Besar GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, Sir, I beg that the motion not be

approved.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am obliged to join

in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not support the motion. Having heard the NCMP and the

seconder, Mr Low Thia Khiang, I regret that I cannot agree  with

their  reasons.   It  is  clear to me that  there  is  no  legal

requirement  for  a by-election under existing  laws.   In  this

sense,  I think the hon. Member for Hougang, Mr Low Thia Khiang,

and  Mr  Chiam See Tong, Member for Potong Pasir,  have  got  it

right, and the NCMP has got it wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think there is another debate about the principles of

democracy and of morality, and these are, basically, around  two

possible principles.  The first is on the nature of the  offence

and  the  second  on  the  question of fair  representation  for

constituents in a parliamentary democracy like Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the nature of the offence. In the past case of the

late Dr Tay Eng Soon in the Eunos GRC, it is clear to us that it

was  his  untimely  death that caused the  vacancy.   There  was

therefore no question of approbation.  Here, given the nature of

the  disqualification faced by the former Member of  Parliament,

Mr Choo Wee Khiang, it could be argued that this might

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>

have affected how voters have felt if they had known at the time

of  voting.  That is to say, we could argue that the  nature  of

the  offence  vitiates  the vote at the last  general  election.

However,  I believe the Singaporean public as a whole trust  the

PAP, on a general basis, is not corrupt and, in fact, the events

in  this  case  evidence that wrong-doing will  be  investigated

thoroughly  and  punished, no matter  who  is  the  perpetrator.

Therefore,  I  think on this ground, the nature of the  offence,

there is no need for a by-election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to my second point on representation. The

NCMP  has  stressed at great length that the nature of democracy

means that every voter must have a representative in Parliament.

That is true.  But it is a jump from there to suggest that every

constituency  must  have  a Member, and  he  misunderstands  the

fundamental  change  that has been made in Singapore  under  the

concept of a Group Representation Constituency (GRC).  These are

fundamentally  different from single-seat  constituencies.   The

concept here is for a team representation.  And this fundamental

change  in  Singapore's system has not been understood  by  many

people who draw analogies from Britain which does not have  this

system, as the NCMP has done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, my answer to him is quite simple. When he

points  to  the  Constitution and suggests that when  a  vacancy

arises,  it  must be filled in certain ways.  But  there  is  no

vacancy.   Nobody elected Mr Choo Wee Khiang as an  independent,

separate  constituency.  It is a team concept.  We do  not  even

know  whether  the constituents of Whampoa did, as  a  majority,

elect  Mr Choo Wee Khiang.  All we know is the official  result.

For the Jalan Besar GRC as a whole, the PAP team led by Minister

Dr  Lee Boon Yang won.  So, to me, there is no vacancy and it is

a political question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have analogies to this in other systems. In a system of

proportional representation, once a party is elected, it  is  up

to  the party to say who should fill up the slots it has won  in

Parliament.  And I think this shows that our constitutional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>

system has changed fundamentally from certain English roots, and

must be understood on its own terms.  So long as a majority of a

team  exists  and  believes  it  can  meet  the  needs  of   the

constituents,  I  would  think that Singaporeans  are  pragmatic

enough to focus on the level of the service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP has a very nice argument that the right of voters

for  a  team  then is to have four representatives, rather  than

three  which  the  Jalan  Besar  GRC  now  has.   I  think  that

Singaporeans  do  not care about the formal numbers.   It  is  a

question  of function and efficiency, rather than numbers.   And

so  long as the team tries and believes it can do well, then  it

should  be able to continue.  If the team does not do  well  and

does  not  meet the constituency's needs, then there will  be  a

price  to  pay  at the next general election.  They  can  choose

another team.  In that sense, I think it is very much a question

of political judgment by the party in power, rather than a legal

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn in this sense to two other points made by,

first,  the  NCMP  and then by the Member for Potong  Pasir,  Mr

Chiam.   The first was that several people  -  I think Mr  Chiam

as  well   -   suggested that the PAP was afraid.  There  was  a

question of fear.  I must, in fairness to the PAP, bring up  the

Marine  Parade  GRC election.  I think there is  clear  evidence

that  where  it  is  felt  there is a  moral  obligation,  Prime

Minister Goh, of all people, had not been afraid to put his  own

neck on the line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Chiam, the Member for Potong Pasir, made a

great  deal  about the fact that it is a by-election.   I  would

remind  Mr  Chiam  to remind himself that he has  twice  claimed

credit  for  the so-called by-election effect at  the  last  two

general  elections,  and  none of  these  was  the  question  of

government  at  stake.  And yet in both, the PAP achieved  quite

substantial victories.  I am not pro-PAP.  But I think these are

facts  that  must be stated, to be fair to the  debate  in  this

House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then turn to the question of why the Prime Minister has

decided not to meet

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>

the  request of the Opposition to hold a by-election.  I frankly

do not know.  I am not a mind reader.  But if I were to guess, I

would  look at some of the elections that are coming up  in  the

countries  around us in this time of crisis.  When  we  look  at

Malaysia, we realise that in the run-up to a possible early snap

elections,  their  foreign relations seem to be  taking  a  very

aggressive and unreasonable stance at some of our issues.  If we

look  at  Thailand's elections  that are coming up and those  in

South  Korea, we will see this as well.  Basically, by-elections

or  general  elections force both parties to make  their  voices

more shrill and more nationalistic.  My bet would be that in the

Thai  general  elections, you will see a lot of statements  made

about  nationalism, about foreigners buying up  Thai  companies.

That  could  be a problem for us too.  We had a debate  in  this

House  about foreign talent, especially in times of crisis.   Do

we  need,  in a time of crisis, therefore, to open up  potential

fissures?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another stray point made by the NCMP is related to the

nature  of  Backbenchers and NMPs.  He says that the  nature  of

democracy must be judged by the number of Opposition Members  in

the  House.   Well,  I  would say this much.   The  job  of  the

Opposition is to be the next government.  That is their claim in

democratic  theory.   It  is  not  to  ask  questions  here   in

Parliament.  My job, as an NMP, is certainly not to be the  next

government.   It  is  to  try, as best as  I  can,  to  increase

accountability and add what little I can to the debate  in  this

House.   In  this sense, we cannot compare the two.  One  is  an

apple.  The other is an orange.  I do not see what he stands  to

gain  by  this,  except  for  a stray  bullet  here  and  there.

[Laughter].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the stray bullet. I would say that while

that,  in  theory, taking over government is  the  goal  of  the

Opposition, the Opposition has failed to do that so far.  And  I

do  not  see,  more  to the points of this motion,  what  a  by-election  would  do  to further the cause of the  Opposition  of

trying to be the next government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having talked about the nature of representation and

emphasised the team GRC concept, I think I have another point to

make.  And this is the degree to which a person who is not an MP

can  be  allowed  to  take on additional duties  caused  by  the

vacancy.  It has been widely reported that Mr Heng Chee  How  is

now serving as the Second Adviser to Whampoa.  Citizens can,  of

course, help at the grassroots, as can party members who are not

MPs.   I  think  almost all MPs have somebody from  their  party

helping them, as a very close associate.  But I think there must

be  a  line  between  what an MP can do and  what  these  normal

citizens and party members can do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A legal principle says it quite nicely. The nature of

parliamentary representation is that it is delegated to  you  as

elected   MPs.   What  is  delegated  cannot  then  be   further

delegated.  There are, in that sense, some things an MP  can  do

that  a  non-MP  cannot.   Of course, parliamentary  debate  and

duties is one of them.  But, also, I would argue, things outside

this  House,  eg,  signing letters to Ministries  on  behalf  of

constituents, officiating as guest-of-honour.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members an analogy. When a football team has a

player sent off, the team as a whole is not disqualified, but it

cannot substitute the sent off player.  The position of the  PAP

Government is that the team in Jalan Besar can cope and carry on

and,  therefore,  there is no need for  a  by-election.   It  is

consistent with that stand.  The PAP team in Jalan Besar  should

observe  the differences and, even if Mr Heng serves  as  Second

Adviser, he should not act as an MP without being elected.  I am

confident that the PAP team in Jalan Besar GRC will observe  the

constitutional and legal principles of representation  and  fair

play.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is for these reasons that I do not support the

motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, Mr

Jeyaretnam argues and I quote him in his motion that "in all the

circumstances it is only right and proper" that a by-election be

held in Jalan Besar

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>

GRC  in  view of Mr Choo Wee Khiang's resignation.  I completely

disagree with that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quotes us the Singapore Constitution and the Malaysian

Constitution, Article 54, saying that the Malaysian Constitution

provides a limit within which a by-election should be held.  But

Article   54  of  the  Malaysian  Constitution  is  really   the

Malaysia's  Constitution.   Singapore  adopted  it   only   when

Singapore joined Malaysia in 1963.  Before 1963, we had  in  our

Constitution  which was then called the Singapore (Constitution)

Order  in  Council  1958, Article 44.  And that  Article  44  is

exactly what we have in today's Constitution Article 49(1) which

says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the seat of a Member has become vacant for any

reason other than a dissolution, the vacancy shall be filled  by

election in the manner provided by or under any law for the time

being in force in Singapore.'

<br><br>This was in the 1958 Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1965 Constitution, we changed it after we left

Malaysia.   We adopted the same words in the 1958 (Constitution)

Order by expunging the words "within three months from the  date

on  which  it  is  established that there is a vacancy"  in  the

Malaysian Constitution because we did not take the position that

the  Malaysians  had taken.  And it is for good reason  that  we

went  back  to  the  1958 Constitution,  because  that  was  our

position before we went into Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Constitution says, we will hold a by-election "in

the  manner provided by and under any law for the time being  in

force".   The law being in force is our Parliamentary  Elections

Act.  Section 24(2A) says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In respect of any Group Representation Constituency, no

writ  shall  be issued under subsection (1) for an  election  to

fill a vacancy unless all the Members for that constituency have

vacated their seats in Parliament.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that we debated the GRC issue during the

debates   on  the  amendments  to  the  Constitution   and   the

Parliamentary Elections Act, and why we specifically  made  this

provision.  We specifically and expressly prohibit the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>

issue  of  a writ for an election in a GRC, unless all  the  MPs

resign  their  seats.  The legislative intent then  was  not  to

allow any particular MP so elected as part of a group of MPs for

the  GRC  to  hold  the  rest to ransom through  resignation  or

otherwise.  The thinking then was that all the other MPs  should

not  be  forced  to  vacate their seats on  account  of  one  MP

vacating his seat for whatever reason  -  death, resignation  or

whatever.  So it is quite clear that under our law, it expressly

provides  for  the exclusion of the issue of a writ  for  a  by-election  in  a  GRC.   That  is the  legal  position  which  Mr

Jeyaretnam may well know, and some of our colleagues  here  have

also mentioned this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no conflict between Article 49 of our

Constitution and section 24 of the Parliamentary Elections Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no breach of parliamentary democracy, as Mr

Jeyaretnam has suggested.  As Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr  Simon  Tay

have said, the MPs in a GRC are elected together as a team,  and

not  singly.   This  is  our GRC system.   I  choose  the  words

"Whampoa   area".    There  is  no  such   thing   as   "Whampoa

Constituency".  The GRC is Jalan Besar GRC.  The number  of  MPs

there  is four.  By an internal arrangement, Mr Choo Wee  Khiang

went to work in Whampoa and Kallang and also by arrangement, the

MPs in the area also take turns to visit one another's area when

they   have    block   parties,  block  visits,  meet-the-people

sessions,  and  so on.  For example, at the end of  every  third

Tuesday  of  the  month,  I  am in another  Branch  meeting  the

residents who may be living in the Sin Ming area or in  the  Toa

Payoh East area.  Similarly, the MP in that area will come to my

area.  We are MPs of that  GRC.  We do not just belong to Bishan

East, like myself, for example.  Neither does Mr Choo Wee Khiang

belong to Whampoa only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in 1997 the voters elected the four of them, Dr Lee Boon

Yang, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr Choo Wee Khiang,

as  one  team.  Dr Lee Boon Yang also canvassed in  the  Whampoa

area  together with Choo Wee Khiang.  Similarly, he did the same

thing in Geylang West with Peh Chin Hua or in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>

Kolam  Ayer  together with Dr Yaacob Ibrahim.  So  there  is  no

reason  whatsoever for the remaining MPs to resign just  because

one  MP  has resigned.  In fact, I would say that the  remaining

MPs  have  a  moral  obligation to carry on  and  implement  the

programmes  which  they promised and pledged to  the  voters  in

1997.   Of  course,  this means that they have  to  work  a  bit

harder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann talks about the example of a board. It

does  not  need to resign if one board member resigns  and  they

need  to  call an AGM.  There is no such requirement.  Mr  Simon

Tay gave the analogy of football.  I can also use the analogy of

football.   If  the  striker beats up the referee  for  a  wrong

ruling  and the referee gives him the red card, he is out.   But

that does not mean that the other 10 members have to quit.  They

will carry on and they will play hard, and they will win if they

play  very hard.  It is the same thing for the three MPs now  in

Jalan Besar GRC.  They work hard and they will work very hard so

that  through their efforts they will be returned again.  I have

no doubt that they will be returned again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the three of them lost no time in making

arrangements to cover the Whampoa area since Mr Choo Wee  Khiang

went on leave of absence in December last year.  They took turns

to  attend meet-the-people sessions.  They took turns to  attend

the  RC  functions, block parties, house visits and so  on.   So

they  are still active.  They remain active, and they will  have

to be active.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is Mr Heng Chee How sent there? Is it to replace Mr

Choo Wee Khiang?  Certainly not.  Mr Choo Wee Khiang was elected

together  with the others.  Mr Heng cannot be appointed  by  the

Government  to  represent  the  people.   He  is  not  there  to

represent the people.  He is there - the PAP always plans  ahead

-  for training.  We sent him there for training so that he gets

ground  experience on how to work with people, how to understand

the  issues  and concerns, how to deal with their  problems  and

help them with their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>

problems.   But  in the signing of letters during the  meet-the-people  session, the three current MPs will still  be  there  by

rotation to take care of such cases, as they do for block  party

attendance and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no question that the constitutional rights of

the  voters  in Whampoa have been diminished.  They  have  their

rights.  They voted for the four MPs and the MPs carry on.   The

voters,  in fact, voted with the knowledge that should a vacancy

arise, such a vacancy need not be filled, as provided for in our

law.  There is no question that the mandate has been thwarted or

withdrawn.   So  regardless of the reasons or the  circumstances

under  which  an MP has to resign, there is no need  for  a  by-election  because the existing MPs will carry on with  the  task

which they have been entrusted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam must be fooling himself when he said that the

PAP  is  afraid  to lose the by-election in Jalan Besar  because

according to him that is the only reason why we do not  want  to

have  a  by-election.   He  said that the  PAP  accused  him  of

chickening out in the Marine Parade by-election.  I do not  know

why  he chickened out.  Maybe he did not chicken out but he  was

played  out!   There were four of them.  One  of  them  who  was

supposed to be there with him happened to be somewhere  else  in

Jurong  and  lost his way.  He was supposed to be in the  Marine

Parade  nomination  centre  but he could not  find  his  way  to

Marine Parade.  So he should find out why that team-mate of  his

decided  not to turn up.  Maybe he chickened out.  So there  was

good  reason  why the PAP said the Workers' Party chickened  out

because they did not find the right person to contest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason why the PAP should fear a loss in a by-election either. We won convincingly in 1997 - 67.7% of the

votes.  There is no question that we will win again should there

be  a  contest.  I read Mr Jeyaretnam saying that he would  quit

politics if he were to contest and lose.  We do not want him  to

lose.   We  want him to remain here.  It would be a pity  if  he

were  to contest and lose.  In fact, his presence here is a good

lesson for all Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>

that  that  is  the  kind  of  opposition  leaders  we  have  in

Singapore.   I think it is a salutary lesson.  If the opposition

does not wake up, then they may lose again in the next election.

So  it  is a lesson not just for Singaporeans but also a  lesson

for the opposition parties themselves to find the right kind  of

people to lead them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam, in fact, said that we should have a by-election

to put the Government's handling of the economy to the test.  We

do  not  need a by-election to put the Government's handling  of

the  economy to the test.  If he had been following events,  and

reading  reports from financial analysts, from people who  know,

they  have  said that Singapore indeed has come out with  flying

colours  in the way we have handled the economy.  But  the  real

test  is, at the end of the term, how would the people vote  for

the  PAP?  That is the real test, not in a by-election.  So what

does  he want?  To get an opportunity to contest?  But his party

cannot  even  get  organised.  So he would  not  be  contesting.

Maybe he would leave it to Mr Jeyaretnam.  I do not know whether

the Workers' Party could also be organised to contest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's record for good governance is widely

acknowledged.  So we do not need to have a by-election  to  test

the  Government.  Mr Jeyaretnam also suggests that  maybe  at  a

time  like  this, we should save money and have the Presidential

election  together with the by-election.  That  is  a  facetious

argument.   A  Presidential  election  is  vastly  different  in

purpose,  scope  and  format compared  to  a  by-election.   The

candidates   are  different,  the  issues  are  different,   the

objectives  are  different.   So we  should  not  hold  the  two

together and confuse our electorate with two different elections

going on at the same time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prerogative to call a by-election, "considering all the

circumstances",  really  rests with  the  Prime  Minister.   His

decision  will  be based on the best interest of Singapore.   He

has explained why he has decided not to call a by-election.   He

wants  Singaporeans to focus on our incipient economic recovery.

Do not take for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>

granted  that our economic growth is assured.  Look  around  us.

Many  things  can  still happen and it is  still  in  the  early

stages.  So despite the changes and the rising stock market,  do

not  take  for granted that things will be good.  This  was  the

same  message that we put out even before the 1997  crisis.   We

said:  "Don't  take things for granted."  The people  said,  "It

cannot  happen.  The PAP will handle it."  Indeed,  we  have  an

economic  crisis  due to external reasons.   So  for  very  good

reason, do not take things for granted.  The Prime Minister  has

indeed  cautioned Singaporeans against assuming that the current

upturn would be quick or permanent.  He feels that a by-election

held  at  this time will be a distraction from the main task  in

seeing through this economic recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans on the whole appreciate that the

Government's far-sighted policies have stood the test  of  time,

particularly  in  this time of regional economic  crisis.   They

also know that the Government has acted decisively to review and

improve  many  of  its policies, some in very fundamental  ways,

like  the  way we handle our financial institutions  and  banks.

Ensuring that these revised policies are implemented effectively

and  successfully will therefore require the undivided attention

of  all  Singaporeans.   I  think that  should  be  our  primary

objective.   It is not the time for fractiousness  and  partisan

politics which a by-election will foment. This is the pragmatic,

hard-headed  approach that we have taken which  has  worked  for

Singapore all these years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties, on the other hand, like what Mr

Simon   Tay  has  alluded  to,  want  excitement  and  political

agitation.   They  have had their day during  the  last  general

elections  and they made no impact.  Two Members were  returned.

There  is no reason why the Government should satisfy the vanity

of certain opposition figures by holding a by-election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Predictably, the opposition makes loud calls for a by-election to be held. But Mr Jeyaretnam fools himself if he

thinks  that  having  a by-election is the topmost  priority  of

Singaporeans now.  Not holding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1785</b></font><br><br>

a  by-election  is not a breach of parliamentary democracy.   In

accordance  with the law, the electorate has a choice  at  every

general election.  The law does not require a by-election to  be

held  when an MP in a GRC vacates his seat for whatever  reason.

The law provides leeway to the Prime Minister to decide.  If  he

considers it necessary, by-elections will be held.  The PAP  has

not  shied  away  from by-elections in the  past.   As  for  the

vacancy  that has arisen at Jalan Besar GRC, the Prime  Minister

has  decided that, on balance, it is not necessary nor is it  in

our interest to hold one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have sat through

all   the  speeches  and,  apart  from  the  speakers  from  the

Opposition  Members in Parliament, the sum total of  the  answer

from  NMPs  and  PAP MPs seems to be "Section  24(2A)  does  not

require  us,  so  we  would not hold any  by-election."   May  I

suggest  that that is a lame excuse of people who fear  defeats.

They hide behind a legal excuse for them and not face up to  the

realities.   I am aware of section 24(2A).  I pointed  out  what

Article 49 of the Constitution says.  It does not say "leave out

GRCs".   It says "leave out only NCMP post", but in every  other

case  the vacancy "shall be filled."  There are no two  ways  of

reading  it.  The vacancy shall be filled.  As Mr Chiam  pointed

out,  "shall be filled" cannot be interpreted as saying  you  do

not  have  to hold it till the next elections.  But is that  how

the  Article is to be interpreted, that you do not have to  hold

any by-election?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24(2A), as I said, in the first place, would appear

to  conflict  with Article 49.  I am challenged to  take  it  to

court.  But better than the court it would be for this House  to

resolve that notwithstanding section 24(2A), there should  be  a

by-election in Jalan Besar GRC.  It is within the competence  of

this House.  Parliament can pass a resolution.  So I do not have

to  take  it to court.  I come to Parliament which,  as  I  have

said, is the supreme body in a parliamentary democracy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal very briefly. As I said, the main theme

seems  to be that we do not have to hold it, we have got section

24(2A) behind us.  The other reasons are simply just by the way.

But if I may just reply to one or two of these criticisms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin said that I had not made out a strong

case.   I  do not know what he meant by not making out a  strong

case.   I  did  not follow what he said about PAP  having  shown

itself  to come down on criminal activities.  What has that  got

to  do with representation in Parliament?  Just because the  PAP

has  prosecuted - is that what he is saying - Mr Choo Wee Khiang

in court and had him punished, that there is no need to hold any

by-election?  Is that the argument?  I do not quite follow that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think almost every speaker mentioned about the practical

arrangements  that have been made by the PAP, how  wonderful  it

is, that they can send Mr Heng Chee How to look after voters  in

Whampoa.  But that again misses the point.  Heng Chee How, as Mr

Chiam  mentioned, is not the choice of the voters yet.   And  he

cannot by any stretch of the imagination be asked to do the work

of  an MP there.  They need an MP to do the work in Whampoa, not

Mr Heng Chee How.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the third speaker also talked about free and fair

elections.   This was taken up by Mr Sin Boon Ann and  Mr  Simon

Tay,  says, "Oh, the Opposition got a sound beating in the  last

elections."   So  there  is no question about  Singaporeans  not

wanting  an Opposition in Parliament, that they do not want  any

Opposition in Parliament.  That again, with respect, ignores the

realities.  I have to, at the risk of repetition, go back to our

own  particular  experience in Cheng  San.   Why  did  we  lose?

Because  of  the  threats and intimidation, extra-parliamentary,

extra-legal  methods used by the PAP, by the Prime Minister  and

his two Deputy Prime Ministers invading our own pitches in Cheng

San,  and  watching over the voters.  And to say that we  got  a

sound  beating  is to miss entirely the point  and  to  see  the

elections through the PAP glasses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Simon Tay also brought up

examples.   Mr  Sin  Boon Ann talks about a board  of  companies

losing a director.  I am afraid I cannot  see the analogy.  They

are  quite  different things.  And the football  team  which  Mr

Simon Tay talks about, I am afraid I cannot really see what  the

analogy  is  between  a  football  team  and  having  your   own

representatives in Parliament.  But what really astounded me was

Mr  Simon  Tay's  announcement  that  there  is  no  vacancy  in

Parliament.   As  I have pointed out when I spoke,  the  Speaker

only  this  afternoon  announced that there  was  a  vacancy  in

Parliament  from 2nd June this year.  So what is  Mr  Simon  Tay

saying  that there is no vacancy?  Was the Speaker speaking  out

of turn when he announced that there was a vacancy?

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I ask whether the NCMP will give the

floor to me?  Will you allow clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If you want, speak afterwards, Mr Simon

Tay.   But  did you not say that there was no vacancy?   If  you

want  to  clarify, you should have clarified it  then.   And  he

harps  on  Opposition Members failing so far.   This  was  again

taken  up by the Minister.  The proof of the pudding is  in  the

eating, they say.  And here is an opportunity to have just  that

-  to  see  whether the Opposition Members have failed  or  not.

Will you take up the challenge?  Or will you just say, "Ah,  but

section  24(2A) says we don't have to."  Will you  take  up  the

challenge?  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Let  the

electorate in Jalan Besar decide whether the Opposition  Members

are failing or not, or whether they would like to see Opposition

Members in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good indulging in words without being prepared to

put  your words to the test.  He says that the PAP has no  fear.

And I thought the Minister would be giving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>

us  sound reasons for not holding a by-election.  But he says PM

has   given  his  reason.   We  should  have  expected   greater

clarification of what the PM was trying to say.  But we did  not

get  that.  What was the Prime Minister saying when he said  "to

distract the nation from its economic activities"?  What was  he

trying  to say?  Just mere words without any meaning?  If  there

is  a  meaning, what is it?  Let us have it.  And we do not  get

any of these.  So I do not know if there is anything else for me

to answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, have you got any more

new points?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes. I do not think there is anything more

for  me to answer.  I am just coming to that, Mr Deputy Speaker,

if  you  will  bear with me.  I was just saying  that  it  would

appear  there is nothing more to answer.  Because  all  we  have

heard is just one reason.  It is a pity.  But I think the people

of  Singapore  will see.  They will read, I hope,  something  of

what was said today and they will judge for themselves.  In  the

final  analysis,  it  is the people.  And  it  is  the  people's

judgement  that we must accept.  The conclusion I get from  this

evening's  debate is that the PAP is not prepared  to  face  the

people and accept their verdict.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Prime Minister, for the

Presidential  elections, whether Singaporeans who  are  overseas

will be allowed to vote at Singapore's missions overseas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng (for the Prime Minister):</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of overseas voting was last raised in

Parliament  in  October  1998.  There  is  no  change   to   the

Government's  position that we are not yet  ready  to  introduce

such  voting.  This is because the limitations  of  the  various

forms of overseas voting remain.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate from experience that only about 3.5% of

electors  are likely to be overseas on polling day  for  various

reasons.   They  are  dispersed  in  many  countries  and   many

locations  within them.  We have only 26 missions,  which  means

that many electors will not live or work close enough to one  of

these  missions  to  go  there  to  vote,  especially  in  large

countries  like  the  United States or  China.   Voting  in  our

overseas  missions  would  probably not  effectively  reach  the

majority of these Singaporeans.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans to introduce overseas voting in the

forthcoming  Presidential  Election.   However,  the  Government

recognizes   that   this  is  not  a  static  situation.    With

globalization, more Singaporeans will work abroad and  the  case

for overseas voting may change.

<div align="center"><b>CRIMES INVOLVING POLICE AND CIVIL DEFENCE OFFICERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  whether the recent incidents of crimes  involving

the  police  and  civil defence officers reflect  an  increasing

trend of crimes amongst officers in the force.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no consistent upward trend in the number of

Police  and  Civil  Defence officers committing  corruption  and

other criminal offences.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 26th June 1999, 21 Police officers have been

charged  in  court  for  corruption  and  criminal  offences  as

compared  to  33 in 1998, 29 in 1997, and 34 in  1996.   As  for

Civil Defence officers, the numbers are 1 in 1998, 4 in 1997 and

2 in 1996 for various offences. None was charged for corruption.

There is 1 case under investigation this year.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of police officers charged in Court for

corruption and criminal offences averaged about 28 per year from

1995  to 1998. This makes up less than 0.4% of the Police  Force

strength (strength to-date is 7,417).  Nevertheless, these cases

are  still  of concern. The harm caused by a few rogue  officers

goes  far beyond the numbers they represent.  A single  case  is

one case too many.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Police has given the assurance that

such  officers will be systematically weeded out and charged  in

Court.  They  will be held fully accountable for  their  actions

even  if  it  means  having  to make their  acts  public.   Such

transparency clearly demonstrates the Police's determination  to

eradicate corruption and criminal acts.  We cannot allow  public

confidence in the Police to be eroded because of the acts  of  a

few rogue officers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>

The  Ministry of Home Affairs places a high premium  on  honesty

and  integrity  for all its officers.  Police has implemented  a

range  of enhanced measures aimed at eradicating corruption  and

criminal acts in the Force. These include:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Better preventive measures;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Stronger detection mechanism; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Proactive co-operation with CPIB.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is well under control. The Ministry of

Home  Affairs  and  its departments are fully conscious  of  the

trust  and respect accorded to them by the public. The exemplary

conduct  and behaviour of officers contribute to this trust  and

respect.   We  will  continue to uphold the high  standards  and

<div align="center"><b>REVIEW OF LEGISLATION AFFECTING JUVENILE DELINQUENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether  the  Government  has any plans  to  review  legislation

affecting  juvenile delinquents in view of rising  crimes  among

the group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><i>Juvenile Delinquency Trend</i>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of crime involving juvenile delinquents is

not  rising.   In  the  first 5 months of 1999,  the  number  of

juveniles arrested decreased by 42%, from 1,079 to 631  compared

to  the same period last year. The misperception could be due to

a  number  of  recent  cases happening in quick  succession  and

extensive media coverage on these cases.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile delinquency is a multi-faceted problem. The

reasons why a juvenile turns to crime are diverse and complex in

nature.   A  concerted  effort  by Governmental  bodies,  social

agencies,  community  organisations,  and  parents  and   family

members is needed to deal with the problem effectively.  In this

regard,  the "Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime"  or  IMYC

which I chair monitors the youth crime situation and coordinates

the  various  measures  by  key agencies  such  as  the  Police,

schools,  the Courts, MCD, NYC and VWOs to tackle youth  crimes.

A  wide range of measures, such as the Streetwise Programme, the

Honorary VSC Scheme and the Guidance Programme, have been put in

place  over  the last 2-3 years.  These measures  have  kept  in

check  the  incidence of juvenile and youth crimes in  the  past

couple of years.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Government is reviewing the Children and

Young  Persons Act to enhance the rehabilitation programmes  for

youth  offenders.   The review will look at provisions  for  the

treatment  of  juvenile  offenders.  In  the  area  of  juvenile

delinquency, we will be looking at alternative treatment options

and provisions to enhance the rehabilitation process.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, Police will continue to make its presence

felt  on  the  ground  and monitor places where  youths  usually

gather.   It  will  continue  to conduct  checks  on  suspicious

juveniles found loitering in the void decks, coffee shops,  fast

food outlets and shopping malls.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

Providers  (ISPs) are prevented from intruding into the  privacy

of their account holders.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1792</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1793</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current legislation already offers

protection to the Internet users, we recognise that there  is  a

need  to  formulate a set of clear guidelines for  ISPs  on  the

actions  which  constitute an invasion of  user's  privacy.  The

MCIT, together with NCB, TAS and other Government agencies, have

already started work to develop this set of guidelines.  At  the

same time, we will also examine the current laws to see if there

are areas that need to be improved.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD UPGRADING PROGRAMMES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  whether, in the light of economic  recovery,  there

will  be  plans  for more upgrading programmes for  Housing  and

Development Board estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgrading programmes are part of our Estates Renewal

Strategy  to  rejuvenate  older HDB estates  while  keeping  the

community ties intact.  The Main Upgrading Programme (MUP)  aims

to  improve  the living conditions of the older HDB estates  and

bring  them  closer to the standards of the latest  HDB  housing

developments.   The  Interim Upgrading  Programme  (IUP)  allows

residents  living in HDB blocks that are more than 10 years  old

to  enjoy some form of upgrading to the common areas before  the

blocks  are  due for MUP.   Both these upgrading programmes  are

heavily subsidised.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will maintain the IUP at 18 precincts for

1999 to allow residents to continue to enjoy the benefits.  This

takes   into  account  the  resources  of  the  Town   Councils.

Increasing the number of precincts will lead to slower and  less

than  satisfactory implementation of the projects.  The  current

programme  of 18,000 dwelling units per year is just  right  for

the Town Councils to comfortably handle.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for MUP, it was earlier announced that the programme

will be scaled down to 5 precincts in 1999 from 10 last year  in

view of the economic uncertainty then, and the fact that we will

be having a budget deficit in FY99.  Should the economy continue

to  show clear and sustained signs of recovery, my Ministry will

review  the  programme with a view to increasing the  number  of

precincts for MUP next year.

<div align="center"><b>USE OF MEDISAVE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health whether

the  amount  of  Medisave that can be used for  chemotherapy  in

hospitals  will  be  revised upwards  from  the  present  $2,000

ceiling  which has not been reviewed since 1991, so as  to  make

the effective but expensive 'advance cancer drugs' affordable to

patients.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the hon. Member that my Ministry

has  already  reviewed  and increased  the  Medisave  withdrawal

limits  for  outpatient chemotherapy.  From January 1998,  these

limits  have  been raised from $250 to $400 for  each  treatment

cycle  lasting between 21 and 28 days.  The withdrawal limit  is

$100  for a weekly treatment cycle.  The yearly withdrawal limit

now  stands at $3,000, up from $2,000.  With the raising of  the

limits,  about  80% of subsidised patients and  60%  of  private

patients  would  be able to pay their entire chemotherapy  bills

using   Medisave  alone.   This  does  not  take  into   account

MediShield claims which can also be used to offset part  of  the

bill,   hence  making  the  chemotherapy  treatment  even   more

affordable.   The  hon. Member may be assured that  my  Ministry

reviews Medisave withdrawal limits regularly to ensure that they

are adequate for most patients.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of eligible foreign spouses of citizens and

permanent  residents, SIR either grants them Singapore permanent

resident  status  or  issues them with long  term  social  visit

passes.   Foreign spouses who are issued with long  term  social

visit  passes are allowed to work in Singapore.  They can  apply

for the appropriate category of work pass.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>MILITARY DEFERMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and  Minister for Defence what  are  the  reasons  for

granting and not granting military deferment to 18-year-old male

Singaporeans and if he can give an update on (i) the  number  of

such  persons who were granted this deferment to complete  their

tertiary education before joining the army, from 1994-1998; (ii)

which  field of study they were in; and (iii) whether they  were

in local or overseas tertiary institutions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporean males are liable for full-time National

Service enlistment once they are 18 years old.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For practical reasons, MINDEF, in general, defers their

enlistment  to allow them to complete the course of  study  they

are  undertaking when they turn 18. This means that MINDEF would

generally  grant  deferment from full time national  service  to

allow  them  to  complete  their GCE A  level,  ITE  or  diploma

studies.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also grant deferment for university studies if the

applicant  is  able to commence his course of study  before  the

enlistment age.  For overseas university studies, he  will  have

to commence his studies before the  age  of    17 1/2.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers of persons granted deferment for tertiary

(i.e. diploma and undergraduate) studies fluctuate from year  to

year.  On  average,  over  the last  4  years,  about  4000-5000

deferments  are  granted  annually for local  tertiary  studies,

primarily  in  the  local polytechnics. In addition,  about  100

deferments are granted for overseas tertiary studies each  year.

I  am unable to provide a further breakdown of these figures  by

field  of study because we do not keep such records since  field

of study is not a factor for consideration for deferment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On compassionate grounds, MINDEF also grants deferment

to  males if enlisting them for full-time national service  will

cause them and their family severe financial or social hardship.

All  applications for deferment on this ground are evaluated  by

an  Advisory Board which comprises representatives from both the

public  and private sectors and which will make a recommendation

to  the  Commander  of  Central Manpower  Base.   Deferment,  if

granted,  is meant to give the males concerned time to sort  out

their  financial  or social problems before they  are  enlisted.

In  the past 3 years, an average of 50 cases a year were granted

deferment on compassionate grounds.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF also grants deferment to those whose medical or

physical   condition   renders  them   temporarily   unfit   for

enlistment.   The  deferment is to enable them to  recover  from

their medical and physical conditions.  In the past 3 years,  an

average  of  130  registrants are granted deferment  on  medical

grounds each year.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our water consumption actually declined in 1998. The

average daily water consumption fell by 0.3% in 1998, a reversal

from an increase of 5 % and 4.2 % in 1997 and 1996 respectively.

The first five months of 1999 also saw a decline of 2.9 % in the

average  daily  water consumption. This is  partly  due  to  the

economic  downturn  and the measures we introduced  to  conserve

water.  Water tariffs were restructured in 1997 to  reflect  the

strategic  importance and scarcity of water. The third  increase

of  water  tariff,  of  four annual increments,  has  just  been

implemented on 1st July 1999.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board organises an annual programme

to  promote  the  conservation of water as a  way  of  life  for

Singaporeans.   The  programme  covers  a  range  of  activities

including  publicity, visits to waterworks,  water  conservation

talks  to schools, "save water" exhibits at community functions,

and  the distribution of "save water" leaflets.  In some  years,

we  also mount a "save water" campaign. There was a "save water"

campaign last year, but this need not be done annually. PUB will

press on with its programme of water conservation activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, employers contribute to SDF at 1% of the

monthly remuneration of workers drawing salary of $1,000 or less

a  month. In FY98, the SDF collected some $20.4 million in  such

levies. Despite  the  economic  slowdown,  the  SDF  supported  a

record  564,375 training places in FY98, which is a 6%  increase

from  the  previous year. This translates to one training  place

for  every three persons in the workforce, compared to only  one

training place for every ten persons in FY86. With the increased

level of training activity, the total grant commitment has risen

to $88.4 million in FY98, exceeding collections significantly.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is no danger of immediate depletion of

SDF funds, the current rate of disbursement versus collection is

clearly not sustainable.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present salary cut-off of $1,000 was raised from the

previous  ceiling  of $750 in April 1995.  In  the  1995  Budget

Debate,  the  Minister  for Finance had given  notice  that  the

Skills  Development Levy would be further adjusted over time  to

ensure   that  the  SDF  has  adequate  funds  to  help  upgrade

Singapore's workforce for the 21st Century.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is currently studying how this adjustment

can  be  made, taking into account the state of the economy.  We

will  not  want  to  make any increases to the  levy  until  the

vehicles  (EVs)  and hybrid vehicles (HVs)1 occupy  road  space,

contribute  to  traffic  congestion and  cause  road  damage  no

different from conventional vehicles (CVs).  EVs and HVs  should

therefore  be subject to similar ownership and usage  management

measures,  ie.,  customs duties, registration  fees,  additional

registration fees and road tax;  as well as COE and ERP charges.

Loans  which are adequately collateralised and that are not  in

arrears in interest or principal repayments are also classified

as  non-performing  if  they have weak  financials.   This  has

resulted in local banks reflecting a higher NPL figure than  is

the actual case.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local banks have set aside substantial provisions,

amounting to 72% of their regional bank and non-bank NPLs as at

31st December 1998. These provisions and the collateral backing

the  regional  NPLs  in  aggregate  exceed  the  regional  NPLs

outstanding.  The level of NPLs does not threaten the financial

health of any of the local banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(III) Kinds of Crimes Committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the period 1st January 1999 to 31st May 1999, 1,366

youths  were arrested for seizable offences.  This is 37%  lower

when  compared to the 2,159 youths arrested for the same  period

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theft and its related offences form the bulk of seizable

offences  committed by youths.  About 66% of those arrested  for

seizable  offences  in the first five months  of  1999  (or  900

youths) committed such offences.  For the same period last year,

such offences were committed by about 72% of those arrested  for

seizable  offences (or 1,522 youths).  Shoplifting is  the  most

common  theft  related offence among youths.   522  youths  were

arrested for shoplifting in the first five months of 1999  while

978 were arrested for the same period last year.  The number  of

youths  arrested  for  offences relating to  unlawful  assembly,

rioting  and serious hurt from 1st January to 31st May  1999  is

189, a 10% decrease from 209 for the same period last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(IV) Measures in Place to Tackle Youth Crimes

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministry on Youth (IMYC) cordinates a range of

measure on prevention, enforcement and rehabilitation.  Measures

to tackle youth crimes involving MHA include:

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School Talks

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and CNB jointly conduct school talks to educate high-risk students about the dangers of secret societies and drug

abuse, and to advise these students to lead drug-free and crime-free lives.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caution And Prison Visit Programme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This programme is part of the rehabilitative programme for

high-risk  youths,  such  as  gang  members  or  those  who  are

associated with gangs.  Students who are involved in gangs  will

be  cautioned by officers from Secret Societies Branch (SSB)  of

Criminal  Investigation  Department (CID)  against  future  gang

involvement.  They will also be counselled

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>

by CID and invited to participate in the Prison Visit Programme.

Under  this  programme, they will see for themselves  the  harsh

realities of prison life.  The students will be recalled  during

the school holidays after the visit for a review.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honorary Volunteer Special Constabulary (VSC) Scheme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The honorary VSC scheme aims to strengthen links between

schools  and  the  Police  so  as to keep  juvenile  delinquency

problems and youth-gang influence away from the schools.  School

discipline  masters/mistresses and  disciplinary  teachers  from

secondary schools are appointed as honorary VSC senior officers.

These honorary VSC officers serve as school liaison officers  in

networking with the Police.  They also help to project a  symbol

of police presence and authority in the schools.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guidance Programme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guidance Programme, administered by Police and MCD,

targets juvenile offenders who have committed petty crimes,  but

where there are mitigating factors.  It is a 6-month supervision

and  counselling  programme which involves the  parents  of  the

offenders.   The  programme aims to help the juvenile  offenders

recognise the seriousness and consequences of their act  and  to

acquire  life-skills and self-control.  It also  aims  to  equip

parents  with  the necessary skills and knowledge for  effective

parenting.   Upon successful completion of the programme,  these

juvenile  offenders may be cautioned by Police in lieu of  Court

prosecution.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;StreetWise Programme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The StreetWise Programme, initiated by the National Youth

Council  and Police, is a 6-month programme designed  to  change

the  behaviour of youths who have unwittingly drifted into  gang

activities.   Youths  who  are identified  as  gang  members  or

associating with gang activities, but where there are mitigating

factors, may be placed under this programme.  The programme aims

to  inculcate life skills and discipline through counselling and

developmental  training sessions, as well as  voluntary  curfew.

Juveniles  involved in serious offences with mitigating  factors

may also be placed under this programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restriction on Participation in Tea Dances

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles have been restricted from patronising

entertainment outlets that serve alcohol with dancing facilities

or  tea  dances.   This  is  to protect  them  from  undesirable

influences  at such entertainment outlets as well as to  prevent

the  gangs from using these entertainment outlets as grounds for

youth gang recruitment and congregation.

<div align="center"><b>E-COMMERCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  if  there  are  any  (i)  projections  regarding   the

potential contribution of E-commerce over the next 5-10 years to

Singapore's Gross Domestic Product compared with other  regional

economies; and (ii) statistics as to the percentage of small and

medium-sized enterprises in economies such as Hong Kong,  Taiwan

and South Korea which have embarked on E-commerce.



<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no such projections regarding the potential

contribution  of E-commerce to our Gross Domestic  Product  over

the next 5-10 years. The E-commerce industry is still a very new

industry,  whose impact on the economy,  not just for Singapore,

but  also  for the global economy cannot be correctly estimated.

But  its  rapid growth confirms the conclusion of most  analysts

that this is major global trend with far-reaching effects.   The

problem of estimation arises because the industry is potentially

very broad and cuts many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>

economic   sectors,  making  any  computation   of   the   exact

contribution  of  E-commerce activities on the  existing  value-chain  a  complicated undertaking. Singapore is however  keeping

abreast  of statistical developments relating to the measurement

of E-commerce, where there is still no international consensus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February this year, DOS launched a new survey1 to obtain

information pertaining to electronic commerce (EC) activities in

Singapore to enhance our understanding of this emerging  sector.

The  full  set  of  results would be published  in  due  course.

Preliminary   findings  confirm  that  the   E-commerce   growth

potential  in  Singapore is good, even if the  actual  level  of

activity  is  still  small at the moment. For  example,  revenue

derived from EC supporting services amounted to S$144 million in

1997.  This soared 85% to S$267 million in 1998 and is  expected

to  increase by another 34% to S$359 million in 1999. The  focus

remains  primarily  on business-to-business  (B2B)  rather  than

business-to-consumer  (B2C).  Similar  projections  by  agencies

like  the International Data Corporation (IDC) also paint a very

optimistic  scenario. IDC projected that E-commerce  revenue  in

Singapore would grow by about 110% per year over 1998~2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have comprehensive data on the percentage of

small  and  medium-sized enterprises which have embarked  on  E-commerce. However, a recent NCB sample survey on the state of E-

commerce  readiness  (based  on  a  sample  of  more  than  1000

companies in 8 industry sectors) showed a high level of Internet-readiness  among  companies  in the selected  industry  sectors,

notably  in the manufacturers of electronic products. About  73%

of  the companies surveyed already had corporate Internet access

and over a third owned corporate websites.  About 9% already use

the Internet to conduct business-to-business e-commerce.  Of the

companies  already  procuring through  the  Internet,  57%  were

already  procuring  through  Web-based  trading  platforms   and

another  32% used e-mail.  The survey, however highlighted  that

many  small  and  medium-sized companies were  still  relatively

behind  larger  companies  in the  area  of  E-commerce.  It  is

important for these SMEs to do more to move into E-commerce,  by

taking  advantage  of  various Government schemes  currently  in

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corroborating our state of overall EC readiness, the World

Competitiveness   1999   ranking  of  whether   the   E-commerce

environment    is    sufficiently   developed    for    business

opportunities,  ranked Singapore as the 3rd, after  Iceland  and

Finland. (In comparison, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea  were

ranked 13th, 16th and 40th respectively.)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will continue to promote global companies to base

their E-commerce hubs in Singapore to further grow the industry.

EDB  targets  to  anchor at least 25 of the  leading  logistics,

manufacturing and services companies to set up their  e-commerce

operations  in Singapore by 2003, in order to tap the tremendous

growth worldwide2.
