<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Law if he is

considering amendments to the Constitution and current  laws  in

view  of  the  recent decision of the Court  of  Appeal  on  the

constitutionality of section 27 of the Prevention of  Corruption

Act.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee)</b>

<b>(for the Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

Court  of  Appeal's  decision made on 24th  February  1998  that

Parliament has the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



power to enact extra-territorial laws and that section 27 of the

Prevention  of  Corruption  Act  does  not  violate  the   equal

protection clause in the Constitution, it would appear  that  it

is not necessary to consider any amendments to the Constitution.

A  final  decision will be taken after we have carefully studied

the written judgment when it is given.

<div align="center"><b>PREVENTION OF HAZE POLLUTION</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for the

Environment, following the recent meeting of ASEAN Ministers for

the   Environment,  what  are  the  prospects  of   successfully

preventing  the haze pollution from returning to Singapore  this

year  and  if the Government has been asked or will consider  to

render  technical,  financial  or other  assistance  beyond  the

assistance that is presently offered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir,

unless  heavy rains fall over East Kalimantan over the next  few

months,  the  chances  of  preventing the  haze  from  affecting

Singapore are slim.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few weeks, satellite pictures have shown a

dramatic increase in the number of fires in Kalimantan.  A dense

cloud of smoke, haze many times the size of Singapore, has built

up over Kalimantan. The situation is of grave concern to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is currently cooperating with and assisting

Indonesia within the framework of the Regional Haze Action Plan.

While  Indonesia has so far not approached us for any assistance

beyond  what  we  are  providing  today,  I  have  informed   my

Indonesian counterpart that Singapore will be prepared to assist

where we have the necessary technical expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Haze held in

Kuching  on  25th February, the Indonesian Environment  Minister

stated  that  only the onset of rains could put  the  Kalimantan

fires  out, and current fire-fighting efforts by Indonesia would

only  mitigate  the situation.  In view of this assessment,  the

ASEAN Environment Ministers attending the Meeting proposed  that

Malaysia and Indonesia immediately



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



activate  their  bilateral MOU on joint disaster management  and

relief  efforts, and that personnel of the two countries proceed

to  identify the additional resources that are needed  to  fight

the  fires.   Singapore and the other ASEAN countries  can  then

help to provide some of the needed resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers also called for immediate international help

to  meet  the  looming  crisis.  Singapore will  work  alongside

international   organisations  such  as   the   United   Nations

Environment   Programme   (UNEP)   to   mobilise   international

assistance.   We  have met up with UNEP in Kuching  and  are  in

touch  with  them.  Singapore will also actively participate  in

any international effort to help put out the fires.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister says

that  the  chances of preventing the haze coming from Kalimantan

to  Singapore  are slim.  I want to know why.  Is  there  not  a

government there?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Yes, there is a government there, as I

am sure Mr Chiam knows.  However, the fires have now spread to a

huge  area,  and the situation has been made worse by  the  long

drought  that Kalimantan has been facing because of the El  Nino

effect.    I  think  Mr  Chiam would realise,  if  he  has  been

watching TV on fighting big bush fires, that once the fires  are

raging, it is very difficult to put them out.  In fact, the fire

that we had recently in Singapore involving a pile of waste wood

took  us about 3-4 days to put out.  With over 50 people working

and  with a lot of equipment being put on the job, it still took

us  quite a few days to put out what is relatively a small fire,

in  the  context of the big fires that are raging in Kalimantan.

That  is  why  we  have  to mobilise international  support  and

assistance,  because  in  the current  economic  situation  that

Indonesia is in, I think it would be difficult to expect them to

deploy  a  lot  of  resources.  So we must  supplement  whatever

resources they have through international efforts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I agree that this is an

international  problem.  But is there not a law,  in  the  first

place,  to stop people from starting the fires there?   I  think

this message should be put across to the Indonesians.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Yes, Mr Chiam, the Indonesians have

relevant  laws against illegal burning, and we have been  urging

them  to  ensure that those laws are being enforced as  best  as

possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, it would appear that the laws are

not properly enforced at all.  Now we hear of raging fires.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Perhaps Mr Chiam may like to go to

Jakarta and put his message across.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> We have Roving Ambassadors. Is the

Minister  suggesting that I should also be a  Roving  Ambassador

for this job?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Is he looking for a job?

<br><br><!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, may I

ask  the Minister whether his answer to Mr  Chiam is the correct

answer?    It  is  no  good saying that Mr Chiam  should  go  to

Jakarta  to  find out for himself.  Has the Minister  asked  for

reports from the Indonesian government on what they are doing to

enforce these laws?  Has he had a report from them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I can assure Mr Jeyaretnam that we

are  in regular contact with our Indonesian counterparts as well

as   with  our  Malaysian  counterparts  who  are  also  equally

concerned as we are.  The Indonesian Minister has told us, as  I

have  reported in my main answer, that in view of the fact  that

the  fires have now spread over such a big area, they  can  only

hope to solve the problem with the help of nature, ie, hope  for

the rains to come and for the drought to end.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister then saying that there is

really  nothing  anyone is going to do except to  pray  for  the

rains?

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, if he had been listening carefully,

he would have heard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



that I said that the ASEAN Ministers, realising that there is  a

big  crisis looming, have already asked for international  help,

very  early  in  the  game, and that UNEP  has  responded  quite

positively,  and  we  look forward to the international  efforts

coming  with  the  active help of UNEP.  With the  international

help,  I  think we have a better chance of solving the  problem,

rather than leaving it just to Indonesia and Malaysia.

<div align="center"><b>SCHOLARS AND SCHOLARSHIP BONDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister BG Lee Hsien Loong)</b></div>

<br>12.38 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am  making a statement on the subject of  scholars  and

scholarship bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentally, a Government scholarship recipient takes up

a commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans through service

in the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government and statutory board scholarships represent a use

of  public funds to train promising young men and women, to take

up  leadership or specialist roles in the public  sector.   They

are  not bursaries, given to needy students who otherwise  could

not  get a university education.  They are not general education

subsidies,  which anybody who qualifies to go to  university  is

entitled  to.   Nor are they academic prizes, merit  awards  for

good performance without any strings attached.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of an overseas scholarship is high about $250,000

per  scholar.  There must be an accountability to the public for

such  a large investment in a single individual.  A scholar  who

fails  to return to serve his bond has used public funds  merely

to serve his personal ends.  He has thwarted the State's purpose

in  investing  in  his  abilities.  More reprehensible,  he  has

deprived  another student of the opportunity of studying  at  an

outstanding university, who would have made more contribution to

his sponsor and to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Legal Obligation to Serve</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to compel scholarship recipients to serve,

if  they have made up their minds not to do so.  The fundamental

principle  of  law is that the courts will not  compel  specific

performance of personal service contracts.  This is for a  basic

reason: if a person does not want to fulfil an obligation he has

entered  into,  it is beyond the powers of any court  or  anyone

else  to  force  him to do so.  This is unlike, for  example,  a

contract to buy or sell a property.  Once a person enters into a

sale  or  purchase agreement, he has to go through and  complete

the  deal.  Otherwise, the other party can go to court to compel

him to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the remedy for non-performance is payment of

damages.  In the case of scholarships, this takes the form of  a

scholarship bond.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties to a scholarship award need to be committed to

the  arrangement  which they have embarked upon  together.   The

Government,  and  statutory boards offering  scholarships,  will

make  every  effort to offer scholars and other public  officers

rewarding careers.  They implement good human resource  policies

and  practices, offer challenging assignments, provide  training

and   development   opportunities,   maintain   conducive   work

environments,  and  give  timely  recognition  for  effort   and

enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the scholar also has to live up to his end of the deal.

He  has  to  make an honest, conscientious effort to fulfil  his

obligation,  and to serve the organisation which has  given  him

the  opportunity,  invested  in  him,  and  expects  in  time  a

contribution from him.



<br><br><i>Moral Responsibility to Serve</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from the legal obligation, scholarships also

carry  a  moral responsibility.  A scholarship is not  simply  a

study  loan,  with an option to serve in lieu  of  repaying  the

loan.   Nor  is  it a commercial contract which may  be  settled

purely by paying liquidated damages.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No applicant at a scholarship interview explains that he

will  treat  his  scholarship purely as a legal obligation,  and

that  he  will  be  off as soon as another opportunity  presents

itself.   Every one explains how anxious he is to contribute  to

the organisation, and why he and not another candidate should be

given the chance to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when a scholar breaks a bond, it is not just a matter of

contracts and liquidated damages.  It involves deeper issues  of

right and wrong, moral integrity, a sense of shame at breaking a

solemn personal undertaking.  It is not just a legal, but also a

moral obligation.  There is a qualitative difference between the

two.   Without  the moral sense of duty to family,  friends  and

society,  no  society can thrive.  No army can  win  battles  if

every  soldier only does his minimum duty.  It is  the  altruism

and  heroism  of  outstanding leaders  and  soldiers,  from  the

commander-in-chief down

to  the  private soldier, which differentiates the victors  from

the vanquished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students also seek scholarships because of the prestige

they  carry.   Some apply for PSC scholarships not because  they

want  one  or  need one, but just to measure themselves  against

PSC's standard.  I believe some parents tell their children that

they will pay for their overseas education, but only if they are

good enough to be offered a PSC scholarship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools, principals, teachers, relatives, the media, all

hold up scholars as success stories to be proud of and emulated.

Even  if it is just one of your 40 pupils who got a scholarship,

the   teacher  will,  as  they  say  in  Chinese,   zhan  guang,

[               ]  share  in his glory.  This public recognition

carries with it an obligation to serve.  When the obligation  is

refused, shame is brought not only to the scholar, but  also  to

his  family,  his  principals, teachers and  everyone  else  who

shared in his success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I showed a draft of this speech to the Ministers. RAdm Teo

Chee Hean e-mailed me back his views, which I will quote:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Even in a purely commercial contract, there is an element

of obligation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose I sign a contract to supply bricks to a housing

contractor.  Come the appointed day of delivery, I turn  up  and

say  that I am unable to supply the bricks, and he can have  his

liquidated damages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contractor is not interested in my LD - he wants the

bricks; his building schedule depends on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an expectation even in purely commercial deals

that contracts will be fulfilled.  The contractor will never buy

another  load of bricks from me - and may even tell his  friends

not  to  do business with me (so that they will not be similarly

left in the lurch).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government debars contractors and publishes their names

when they default for no good reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose the contractor found out that I was actually able

to  deliver the bricks, but had decided to sell them to  someone

else  that  day because he had offered me a few cents  more  per

brick.  He would blow his top.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think anyone will say that what I did is OK since

my bricks are still being used to build houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone treated commercial contracts that way, that

person will soon be out of business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a scholarship involves even more of an obligation

than offering to sell bricks."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a moral obligation. But this does not mean

that  every scholar must always serve till the very last day  of

his  bond,  come hell or high water.  Between the award  of  the

scholarship  and the end of the bond period may be 10  years  or

more.   Many unforeseeable events may intervene, which may  make

it  awkward for the scholar to continue to serve, either for the

scholar  himself or even for his employer.  In which  case,  the

break clause provides a way out for both parties.  Mr Leong Horn

Kee  was candid in telling this House that he too once paid  off

his  scholarship bond.  I know that other MPs have also done so.

But  there cannot be a blanket condemnation of all scholars  who

break  their bonds.  But in each case the circumstances have  to

be examined, and a judgment made.



<br><br><i>Flexibility in deploying scholars</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs and members of the public reported in the media have

asked  the  Government to administer its scholarships  flexibly,

and  allow  scholars to fulfill their obligations  in  different

ways.  The Government is keen to develop the scholar talent pool

to the full, in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



maximise their contributions to Singapore.  It has gone  out  of

its  way  to  help  scholars to pursue careers which  fit  their

inclinations  and aptitudes.  It has often allowed  scholars  to

proceed  on  Masters and even PhD courses, as well as industrial

and research attachments.  However, the overriding criterion  is

always:  how will Singapore benefit from this further investment

of time and/or money in the individual?  That the further degree

benefits the individual or his faculty is not sufficient reason.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB has been particularly flexible with its scholars

because  it  has a wide range of scholarship schemes,  which  it

awards together with private sector organisations.  For example,

it   allowed  one  scholar  doing  an  undergraduate  degree  in

electrical/electronic  engineering  to  proceed  to  a  master's

degree.   It  also  arranged for him to  work  with  an  MNC  in

Singapore  to  gain  industrial  experience,  at  the  scholar's

request.   In  another case, it allowed a scholar to  defer  his

bond  for  three years.  He was accompanying his  wife  who  was

going to the US for a posting.  The scholar arranged to take  up

a  Research Fellowship in the US, so that on his return he would

be  able to contribute in the area of research.  I suppose  that

if  he  had asked for leave of absence for three years to  be  a

husband, we would have considered the matter too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, 72 EDB scholars have been placed outside of EDB.

Some  teach  in  tertiary institutions, others work  in  private

industry.    Still   others  serve  in  statutory   boards   and

Ministries.



<br><br><i>Naming bond-breakers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes despite all our efforts, it proves impossible

to  accommodate the scholar's request.  Or the scholar makes  up

his  mind that a career with the Singapore Government is not for

him,  and will not be shaken.  This has happened more frequently

in  recent  years.  Nowadays, scholars receive  many  other  job

offers,  sometimes before graduating.  Quite a few scholars,  or

their families, also have the means to pay back the bond without

difficulty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bond breaking has therefore become a problem, especially

with   the   Singapore  Inc.  scholarships,   awarded   by   the

participating  agencies,  which are  EDB,  NCB,  Civil  Aviation

Authority  of Singapore and Singapore Technologies.  Hence,  EDB

announced in August last year that it would tighten up the terms

of  the  bonds  for  the Singapore Inc. scholarships.   It  also

warned  that  it  would publicise the names of those  who  broke

their bonds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a precedent for this in America. The US

Government  recently in January published  the  names  of  1,402

health care professionals (doctors, chiropractor, surgeons)  who

have  defaulted  on  their  Health Education  Assistance  Loans.

Their  names  are posted on a special web page on the  Internet,

together with the amounts they owe, to shame them.  And  if  you

want,     you    can    look    up    the    web     page     at

www.defaulteddocs.dhhs.gov, and you  can  check  them  by  name,

faculty,  university and discipline.  So you  know  who  is  the

defaulted doctor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All MPs who spoke have acknowledged that it is wrong to

break  scholarship  bonds.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock  described  it  as

"ungentlemanly",  in  an uncharacteristic  understatement.   But

they  questioned whether we should shame such scholars publicly.

EDB  does not automatically publicise the name of every  scholar

who   has   broken   his   bond.   If  there   are   extenuating

circumstances,  EDB  will  take  them  into  account.   But   in

egregious  cases, publishing the name lets the public  know  the

facts.  If indeed the scholar had good reasons for acting as  he

did,  and feels that he has done no wrong in breaking the  bond,

then as Mr David Lim said yesterday, he has no  reason to object

to  having his deed publicised, or even put into his CV.  But if

he  has  not  done  the right thing, then the only  question  is

whether publishing might be too harsh a punishment in his  case.

That is a judgment which the awarding organisations will have to

make, and they will have to make their decisions case by case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When EDB and NCB learnt that the three scholars intended to

break  their bonds, they reminded the scholars and their parents

of the warning EDB had already



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



given,  that  the  Government would have to name  them  if  they

proceeded.   They  asked  them to reconsider.  Regrettably,  the

scholars did not change their minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB and NCB officers deliberated extensively and carefully

before  deciding to proceed to name these three.  It was  not  a

matter  of  the  three "incurring the wrath of  some  Government

officials", as Mr Chng Hee Kok put it.  The two statutory boards

consulted  PSC,  PSD,  and the other agencies  which  award  and

handle  scholarships.  Unfortunately, there were no  extenuating

circumstances.  All three were still studying, and had not  even

started  work. They had no difficulties with their  courses,  or

medical  problems, or family difficulties.  They made no  effort

to try to serve EDB or NCB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So finally, EDB and NCB decided that these three scholars

had to be named.  I vetted and approved the press statement.



<br><br><i>PSC scholars</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been very few cases of students on overseas PSC

scholarships breaking their bonds.  This may partly  be  because

the  men  have  to return to complete their full  time  National

Service, unlike the statutory board scholars, many of whom  have

completed  their NSF before going overseas.  In  the  last  five

years,  only  0.3%  of PSC overseas scholars broke  their  bonds

before  they started work.  However, as and when cases arise  of

scholars breaking bonds, PSD will study them, and decide whether

it  is  necessary to publish their names.  We expect these cases

to continue to be few.



<br><br><i>Hector Yee</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hector Yee's case has been widely publicised in the media.

Questions have been raised whether the Government was too  rigid

in  handling  his case.  Hence, I shall provide a chronology  of

the  discussions between Hector Yee and NCB. If I  can  ask  the

Clerk  to  hand  out  No. 1 (Cols. 985-988) Handout  [Copies  of

Handout distributed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



to  hon.  Members].  The chronology shows that  NCB  made  every

effort  to accommodate Hector Yee's requests, and was  taken  by

surprise when Hector Yee decided to break his bond.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980311/19980311-HA-0680985.htm">hand out No.  1  -  HECTOR  YEE YANG LI - CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS (Cols. 985 - 988)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hector Yee is studying Computer Science at Cornell

University  in  the  US.  He requested to  continue  beyond  his

undergraduate  degree,  to  do  a Master's  degree  in  computer

graphics.  He  wanted to spend five years, longer than  the  4.5

years  which  NCB normally allows.  But after deliberation,  NCB

agreed to five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th January this year, NCB met Hector Yee, and told him

that  it  had  approved extension of his  stay  to  five  years.

Hector Yee said that he was considering a PhD after his Master's

degree.   NCB  Human Resources advised him to get  some  working

experience before pursuing his PhD.  Past NCB scholars had found

it useful to get some working experience first.  Hector Yee said

that he had been offered a fully funded place in Cornell, and if

he  obtained a PhD, he would want to pursue an academic  career.

At  the meeting, he did not request NCB to allow him to continue

to  complete his PhD without a break.  Nor did he enquire  about

postings to research institutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one week later, on 17th January 1998, Hector Yee e-mailed NCB Human Resources to say that he had decided to break

his  bond.   It was only now, after he had made up his  mind  to

quit  that  he told NCB for the first time that he thought  that

his  field  of  study, ie, computer graphics,  was  "not  really

relevant to the focus of NCB".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 26th January 1998, Hector Yee sent an e-mail to NCB Human Resources, explaining his desire to do

research in computer graphics.  I attach the e-mail in the hand-out on the next page.  It reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I believe it would be a great evil to deprive the world of

research whose by- products could significantly change  the  way

we   live.   I  work  to  benefit  all  humanity,  not  any  one

organisation or group of people.. Thus I'm saddened that NCB has

reacted  in  this  way, but I cannot deprive the  world  of  the

potential benefits that can be derived from my research.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was only after Hector Yee had decided to break his

bond  that  he told NCB he wanted to do research, and  that  NCB

could  not accommodate the career that he had in mind.   It  was

not  the case of his trying to persuade NCB to let him do  this,

and NCB refusing to do so, thus forcing him to quit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saddened to read Hector Yee's e-mail. Despite his

unquestioned intelligence and academic brilliance,  he  has  not

understood one simple fact: that Singapore gave him this  chance

to  study in Cornell and that he owed something to the  rest  of

Singapore, to strengthen Singapore's chances for the future.



<br><br><i>Duty to Singapore</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not China. China has millions of talented

young  people.  It can afford to lose tens of thousands of  them

overseas,  and  yet have many more to spare.  It has  to  accept

this  as  the price of modernisation to send people overseas  to

learn about technology, economics, finance, and to come back and

pull  China  up and in the process lose many abroad.   Singapore

needs all the talent we can find.  We do all we can to help each

one  achieve the best he can, within the resources we have.  But

this investment is for the advancement of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of our scholars, going overseas to study is a

heady  experience.   They do brilliantly  academically,  because

they  are  extremely bright and well prepared.  Their professors

see them as star pupils, and strongly encourage them to continue

in  an academic career.  Hector Yee is not the first Singaporean

to have been made such an offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without Singapore and the Singapore system, our scholars

would never have had the opportunities which made them what they

were, took them to the top universities in the world, and opened

the  door  to  fascinating  careers  in  research,  finance,  or

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes maturity for scholars to remember why they were

sent  overseas in the first place, and to feel the pull of their

obligations  and  responsibilities  back  home.   They  need  to

understand that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



despite   having   all   these   boundless   opportunities,   as

Singaporeans,  their  first duty is to  Singapore.   Fortunately

most  scholars do return, and soon adjust back to  life  in  the

real world.  And as they grow older and their views mature, they

come  to realise where their youthful ideas of what is important

and what they hope to achieve in life were naive or mistaken.



<br><br><i>Mr Chng Hee Kok's meeting with Mr Philip Yeo</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One extraneous issue which has been introduced into this

debate is the meeting between Mr Chng Hee Kok and Mr Philip  Yeo

on the question of bond breakers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have heard Mr Chng's account of the meeting. Other

Members too have commented on the matter, although they were not

present at the meeting, notably Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge Members to exercise restraint in criticising civil

servants, especially in this House.  The civil servants are  not

here  to  defend themselves, nor can they answer back.   If  MPs

have  problems with individual civil servants, they should  take

the  matter  up with the Minister in charge.  And  if  they  are

still  not  satisfied, they can raise it with me  or  the  Prime

Minister.   MPs  and  civil  servants  both  play  crucial   but

different roles in our body politic.  Without mutual respect and

appreciation between them, the Government cannot work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng had spoken to me earlier about his meeting with Mr

Philip Yeo.  He had complained about Mr Philip Yeo asking him to

resign.  I therefore called for the file note of the meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a breakfast meeting, which took place on 19th

January  1998.  Besides Mr Chng and Mr Philip Yeo,  four  others

were  present:  Mr  Ho Meng Kit, Managing Director  of  EDB;  Mr

Stephen  Yeo, Chief Executive of NCB; Mrs Shirley  Chen  and  Mr

Timothy  Sebastian, both EDB staff.  The file note was  recorded

by  Mr  Timothy  Sebastian,  vetted by  Mrs  Shirley  Chen,  and

approved   by   Mr  Ho  Meng  Kit.   The  note  was   classified

Confidential,  because EDB had no intention of  publicising  the

meeting  with  Mr Chng.  But since Mr Chng has made  the  matter

public, I am releasing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



it  to  Members.  Can we have Handout 2 (Cols. 989-996), please?

[Copies of Handout distributed to hon. Members.]



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980311/19980311-HA-0680989.htm">Handout 2 (Cols. 989 - 996)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also releasing the letter which EDB wrote to Mr Chng

after  the breakfast meeting, inviting Mr Chng to say  who  were

the  MPs who had views different from Mr Yeo's, so that  Mr  Yeo

could  arrange a meeting with them to discuss the issue further.

It  is  the  first  page  of the handout.   Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock

described  this as EDB trying "to summon MPs for  a  meeting  to

answer  to him why they disagree".  He will see that  it  is  in

fact  a  very  courteous  letter, which  unfortunately  did  not

receive a reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo did indeed tell Mr Chng that MPs who held such views

should resign.  It was wrong of Mr Yeo to say this.  And I  have

told  him  so.   I have reminded him that it is  for  the  party

leadership  and the Whip, not Chairman EDB, to  take  an  MP  to

task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this exchange between Mr Chng and Mr Yeo did not take

place  out  of the blue.  It is relevant to read the  discussion

between  Mr  Chng and Mr Yeo which preceded this.  And  I  refer

Members to the file note.  Let us look at paragraphs 4 and 5:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Taking up the point of honour and integrity, Mr Chng said

that he did not agree that scholars who broke their bonds lacked

these  qualities.  He said that so long as they  paid  what  was

owed  to the organisation, they had fulfilled their obligations.

Chmn  disagreed.  He said that as an MP, Mr Chng  should  uphold

values  such  as honour, integrity and commitment.   By  putting

forth  his  views publicly on this issue, scholars  would  think

that  it  was all right to break their bonds.  He was  therefore

doing a disservice to young Singaporeans who would take this  to

mean  that scholarships were mere legal contracts that could  be

entered into lightly and broken easily.  Chmn said that  it  was

incumbent on MPs and public leaders to set the right example and

to  send  the  right messages.  Mr Chng retorted that  this  was

Chmn's view, and that it was not necessarily a correct one.   He

reiterated that he did not see anything wrong with scholars  who

broke their bonds without serving a single day, so long as  they

paid  up  their  liquidated damages.  He added that  there  were

instances where MPs do not agree with the government's  position

on various issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chmn cited the example of his son, Eugene, who had asked

about  taking  up a scholarship prior to entering university  in

USA.  Chmn advised him to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



so  only if he was genuinely committed to returning to serve his

bond.   If not, he was not only taking away an opportunity  from

another  good  student,  but he was also  being  unfair  to  his

sponsor.   Upon consideration, Eugene decided not to take  up  a

scholarship.   Chmn asked Mr Chng whether he  would  advise  his

daughter who was studying in Yale any differently.  Mr Chng said

that  if  his  daughter wanted to break bond, he  would  not  be

against it.'

And  at  this point, according to the note, "Chmn said that  MPs

who held such views should resign as they were sending the wrong

signal to young Singaporeans", and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the issue was not whether or not we should

publish  the  names of the bond breakers, which is a  matter  on

which  we  may reasonably disagree.  The issue was a fundamental

one:  whether  or  not there is anything wrong with  breaking  a

scholarship bond, especially without making the slightest effort

to  fulfil it.  It is clear from the file note that Mr Chng  had

argued that it was quite all right to break a scholarship  bond,

because  it was just a matter of a legal contract and liquidated

damages, and this is what provoked the dispute with Mr Yeo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No MP has argued in Parliament that there is nothing wrong

with  breaking  a  bond.  On Monday, Mr Chng  Hee  Kok,  to  his

credit,  no  longer  maintained that there  was  nothing  wrong.

Instead, he argued, and I quote from his speech:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Certainly, scholars do have an obligation other than legal

to serve their bonds.  We cannot encourage scholars to terminate

their  bonds.  Moreover, a scholarship in Singapore brings  much

honour  and  prestige  to the scholar  and  the  family.   Hence

terminating a bond must bring with it some dishonour.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng has told me that he had thought the matter over and

modified  his  stand.  Had Mr Chng taken this  more  responsible

line  in his meeting with Mr Philip Yeo on 19th January 1998,  I

doubt  if he would have provoked the reaction that he did.   The

view that he actually expressed in his meeting with Mr Yeo,  and

recorded in the file note, is wrong, and dangerous if it becomes

widely held.  MPs are opinion leaders.  The views they propagate

in public speeches set the tone for society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a bond does not enslave a scholar. It

develops  his potential to the maximum.  By his early  30s,  his

bond is over and he can decide on a change of careers.  However,

the  training, the discipline and the moral values that  he  has

imbibed in the years working out his bond will remain with  him:

that  sense  of  the  larger mission  in  life,  and  the  basic

instincts  and values to do the right thing by his  country  and

his  community.   These will enable him to do well  in  whatever

field he chooses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scholars had no problem with bonds for over three decades,

from the 1950s to the middle 1980s.  This flow of trained talent

into  the  public  sector carried Singapore up  to  its  present

levels,  the  least bureaucratic government in the  region,  the

leading  container  port,  airport, airline,  telecommunications

centre,  and so on.  These scholars include Lee Yock  Suan,  Lim

Boon  Heng,  George Yeo, Lim Hng Kiang, Teo Chee  Hean,  Kishore

Mahbubani,  Lim Siong Guan, Philip Yeo, and many others.   Among

the  younger generations of scholars we can count several MPs  - David Lim, Lim Swee Say, and S. Iswaran, I believe, the youngest

Member of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1980s, with increasing affluence, the sense of

urgency for Singapore's future has dissipated.  More parents and

students  are  now  driven by self-interest rather  than  public

duty.   Unless we check this tendency, Singapore cannot maintain

its  present  standards of excellence.  We need  that  sense  of

dedication among our brightest and best, that commitment  beyond

themselves  and  their  families, to the  larger  community  and

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our scholars owe their academic success to the system that

affords everybody an equal chance to achieve this maximum.  They

owe a duty to preserve and sustain the system.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just

have  your  indulgence  to speak on the  Ministerial  Statement.

Instead of couching all the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



points I made in the form of questions, I just want to say a few

words about what transpired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was invited to this breakfast meeting, I

thought  it  was a social breakfast.  No sooner did we  get  the

food  from  the  buffet  table, EDB Chairman  gave  me  a  draft

announcement of three scholars who were terminating their bonds.

He showed me a copy of The Straits Times' report of 13th October

on the table.  Yes, I admitted I said I agreed that I had spoken

against him.  My views remained what was reported.  Without much

preamble,  he  accused me of sharing the values of  those  three

scholars  who were breaking their bonds.  And because  I  shared

their  values,  I  should resign.  I was completely  caught  off

guard by this response of EDB Chairman and two very senior civil

servants.   I  was  definitely very surprised.   Of  course,  my

immediate reaction was to question his standing in asking me  to

resign.  Elected representative - resign!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I told EDB Chairman that he should not take the matter

personally.  His is a Government's position.  I have  spoken  up

against Government policies several times before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can imagine the atmosphere after this came about. I

sat  down  for  breakfast,  and I  was  asked  to  resign.   And

certainly the discussion got a bit awry.  The sequence  is  very

important.  The file note says in paragraph 6 that he then asked

me to resign.  But the starting point was he asked me to resign.

And  later on, in the middle, when I confirmed that a number  of

my  colleagues  shared  similar  views  about  naming  scholars,

because  I had a lunch discussion in Parliament and a number  of

people  do  express that there is no need to name scholars,  EDB

Chairman said that they should do likewise.  This was not in the

file note.  A number of points I made   two days ago in reply to

Dr  Tan  -  I stick by what I said - were not in the file  note.

But these are not important points.  The most important point is

that he did ask me to resign.  The question is: Which stage  did

he ask me to resign?  Will I, as a guest of very important civil

servants go out of my way to the meeting and start to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



provoke  them?  Would I do that?  These are very powerful  civil

servants.  I went to the meeting with a very open mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some provocation, which is why the EDB Chairman

said that he reacted accordingly.  That provocation was about my

daughter.  At that stage, the discussion went awry.  It  was  no

good  anymore.  He posed a hypothetical question and  he  got  a

hypothetical  answer.  Perhaps this is Mr David Lim's  half-told

story, I think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to prolong this whole episode. I

think  the point to be made is that the meeting went  awry.   In

the  first  place,  I  still  do not  understand  what  was  the

objective of that meeting.   EDB Chairman made a public  speech.

A PAP MP has spoken out that there was no need to do what he was

going  to  do.  I was invited to breakfast.  Three  very  senior

officials  in the civil service spent a lot of time  and  effort

and,  up  to  today, I still do not know the  objective  of  the

meeting.   It was not started in the way it was put in paragraph

1,  ie, it was explained to me  the overall  picture and why  we

are not supposed to do what I did, and when the press should ask

me, please support.  Nothing was mentioned about the press.   In

fact,  I  told DPM before I came to this Chamber that  had  that

been  the  approach, I would have supported the  Government.   I

want to make it very clear to the DPM, the Prime Minister and to

this Chamber that, as a Government MP, I have never  never acted

against  Government's  policy.   Since  the  Government  is  now

stating  that breaking a bond is wrong, it is not in  line  with

Government's policy, I wish to state for the record that I shall

not  have my children act against this policy.  If they  have  a

scholarship,  they will fulfill it.  If not, they  will  not  go

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, this does not mean that PAP MPs should not

speak  on issues against naming of scholars.  There is long-term

repercussion.   It  can be a very traumatic experience.   Unless

the  Government  thinks through very carefully, this  policy  of

naming scholars may not be the right approach.  That is all I am

saying.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my name

was mentioned.  I would like to ask a question but I do not know

whether  to direct it to the Minister or Chng Hee Kok.  Maybe  I

should  address  it  to Chng Hee Kok.  If  it  was  a  breakfast

meeting, I would expect all the participants at this meeting  to

be given minutes of this meeting.  So I want to ask Chng Hee Kok

whether  he  received the minutes of this meeting.  Because  the

persons  who were present at the meeting must verify the minutes

and  make corrections, if necessary.  So I just want to ask Chng

Hee Kok whether he received the minutes of this meeting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, quite obviously, no, and

I  was  caught  by surprise that the sequence of events  in  the

minutes  sounds most reasonable.  Sir, as I said, I cannot  find

anywhere  in  the minutes which mentioned about a number  of  my

parliamentary colleagues who share similar views and yet at  the

same time, there was a follow-up letter to me on 2nd February on

that very same topic.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me put the

position  quite clearly.  This is not minutes of meeting.   This

is  a  file note.  There was an informal discussion and the  EDB

officers  jotted down points.  There was, to put  it  mildly,  a

strong divergence of views.  The meeting broke up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Chng raised the matter with me, I asked EDB whether

they  had the record.  They prepared this and gave me this  from

the points which they jotted down.  As you can see, Ho Meng Kit,

Shirley  Chen, Timothy Sebastian, three EDB officers,  prepared,

vetted  and approved the file note, not Philip Yeo.  Philip  Yeo

was  away.   Philip Yeo came back and I asked whether  the  file

note was a complete account.  EDB wanted to add more to the file

note.   I  said,  "No, you leave it.  This is what  is  written.

Give  me a supplementary note." Because Mr Chng had told me that

he had asked the other MPs to resign,  I would read the relevant

paragraph from the supplementary note:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Going back to the issue of his daughter, Chairman asked Mr

Chng  whether  he would encourage her to break bond prematurely.

Mr Chng replied loud and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



clear,  "Yes."  Chairman was really shocked.  Chairman told  him

that  he showed a bad moral example for an elected MP.  Mr  Chng

argued  that  the bond was a mere contract and it had  no  moral

value.  Chairman then suggested that he should resign as an  MP.

Mr  Chng defiantly said that there were many other MPs who share

his  value system.  Chairman then similarly said that  they  all

should resign.  However, Chairman said that he would be glad  to

meet  them  to  know  who they are, to explain  and  hear  their

views.'

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not meant to be a blow-by-blow

court  room  reconstruction or forensic examination.   A  strong

divergence of views has led to a personal clash.  Mr Philip  Yeo

did  wrong  in telling MPs to resign.  I think Mr Chng  did  not

take  the correct attitude either in the argument which he  made

that  it is perfectly all right to break bonds as it is  just  a

legal  obligation.  There is nothing we can do about  the  past.

The  matter has come up, so  I have produced the facts  which  I

have.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I am glad the

Deputy Prime Minister has made this Ministerial Statement.    It

gives  us  a chance to hear the Government's position  and  also

gives  the  Backbenchers a chance to pose a couple of questions.

I  do  agree  with the Deputy Prime Minister that we  definitely

very  much frown upon those scholarship holders who break  their

bonds, particularly those who do not even serve a single day  of

their  bond.  But  my point really is to ask whether  naming  of

the  bond-breakers would serve the purpose.   Because  when  you

send  a student overseas, there is a risk that in three to  five

years  of  overseas stay, he might be affected by  the  overseas

environment  and there may be other reasons for him not  wanting

to  serve  his bond.  So I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  there  are  other ways of doing it that  can  help  the

process.   For  example, the pre-award procedures  can  help  to

educate  them.   Maybe  there should be  proper  counselling  or

national  education.  Maybe the selection process of scholarship

applicants  can be a bit more rigid to make sure  that  you  can

sieve  out  those  who are very mercenary in their  approach  of

going  for  scholarships.  Perhaps that may  be  considered.   I

thought it was also not quite in line with the new approach that

we  are  going to have about the Government's lighter  touch  in

naming the bond-breakers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the DPM for

clarifying that the note was taken after he intervened  in  this

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just for the record, as I mentioned earlier, the

discussion was awry and the question of my daughter was put in a

hypothetical  manner.  My daughter did not go  on  a  Government

scholarship.  He challenged me, "Would you ask your daughter  to

resign?"  At that stage, the meeting was bad.  Certainly, anyone

in  my  shoes, with three very senior civil servants challenging

me,  would say things that one may not respond otherwise.  But I

take  the DPM's point that I may not have given the best answers

at  that  meeting.  I admit it.  But I just  want  to  give  the

context of the atmosphere I was in, and why the reply was given.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I  say I found all this very interesting.   But  what

emerges from all this exchange, and it seems to me, is that  the

Chairman  of the EDB was telling Mr Chng Hee Kok and  making  it

clear  that it was Government policy to hold these bond  holders

and  that  if he felt very strongly about this, then perhaps  he

should  resign.  I do not see what is wrong with that.  Will  Mr

Chng Hee Kok now consider resigning from the Party?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just to respond to Mr

Leong Horn Kee on what we do to discourage bond-breakers.  He is

right  that  if  you  just  toss  a  young  man  into  an  alien

environment  and  leave him there for three, four  years,  after

quite  a short while, his views will be influenced and you  will

find  you  have a different person on your hands.  Many  parents

have  found that when they send their children overseas.  So  we

take a lot of trouble to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



make  sure that, firstly, we choose the right people.  Secondly,

we explain to them the nature of their obligation which they are

entering  into.  Thirdly, to keep in touch with them while  they

are overseas.  And finally, if they have particular problems  or

needs,  to address these, and do our utmost to accommodate  them

so that there is a fit for them and a fit for the organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not just take scholarship applicants off the streets.

PSC  organises  a scholarship seminar every year in  January  or

February  for  JC 2 students and their parents, because  parents

are  a  critical part of this.  And at the seminar, PSC scholars

who  have  started work, we will brief them about their  careers

and  the different PSC scholarships.  In other words, the  older

generation  of  scholars will come and explain  to  the  younger

generation what they can expect.  And the larger Ministries  are

also  invited to set up information booths at the  seminar.   So

you get a sense before you apply, what it is about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally before a scholar accepts a PSC scholarship, PSC

staff  will meet him or her to answer any queries he or she  has

about  the  public sector career.  And where it is  appropriate,

PSC  will ask some officers from the relevant Ministry  to  meet

the  scholar,  normally  to  provide further  information.   And

students are advised to think very carefully before accepting  a

scholarship offer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, PSC runs a mid-course scholarship programme for

scholars  in their second or third year.  The programme includes

a  two-week attachment with the potential Ministry.  In the case

of  Mr  Hector  Yee,  you will see from the chronology,  he  was

awarded the scholarship in 1995, 2.5 years ago.  In 1996, he  was

attached  for a summer attachment to NCB and it was in  November

1997  when  the idea of continuing on to graduate school  arose.

So  we do make the utmost effort in order to manage the scholars

on a constructive and proper path, but unfortunately it does not

always work.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the lighter touch, we are looking for a softer touch

in our hands, not gone soft in our heads.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the Deputy

Prime  Minister  for clarification on more  general  points.   I

think  this  has  wider implications.  The  first  clarification

relates  to the third line, third paragraph of Hector  Yee's  e-mail.  If I may, Mr Speaker, read out the line:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the departure of ITI and the restructuring of NCB

from  "builder" to "architect", I realized that my goal of doing

research can no longer be properly fulfilled.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to clarify whether this

is  true  that the organisational mission of the NCB has changed

from  the  time of scholarship to the time of the bond  breaking

and,  if  so,  the  more general point is  that  the  Government

agency's  mission has changed.  Does he see this as a legitimate

ground  for  the  scholar  to  change  his  mind?   I  ask  this

particularly  because the Deputy Prime Minister earlier  on  had

said there were legitimate and not legitimate reasons to break a

bond, which is why not all scholars are named.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second general point I wish to ask the Deputy Prime

Minister to clarify is how far this condemnation of morality and

integrity runs.  Naming the bond-breakers is one thing.   May  I

ask  the  Government to clarify if, beyond naming, there  is  in

fact  a black list that people who are viewed in this way should

forget the prospects of joining Government agencies in future or

seek Government jobs?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, on the ITI and

the mission change.  I am not a lawyer, but it is a principle of

law that you never answer hypothetical questions.  In this case,

it  does  not apply because NCB has always had its role  as  the

"architect"  with  ITI as a separate arm under NCB,  responsible

for  "building".  ITI was just one of the places where Mr Hector

Yee could have been deployed.  It had not been discussed but  it

was  possible, or he could have gone to ISS, a separate research

institute which is not in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



NCB,  or  he could have gone to university, for which there  are

also precedents.  So the fact that ITI has been moved out of NCB

and  merged  with  ISS  in  no way constrains  the  universe  of

possibilities which were open to Mr Hector Yee when  he  returns

to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go on a scholarship to learn to become a doctor and

serve  the Ministry of Health, and you find that when  you  come

home,  it has turned into the Ministry of Community Development,

that  is  another matter.  When it comes, we will  have  another

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what we do with scholars who have broken their

bonds,  the  answer is: in general, we will not  re-employ  them

within  the  bond  period,  unless  there  are  exceptional   or

extenuating   circumstances.   Because  the  non-fulfilment   of

obligatory  service  suggests a lack of responsibility,  but  we

will study each case carefully on its own merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for scholars from statutory boards and other

organisations,  including those from  the  private  sector,  the

civil  service will not recruit candidates under a bond  without

the  agreement of the organisation to transfer the bond  to  the

civil  service.  For example, there was one case where Singapore

Technologies  agreed to transfer the bond to the  Administrative

Service.   In  another  case,  DBS Bank  refused  to  allow  the

transfer for one of its scholars.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I think the examples the Deputy Prime

Minister  brought up, DBS Bank and Singapore Technologies,  both

related  to  scholars  who  were presently  under  bond  to  the

Government  agencies.  Perhaps I was not clear the  first  time.

My question relates more to those who actually break their bonds

in  ways  the  Government agencies do not accept or illegitimate

bond  breakers.   Earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister  said  that

there  may  be  good reasons for people to break  bonds.   Would

these  people  find  an  impasse in seeking  re-employment  with

Government or Government agencies?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not go for

fine talmudic distinctions.  Singapore Inc is a broad family of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



many  organisations, and we work very closely  together,  and  I

hope  we  share notes together.  If somebody has broken  a  bond

there  and he is coming here and looking for a job from me here,

I  will  take  some trouble to find out from the other  HR  what

happened and whether it is wise for me to accept such a person.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in this discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Mr Jeyaretnam found it interesting, I find it

reassuring.   I  notice  that  Mr  Jeyaretnam  has   taken   the

opportunity  to cocok  a bit.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam understands

the  meaning of cocok, which is to try and take advantage of the

situation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Zainul, could you make your point, please?

We are running short of time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> I am sorry. As regards asking

my  colleague to resign, I thought it was unnecessary because we

have  seen  precedents where Members disagreed  with  Government

policy  and  the  issue of resignation did not  arise.   On  the

question

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is your question for the Deputy Prime

Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> I want to make a comment, Mr Speaker.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Could you please ask your question? We are

running out of time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> The question I would like to ask

the  Deputy  Prime Minister is on the breaking of  bonds.   Just

now,  I  gather  that  he was saying that  each  case  would  be

considered  on its own merits.  In view of that possibility,  in

future,  when such cases arise in Government, GLCs and statutory

boards,  should they first be referred to the DPM  or  a  higher

authority before the naming of bond breakers is carried out?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not how the

Government works.  There are procedures.  There are people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



who  are  properly  authorised and apprised  of  the  facts  and

competent to make these decisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I just would like to ask the Deputy

Prime  Minister a very broad question.  These bond breakers  are

scholars.   They are the cream of the population, and they  have

undergone  perhaps 12 years of our education  system.  I  wonder

whether   something has gone wrong somewhere  in  our  education

system,  bringing up end products such as students who blatantly

break their bonds.  One would imagine that they would have  some

values, to think the matter over seriously before breaking their

bonds.  Despite many meetings and warnings, they still break the

bonds.  It shows clearly that there is something basically wrong

with  our education system.  The right values are not inculcated

in our students.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam has a valid

point, but he overstates it.  We have to work harder at national

education, moral education, inculcating in our young people, not

just  facts  but  values, so that they know what  is  right  and

wrong.   We  have  tried hard to do this, especially  in  recent

years.   We do not always succeed.  There is always a  range  of

responses,  and  even  in the most ideal system,  not  everybody

responds to enlightened precepts, because they just do not  sink

in.   Also,  it is the mood of the times.  If you are  facing  a

great upheaval and tumult, and your stomach is hungry, as is the

case  in  some  countries in this region now, you  will  not  be

thinking of doing computer graphics or something like that.  You

will  be  thinking of the family back home and how to  fend  for

them, not just family but friends, relatives, your country.   We

are  no  longer  in  that position, but we have  to  keep  these

values,  the sense of service and moral obligation, so  that  we

can hold together as one nation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I was a school teacher for over 10

years.  What I learned was that the best way to teach the  right

values  to  the  students is by example.  I think  the  teachers

themselves have to set



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



the  example  and the tone.  I wonder whether our Ministers  are

setting the right examples and the right tone.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if Mr Chiam thinks

that  he  can  produce  a  better team of  Ministers  either  in

Singapore or anywhere else in the region or in the world, it  is

up to him to  try to do it and convince the population.  Anybody

whom  we  bring  into the leadership team is  somebody  whom  we

believe  can make more than that, many times over, outside.   We

have to bring them in and they have to be willing to serve.  And

if  they were not willing to serve, you could pay them a million

dollars and they would not be here today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Chiam should stick to his original point. He

has been a teacher.  He knows that not all his students pass his

examinations.   But  this is a very serious matter  and  one  on

which,   not   just   the   political   leadership,   but    the

administration, the civil service, the teachers  and  the  young

people  must understand where they stand, and what is right  and

wrong.

<br>1.38 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of Singapore for the

financial year 1st April, 1998 to 31st March, 1999, contained in

Paper Cmd. No. 3 of 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall take the totals for each head of expenditure in the

Main and Development Estimates appearing in the last columns  of

the Main Estimates and Development 879Outlays for FY 98 on pages

35 and 36 respectively of the Command Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the "guillotine" times for heads of expenditure,

which  I  have fixed under Standing Order 89(7)(a), I have  also

allotted  the time for the discussion of each amendment  in  the

Estimates.   The  time  allotted for a discussion  includes  the

replies  from  the  Frontbench.  I shall  announce  these  times

whenever necessary as we go along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the sitting time of the Committee of Supply has

been  extended  to 6.45 pm each day and we have added  an  extra

day,  we will still be hard pressed for time.  The time we  have

available falls short of the times Members have indicated  would

be  required  for discussion of their amendments.  Members  will

therefore not necessarily be given the amount of time they  have

requested.      Other  Members who would like  to  join  in  the

debate  on a particular amendment will be allowed to do so  only

if there is sufficient time left on the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received a total of 465 notices of amendments.

This is the highest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



number  we  have  ever  received for the  Committee  of  Supply.

Together  with  the replies from the Frontbench, this  means  my

Deputy  and I will be listening to a great many speeches in  the

coming  days.   Because of the shortage of time,  there  may  be

occasions  where  I  will  have to exercise  the  guillotine  on

Members.   However, I hope the inflicting of such  pain  on  you

will  be  minimal, better still not necessary at all if speeches

are  kept  short  and  sweet.  As in previous  years,  with  the

cooperation  of  Members, I will endeavour to  keep  the  debate

going at a brisk pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure in respect

of which amendments stand on the Order Paper Supplement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head V



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head V Prime Minister's Office. I am

afraid  the  discussion on the Ministerial Statement  has  eaten

into  the time I have allotted for this Head.  So I urge Members

to  come to their point when making their speeches.  Dr Lee Tsao

Yuan, please move your amendment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister, during his National Day Rally

Speech last year, discussed the reasons for a greater inflow  of

foreign  talent. It is to continue to develop Singapore  into  a

dynamic, vibrant city state, an important node in the network of

global  cities  such  as  New York  and  London.   However,  the

announcement  of  the foreign talent policy  has  set  off  some

disquiet  in  Singapore.  Concerns expressed range from  whether

foreigners will take away our jobs, or our children's  jobs,  to

whether this will result in landed property and cars being  even

more out of reach of the ordinary Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the importance of attracting foreign talent

into   Singapore  and  they  will  augment  our  limited   human

resources.  This policy has benefited us in the past,  and  will

benefit us in the future.  Some of the foreign talent will leave

after a short stay while others will sink their roots here



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



and  obtain either permanent residence or Singapore citizenship.

When  they  adopt citizenship, they are every bit a Singaporean,

as those of us who are born and who grew up here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that part of this disquiet stems from uncertainty

as  to  what  it  means to be a Singaporean as distinct  from  a

foreigner  in Singapore.  What are the rights and privileges  of

Singapore citizenship?  Is it merely the right to vote?   Is  it

eligibility  for subsidized HDB housing?  But what  about  those

whose  income  levels are above the ceiling and do not  qualify?

Does  it  include  the promise of Government funding  for  basic

education  and retraining so that local talent can be  developed

and  fulfilled, utilized to its maximum potential?  What are the

obligations  and  responsibilities  of  citizenship?    National

service for men?  Is it more than that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to define the parameters in

order  to  give the discussion a better focus.  While  welcoming

foreign  talent and making it easier for them to work  and  live

here, the  Government should also spell out at the same time the

privileges   and  responsibilities  of  Singapore   citizenship.

Foreign  talent and citizenship are two sides of the same  coin.

Both   have   important  contributions  to  make  to  Singapore,

economically, socially and culturally. Both define  the  essence

of  Singapore, its cosmopolitanism, its ancientness, that  which

makes our country and culture uniquely Singapore.  The Singapore 21

Committee, of which I am a member, will consider this issue.

But  it  would be good if the Government could, at  some  point,

elaborate on what it means to be a Singaporean.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> The importance of overseeing the

national   talent  pool  by  ensuring  continuous   inflow   and

integration of desirable foreign talent and retention  of  local

talent  cannot  be  overstated.   For  a  country  with  limited

resources, it is even more urgent, as in Singapore.  Thus, I  am

most glad to see PMO spending more on its PSD's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



programmes,  in  particular, its talent  management  programmes.

The  holistic approach in terms of attracting and retaining  the

right talent, the SDU in promoting marriage among graduates  and

formation of families, and the Personnel Guidance Unit's work in

conducting  psychometric  and  other  assessment  procedures  to

assist the civil service in selection, placement and development

of  staff, is commendable.  It is very relevant to what we  just

discussed  in  terms of scholars and bonds.  It should  help  to

minimise the problem of attrition and enhance retention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But PSD must be aware of the growing competition for such

talents  from  other  countries.   As  globalisation  grows   in

importance  and Asia's economy gets plugged in a bigger  way  to

the  west,  particularly the US, the latter will be looking  for

more  Asian  talent.  Prime talent from Singapore will  be  much

more  in  demand.   In fact, it comes with a premium.   For  our

scholars keen on R&D, our budding R&D facilities may not be able

to  match.   Bill  Gates and his type will be  hungry  for  such

talents,  as  his giant business grows.  That is our  challenge.

How  does  the  PMO  and PSD intend to meet that  challenge  and

competition for talent?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSD should look into possible strategic and collaborative

alliances  in the competition for that limited talent worldwide.

While  the  more  than  18% increase in  the  talent  management

programme  is impressive, it may not be sufficient to match  the

growing competition.  Expose more of our better brains with  the

best  in the world to allow better flexibility in retaining  the

much  needed  brains trust for the civil service  and  even  the

private sector through the statutory boards and the GLCs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I want to speak on bond breakers. When I

filed  this  amendment, Sir, I did not realise that  this  topic

will  be  so  hotly debated in this House and  I  also  did  not

realise that some Members were bond breakers themselves and they

seem  to have some personal interest in it.  We also heard  this

afternoon



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



a lengthy Ministerial Statement on this issue.  The question is:

are the bond breakers wrong in doing so?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purely, from the legal point of view, they have committed

no  wrong.   They just have to pay damages, as has been  pointed

out.   Like  other  Members,  I  think  they  do  have  a  moral

obligation.  They are morally obligated to carry out their bond.

On  the other hand, I would also stress that, in fact, the  bond

givers themselves also have a moral responsibility.  They should

not  impose  harsh and onerous terms on the scholars.   We  have

heard  the  hon. Member for Bishan-Toa Payoh that he  served  10

years  of  the  bond before he broke it.  I  take  it  that  the

Member's  bond  lasted  longer than 10 years.   I  think  it  is

utterly  wrong to be tied down for 10 years.  A 10-year bond  is

definitely  too  long.  Such a contract is  harsh  and  onerous.

Under such circumstances, I can understand why scholars want  to

break their bonds.  It is said that in every action there  is  a

reaction.    If  harsh  and  onerous  terms  were  imposed,  the

reaction  of scholars would be to try to get out of the contract

at  the first opportunity.  The givers of scholarship have  also

to be fair and equitable in their attempts to bind recipients of

the scholarship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time, a scholar had to serve a bond period

equivalent to the number of years he spent overseas to  complete

his  course.  I believe this can be a criterion, but subject  to

not  more  than  four  years' bonding of scholars.   I  think  a

maximum bond period should not exceed four years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is: why do our scholars break their bond?

As  I  have mentioned, they are the cream of the population.   I

would urge the Government to look into our education system  and

also  the  Ministers themselves should look at  what  they  have

done, whether they have set a high standard for our young people

to follow.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will

allow  me,  I  just would like to share a few comments  from  my

perspective as a scholar or one who had the privilege of  taking

a Government scholarship.  I think DPM has given a very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



extensive  account and I believe that the force of his arguments

is   particularly  strong  in  the  context  of  civil   service

scholarships.   We  need  to invoke  the  spirit  and  value  of

noblesse oblige  that privilege entails responsibility, and with

Government scholarships, I firmly believe this is true for three

reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they are funded by tax dollars contributed by DREs

through  to  CEOs.  Second, because it is a privilege  that  the

people of Singapore are bestowing on a scholar, it is not just a

manpower  recruitment  device.  Third,  it  is  given  with  the

expectation and hope that the scholars will come back and  serve

in the long term for Singapore's interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this cannot be a simple financial calculation. It

would  do  Singapore or Singaporeans no good,  in  my  view,  if

someone  comes back to serve simply because he cannot afford  to

break  his  bond.  Today, it may be a cost-benefit  analysis  of

whether  they come back to serve an organisation.  Tomorrow,  it

may  be an economic analysis of whether it is worthwhile staying

in  Singapore.  But if a scholar has truly imbibed the value  of

noblesse  oblige, of wanting to serve, I think we would  have  a

real  national  asset in that individual, for  that  person  who

serves  Singapore and Singaporeans.  In that spirit, I have  two

suggestions for the Deputy Prime Minister to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, can more be done to imbue scholars with the values

and  culture  of the civil service?  When I was a  scholar,  the

first  contact I had was a note telling me I had been given  the

scholarship  and  intermittent, during my study  period,  I  got

letters asking for my results and progress.  And that was  about

it.  I understand from the Deputy Prime Minister that things are

more  enlightened now.  Nevertheless, I think more can  be  done

and, in particular, scholars would benefit immensely during  the

period  of  study  if they have regular dialogue  sessions   and

discussions with senior civil servants and Ministers.   I  think

this would give them a chance to appreciate first hand and learn

from  role models what the civil service stands for and why they

have been selected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, whilst we talk about bond breakers and

highlighting their questionable actions, I think it  is  equally

important that we highlight the good role models. The focus  has

been on a minority and a balance must be restored in this debate

and  in  public  perception.  The best way is to demonstrate  by

example.   I  would urge the civil service and the Deputy  Prime

Minister to consider highlighting the many others who have  come

back  and  who  have also had attractive alternatives  at  their

disposal,  but  they  have come back to  serve,  and  they  have

succeeded in their careers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> With your indulgence, Sir, I have

the  privilege of working with some of the senior and top  civil

servants,  including Mr Lim Siong Guan and the Director  of  the

Civil  Service  College,  Ms Lim Soo Hoon.   I  find  them  very

bright,  very enlightened and very open-minded. The  development

of  the higher echelon of the civil service, in fact, is in good

hands.   But my attention is drawn to the question of  how  much

attention is given to the lower echelon of the civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had the privilege also of attending a joint seminar

between  PSD  and  the public sector unions at  Batam  recently.

There  again, the experience was rewarding because it  gave  the

opportunity between the higher echelon of the civil  service  to

interact  and  have  a  better  understanding  with  the   union

representatives.   So I would like to ask PMO  whether  in  fact

more  of  such opportunities could be provided so  as  to  allow

better  interaction  and better understanding  of  each  other's

aspirations and also to allow the members of the civil  service,

especially those of the lower echelons, to feel that they are an

important and an integrative part of the civil service, which we

all  know  is  one  of  the  pillars of  the  success  story  of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would be

much obliged if I can take the three cuts together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> The Government had earlier announced that

the retirement age will be raised from 60 to 62 from 1st January

1999.   Sir,  before  legislation comes into effect,  there  are

important  concerns  and issues in the civil service  employment

and  salary structure that need to be addressed.  The  NTUC  and

the  unions have been discussing some of these concerns  and  we

would  like to raise some of these concerns for the Government's

consideration.  Basically, there are four main concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The principles which should be used on the wage cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The mode in which the wage cut should take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Job out-placement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Alternative health care scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the first point. Given the Tripartite Committee on

the  Extension of Retirement Age guidelines, the  NTUC  and  the

civil  service unions would like to propose that the  Government

adopts  a  wage  cut  for all officers, as  recommended  by  the

Tripartite  Committee.   This  may have  to  include  Superscale

officers.   However,  exceptions could be  given  based  on  the

following three broad principles:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether base-up wage system is already in place. Where

wages reflect the actual job worth, then there may not be a need

for a wage cut; and this may apply to higher scales in the Upper

Timescale and Superscale grades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The supply of and demand for the services of the

officers concerned.  Where demand exceeds supply, implementing a

wage cut would only aggravate the vacancy situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The changes in job responsibilities, before and after the

age of 60.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in considering pay cuts, it must be noted that the up

to  10% wage cut does not include the 3.5% cut in CPF.  In other

words,  it  is  actually up to 13.5% in  wage  cut.   The  civil

service  unions do not strongly object to this principle because

they know that it is costly for an employer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



to  employ  someone beyond the age of 60 when they can  actually

employ a much younger entrant into the workforce at lower  cost.

However,  the  unions  feel that the  cut  in  wages  should  be

effected  through  the  annual wage component  rather  than  the

monthly  salaries.  However, the caveat is that if  one  resigns

before the year is out, then pro-rated annual wage cuts must  be

made from the last drawn monthly salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next, job out-placement. On job placement, the

Tripartite  Committee recommendations should  be  followed.   In

addition,  I would like to urge the civil service to participate

actively in the Skills Redevelopment Programme, an initiative of

the  NTUC.   However,  the   issue of  paying  for  payroll  and

training costs from INTECH funds may have to be adjusted to suit

the financial procedures of the civil service.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already some very good initiatives have been made by the

Ministry   of  the  Environment  which  has  started  reskilling

programmes for DRE workers, through the insistence of NTUC,  and

using  the  SRP funds.  But the fund principles may need  to  be

further refined.  I urge that other Ministries be encouraged  to

participate in the SRP actively for workers up to the age of 62.

This should especially be so because Dr Richard Hu had announced

yesterday  that the SRP may be considered to become  a  national

programme,  and when it becomes a national programme  the  civil

service must take the lead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the last point, the Alternate Healthcare Scheme,

the  unions  suggest  that  new employees  under  the  Alternate

Healthcare  Scheme be given Medisave top-up of an additional  1%

of  salary,  subject to a minimum of $15 and a maximum  of  $70.

The  MSO currently has a maximum of $70 but there is no minimum.

I  would like to urge that a minimum of $15 be set, particularly

to help the DRE workers whose pay is generally very, very low.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I just want to end by saying that I would like to

emphasise that until we are able to resolve these issues, it  is

difficult for the public sector or the civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



service to raise the retirement age before 1st January 1999.  We

need to step up the pace of the union-management discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second cut is on union representation. While

union membership is declining in most parts of the world, it  is

increasing  steadily  in  Singapore.  This  is  because  of  the

pragmatic approach and the right kind of leadership and policies

adopted  by  the  Singapore NTUC.  It is  also  because  of  the

recognition by the PAP Government of the positive role  of  NTUC

and  its  affiliated  unions.  In many  other  countries,  union

leaders  and  Government  leaders  or  the  union  leaders   and

employers  will never sit down together and have a peaceful  cup

of  coffee.  However, in Singapore, union leaders, employers and

Government  leaders  meet very frequently  in  both  formal  and

informal settings and discuss and resolve issues that arise from

time to time in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profile of our workforce has changed rapidly in

Singapore  because  of  rapid improvements  in  education.   For

example, 20% of each cohort attains a university education;  40%

a  polytechnic education; and 25% a post-secondary education  at

ITE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the profile of the workforce who can join

unions  has  altered somewhat over the years.  To address  this,

the  NTUC  introduced the General Branch Membership.   The  NTUC

leadership has also set a rule of thumb that at least 80% of the

workforce  can  join  the union as an ordinary  member  and  the

remaining 20% can join as a General Branch member, depending  on

the  position that they hold in the organisation.  For  example,

very  confidential senior staff in a company may choose  not  to

join  as  a General Branch member because, from the management's

perspective, it might be seen as inappropriate.  And rightly so,

it is their prerogative.  Although this rule of thumb of NTUC

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, I am sorry to intervene.

But would you like a reply from the Deputy Prime Minister?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Yes, I will summarise.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Then could you ask your questions so that

there is time for the reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> I would like to say that although this

is  not  legislated, we are pursuing this matter in the  private

sector.   And  I  would  like to urge the PMO  to  convince  its

officers, particularly those in Division I, who form almost  25%

of  the  total officers in the service, to join the  union.   We

have a parliamentary debate on tripartism here not too long ago.

I  would  like to urge that the civil service take the  lead  in

working hand in glove with the unions by joining us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last cut -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, could I ask you to stop

your speech now, because we are approaching guillotine time.   I

think it is only fair that the other Members who have spoken can

have their replies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Could I speak on my third cut, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If there is time, you can move your cut

later on.  BG Lee.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Members have raised several

points.  First, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asks what does it mean to be  a

Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think what it means to be a Singaporean can be

reduced to dollars and cents, subsidy here, grant there, shares,

asset  top-up, or whatever, therefore so many thousand  dollars.

It  is an identification with Singapore.  You belong here,  this

is  your  country,  you  will fight for it,  you  determine  its

future,  together with other citizens.  That is how we became  a

country,  fighting for independence, first, during the  Japanese

occupation;  then  the  British  colonial  government;  then  in

Malaysia;  now  out.  And that is how you have  to  survive,  by

identifying yourself with the country and feeling that  this  is

where  you  belong and this is where your responsibilities  are.

We  have  a very long discussion on this just now and I  do  not

think we need to go into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



a  lot more details again.  I think that many Singaporeans  know

that whilst foreigners will come and compete with them for cars,

houses  and  jobs,  we  are still better off  having  them  here

working with us, than not having them here, and having Singapore

a  thinner  talent pool, a less vibrant economy.  You  can  have

cheap land, but your incomes are going to be low and you are not

going to be able to afford cars or grand houses either.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is not a matter of dollars and cents. It is a matter

of  intangibles,  of  rooted-ness and  feel.   And  I  hope  the

Singapore  21 Committee, which is looking into this issue,  will

take such an approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on talent management. Mr Zainul Abidin has asked

what  we  do  to  work harder to attract talent into  our  civil

service.  First, we must have competitive terms, challenging job

opportunities,  good  work environment,  and  systematic  talent

development.  So good people will come, they will stay, and they

will  rise.  And we will develop them as they go.  We will  make

sure  that our terms and conditions are competitive, and we make

sure  that  this  applies not just to a  small  elite  group  of

scholars  or  administrative officers but  to  the  whole  civil

service,  whether  you  are  an  administrative  officer  or   a

professional  officer, a clerk, or somebody looking  after  some

other  responsibilities.  We will make sure we  treat  each  one

individually  well,  feedback on performance,  and  give  timely

recognition in terms of promotions, bonuses, national awards, in

accordance with performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin also asks about improving the quality of

civil  service.  Continuous learning and training is indeed  one

of our priorities and not just at the top, but all the way down.

And  we  have made a special effort to make sure that  we  reach

down with programmes which are relevant to Division II, Division

III,  and Division IV officers.  For example, over the last  six

months  it  has  introduced four new programmes  for  the  lower

division   staff,  including  English,  writing   and   personal

effectiveness courses aimed at Division III and IV officers.  We

are now working on a programme to complement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



WITs  and the Staff Suggestions Scheme to bring out the creative

spirit amongst the civil servants, to encourage them to open  up

and  speak  up,  and  contribute.  And we are  also  working  on

another  language programme to help Division IV officers achieve

`N'  and  `O'  level English standards.  Both the  creative  and

language programmes should be ready in the next financial  year.

So we are working on developing more opportunities for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On scholars and bonds raised by Mr Chiam and Mr Iswaran, I

do  not propose to respond in any detail.  Indeed, scholars have

to  be morally obliged to serve and their sponsors have to  make

sure  that the terms are not onerous.  And indeed that has  been

our  policy  -  to make sure that pay is competitive,  that  the

opportunities are competitive, and it is not just money, but you

come in, you have a fulfilling career and standing, and you  are

doing something which you are proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular dialogues, highlighting role models, imbuing people

with  the correct values and cultures, as Mr Iswaran has pointed

out,  we have improved, but we can do still better, and we  will

try to improve further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan's point, first, on extension of the

retirement  age.   Mr Sinnakaruppan has explained  many  of  the

things  being  done  by the Tripartite Committee  studying  this

matter.   It is a very complex subject.  In principle,  we  have

decided to extend to 62.  In practice, when you want to work out

the  implementation details, it becomes very, very  complicated.

How  do you implement a pay cut?  It cannot be across the board,

without  modulation,  because it depends on  the  circumstances,

what  are  the principles by which you will vary it,  and  these

have  to  be worked out, not just academically but in  agreement

with  the  unions, so all parties acknowledge that the basis  is

fair and workable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are studying the proposals and we are currently

discussing with the unions how to implement it.  If we can do it

before  1st January 1999, we will do so.  But I am not confident

that we will be able to do it very easily.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On union membership, I have told this House before that

civil  servants are allowed to take up union membership as  long

as they meet the membership rules of unions, and there is no bar

on Division I officers joining civil service unions, unless they

have been specifically designated as such.  There are staff  who

are handling sensitive and confidential personnel portfolios, or

who have direct influence and authority over personnel decision-making,  or  are  involved  in  labour-management  actions   and

policies  and may hesitate over the propriety of becoming  union

members.  Because you have to act entirely impartially,  and  it

has yet to be tested whether if you are a union member and there

is  a fellow union member, it is going to be workable for one to

discipline  the  other.   It  could  be  an  awkward  situation,

resulting in potential conflict of interests or divided  loyalty

and  representing  the  employers when dealing  with  unions  on

specific  issues.  We are now working out the rules  to  clarify

the   position  of  this  group  of  officers  to  minimise  the

likelihood of conflicting duties and interests.  I can be candid

and  explain to the Member that one of the areas where  this  is

most  tricky to do is the teaching service because traditionally

teachers  and  principals have been union members.   But  as  we

devolve  more and more powers to school clusters and to schools,

and to principals, more and more principals who used just to  be

administering,    now    have    management    and     personnel

responsibilities over the teachers in their schools.   And  this

will  cause  some difficulty.  We are studying the  matter.   We

have not quite decided, but we will do.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, your third amendment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, this base-up wage system has been

recommended  to  address the problems caused by  the  seniority-based wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the civil service already has many features of the

base-up  wage  system in its present day salary structure.   But

there are still some areas that need to be addressed.  NTUC  and

the civil service unions would like to see that the civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



service  adopt  the  full implementation as  soon  as  possible.

Really  the  missing  link  is  in  the  determination  of   the

appropriate  minimum-maximum  ratios.   The  desirable  minimum-maximum  ratios  would, in general, be different  for  different

jobs.   One possibility is to have different ratios for jobs  at

the different Division or job grade as follows: for Division  I,

it  could  be  1.8; for Division II, it could be  1.6;  and  for

Divisions  III and IV, it could be 1.5.  The exact ratios  would

have  to  be ascertained from job evaluation or market  surveys.

But  this  is  the proposal that the civil service unions  would

like to put up to PMO.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I will be very short. While credit

must  go to the political leaders for our achievements, I  think

the  role  of civil servants in assisting Ministers in achieving

Government's  promise cannot be understated.  I would  urge  the

Prime  Minister to try to get more people from outside  to  join

the  civil  service for two to three years.  If they  cannot  be

persuaded to join the political circle, they could at least join

the senior rank of the Administrative Service.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, on the base-up wage system, yes,

there  are ideas to work it out.  In the civil service, we  will

have  to  find ways to narrow the ratio between the maximum  and

minimum  salary  points.  Right now, more than half  the  salary

scales  have  a  ratio of exceeding 1.5, which  is  the  desired

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Machiavelli, the famous sixteenth century strategist

and  the  author of The Discourses and The Art of War, reflected

upon  the fate of Florence and other Italian city states,  which

fell  prey  to foreign invasion and occupation.  His conclusion:

"The  first  way  for  a state to lose its  independence  is  to

neglect  its  defences."  And his advice: "The foundation  of  a

state  is  a good military organisation."  In other words,  Sir,

neglect  defence at your own peril, especially for  small  city-states like Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is Machiavelli from the West. And from the East, we

have Sun Tzu who wrote The Art of War in the fourth century B.C.

And  in  the opening paragraph of his book, he proclaimed  that:

"Defence  is  a  matter of vital importance to  the  state,  the

province  of life or death; the road to survival or ruin."   Sun

Tzu's  formula is not for going into battle per se, but to build

up  our defences in peacetime, and deploy them in such a way  as

to  prevail, overwhelm or deter the enemy by strategic  planning

and  deployment, or what we will call today, deterrence, balance

of power or the indirect approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in the tail-end of the 20th century. It is a

time  of  changes and uncertainties in Asia Pacific, a  time  of

paradigm  shifts in the strategic environment.  It is  the  most

challenging of times; it is the most unsettling.  It is as if we

were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



in  the  birth  pangs  of  a new era.  The  point  is  that  the

unexpected  does  happen in history.  Few  predicted,  Sir,  the

collapse of the Berlin Wall or the collapse of the Soviet  Union

or the outbreak of the Gulf War.  We must therefore in Singapore

prepare ourselves for the worst turn of events, while hoping for

the best.  We must expect the unexpected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do well, Sir, to remember Athens, which despite its

affluence  and  excellence, lost to Sparta in the  Peloponnesian

War.   A  democratic and commercial Athens was vanquished  by  a

militaristic  Sparta.   Athens  fell  because  of  the  lack  of

military  preparation.  We, in Singapore, should draw  a  lesson

from  the city states like Florence and Athens.  We should avoid

being  driven  or consumed by materialism and we  should  never,

never neglect defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also draw a lesson from World War II with regard to

defence closer to home.  We know that on 15th February 1942,  it

was  a  day of infamy for the British.  On that day, the British

surrendered to the Japanese at the Ford factory at Bukit  Timah.

As  Winston  Churchill, the British Prime Minister  declared  at

that  time, it was the `worst disaster'.  It was too  late,  too

little.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government in Singapore is giving high

priority   to  defence.   My  question  is:  in  view   of   the

uncertainties in the region and the unpredictable turn of events

and  the  nature of events, are the funds allocated for  defence

sufficient?   If the Minister considers they are inadequate,  we

will  be happy to oblige and support his appeal for more  funds.

After  all, the defence allocations will amount to 4.6%  of  the

GDP,  still well below the cap of 6% of GDP declared earlier  by

the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Chinese proverb puts it:

(yang  bing  qian ri, yong zai yi zhao) "Train  an  army  for  a

thousand days, for use on the day of need of crisis."   We  just

cannot wait for the crisis to happen and then pour our resources

or  funds  in.   We  cannot  build and  train  an  armed  forces

overnight.  It will be too little and too late.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all for defence. But we also want to know that

the  defence dollars, or indeed the taxpayers' dollars  will  be

well spent.  We want to know whether the defence expenditure  is

cost  effective,  whether  we are getting  good  value  for  the

hardware  we  purchased.  I wish therefore to ask  the  Minister

whether  he would elaborate on the measures to ensure  that  the

defence  funds are maximised in terms of cost effectiveness  and

the judicious mix and selection of hardware.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, as mentioned by the

Chairman  of  the GPC for Defence, our long standing  policy  on

defence  expenditure has been to cap it at 6% of our GDP.   This

would  have  been  an  adequate level as  long  as  the  economy

continues  its healthy growth enabling our expenditure  to  keep

pace  with  inflationary  increases  without  compromising   the

quality of training and equipment of our armed forces.  However,

with  the economy now facing uncertainty as a result of regional

crisis,  our GDP growth is projected to slow down.   This  would

have  a  direct and immediate impact on our defence  expenditure

which will decline correspondingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, development of a well-trained and competent defence

force  and  the acquisition of defence assets are usually  long-term  processes.  If we subject our defence expenditure  to  the

mercy   of   economic  cycles,  we  may  be   compromising   the

effectiveness  of the SAF in building up and maintaining  itself

as  a credible defence force.  Having a strong defence force  is

essential not only for our national sovereignty but also for our

continued  economic  well-being.   Foreign  investors  are  here

because we offer them a safe, secure and stable haven for  their

multi-million dollar investments.  The relationship between  our

sovereignty, our prosperity and our stability is an  indivisible

one and a strong SAF is the linchpin in this situation.  Because

without  a strong SAF to protect our sovereignty, stability  and

prosperity  all  talk  about  more  money  being  allocated   to

education, workers' training, healthcare, social welfare or even

helping the businesses would merely be academic.  Older



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans who have lived through the Japanese Occupation  and

other periods of hard time may be well aware of this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ours is a small military force and with falling birth

rates, we need to augment the effectiveness of our citizens army

with   the  best  defence  technology,  equipment  and  training

available.   But  the  best  defence technology,  equipment  and

training do not come cheap.  However, in order to ensure that we

continue to live in peace with everybody, we must be prepared to

defend  ourselves against anybody and that nobody  should  doubt

that  Singaporeans have the capability and the  will  to  defend

themselves  if  the  need arises.    I would therefore  like  to

request the Minister for Defence to review the 6% of GDP cap  on

our defence expenditure to ensure that the SAF will continue  to

have  the  best defence technology, equipment and training  even

during economically troubled times and especially during periods

of uncertainty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have always

understood  our  defence  philosophy  to  be  premised  on   the

principle  that the best assurance for peace and  stability  and

safety  in our country is deterrence.  Although we are  a  small

country,  we have over the years invested much of our  resources

in  developing  the SAF into an effective and credible  fighting

force.   The SAF today is a modern, balanced and well-integrated

tri-service  armed force that is capable and willing  to  defend

Singapore  when called upon.  To use an analogy  shared  by  our

Prime Minister some time ago, although we may be a small shrimp,

we  are  at least a very poisonous one.  Any potential aggressor

will  have to think twice or many times over when taking us  on.

And   our   defence  philosophy  has  served   us   well   since

Independence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note that in the Budget this year, we have increased

our  spending  on defence.  To many, it seems strange  that  the

Government  is  spending so much on defence when  faced  with  a

difficult economic climate ahead.  Is it prudent that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



we  should be maintaining our defence expenditure at this  level

when we should be cutting back and saving our resources?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say at the onset that I do not subscribe to the view

that we should cut back on defence spending.  In fact, I support

our  proposed expenditure on defence for the coming fiscal year.

It  is no argument when it comes to security and defence to  say

that  we  should be cutting back on defence expenditure  in  the

face  of  a  rough road ahead, especially when the  economy  can

still  afford it. Whether in good times or bad times, the  issue

of   our   vulnerability  as  a  small  state  remains.   Steady

expenditure on defence is to be seen as an insurance premium for

security and survival.  We have seen how vulnerable small states

can be.  We cannot depend on other people's goodwill or largesse

to come to our assistance.  On the contrary, we have to stand on

our own when it comes to the crunch.  Events can quickly take  a

rapid  turn  for  the worse and we have to  be  ready  for  such

eventualities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, modern warfares are a contest of technology. Military

hardware  built on the latest technology determines to  a  large

extent the outcome of any battle.  Modern weapons are not cheap.

It  takes  time and money to maintain the SAF at a high standard

of operational readiness.  There should be no compromises on the

state  of  its  men, weapons and machines.  Without  maintaining

this  necessary expenditure, the ability of the SAF  to  perform

its  role  will be seriously compromised.  The issue is  a  very

simple one.  Would you rather have your son go to battle with  a

bazooka  that is a relic of Second World War or with the  latest

guided  anti tank missile?  The choice is obvious.  In order  to

stay  effective, the SAF must continue to update  its  equipment

and   acquire  a  new  state-of-the-art  equipment   and,   more

importantly,  be led by capable men even if it means  continuing

to pour resources in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that although this year's defence budget has

increased  in  real  terms, the sum total expenditure  is  still

within  our  cap on defence spending at 6% of our GDP.   As  our

economy  continues to grow, the 6% cap on GDP will also continue

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



grow in absolute numbers.  Maintaining defence expenditure at 6%

of  GDP  gives  us the assurance that the economy  is  not  over

burdened as a result.  The SAF has built up its credibility as a

fighting force over the last two decades and must continue to do

so in the coming years to remain effective.  Having said that, I

am  confident that the SAF will at the same time recognise  that

in  the  face  of  the  softening economy, it  would  make  some

adjustments  to  its  programme by consolidating  its  resources

without sacrificing its effectiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting an increase in the budget for defence is

not,  to  me, an issue, I believe the people would like to  know

whether  the Ministry would be making adjustments to its defence

spending  and, if so, what these adjustments are.  Additionally,

I  share  the  concern of my colleague, Dr Ong  Chit  Chung,  in

asking  for assurance from the Minister that the money allocated

to defence will be well spent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, after hearing the last three speakers,

I  am  sure what I am going to say must sound treasonable.  But,

nevertheless,  I  propose to say what I  wish  to  say  on  this

subject.  But, first of all, may I assure the House, although  I

do not think it needs any assurance, the Workers' Party does not

for one minute suggest that we should compromise on our defences

and  our  capabilities.  But the question is:   has  there  been

clear  thinking  about what the objectives  are  and  where  the

threat  is  coming  from and how best  it  could  be  met?   The

Minister  says  in his Budget Statement that the  Government  is

prepared to commit up to 6% of its GDP on defence expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have made a study of 167 countries on their

expenditure  and  the ratio it bears to the GDP.   I  find  that

among these 167 countries, only 25 spent more than Singapore  on

their defence expenditure as a proportion of the GDP. May I  say

that these figures are for 1996.  But these countries where they

spend  more  are in what has been known as troubled  spots,  the

Middle East, in Central Asia and in other countries where it  is

recognised that  troubles are brewing.  Is this region a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



troubled  spot?   We must, first of all, try and formulate  what

are  our objectives in our defence.   What are the threats  that

we may encounter and where will they come from?

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of countries whose spending on defence is much

less  than  Singapore are committed to peace-keeping  operations

which  require  them to send their troops outside  to  keep  the

peace.  I do not see Singapore has ever been called upon to send

its  troops on peace-keeping operations. So what do we  see  the

need  in  Singapore?   Do we see a need  to  keep  ourselves  in

readiness  for  threats  from  our neighbours  or  threats  from

elsewhere?  And if so, what would be the nature of the  threats?

I  think there should be clear discussion on these subjects.   I

do not know why it is not possible for the Ministry to put out a

White Paper on the defence of Singapore, so that these questions

that I have asked are discussed openly and that the people could

see  the need for spending what we are spending.  It is already,

as  I  said, much higher than almost all other countries in  the

world, except for 25 countries.  I would urge the Minister  that

we  should not just follow what may have been our policy in  the

1960s  and a little beyond that.  Times have changed.  The world

has  become  a safer place, and this region has become  a  safer

place.   Where  it  used  to  be  a  troubled  area,  there  is,

comparatively, now peace in this area.  So what are we preparing

for?   Should we not, first of all, outline what our  objectives

are in our defence expenditure?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the 1998

Budget  is  a prudent one.  However, despite the shadow  of  the

regional  financial crisis, our defence spending is not  reduced

but  increased.  It accounts for 4.6% of our GDP, up  0.2%  from

last year.   In other words, defence spending has increased from

last  year's  figure  of  $6.445 billion to this  year's  $7.228

billion,  an  increase of $830 million, or  12.8%.   This  is  a

substantial increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: why are we increasing this spending? The

NCMP has been  asking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



the  same  question again and again.  There is peace around  the

region, why should we spend more money on defence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the NCMP is English educated. He is not quite

familiar with the Chinese history.   Let me enlighten him with a

story  from  Chinese  history.  During the warring  periods,  in

order  to show  appreciation to the state of Jin for helping  it

to  negotiate for peace with the other states, thereby  avoiding

a  conflict, the state of Zheng gave a  lot of chariots, musical

instruments,  musicians and songstresses  to the  king  of  Jin.

The  king  offered  to  share these gifts with  his  meritorious

minister, Wei Jiang.  Wei Jiang declined the offer, and  instead

turned  to  advise the king that he should think of the  dangers

ahead  and  be  prepared, even when he was  enjoying  peace  and

prosperity.   So  I hope the NCMP can appreciate  that  national

defence is the basic foundation and most important role  for  an

independent  and  sovereign Singapore to guard against  external

aggression,  to protect the lives and properties of the  people,

and to ensure security, stability and prosperity of our country.

At  the  same  time, it will boost  confidence of  our   foreign

investors in us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now my colleague mentioned that it takes a thousand

days  to  raise  an army to be used one day.  So a  well-trained

army  cannot be produced overnight.  In the present  context  of

science  and technology, apart from a well-trained armed forces,

we  must  also  ensure that our armed forces are  equipped  with

advanced military hardware.  We can learn from the Gulf war  the

importance  of the supremacy of advanced military hardware.   So

even  in  peace,  we must also make sure that we  have  a  well-trained,  well-armed  and well-equipped  armed  forces,  and  be

prepared at all times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are enjoying peace and security, we tend to forget

the hardship of nation building, especially the young people who

have not gone through the experience of disorders in the 50s and

60s.   We have to remind them time and again of events that  are

happening  all over the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



world.    Take the lesson from the Gulf war.  Kuwait was invaded

overnight by Iraq.  For a small country like Singapore, I  think

we  can  learn  a  good lesson from that.   Our  defence  is  to

maintain our stability and security, especially in this time  of

uncertainties.  We cannot afford to be  complacent.   We  should

restore  the  confidence of investors and make every  effort  to

promote peace and security in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This regional financial crisis teaches us a lesson and

makes  us realise that the future is very unpredictable.  It  is

only  when we live in peace and do not forget to anticipate  the

dangers ahead, be prepared at all times that we will be able  to

tackle the problems as they come along, in order to continue  to

enjoy peace and prosperity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, our huge defence

expenditure  has  been  well  accepted  by  Singaporeans.    The

investment  over  the  years  in  equipment  and  personnel  has

contributed  immensely  to our strong, credible  defence  force.

The best time to invest in our defence capability is surely when

we  are  doing  well  economically,  so  that  Singaporeans  can

continue  to enjoy better life with a greater sense of security.

Surely  that  sense of security is also based on  the  state  of

security  in the region we live in  Southeast Asia and the  Asia

Pacific  in  general.  My question is: what  is  the  Ministry's

assessment of the state of security in the two regions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our enhanced defence capability through the investment in

hardware and training must surely mean that our armed forces are

operationally ready to defend Singapore's territorial  integrity

and  sovereignty.   Given that our armed  forces  consist  of  a

citizens  army, their ability to train safely during peace  time

will  enhance the sense of confidence of our soldiers' families,

particularly  because  our soldiers train  locally  as  well  as

overseas in realistic live-firing exercises.  The SAF does  have

a  very  good record of safety in training and safety is not  an

issue  here.  What I would like to know is how the SAF tries  to

improve further its safety record



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



in  training  and ensure the high quality of safety standard  of

the equipment and weapons that it has purchased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is one other area of investment for security

that  Singapore  must  continue  to  enhance,  ie,   in  defence

relations with neigbouring and friendly countries.  Some foreign

observers  tend to look at the defence expenditures of countries

in the region as a reflection of the arms race.  I look at it as

individual  building  blocks  of  regional  defence.   In   this

respect,  we should build on further bilateral defence relations

with  other  countries.  My question is: how are we  progressing

here?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony</b>

<b>Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to reply to some

of  the  points  which  have  been  brought  up  by  Members  of

Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the region today faces economic gloom. The scale of

the  financial and economic crisis which has hit Southeast  Asia

is unprecedented.  In the months ahead, perhaps even in the next

few  years,  economic  growth in the  region  will  be  severely

affected.    This gloomy prospect is a far cry from the  outlook

less  than  a  year ago when Asia was deemed to  be  the  global

powerhouse.   Investments then flooded into Asia  in  search  of

opportunities.   No  one  could have foretold  how  drastic  the

economic plunge would be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, serious as the economic crisis is, my intention today

is not to discuss the crisis, but to highlight the lessons which

we  can  learn  from  the  crisis for Singapore's  security  and

defence.    The  economic crisis which has hit  Southeast  Asian

countries  is another stark reminder of how quickly a favourable

situation can turn bad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson is clear. We must never take our success,

stability and security for granted.  As I have said many  times,

it  takes many years of hard work to attain economic growth  and

prosperity  but  it does not take very long   sometimes  only  a

matter of weeks   for the situation to deteriorate rapidly.   We

must therefore never assume that prosperity and plenty



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



will  be  ours to enjoy forever.  The lesson which  we  have  to

learn from the economic crisis is that our prosperity depends on

our having sound policies, always being prepared and never being

complacent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's security, like our economic prosperity, is also

not  something  which we should assume will  be  ours  to  enjoy

forever  without  the  need for sound  policies,  to  be  always

prepared   and  never  be  complacent.    As  a  small  country,

Singapore's  security, like our economy, is very  vulnerable  to

the  influences of the external environment. We have  seen  time

and  again  in the Asia-Pacific region over the past  few  years

just  how  quickly tension and threats to stability and security

can  develop. In 1996, the tension in the Taiwan Straits  was  a

cause   of   grave  concern  throughout  the  region,  including

Singapore.  Last  year, there was a crisis in  Cambodia.    But,

fortunately both these crises were defused in time and the  rest

of the region could go on with their pursuit of economic growth.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, we have an economic crisis. The link between

economics  and  security is inescapable.   Today,  the  economic

turmoil  which  has engulfed much of the region brings  with  it

possible repercussions for stability and security as well.   One

of the most striking features of our region over the last couple

of  decades has been the level of cooperation among the  various

countries    both  bilaterally  with  each  other  and   through

multilateral  arrangements, and in a wide range of  sectors  and

activities.    Regional countries blessed with  economic  growth

and  prosperity found it in their interest and to  their  mutual

benefit to cooperate.  Such cooperation in both the economic and

security sectors in turn underpinned the tremendous progress  in

the  Asia-Pacific  region.   If the economic  downturn  is  very

severe  and  there are attendant political and social  problems,

the  stability  and  security which we now enjoy  may  start  to

unravel.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Dr Ong Chit Chung has said, it is imperative that

Singapore is prepared for any challenges to our stability and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



security  that  may  arise in an uncertain regional  environment

complicated by the present economic turmoil.  Newsweek  magazine

last  November advanced three fundamental reasons why  Singapore

had  emerged  relatively  unscathed from  the  currency  crisis.

First,  we  are  vigilant  and always  prepared    for  trouble;

second, we have a preoccupation with efficiency;  and, third, we

emphasize   strategic   planning.    Newsweek   concluded   that

Singapore  had  kept  its balance because we  always  took  into

account possible dangers over the horizon, and when the troubles

arrived, the preparations were already in place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same factors apply to our efforts to build a defence

capability  to  protect  Singaporeans,  and  to  safeguard   our

sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.   Ensuring  peace  and

security   requires   constant  vigilance,   a   commitment   to

efficiency,  and strategic planning.  Building a strong  defence

capability  requires  sustained  effort  and  the  support   and

commitment  of  our  people  to  the  defence  of  our   nation.

Singaporeans  must always be mindful that there may  be  dangers

over  the horizon, and unless we have a defence capability which

is  credible enough to deter a threat, and to defeat that threat

if the need arises, we will pay very heavily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying the price now to build up our armed forces will

spare  us the much bigger price that we will have to pay  if  we

get caught unprepared and unvigilant.  In the economic sphere if

things  fall apart, you will still have future opportunities  to

rebuild  again,  and to prosper, but we will not  get  a  second

chance  if we cannot defend ourselves.  A security threat  could

mean the loss of lives and the end of Singapore. So, just as the

right  economic policies have enabled us to weather the regional

economic turmoil, we must have the right policies in defence  to

help us ensure our security and survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, building a credible defence force is a long term

process.   I  have  made this point in Parliament  before.   The

modern  battlefield is a fast evolving one.  We have  to  ensure

that our armed forces do not have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



yesterday's  capabilities to fight today's wars.  This  requires

constant   investment   in   training   in   new   skills    and

technologically-advanced weapons.  Technology is also  important

to give us the multiplier to overcome our manpower constraints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building up a credible defence capability therefore

requires prudent and steady investments over many years.  Feast-and-famine  budgets will only result in sub-optimal "start-stop"

implementation  of programmes.  You cannot build  a  strong  and

effective  defence capability using such an approach.   We  must

plan  our  defence spending carefully, over many years  and  not

year  by  year  in  fits and starts. We must always  maintain  a

suitable  level of defence spending each year.  Our policy  has,

for  a long time, been to set a cap of 6% of the GDP for defence

spending.  This policy has served us well.  I am  encouraged  by

the comments from Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Charles Chong that we

should review this 6% cap to see whether it is sufficient.  Sir,

we  have  actually spent well below 6% for the last  few  years.

For  this financial year, the Defence Ministry is spending 4.62%

of our GDP.  But I think the 6% cap is valuable because it is  a

commitment  which facilitates planning and a smooth  development

of capabilities.  Equally important, the 6%  is an expression of

the  importance we place on ensuring Singapore's defence.    Our

fate  as  a  people and as a nation hangs on  this.   If  it  is

necessary to review the 6% cap, we will certainly do so, but for

the time being, that is sufficient for our defence needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam has brought up the point as to why

Singapore is spending so  much on defence.   I am sorry that  he

is not here now to listen to my reply.   But let us consider the

consequences  of  spending less on defence. Sir,  with  a  small

population,  the SAF needs high technology systems  to  overcome

our  manpower constraints.  In fact, it is fortunate that we are

able to use technology to overcome our shortage of manpower.  In

the  days  when  sheer  numbers counted for  everything  on  the

battlefield, there could have been little that we  could  do  to

fight back against an enemy who has vastly more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



men than Singapore that our small population could ever hope  to

muster.  Singapore is also land scarce which means that much  of

our  training has to be done overseas.   This is more costly  -- although  we must not forget that the benefits of more effective

training  and  the  opportunities to interact with  other  armed

forces often more than make up for the extra cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting back on defence expenditure will mean slower

modernisation, less defence R&D and therefore not as big an edge

over a potential enemy, and fewer training opportunities for our

soldiers, sailors and airmen.  What this means is that  it  will

translate into a degradation of our defence capability  and  our

operational  readiness.   Our  deterrence  level  will  then  be

lowered.   And  our security policy is based on the  concept  of

deterrence.  Sir, we are not looking for a fight with anyone. We

pay  great attention to maintain good defence relations with our

neighbours and with other countries.  I would like to assure  Mr

Hawazi  Daipi that this is given daily attention by both  myself

and  my colleagues in the Ministry of Defence.  But, Sir,  where

defence relations fail and in case anyone has hostile intentions

towards Singapore, he must know that it will be extremely costly

for him to carry it through, and it would be best for him not to

contemplate  such a venture.  If our defence capability  is  not

credible,  a  potential aggressor might well reach  a  different

conclusion  and  feel bold enough to go on a military  adventure

against  Singapore. A weaker defence capability also means  that

the  SAF may have to fight at a disadvantage against the  enemy.

So, cutting back on defence expenditure would amount not only to

higher  risks  for  our nation but also, more directly,  to  the

Singaporeans who have to fight to defend Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Mr Sin Boon Ann has said, defence expenditure

should  be  seen as our national insurance policy for peace  and

prosperity.  You have to continue to pay the premiums,  in  good

times and in bad times.  The greatest return we can have on  our

investment is never to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



to  go to war.  We are already collecting on our policy in terms

of  the  peace of mind that the people of Singapore and  foreign

investors  have as a direct consequence of knowing that  we  are

ready and willing to make all necessary commitments in resources

and money to ensure the security of our nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are our objectives in spending on defence. The

SAF  that we have today is the result of years of investment  in

the  best  people,  equipment, doctrines and tactics.   The  SAF

demonstrated  its  operational readiness and effectiveness  when

events  in Cambodia took a turn for the worse last year and  the

SAF  was called upon to bring Singaporeans home.  More recently,

the SAF responded promptly and effectively to provide assistance

in  the  search and rescue and recovery efforts after the tragic

SilkAir  crash  in the Musi River.  The SAF must  constantly  be

prepared   for   all  contingencies,  including  providing   the

necessary  response  should there be  a  threat  to  Singapore's

sovereignty  and  territorial  integrity.   We  must   therefore

attract  the  best talents to serve in the SAF, and augment  our

limited manpower resources with high technology weapon systems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF will continue to invest in the necessary

equipment and weapon systems and exploit technology as  a  force

multiplier to compensate for our limitations in manpower and  to

maintain  our technological edge.  In the future, the  challenge

will  be  to broaden the scope and quality of defence technology

that  is used by the SAF.   This will increase its effectiveness

manifold.    To achieve this, MINDEF will continue to  emphasise

greater integration among the SAF, the Defence Technology  Group

and  our  defence industries, as well as optimise our scientific

and  engineering talent.  The most vital element is good people.

We  need  motivated and professional officers and  men  who  are

willing  to  take on an onerous career in the SAF  and  who  are

prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has come a long way, and a strong and

credible SAF is a key



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



fundamental   which  has  contributed  to  our  success.    More

important,  a strong SAF will determine whether we can  preserve

that success or whether we or future generations of Singaporeans

will  have to stand by helplessly while our country comes  under

attack  and we lose everything we have built up, or worse,  lose

our freedom as a people and a nation. Sir, this is a point which

has  been  aptly brought up by Dr Wang Kai Yuen.  Our  long-term

investment in defence will allow us to face any uncertainty with

confidence.  Even in difficult times such as those we face  now,

we  must  continue  to  be committed to building  a  strong  and

credible  defence  force.   This  is  the  best  guarantee   for

Singapore's continued peace, stability and prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleagues, the Second Minister for Defence and the

Minister  of State for Defence, will reply to some of the  other

points brought up by Members.



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, it is a time of changes and

uncertainties in Asia Pacific, a time of paradigm shifts in  the

strategic environment in the region.  In such circumstances,  we

must be single-minded and focus on the operational readiness  of

the SAF.  We want to be certain that the SAF is ever ready, when

the chips are down, to discharge its missions in any scenario.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Sir, we read in the Parameters, a quarterly

journal of the United States Army College, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore's ground forces are considerably more competent

tactically  than  those  of  its  neighbours  .  .   Singapore's

equipment,  personnel,  training,  and  overall  readiness   are

considered the best in Southeast Asia.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, I came across the Australian Strategic Policy, a

paper  published  by Australian Department of  Defence.   And  I

quote from this paper:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore's forces are the most advanced and effective in

this  region,  making it a valuable partner for  the  Australian

Defence Force in terms of peace time interaction.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister care to comment on these external

assessments,  and whether the SAF is operationally  ready,  come

what  may,  and  that the SAF is more than equal to  its  tasks?

That  having invested substantially in the SAF, we can count  on

the SAF in a crunch.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am reassured having heard Dr Tony

Tan's  reply.  We have come a long way from the days of  Dr  Goh

Keng  Swee  to that of Dr Tony Tan's.  The fact that  the  Prime

Minister has given three Ministers the responsibility of defence

shows the priority the Government has.  I would like to urge the

Minister,  and I share the sentiments shown by Dr  Wang  and  Mr

Charles  Chong, that the fact that 6% is the upper limit  should

not  deter  us from reviewing this upper limit should  the  time

arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our defence, our peace, will ensure the quality of

life  that Singaporeans are going to enjoy.  The fact that  your

area has not been burgled does not mean that you keep your house

open.   There is an Indian saying: in order to have  peace,  you

have  to  defend it at a price.  The fact that we  do  not  have

enemies  around us is a good sign.  But the fact  still  remains

that  we  live in a very turbulent world, and we must build  our

defence  capability.  Sir, it is reassuring  that  none  of  the

Members,  when  the debate on the Budget Statement  took  place,

questioned the spending on defence, and I think that is right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on another area which I think has

equal  priority,  and  that  is, the people  must  realise  that

defence  is part and parcel of their life.  It is not  just  our

armed forces.  Every Singaporean must realise that he has a role

to  play.   And I urge the Government to reconsider  giving  the

citizens  a right perspective of our defence.  And I would  urge

the  Minister, in collaboration with the Minister for Education,

to  ensure  that every school child in Singapore  shall  realise

that  the defence of Singapore is also his responsibility.   His

parents must tell him how we must nurture ourselves in the world

we are living in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the employers must realise the important

contribution that their employees do when they perform  National

Service.   And I will go one step further, that those  employees

who  have  done  outstandingly well in  their  National  Service

should be considered as a plus point for promotion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot overstate the fact that the defence of

Singapore is the responsibility of everyone of us, including the

Members  of  this  House,  some of  whom  are  actively  serving

National Service now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to have a good armed forces, we have to have

money  invested both in machines as well as men.   And  I  would

urge  the  Government to second some of the best brains  of  the

country into the armed forces, which I think the Government  has

been  doing.   I  think it is gratifying to  note  that  we  are

developing defence ties with other countries, like Sweden.   The

fact  that they are prepared to have defence ties with us  shows

the capability and efficiency of our armed forces.  I would urge

the  Minister  to go and explore and have defence  relationships

with as many countries as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many Members who are going to speak. I will

just  touch on only one point which is of importance to us.   We

always  think in terms of production, in terms of money, dollars

and cents.  The defence personnel may not be helping in GDP, but

let  us bear this in mind.  Without them, we would have no  GDP.

So,  please  give them their dues, and I think we should  salute

these men who have helped in defending Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the break now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and

took the Chair of the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, MINDEF has many years ago embarked

upon  and  launched the concept of total defence, embracing  and

encompassing  not only military defence, but also  psychological

defence,  social defence, civil defence and, not least  of  all,

economic defence of which we are painfully aware of in  view  of

the economic turmoil in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total defence is part and parcel of our national education.

While  we  train  our National Servicemen  on  how  to  use  and

maximise  the  hardware that we have, we  must  not  forget  the

heartware.  Each and every National Serviceman must know what he

is  fighting  for,  why the sacrifices, why  we  hold  dear  our

sovereignty,  integrity  and  independence  and  our  hopes  and

visions for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Servicemen should have, through national

education,  a  sense of history, an abiding  commitment  to  our

homeland,   an  appreciation  of  our  strength   as   well   as

vulnerabilities,  and an unshakeable faith in our  own  national

defence.   Through national education, our National  Servicemen,

indeed all Singaporeans, will be rooted in our own homeland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our National Servicemen have their hearts in the right

places,  Sir, we will win every battle.  We must drum  into  our

servicemen the `can do' or the gungho attitude or to put  it  in

the  local  Hokkien  context: pa see  bo  chow.   I  would  like

therefore  to ask the Minister whether enough has been  done  to

promote  national  education in the SAF and  whether  there  are

better  and  more  effective ways to win over their  hearts  and

minds of our National Servicemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I continue with the other items?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please do.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, for a small country, with a small

armed forces based on National Service, we have to know our  own

strength  and weaknesses, adopt the right strategy and have  the

right  mix  of weapon systems.  We cannot rely on mass manpower.

Our  competitive edge lies in high technology, in firepower  and

mobility, in other words, in quality rather than quantity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same applies in the area of training. As a national

service  armed forces, we have limited time frames to train  our

own  men.  We also face the limitation of space in a city state.

With the constraints of numbers, time and space, our answer must

lie  in high-tech.  This is very much so in training.  We should

harness  high-tech to train our National Servicemen,  maximising

the  returns  in  terms  of manpower and  space.   High-tech  in

training  would also make training more relevant, realistic  and

interesting to our younger National Servicemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I request the Minister to elaborate on the use of high-tech

in  training and whether he would consider expanding the role of

high-tech in more areas of training, locally and overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, unfortunately, there were a series of

accidents  and  fatalities in the SAF training, both  local  and

overseas.   It  raised much concern amongst parents  and  family

members.   I  am  glad  that MINDEF took  safety  seriously  and

instituted a thorough review of training procedures.  Safety  in

training is the order of the day in the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish therefore to ask the Minister on the current state

of  safety  in  training and whether he is  satisfied  with  the

safety  measures  in  place and what are the  responses  of  the

troops in the field to such measures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, in his Budget speech last year, the

Minister gave his assurance that the SAF placed most priority on

training safety.  To achieve this, would the Minister point  out

that  the  SAF  has focused on three main areas.  Firstly,  risk

assessment  and management.  Secondly, close range  supervision,

and thirdly, safety education.  We have no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



doubt that the SAF takes training safety very seriously and that

no effort has been spared in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will recall, these assurances came fresh from

the tragic aftermath of the explosion of the artillery shell  in

New  Zealand  which killed two of our servicemen.   Despite  the

assurances  given by the SAF, accidents still  do  happen.   The

public,  I  believe,  has come to accept  that  this  is  to  be

expected  in  organisations as large as the  SAF.   Foremost  in

people's mind is whether there has been any improvement  in  the

safety  training  record  since last year.   Will  the  Minister

please supply this House of the training safety record to-date?

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,

the  SAF that we have today is the result of years of investment

in  people,  equipment and doctrine.  It is a modern  and  well-integrated fighting force, operationally ready to deal with  any

contingencies   that   involve  our  national   interest.    Its

operational    readiness   is   maintained   through    frequent

mobilization practices and realistic training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong has mentioned two articles, one, Parameters and

another, Australian Strategic Policy that have complimented  the

SAF   on  its  readiness.   Those  armed  forces  that  we  have

interacted and trained with have also found that the  SAF  is  a

professional and proficient outfit.  As I said last year, we  do

not  just  depend  on magazines, reports and foreign  forces  to

assess  our readiness.  We conduct regular readiness checks  and

exercises.  Also when the SAF has been called upon to carry  out

missions at short notice, it has performed well.  This is a test

to the high operational readiness of the SAF.  Recently, the SAF

was called upon to evacuate Singaporeans caught in the midst  of

factional fighting in Cambodia in July 1997 and to carry  out  a

month-long  search and recovery mission in Palembang, Indonesia,

in  December 1997.  If we delve further back into history,  many

Singaporeans will remember the role that our commandos played in

ensuring the successful resolution of the SQ 117 hijack in 1991,

or  our  air  force executing the dramatic cable car  rescue  in

1983.  The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



Government will continue to ensure that the SAF is operationally

ready to deal with any contingency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Hawazi Daipi have asked

about safety training in the SAF.  The SAF has taken great pains

to  ensure that whilst we train hard and well, no compromise  is

made to the safety of our servicemen.  Nothing is more important

than the safety of our troops.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training safety in the SAF is overseen by a high-level

committee chaired by the Chief of Defence Forces.  The Committee

meets regularly to review safety efforts undertaken by the  SAF.

We  have in place a safety management system that systematically

seeks to minimise all conceivable risks to our servicemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, there are detailed safety procedures for every

activity  our  soldiers undertake.  These  procedures  are  well

documented  and  widely disseminated to  all  our  officers  and

specialists.   They  are updated whenever valuable  lessons  are

learnt  either from our own experiences or from the  experiences

of other armed forces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All officers and specialists are required to pass training

safety regulation tests as part of their training.  The SAF also

regularly  conducts Safety Education and Awareness seminars  for

all our officers and servicemen to remind them of the importance

of safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety officers are appointed whenever major exercises or

live firings are conducted.  Commanders are also required before

each  exercise  or training to review the risks associated  with

the exercise or training and take steps to minimise these risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the more established armed forces, the SAF also has

safety  agencies whose primary aim is to audit all SAF  training

activities  at  every  level to ensure that  all  the  necessary

safety  training measures are implemented fully.   These  safety

agencies  also  investigate  all training  incidents,  including

those that do not result in any bodily harm.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also established an electronics training safety

bulletin where every serviceman can access and share the  latest

in safety developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF recognises that any training accident is one

accident too many.  No effort is therefore spared to ensure that

our servicemen can train safely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked about the use of technology in training. Sir,

less  than one-tenth of the Singapore land area is used for  SAF

training and MINDEF recognises that the area available  for  SAF

training will shrink with time as we face competing demands  for

land  to  meet  our housing and economic needs.   A  two-pronged

approach  is  adopted to deal with this.  Firstly, we  look  for

training areas overseas and today, the SAF conducts large  scale

training  in several countries.  The SAF will continue  to  look

for  suitable  training areas overseas.  Second,  the  SAF  uses

technology  to make up for the shortfall on land and air  space.

For example, emphasis is placed on the use of simulators.  High-end   simulators  can  provide  extremely  realistic  and   safe

training.   It  reduces  the need for live  firing  and  is  not

constrained  by  the  lack  of space.   Examples  of  simulators

developed  for  SAF  training  are the  air  combat  manoeuvring

instrumentation  system,  the  air defence  complete  engagement

simulator, naval tactical simulators, flight simulators and  the

tank  and  training systems.  The SAF will continue to look  for

innovative training methods using high technology to make up for

the shortfall of training areas in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Shriniwas Rai and Dr Ong spoke about national

education  and  reminding our citizens about the  importance  of

defence.   I  could not agree more with Dr Ong and Mr  Shriniwas

Rai  that  it  is  very important for all Singaporeans  to  take

defence  seriously.   MINDEF introduced  the  concept  of  total

defence  in  1984.  Since then, MINDEF has, in conjunction  with

relevant  Ministries  and  other agencies,  implemented  various

programmes  to  enhance public awareness of  the  importance  of

total  defence.  These programmes reach out to all Singaporeans.

Most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



recently,  the Total Defence Heroes exhibition at  Fort  Canning

which  commemorated Total Defence Day on 15th February was aimed

at increasing the awareness of Singaporeans about the roles that

they can play in Total Defence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the SAF, we have for many years had national education

programmes  which reach out to NSmen, regulars and non-uniformed

personnel.    These   programmes   serve   to   strengthen   the

servicemen's commitment to Singapore and to explain the need for

a  defence capability.  MINDEF also contributes actively to  the

Ministry   of  Education's  national  education  programme   and

conducts  its  own  national  education  programme  for   school

children  aimed at creating a greater awareness of  defence  and

security  issues.   I  can assure Mr Rai that  the  Ministry  of

Defence  and Ministry of Education are well coordinated on  this

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Ministry of Education is developing a

comprehensive  and  extensive national education  programme  for

young Singaporeans reaching all the way from primary schools  to

the   tertiary  institutions,  MINDEF  has  adjusted  its  focus

slightly  to  provide  national  education  in  a  cohesive  and

systematic  manner  for  all  SAF  servicemen  and  women  which

complements  and reinforces the national education programme  in

schools.   The  SAF's programme covers many  levels  from  basic

military training to specialist and officer cadet schools.   The

national  education packages stress the importance  of  national

service  and the roles our servicemen play in providing for  the

security   of  our  country.   MINDEF  also  conducts   national

education  courses and seminars for middle echelon officers  and

specialists both for regulars and national servicemen during in-camp  training on specific issues as well as to remind  them  of

the important role they play in defence.  I would like to assure

Members of this House that MINDEF is fully committed to ensuring

that  servicemen and Singaporeans at large, especially  the  men

and  women  who serve in the defence of our country,  understand

why we cannot take our security for granted and why



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



each  and  every one of them has an important role  to  play  in

ensuring the security of our nation.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the SAF, like any organisation,

requires  good  and capable men to manage and to lead.   Without

these men having the most sophisticated weapons that are at  the

cutting  edge  of technology would not have served any  purpose.

Accordingly  and,  quite rightly, the SAF has never  spared  any

effort  in paying competitive salaries in order to get  men  and

perhaps,  in this day and age, women into service.  As a  result

of the intensive recruitment exercises conducted over the years,

the  SAF  has  had a fair amount of success in getting  men  and

women  of the right quality to make a career out of serving  the

organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two decades, we have seen the transformation of

the  SAF  into a credible and effective armed force  capable  of

defending the security interest of Singapore.  Whether it is the

navy,  air  force or the army, there is very little  doubt  that

these  military services are very highly regarded, not  just  by

our  own people as we have heard earlier, but also by those  who

have had the opportunity to work with them.  This transformation

is  in  no small way attributable to the men and women who  have

made sacrifices to bring the SAF to where it is today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that it is the policy of the SAF to keep

its  organisation young.  Accordingly, very often,  in the  SAF,

we  see  officers who are put in very senior command  positions.

These  men  have been challenged by the very high  demands  that

these  appointments require.  It is not unusual to find  men  in

their  early  30s occupying senior staff positions in  the  SAF.

With younger officers, the organisation will reduce the risk  of

being  encrusted  in  complacence.  Younger officers  with  more

energy  and perhaps with fresher ideas would provide the impetus

for advancing the organisation forward.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping the organisation young does have its price. I

would like to touch on two broad areas.  First, officers in  the

SAF  would  have  to vacate their appointments at  a  relatively

young age in order to allow  younger officers to take over.   In

many  cases,  the  retiring officers are  still  young  and  are

capable  of  carrying  on.  For them,  because  they  are  still

economically  active,  they are compelled  to  look  for  second

careers and starting life afresh there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the SAF has a programme of preparing its officers

and  men  for a second career in advance.  In this regard,  much

credit must go to MINDEF in making the effort to look after  the

well-being  of  its  employees.  While the  soldiers  are  being

returned  to civilian life through these courses, I  wonder  how

many  of  these  soldiers have been successful in  reintegrating

themselves in society.  Will the Minister please tell this House

how many ex-servicemen have been able to find jobs, for example,

in  the private sector, what kind of jobs these are, and whether

any  study  has  been  done  on the  morale  of  these  retiring

soldiers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern arises from the fact that the early

retirement  officers  will  lead to  the  question  of  relative

experience  of those who come to succeed them.  One would  agree

that  no  matter  how  bright a soldier is, intelligence  is  no

substitute for experience.  What assurance can the Minister give

to  this  House  that  in appointing young  officers  to  senior

command positions in place of the retiring officers,  the output

from  the  offices  that  these  officers  occupy  will  not  be

compromised for lack of experience?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, defence relations with other

countries constitute an important function of MINDEF and is part

of  our overall defence strategy.  Good  defence relations among

Armed   Forces  Chiefs  and  personnel  will  enhance  bilateral

communication   and  relationship,  and   help   us   to   avoid

misunderstanding and tide over difficult periods of time.   Good

defence relations, I believe, will yield good dividends,  giving

us  access  to  overseas training, facilities,  enabling  us  to

conduct bilateral and multi-lateral defence exercises, giving us

the opportunity to test



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



our  doctrines  and  measure ourselves against  the  best  armed

forces in the world or in the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has earlier said, we are short of local

training  areas.   The  overseas  training  facilities  will,  I

believe, provide us with good alternative areas and terrain  for

hands-on  training.  I would therefore like to ask the  Minister

to  update us on our defence relations with the other countries,

the  joint  military exercises that we have and whether  we  are

having more access to overseas training facilities.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the topic that I am going to raise,

I  believe,  has been raised earlier.  I am suggesting  that  we

consider  the  proposition to allow  our  girls  to  serve  some

national  service  or  what you call community  service,  for  a

period  of  three   to  six months.  I do this  in  seriousness,

because some Members felt that this matter should not have  been

brought up.  I think we are being unfair to our girls.   We  are

discriminating  against  them.   They  should   be   given   the

opportunity also to serve the country.  Some of them are already

serving in the non-uniformed branches.  May I urge the Minister,

as  a  long-term policy,  to consider my suggestion.  He may  be

aware that some other countries are having national service  for

girls.  They have a longer period  which I do not agree.   I  do

not  think  girls should serve the same period as the  boys.   I

think  anything  from  three  months  to  six  months  would  be

sufficient,  and  they could be a contributing factor,  both  in

time of peace and in time of crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, boys who have served national service have developed a

sense  of  camaraderie, a bond which only the  school  days  can

rival.   Similarly,  the  girls too can  benefit.   I  urge  the

Minister to give some consideration to this matter in the  long-term interest of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we are having a declining

workforce.  If we could allow girls to serve from three  to  six

months,  then we may want to consider   I am not saying that  we

should   reducing the period for the boys from two  and  a  half

years to two years and three months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

propose    to   the   Minister   for   Defence   to    introduce

institutionalised programmes for key appointment holders  in  NS

units  to meet with employers directly, both during and  outside

in-camp training, to improve community relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers' support is extremely important. We must

recognise  their contribution.  We can do more to overcome  some

of  the perception gaps and frustrations that sometimes confront

employers  when  they  communicate  with  the  SAF.   The   most

important  and  frequent  reasons why employers  would  want  to

communicate  with  the  SAF is to ask for deferment  of  in-camp

training  for  their staff.  Usually this happens a  little  too

late,   but,  quite  understandably,  business  unpredictability

sometimes  makes  it difficult to plan one's  in-camp  training,

even  when  notices  are  given  six  months  ahead.   Sometimes

employers  get  the feeling that their problems  are  not  being

understood or appreciated adequately, especially when they  deal

with  some  unknown officials either in writing or  through  the

phone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think NS units can play a very important role here. They

put  a  human face and touch when dealing with employers.   Such

institutionalised  programmes can lead to  more  meaningful  and

strong  relationship between NSmen  and employers,  and  thereby

effectively  enlarging the SAF community.   Who  but  the  NSmen

themselves  can better demonstrate that when employers  ask  for

deferment on behalf of their employees, they are actually asking

other  NSmen  to  shoulder  additional responsibilities  brought

about by the absence of one soldier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF, like any other forces for that matter, is

organised such that the absence of one member in a unit or group

can  seriously affect training and handicap the capability of  a

unit  as  a fighting force.   I ask for a new focus and emphasis

to  establish and enhance the relationship between employers and

the  respective units to complement the roles already played  by

SAF public relations unit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the NS units have grown from just being

operationally   ready   and  competent  to   undertaking   other

administrative responsibilities.  NS units, given the  necessary

resources  and  assistance, can and are ready to play  a  larger

role in community relations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Minister of State, Ministry of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b>

Sir,  Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about early retirement from the  SAF

and also how these retired servicemen are faring in the civilian

world.   MINDEF  has a policy of keeping the  SAF  young.   This

ensures  that the SAF is always fighting fit and effective.   It

also  allows  a  healthy renewal of leadership, and  a  constant

infusion of new ideas at all levels of the SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that transition to a second career is

never   easy.    Preparations  for  a  serviceman's   retirement

therefore  start well before his actual retirement.   About  one

and  a half to two years before their retirement, servicemen are

invited to attend special workshops and seminars to help prepare

them for their retirement and second careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in service, MINDEF provides ample opportunities for

servicemen to upgrade themselves.  Many sponsorships are offered

for  diploma, undergraduate and post-graduate courses.  We  also

sponsor  servicemen  for  certified supervisory  and  management

programmes offered by the Singapore Institute of Management  and

the  Singapore Productivity and Standards Board.   The  training

provided will not only enable the servicemen to contribute  more

to  the  SAF  but also better prepare them for a second  career.

There is also a scheme to subsidise retiring servicemen who wish

to  take  up  training to prepare themselves  for  their  second

career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF also helps retiring servicemen to look for suitable

jobs  in  the public and private sectors.  Furthermore, retiring

servicemen  may start work with their new employers  up  to  six

months  before their retirement from the SAF.  And  during  this

period, the SAF pays them half their pay and allows them to keep

whatever their new employers will pay them.  Sir, these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



measures  will  help  the  SAF  servicemen  to  make  a   smooth

transition into their second careers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no specific numbers as to who have gone to what jobs

but,  anecdotally, we know that our retired servicemen are  well

looked  after  in their new careers by their new employers.   We

know  that  there  is a network of retiring and retired  regular

officers  with  national  servicemen who  form  the  network  of

employers  and employees in the civilian sector.   And  we  know

that  they constantly keep in touch with each other to find  out

who  is  retiring  and who they can hire and can  contribute  to

their companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect of moving young officers up very

quickly  within the SAF hierarchy will not compromise  on  their

ability  and expertise, because we have a well planned route  of

advancement  where  we prepare junior officers  to  take  senior

appointments.  We train them and properly prepare  them  through

courses and expose them to experiences, command appointments and

exercises   to  ensure  that  when  they  get  to   the   higher

appointments, they will be able to perform well in their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Mr Shriniwas Rai

asked about defence relations with other countries.  Our defence

policy   is  based  on  deterrence  and  diplomacy.   Therefore,

diplomacy  is  a  key pillar of our defence  policy.   Singapore

places great emphasis on developing good defence relations  with

other  countries, both within and outside of our  region.   Over

the  years,  we  have  developed a  network  of  strong  defence

relations  with many countries, and we will continue  to  invest

effort  and  resources to strengthen existing relationships  and

develop new ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our defence relations with ASEAN and FPDA countries are

good.  The SAF trains and exercises with their armed forces on a

bilateral  or  multi-lateral basis.  We also send  officers  for

training  in  each other's military academies and colleges.   We

organise  regular  visits and exchanges  for  all  ranks.   Such

interactions  enable us to learn from each other  professionally

and promote mutual understanding and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>



confidence   building.   Such  exchanges  also  facilitate   the

development  of rapport at various levels between SAF  personnel

and their foreign counterparts.



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Pacific, our defence relations with the US are

strong and warm. This relationship has been steadily growing  in

depth  and  scope.  The Air Force continues to  have  access  to

valuable training facilities in America.  Exercises with the  US

conducted  locally have grown in complexity and scope  over  the

years.  These exercises and access to facilities testify to  the

value  both  sides derive from such interaction.  We  have  also

recently  signed a Memorandum of Understanding which allows  the

Air Force to do flying training in Canada.  Defence interactions

between  Singapore and European countries, in particular  France

and   Sweden,  are  increasing.   Our  Navy  conducts  submarine

training  in  Sweden.  The Air Force had their  first  bilateral

exercise  with  their French counterparts recently.   MINDEF  is

working  towards more cooperation between the SAF  and  European

armed forces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year, we have also stepped up defence

interactions  with  countries such as South  Africa,  China  and

Japan.   We  would like to see this continue.  As  for  training

areas,  these  are  limited in Singapore.   While  the  SAF  has

invested  heavily  in simulators and other  forms  of  high-tech

training  aids to overcome our constraints, there are limits  to

what  technology can provide.  There is no substitute for actual

flying  and  on-ground manoeuvres.  Hence, the  SAF  has  little

choice  but to conduct more of its training overseas.   The  SAF

has  access  to  training facilities in 16  countries.   We  are

grateful for these opportunities.  We will continue to look  for

new  training  areas overseas to meet the growing needs  of  the

SAF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked whether girls should do some form of

national  service.   As  far as military duties  are  concerned,

MINDEF has no immediate need to consider the option of enlisting

women  by way of national service.  The number of males enlisted

for national service is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



indeed  dwindling because of falling birth rates.  This has  led

to  a squeeze on national service manpower for the SAF.  But  so

far  the  measures, such as making better use of technology  and

commercialisation  of  non-essential  support  functions,   have

enabled  MINDEF  to cope with the squeeze. These  measures  have

allowed  us  to  free  up  more manpower  resources  for  combat

vocations or we can do more with fewer men.  However,  Mr  Rai's

question touches on cohesion and bonding among women and perhaps

also non-combat duties for them.  If that is so, then perhaps  I

should  pass  this  question  to other  relevant  Ministries  to

consider for further study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether or not we should consider reducing

the  period of training for boys in full-time national  service.

Sir, as explained by the Minister and the Second Minister before

me,   we  are  increasingly  going  into  high  technology   and

sophisticated equipment and these equipment require a long  time

for  the  boys  to get familiar with and to be operational  with

them.  The sophisticated weapon systems and equipment require  a

long   period  of  basic  training,  first,  for  the   soldiers

themselves to understand their own personal weapons and how they

should  react  on  the battlefield and slowly move  on  to  team

building  and then get to operate those sophisticated equipment.

Furthermore,  Sir, the training is not by way of small  sections

of  10,  20  or 50 men.  They have to increasingly also  operate

with  larger  formations such as the battalion, the  brigade  or

even  the division. Therefore, because of these two reasons,  we

need  a long time to prepare a young boy, coming in as a recruit

till the time he is operationally ready, to operate within a far

larger  formation and to operate very sophisticated weapons  and

equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin asked about community relations and,

in  particular, interaction with employers.  I thank him for his

suggestion.  MINDEF has always regarded our relations  with  the

community as very important, especially given that the SAF is  a

citizen armed force.  Families and employers, all have a keen



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



interest  in  what the SAF is doing.  MINDEF is  also  conscious

that in a small country like Singapore, military activities will

inevitably result in some inconvenience to the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF set up the Advisory Council on Community Relations

in  Defence  (ACCORD) in 1984 as a means to keep  the  community

informed of developments in the SAF and to obtain feedback.  The

ACCORD  members  represent employers, trade  unions,  grassroots

organisations, schools and institutions of higher  learning  and

also Members of Parliament.  We have found ACCORD most valuable,

as it helps MINDEF to explain its policies and activities to the

community  and  to  garner the support of Singaporeans  for  our

defence effort.  The feedback from ACCORD also helps us to fine-tune  MINDEF's policies and programmes to take the  concerns  of

the  community into consideration.  MINDEF also conducts regular

dialogue  sessions with various groups, including employers  and

grassroots leaders.  At the same time, we organise visits to the

SAF  units for them so that they have a better idea of the SAF's

capabilities to defend our country and a better understanding of

what  it  is  that  our young men do when they perform  national

service.  Our three services, ie, Air Force, Army and Navy, also

hold   open  houses  for  members  of  the  public.   SAF  units

themselves invite members of the public to such events  such  as

passing  out  parades,  unit anniversary  celebrations  and  the

Commanders'  Evening  so  that the members  of  the  public  and

employers can interact with the officers of the individual unit.

So  I assure the hon. Member that this has already been done and

the  unit  commanders are encouraged to organise  more  of  such

activities wherever possible.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Ministers for

their full and comprehensive replies and I beg leave to withdraw

the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head K of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code KA 1500.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, the Ministry of Defence is a very important Ministry

in  Singapore, especially for a small nation like Singapore that

is  surrounded  by the big countries in Southeast  Asia  without

much  breathing  space.  Most information  relating  to  defence

expenditure  are  sensitive and cannot be  disclosed.   Although

defence expenditure is necessary, we must still be   prudent  in

our spending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1997 Auditor-General's Report, I saw a lot of

shortcomings  in  the  Ministry  of  Defence's  expenditure  and

administrative  procedures.   For  example,  in  the   tendering

procedure, the tender boxes were opened before the closing date.

Secondly,  some  tenders that were submitted after  the  closing

date  were  also  accepted  and considered.   Thirdly,  the  fax

machine  was not installed at a proper place, and some of  these

documents  and  quotations can be read by other  people  in  the

office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also an incident when the tender price was

negotiated  down by $630,000 after the tender was closed.   Yet,

when payment was made to the successful tenderer, the amount  of

$630,000  was not deducted from the original tender  price.    I

wonder what the Ministry is doing about the matter. How did this

happen?  Has any investigation been conducted, and what  is  the

result  of  the investigation?  How can the Ministry of  Defence

ensure  that this type of mistake will not occur again?

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, I assure the Member that MINDEF

takes  the Auditor-General's Report very seriously.  Indeed,  we

are  very conscious of the need to spend the budget given to  us

wisely  and  ensure that there are no biases in the tenders  nor

any discrepancies in the tender system.  There is no mystery  as

to  what  happened.   The  Member read these  reports  from  the

Auditor-General's Report.  Let me explain what has happened with

regard to what he told us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tender boxes being opened, on average,

about 50 MINDEF tenders are outstanding at any one time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>



In  other words, as of today, there are 50 or more tenders which

are  currently open.  The tender periods for the different types

of  tenders range from three weeks to four months, depending  on

the  complexity  of  the requirements.   But  as  tenderers  are

allowed to submit their offers any time before the closing date,

it  is  possible  for  MINDEF to receive offers  from  different

tenderers at any one time.  It is not practical to set aside one

box  for each tender.  MINDEF therefore sets aside eight  tender

boxes and, as far as possible, tries to consolidate tenders with

similar closing dates over a two-week period in the same  tender

box.   Otherwise, if we have 50 or more boxes and tenderers  put

their tender documents in the wrong box, it will result in a lot

of confusion and unnecessary extra work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders submitted more than two weeks before the closing

date  are also allowed to be submitted into the eight boxes that

we   have   kept  open.   Hence,  when  the  boxes  are   opened

periodically  to  take out tenders which have closed,  the  same

boxes  may  contain other tenders which have not  closed.   This

practice, admittedly, was not consistent with the provisions  in

the  Instruction Manual.  The Auditor-General has  pointed  this

out.  MINDEF raised this matter with the Ministry of Finance and

the  Ministry  of  Finance has recognised the problem  faced  by

MINDEF.   It has subsequently agreed to allow MINDEF to continue

with the current practice.  Meanwhile, MINDEF will explore other

ways to improve the practice further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said that there were 13 late tenders which were

considered  after  the tender dates have  closed.  That  is  not

correct.   The  point at issue here is that  none  of  the  late

offers  were  accepted.  But it does not serve the  Government's

interest to completely disregard the late offers and not look at

them when they can be used to evaluate the reasonableness of the

valid offer.  Following the Auditor-General's Report, MINDEF has

consulted  the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry  has  agreed

that  there is no reason to return late offers to the tenderers.

The revised Instruction Manual now allows the procurement agency

to retain late offers for reference, but it still requires the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



purchasing agency to inform the supplier concerned that his late

offer is not valid and will not be considered for award.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the location of the fax machines, tenderers are advised

in the documents that if they want to send their tenders by fax,

it  is  at  their  own risk.  Nevertheless, in MINDEF,  the  fax

machines are always located in restricted areas, for example, in

the  registry  or  in  the tender office, and  access  to  these

machines is tightly controlled and has been further tightened so

that  the office would not be left unattended and will be locked

at  all times.  In addition, we have implemented a system  which

electronically  directs the faxes coming  in  to  the  recipient

through  an e-mail system, thereby reducing the risk of exposure

inherent  in the manual way of delivering faxes to the  desk  of

the recipient.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, how about the question of $630,000

which was offered by the tenderer after negotiation and was  not

deducted in the main contract?

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, I am aware of this case. After

an  investigation it was found that there was a mistake made  by

the  officer concerned and the supplier was asked to refund that

$630,000.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification. How

was  the  mistake made?  Apparently, MINDEF negotiated with  the

contractor  and a discount was offered. Why was this  offer  not

reflected in the contract awarded, in terms of the amount?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I do not think that MINDEF has given any

assurance  that  a  tender box should not be opened  before  the

tender  is  closed.   Should  MINDEF  not  have  any  innovative

solution,  instead of saying that the Ministry  of  Finance  has

allowed  them  to  carry  on with the practice  because  of  the

current situation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, regarding the $630,000, it was

not captured in the original tender document and therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



there was a discrepancy.  Later on, this was pointed out and the

money had been recovered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the tender boxes are concerned, the issue is not

whether  the tender boxes remain open or closed.  The  issue  is

whether  every  tender that comes in is properly kept,  properly

registered,  and not opened before the proper time.   And  under

the  system as it exists, when the tender boxes are opened,  all

the tenders which are meant to be opened or due for opening will

be set aside and given to the officers in charge for processing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender documents for other tenders which are not due for

opening are then properly registered in a register and put  back

into  the box.  And this procedure is properly witnessed so that

nobody can claim later on that he has submitted a tender and  it

is  not  in  the box or that the box was opened and  the  tender

document was taken away.  Nor somebody can claim that he put the

document in the box before the time was up when actually he  did

so after the period had closed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the issue is not whether the box is opened or closed.

The  issue  is whether every document that comes in is  properly

registered and properly processed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Further clarification, Sir. The

Minister  of State mentioned that the $630,000 was not  captured

in  the  original contract.  That, I think, is understood.   But

how did, after the negotiation was done, the contractor agree to

the  deduction and why was it not communicated and deducted from

the  contract sum?  And even at the payment stage, I  understand

the  sum of $630,000 was paid to the contractor.  Why was it so?

How did it happen?

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, it was a mistake by the

Department  and  the  money  was  correctly  pointed  out  as  a

discrepancy  by  the  Auditor-General and  we  have  since  then

recovered the money, and we would tighten the system so that  it

does not happen again.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head T - Ministry of Law. Amendment No.

(1), Mr Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, at the last Parliament meeting, we amended

the  Films Act, as a result of changes in technology.  Now,  the

Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has also implemented the e-filing  system  or electronic filing system for those  who  file

their  income  tax  returns through  the  Internet.   Sir,  such

electronic   filing  with  modern  technology   raises   several

questions.  For example, the integrity of the electronic system,

what  is  the  liability for wrong filing, and what  happens  if

there  is  a fraudulent filing by somebody on behalf of  another

taxpayer.   Where  is  the applicable law  when  filing  through

electronic means, through the Internet, which can be done from a

point outside Singapore? The source of the filing may not be  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many questions related to this issue, as

technology is in fact moving at a much faster pace than what  we

all  can  imagine.  The question really is this: do we  need  to

update  our laws more regularly, and which other areas  the  law

need  to  be  updated?  May I ask the Minister that  perhaps  he

should  look into the setting up of a Review Committee,  and  to

include   technical  consultants  or  experts  in  this   Review

Committee,  to  review laws that need to be  amended  so  as  to

ensure  that  we are up to date.  Having a Committee  will  also

enable some form of uniformity of the law because we do not want

to  have the same set of laws on different issues with different

penalties, if they are for the same offence, for example.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister consider setting up a Law Review

Committee  to make sure that our laws will be reviewed  in  line

with technological changes?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, our legal

system  is  much respected and admired.  It is due in  no  small

part  to the various institutions that make up the system -  our

Judiciary, Legal Service and the professions.  Our laws too have

been   much  admired.   We  have  had  many  visits  from  legal

professionals in the region who are interested in our  laws  and

our  legal system.  We are looked upon as a country where  every

law  is  thought through carefully, where once it is enacted  is

enforced.   These  visitors will probably be surprised  to  hear

that  currently our law reform is not centralised.  We have  the

Singapore Academy of Law Committee on Law Reform that  has  done

an  excellent  job  in specific cases.  We  have  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers'  Legislation  Division,  and  we  have  the

various Ministries each proposing laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be time to take a more holistic view to law reform.

We may also need to speed up reforms of the law in relation to a

number  of  areas.   We need to keep up with the  fast  pace  of

change,  for  example, in areas of cyber laws.  We need  studies

also  to  be  made in relation to a number of legal institutions

such  as  sentencing  policies.  I am sure that  they  are  done

currently  by  a number of agencies, but that is  precisely  the

point  why  we need to have a Law Reform agency capable  of  and

able  to  respond  quickly  and  a singleness  of  mind  to  the

business  of  coming up with modern and well  thought-out  laws.

The  time  surely  has  come  to think  of  a  full-time  agency

dedicated  to  law  reform.   Such an  agency  can  be  used  to

recommend and draft new laws and to study the impact of existing

laws  to see whether they are working well and, if not, how they

can be improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can think of at least three areas where such an agency

may  help.  Firstly, in the area of substantive law, there  need

to  be  more  coordinated  efforts, for  example,  in  the  laws

relating  to the media, especially electronic media, integrating

intellectual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>



property  laws,  and laws relating to electronic  commerce.   In

procedural  law,  the  time  has  really  come  to  review   the

antiquated  codes of procedure evidence, such  as  the  Criminal

Procedure Code and the Evidence Act.  In legal institutions,  we

need  studies done, for example, on the operation of the various

new   ways   of  dispute  settlement,  such  as  mediation   and

conciliation,   on  the  relationship  between   mediation   and

adjudication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in today's modern societies and fast paced economies,

we may need to have an efficient and effective law reform agency

that  can not only keep pace with developments but enable us  to

plan ahead.  That is part and parcel of being Singapore.  And  I

hope that in the not too distant future, we can have this agency

to  help  make  the  legal system even  much  more  admired  and

respected.

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Sir, many small businesses

are  heavily  dependent  on trade with regional  countries.   In

today's  economic climate, many are stuck with inventories  they

cannot  sell and debts they cannot collect. I am told  that  the

number of bankruptcies in 1997 has risen some 30% compared  with

the year before.  No doubt this number is likely to increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These business failures bring with them some unexpected

problems.   Recently,  for  example,  I  was  approached  by   a

businessman  who  had  left the running  of  a  company  to  his

business  partner.   His business partner  disappeared  together

with  all the books and business records.  As the only remaining

director, he is now responsible for the company but is unable to

file any reports or conduct any business.  He does not know  who

his  debtors  or creditors are, who has paid, or  who  has  been

paid.   He  is  afraid  that  the  Registry  of  Companies   and

Businesses  (RCB)  would impose a fine on  him  for  failing  to

submit  his annual accounts.  But at the same time, he does  not

want to wind up the company for fear that he may be disqualified

from  being a director of another company he owns.   And  if  he

does nothing, he may still become disqualified



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>



on the grounds that he has repeatedly been fined by the RCB.   I

am  told  by fellow MPs that they have encountered other similar

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws which govern business failures and the obligations

of  directors  are  not  confined to just  one  Statute  or  one

Ministry.   To  the small businessmen, they can be very  complex

and complicated.  Not knowing exactly what they are required  to

do by law in such circumstances adds considerable anxiety to the

anxiety  of  businesses  which  are  already  in  trouble.   And

hurrying lawyers to figure out a particular situation is  costly

at a time when they are trying to conserve cash.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest three measures for the Ministry to

consider  to help in this particular time.  Firstly, I hope  the

Ministry  of  Law  would be alert to such problems  and  unusual

situations  as  the  years  wear on.   The  Ministry  should  be

proactive  and  prod  further when early and  unusual  signs  of

distress  are  seen.  We should take the lead  to  coordinate  a

thorough  response to deal with the situation,  especially  when

the rules and regulations cut across a number of Ministries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where appropriate, the Ministry could perhaps

issue  guidelines for small businesses on how to deal  with  the

unusual  situations  such as the one I have  described  earlier.

This would save businessmen a lot of time and costs figuring out

what to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also hope that in situations when businessmen

are  caught  through  no fault of their  own  by  the  technical

requirements  of  the  law,  the Ministry  would  adopt  a  more

sympathetic   interpretation   of   the   rules   or    initiate

modifications to the relevant laws to help the businessmen cope.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Bankruptcy Act was amended last

year  to  raise the limit by which bankrupts may be  discharged.

In  view  of the fact that the economy, because of the  regional

currency  crisis, is due to slow down, there is likelihood  that

there  will  be  more  bankruptcies.  As my colleague  has  just

mentioned, bankruptcies have gone up by 30% last year.   I  want

to ask the Minister,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>



in  view  of  the  changes in the Bankruptcy Act  and  that  the

economy  may  go  through a more difficult period,  whether  the

Official  Assignee  and  Public Trustee  (OAPT)  has  sufficient

manpower  to cope with the workload to make sure that those  who

are  in  need  of  help  to be discharged  will  be  discharged.

Perhaps  more  can  be done in this area  and  how  bad  is  the

situation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, may I take both cuts together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Much obliged, Sir. First, I will deal

with  the  Official Assignee and Public Trustee.  The Office  of

Public  Trustee is a very important legal office.   The  present

holder  of the office, Dr Chandra Mohan, besides being a  Public

Trustee  and  Official Assignee, also acts as the  Registrar  of

Moneylenders,   Commissioner   for   Charities,   Registrar   of

Pawnbrokers,  amongst other things.  He administers  all  monies

collected  under  road  accident cases.   As  the  Registrar  of

Pawnbrokers, he has reorganised the auction of pawned goods  for

the  benefit of the public.  There is greater transparency  now.

In  fact, the public has benefited.  The public is getting  more

out  of  these auctions.  I commend him and his men for doing  a

fine job.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another area which I would like the Minister to

consider,  and  that is, the Office of the Public Trustee.  With

growing affluence, more people are leaving properties behind and

we  should  consider increasing the jurisdiction of  the  Public

Trustee.  As Members may be aware, the Public Trustee is allowed

under  the  Act  to administer estate with a certain  limit.   I

think  it will be beneficial to the community at large  if  this

was increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Sir, we should think of corporatisation of this

aspect  of  the  Public Trustee.  When I visited Australia,  the

State of New South Wales has got this and it offers its service,

as lawyers do, to administer estates.  Sir, I am suggesting this

because in normal cases, the court takes about six months to get

the proper documents for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>



administration.   The  Public Trustee  takes  a  shorter  period

because  he  does not have to go to court and I would  urge  the

Minister, for the benefit of our people, to look afresh  at  the

legislation and amend it, if necessary,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to commend the Public Trustee because,

from  time  to  time,  whenever lawyers,  and  I  myself,  avail

themselves  of  the service, and we feel that clients  would  be

better  served  by  the Public Trustee, the Public  Trustee  has

unstintingly  obliged and has done a good  job.   I  think  this

House should be aware of this fact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be permitted to move to land titles, Sir. When the

British  started the settlement of Singapore,  we  had  what  we

lawyers  call "common law titles".  Sir, I would at  this  stage

like  to  declare  my  interest.  I am the owner  of  a  private

property and I have made an application for conversion  of  this

property to land title.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the common law title started, and many Members

who  have  bought properties would have known each  document  is

added  after  each transfer and it becomes very  cumbersome  and

difficult.  Sometimes it is difficult even for lawyers  to  read

one title from the other.  And rightly, the law was changed.  We

have what is called the Registry of Titles and they have done  a

good  job over the years.  I stand corrected, but I think  there

is  a plan to have all of Singapore under the title deeds.  I am

concerned,  and feel perhaps the Minister may want to  enlighten

the  House  as  to how long it would take before  the  whole  of

Singapore is governed by this Torrens system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we are moving very fast and the Registry has

now  been computerised.  I think Members and the public will  be

interested  to  know when the Land Titles Registry  expects   to

convert the common law title to that of land titles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be in the interest of Singapore lawyers as

well  as the business community and property developers to  have

the entire Singapore under this title deed as soon as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, it is known

by  now  that  the  property market in Singapore  is  bad.   The

chances  are  property  prices will continue  to  fall  further.

Quite  a  few  property developers had halted their construction

projects.  If the situation persists, it is not unimaginable for

some property developers to go under and the bank will take over

their building and land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under such circumstances, the professionals, the

builders,  the suppliers and the workers working on the  project

will suffer greatly.  And this is because under our current law,

it is stated that whatever sits on the land belongs to the land.

If  the  land  has  been mortgaged to the  bank,  then  whatever

contribution that the builders, the professionals, the suppliers

and  the workers had made during their building process will  go

with  the  land.  The CPF of course has the first  charge.   The

residual  amount would be first taken by the lending  bank  with

whatever remaining distributed to other creditors, such  as  the

suppliers, professionals, builders and workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unusual for an ailing developer to slow or stop

payment to the builder months ahead of their collapse.  Hence, a

lot  of  values,  contributed  by the  professionals,  builders,

suppliers, workers, etc. are not paid for and yet they are taken

away by the bank.  What makes it worse is that under the law the

builder  has no statutory right to stop work even if it  is  not

paid.   Therefore, it is very inequitable under the present  law

to  protect the banks and not the others who by right should  be

given  a  lien  on  the property or on the  project  account  to

protect their interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to cite the UK practice on statutory right to

suspend work.  In 1996, they enacted a law to give builders  the

statutory  right  to  suspend work in the event  of  non-payment

under   section   113   of  Housing  Grants  (Construction   and

Regeneration)  Act  1996.  That means a  contractor  can,  after

giving   seven   days'  notice,  suspend  performance   of   its

obligations  for  non-payment.   There  is  also  provision  for

automatic time extension for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>



completion for the period during which their employer remains in

default of his payment obligation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to study this biased

and  unfair practice and provide an equitable protection to  the

parties involved in the building process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the Legal Aid

Department  is  providing an invaluable  service  to  those  who

cannot  afford to seek help from the private lawyers.   However,

due  to  the educational background of those who seek assistance

plus  the  fact that most speak only dialects or mother  tongue,

such  as  Malay  and Tamil, sometimes there may be  problems  in

communication  between the officers and the  clients.   Although

the Department does provide translators, but because legal cases

often involve legal terminology, many have complained that  they

could  not quite follow what has transpired between the  various

parties  involved, especially when they receive official letters

in English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common problem is that after they have received the

court  ruling,  the  officer involved often  consider  the  case

closed.   However, there may be follow-up action  to  be  taken.

For  example,  a  divorcee may have problems in  collecting  the

maintenance or receiving the proceeds after the common  property

has  been  sold.  They are often at a loss as to what to  do  as

they  would  be told that as far as the Legal Aid Department  is

concerned, they have obtained the court ruling and the  case  is

considered closed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to request the Minister to look into

these two problems, and perhaps assign more bilingual lawyers to

the  Department and alert the translators to be more patient and

take  greater care in explaining every detail to the users.   As

for follow-up action, the officers can explain to those who seek

their  help that they will be attended to even after  the  court

ruling and that they will be provided with continuous assistance

should they encounter any further problems.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to request the Minister to look into the

existing  $800 ceiling for anyone who is qualified to seek  help

from the Legal Aid Department.  For example, a wife with two  or

three kids and earning around $1,000 wants to seek legal aid for

whatever reason will never be able to afford to engage a  lawyer

from  the private practice.  Nor can a breadwinner with a family

earning the same amount and who encounter any legal problems  do

the  same.   They  would  have  no  option  but  to  seek  legal

assistance from the Legal Aid Department.  Therefore, I  suggest

that  certain  flexibilities be exercised  to  deal  with  these

cases.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.40 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, my subject is how we treat or deal

with those members of our community who fall foul of the law and

have  to  be  dealt with.  And of course, I am speaking  of  our

sentencing  policy in Singapore.  Under our present  provisions,

there  is an increasing number of offences which carry mandatory

sentences that are determined by the legislature.  I can see the

need  for a mandatory minimum sentence in some cases.  But  this

should  be  left or kept to a minimum.  For one thing, mandatory

sentences  take  away  the  function  of  the  Judiciary   whose

functions it is to determine what the proper sentence is.  So  I

would  urge  the Ministry to consider whether they  are  perhaps

going  over  board in trying to provide mandatory sentences  for

very  many offences.  But a more particular concern of  mine  is

the  sentence of caning that is now being inflicted on  a  great

number  of  our  offenders and even where  they  have  committed

offences of which violence was not a major part or even a  minor

part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mankind has come a long way from the time when it treated

its  prisoners inhumanely and cruelly.  There was  a  time  when

they were put on the rack.  There was a time when they were made

to do hard labour and we even had hard labour in our laws at one

time.   But  as I said, we have moved on.  And it has been  said

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>



one  indicia of a civilised society is to see how it treats

its prisoners and people who have fallen foul of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caning that we carry out, as I am sure everyone knows,

is  not  the  caning that is carried out in schools or  even  in

boys'  institutions where boys are kept.  This  caning  that  is

carried  out in the prisons is designed to inflict as much  hurt

as  possible upon the individual and to leave scars.   This  has

been acknowledged as being the aim of the caning sentence.   May

I say, Sir, it brutalises the society to see that caning of this

nature is one of the policies of the Government.  Advocates  who

are  urging the abolition of the death sentence have called  the

death  sentence "state murder".  Similarly, this  imposition  of

caning  by  the  state may be characterised as "state  violence"

upon the individual.  As I said, it brutalises our citizens.  It

lowers  their resistance to resorting to violence in  their  own

relationships with others.  And I did not inform the House  that

under  the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and  under

the  covenants,  caning  is  not encouraged  or  is  prohibited.

Governments are urged not to resort to caning or to any  violent

punishment.  And indeed the European Court of Human  Rights  has

taken it much further.  It has declared corporal punishment, not

only of persons who fall foul of the law but even of schoolboys,

illegal as it violates the human rights of the child or person.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said in a number of other things, there should be

greater public awareness of what should our policy be on caning.

I  think  it is time that we moved on and not stick to  the  old

idea  of  punishment, but to see whether our present  system  of

punishment is fit for a civilised society and whether it  serves

the  purpose.  I hope the Ministry will take steps  to  initiate

public discussion among our citizens on the punishments that are

being  carried  out,  because it is  very  much  a  matter  that

concerns our people.  If that is not possible, will the Ministry

consider  setting up a committee to study the whole question  of

sentencing  policy that we adopt in this country? It  is  not  a

matter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>



that should be just left to one or two Ministers or even to  the

Cabinet.  It is a matter on which the public should state  their

views and a national policy on sentencing reached.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, Singapore, in recent

years,  has  been introducing new methods of dispute settlement.

These  have  gained much attention, acceptance and  favour.   In

particular,  the  setting  up of the first  Community  Mediation

Centre  was  well received.  Residents now have  recourse  to  a

Centre  where they can settle disputes among themselves  instead

of complaining or quarrelling  or calling for the police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how well this centre has

operated.   Has  there been a good response among the  residents

and  grassroots leaders towards this centre?  In particular, how

has the Centre coped with the disputes sent to it, whether these

disputes  have been settled amicably and what lessons have  been

learned from its operations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in relation to the recruitment of mediators, last

year,  I  spoke about the need to involve the grassroots leaders

in  the  mediation process in any neighbour dispute.   I  should

like  to  know  whether action has been taken  to  involve  more

grassroots  leaders  in the mediation process.   Are  there  any

facilities set up to train such mediators?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days of economic stringency, I am concerned that

the  mediation programme may be  set back.  I would like to  ask

the Minister whether there will be more centres in the pipeline,

especially as mediation is now growing in importance, and social

disputes are becoming more in number when economic circumstances

are less favourable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from community mediation, I understand that there has

also been mediation undertaken by the Singapore Mediation Centre

set up by the Academy of Law for commercial disputes.  I am sure

this  is most welcome as parties who contract, of course, intend

their contracts to be kept and that they should remain in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>



the   business  relationship.   Going  to  trial  usually  sours

relations and adds to transactional cost.  I hope that gradually

parties going to courts for relief will consider mediation as  a

precursor to any court action that they may wish to pursue.   At

the  moment, it seems that mediation is an unfamiliar method  of

dispute  settlement.  I wonder whether more  could  be  done  to

promote  this  method before parties take on the  more  familiar

route of fighting it out in the courts.  Litigants will need  to

understand that mediation is, in most instances, a better way of

resolving   disputes  than  adjudication.   Will  the   Minister

consider ways in which the mediation process can be promoted  at

all  levels of society, between neighbours, between businessmen,

indeed between Government agencies and the people?

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, responding

to the various comments that have been made, may I start with Mr

Chng Hee Kok and Prof. Chin Tet Yung's remarks on law reform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, let me say that different countries have diverse

approaches to the way in which they undertake law reform.   Some

countries  have  more than one instrument of law  reform.   Some

have,  as  Prof. Chin has said, a centralised body to  undertake

law  reform.  Whatever the approaches, I think we can agree that

law reform is important in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By law reform, we need to be clear what we mean. It

includes,  first, the updating of laws, to make sure  that  they

are   not  out  of  tune  with  latest  developments  in   other

jurisdictions.  It also means examination of the laws to  ensure

that modern problems, previously not anticipated, are adequately

dealt  with under our laws  information technology, the  example

that he mentioned is a good illustration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Prof. Chin is right that we do not have a

centralised  body.   What is the present  system?   Our  present

system is that there is a Law Reform Committee under the Academy

of  Law.   The  Committee has inputs from the Attorney-General's

Chambers  as well as the Ministry of Law.  The Ministry  of  Law

acts, in effect, as a coordinating body, whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>



there are consultations needed with other Ministries or economic

agencies, such as EDB, TDB and other agencies.  The Ministry  of

Law,  on  its own, also initiates and embarks on law review  and

law reform processes.  A good example is the recent exercise  on

intellectual   property  rights  where  we   introduced   fairly

comprehensive amendments to the Copyright Act.  And there is  an

on-going  exercise  to review trade marks,  industrial  designs,

integrated circuits and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the future, while we may not immediately proceed to one

centralised agency, I can assure both Mr Chng and Prof. Chin Tet

Yung  that  the  Ministry of Law, together  with  the  Attorney-General,  will set up a special unit to coordinate  and  promote

law  reform and law review at the national level.  Such  a  unit

will   work   closely  with  relevant  agencies  in  the   legal

fraternity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the areas that such a unit might usefully focus

on?   I  can  think of three areas which should  have  priority.

First,  the  full range of intellectual property laws  and  laws

concerning  information technology.  This includes some  of  the

points  that have been made by Prof. Chin and Mr  Chng Hee  Kok.

This would also include laws that support the development of the

emerging sciences in the medical field and biotechnology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is to study, together with the economic

agencies,  what  changes have to be made to legislation  in  the

fields  of  business, banking, finance and  commerce.   In  this

regard, I think we should realise that law reform is not just an

academic  exercise.  We should view laws, the legal institutions

and  legal procedures as an important infrastructure to  support

our  overall objective of establishing ourselves as a  financial

and commercial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been spoken about the need to be competitive in

these  areas.  In that context of being competitive,  laws,  the

effectiveness of legal procedures and legal institutions must be

considered  as part and parcel of the infrastructure to  support

our commercial competitiveness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will consult relevant agencies on what should be done

to  update  and make changes to laws such as the Companies  Act,

Trustees  Act,  Bankruptcy Act, Bill  of  Sales  Act  and  other

current laws in the areas of banking and securities.  Therefore,

the aim of the Ministry of Law in setting up this unit is to  be

able to support economic Ministries like the Ministry of Finance

and  the Ministry of Trade and Industry, to ensure that our laws

keep in pace with changes which are vital to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the third area where we will work closely

with   other   Ministries  such  as  Home   Affairs,   Community

Development  and  Health is to review laws to improve  community

relations  and to increase social peace and security.   In  this

area,  we  will  continue to evolve our  own  laws  on  ADR  and

mediation,  which  will be touched on in greater  detail  by  my

colleague,  the Minister of State.  What I should  emphasise  is

that  whatever  method we have to review our laws  and  whatever

instrument  we  have for law reform, it cannot be  done  by  one

agency  acting alone.  It has to tap available resources in  the

Academy of Law, the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Law Society

and,  of  course, the academic talents and brains that exist  in

the University of Singapore's Law Faculty.  In this way, I think

we  can ensure that our laws keep in pace with the rapid changes

that  are  taking  place both in Singapore  and  in  the  global

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the specific points that have been raised by Mr Chng

Hee  Kok  and Prof. Chin, let me say that the Attorney-General's

Chambers currently chairs a committee which examines the  legal,

regulatory   and   enforcement  issues  concerning   information

technology  and electronic processes.  Actually, we are  already

looking  at  a  number of draft legislation,  including  one  on

electronic  transactions which will regulate digital signatures,

a  point  which  Mr Chng Hee Kok alluded to when  he  asked  for

safeguards in the context of IRAS' latest requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments may also have to be made to the Computer Misuse

Act, the Rules of Court and other existing intellectual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>



property  legislation, and we will do so in  close  consultation

with agencies like the NCB, MTI and MHA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the reply to Prof. Chin's point, the

Attorney-General's Chambers are looking into the review  of  the

Criminal  Procedure  Code  to  streamline  and  update  criminal

procedure and police powers, to review also the Penal  Code,  to

update penalties and to modernise code.   And, if I may say  so,

we  are also looking at various aspects of the Evidence Act  and

the  Criminal Procedure Code to examine, for example, the  scope

of the hearsay rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, on law reform, it is under control. It may not

be  exactly  in  the  shape and form that  Prof.  Chin  wants  a

centralised  agency,  but  we  have  to  constantly  review  the

mechanism.   What is important is to ensure that the law  reform

actually does take place.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David Lim, and related points were made by Mr Chng Hee

Kok, touched on the plight of directors who find themselves in a

situation where they are the remaining directors and may have to

comply  with  obligations to file the statement of  affairs.   I

will  focus really on the role of the Official Receiver and  the

duties of the Official Assignee and Public Trustee's Office.  He

wants  us  to be sympathetic and I take note of his point.   But

let me also say that obviously each case has to be considered on

its own merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to balance the difficulties and plight of

inactive  directors  with  the loss suffered  by  creditors  and

investors of those wound-up companies whom the law is duty bound

to  protect.   Because when one becomes a director,  say,  as  a

favour  to a sibling or friend, he must be aware that there  are

certain responsibilities.  There is a duty towards a company and

one  is  accountable for its affairs.  The statement of  affairs

which a director of a wound-up company is required to file  with

the  Official  Receiver  is  an important  document  because  it

enables the Official Receiver to inquire



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>



into  the extent of a company's assets and liabilities.  In  the

past, it is a fact that the Official Receiver faced considerable

difficulties  in  getting directors to  file  the  statement  of

affairs.   The situation improved after 1993 when  a  number  of

them  were  convicted in court and fined.  But fewer  and  fewer

summonses are now issued against company directors.  I  am  told

there  were 56 in 1992, 38 in 1995 and 31 in 1997.   I  am  also

told that to-date, no director has been disqualified because  of

convictions or failure to file his statement of affairs.  Let me

also  add  that  before  the Official  Receiver  applies  for  a

summons,  at  least  three  reminders are  sent  and  extensions

granted to him to submit the statement of affairs.  The Official

Receiver also gives guidance and advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chng Hee Kok's question, let me say that in 1997,

there  were 1,694 new bankruptcies as compared to 1,252 in 1996,

which   represents  some  35%  increase.   But  in  an  economic

downturn,  it  is not unexpected.  From our viewpoint,  what  is

important is that the bankrupts have the opportunity to get  out

of  bankruptcy  as  quickly  as possible.   This  is  where  the

Official Assignee comes in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the impression is given that the Official Assignee

does not have in mind the plight of the individuals concerned, I

should  remind the House that in fact it was due to the Official

Assignee's initiative that we amended the law in  September last

year  to  enable bankrupts who have been in bankruptcy for  more

than  five  years  and  with debts  of  up  to  $250,000  to  be

discharged  by  certification of the Official Assignee.   Before

the  amendment, the ceiling was $100,000.  The point I am making

is  that  following the amendments to the law, a  large  number,

some  6,500  bankrupts,  became eligible for  consideration  for

discharge.   In fact, 3,400 bankrupts, or 52%, have already been

discharged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the high volume of bankrupts, the bankruptcy

clearance  rate, ie, the number of cases discharged compared  to

the  number  of  new  cases  rose to  a  record  high  of  161%.

Creditors  too have had their interests served receiving  record

dividend payments of $30.7 million in 1997, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>



was  29% higher than what was received in 1996.  So the Official

Assignee, through laws and through the administration, has tried

to   serve  both  the  interest  of  individual  bankrupts,  not

forgetting  the interest of the creditors, which are two  duties

that he has to bear in mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked about increasing the jurisdiction.

We  have to examine what has happened in other countries and see

whether it is appropriate for our own system.  I would say  that

comment  also  applies  to  his suggestion  for  corporatisation

because  the  Official Assignee and Public Trustee's  Office  is

already  an autonomous agency since 1st August 1997.   This  has

enabled  it  to  manage  its  resources  more  effectively   and

efficiently.   Whether  we  should  go  one  step  further   and

corporatise  it, I do not rule it out, but I would say  we  will

have  it  under  review and take that step if  and  when  it  is

absolutely necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chuang Shaw Peng's question, I hope he would

understand that I will not be able to give a very specific reply

to  his point at this stage because it is a matter that I  would

have  to  consult  with  other agencies  like  the  Ministry  of

National Development, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and so

on.   After  getting  the necessary inputs from  them,  we  will

respond to Mr Chuang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding is that the position in the United Kingdom

is  pretty  much  the  same as in Singapore  on  the  rights  of

mortgagees of land, ie, builders have no special lien in respect

of  materials they provide for the construction of the building.

But  he has referred to certain specific subsidiary legislation.

I have taken note of it and we will look into that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen talked about legal aid. He has made three

points.  One is about the problem of translation.  Let me assure

him  that  in my discussions with the Director of Legal  Aid,  I

have been assured that they have adequate translators, but I  do

take  note  of his point that if it is not sufficient we  should

ensure that whatever resources are necessary are made available.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two more substantive points were the closure of files.

I  must assure him and the House that it is not true that once a

decree  nisi  is obtained the file is closed.  On the  contrary.

The Bureau informs the applicant of the progress of the case and

the  file  is  not closed till the decree absolute is  obtained.

When  an  order  of court on ancillary issues  is  obtained,  an

applicant faces problems.  For example, with regard to  division

of  matrimonial property, the Bureau still advises  and  assists

the individual to deal with these problems and will continue  to

do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the means test, let me also assure the Member that

the  income  ceiling was increased only two years ago.   But  we

should  not  look  just at the increase in  the  income  ceiling

because, in addition to the quantum and the deductions which are

made  for  HDB flat or CPF and so on, people who have more  than

the  income ceiling qualify for legal aid.  In fact, the present

system  is that nearly 80% of those who apply for legal  aid  do

qualify  for  legal  aid.  I think that is not  an  unimpressive

figure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will stop here to enable the Minister of State to

respond to the other two questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister a clarification?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, there is very little time

left.  Can you allow the Minister of State to reply first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is just a question. But it is all right.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Let  me  reply  to Mr Jeyaretnam.  Mr Jeyaretnam  shows  concern

about  our  tough punishment regime, focusing in  particular  on

mandatory minimum sentences and caning.  Sir, first, let me  say

that  our tough stand against crime and all those who perpetrate

it is well known.  Deterrence is a key pillar of our tough penal

regime.  This has resulted in Singapore being a safe city,  well

known  around the world and as a place where even ladies can  be

out  at  night.  In 1997, we enjoyed the lowest crime rates  for

nine years.  This approach



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>



has  worked  well for Singapore.  Having said this, let  me  add

that imprisonment and caning are not the only punishment options

available  here.  As a lawyer, Mr Jeyaretnam will know  that  in

our  law  books there are also other options that are available,

such  as  granting of probation to juveniles and even to adults,

mandating payment of compensation by the offender to the victim,

suspension  of  licences and even making  the  offender  perform

Corrective  Work Orders.  In other words, there is  a  range  of

punishment  which  is  available to the  courts  to  choose  the

punishment that fits the crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus on Mr Jeyaretnam's two concerns. His first

concern is minimum mandatory sentences.  Mr Jeyaretnam should be

assured  that we do not use it willy-nilly.  Indeed, we  use  it

quite sparingly.  In the Penal Code, for example, there are only

about  25  out  of  the 230-odd offences there  that  have  this

minimum mandatory requirement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> There are other Acts.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> But it is mainly in the Penal

Code.    These  are  all  serious  offences:  aggravated   rape,

aggravated  extortion, aggravated molest.  In other words,  when

we have minimum mandatory sentences, it is sending a signal that

these  are serious offences and they should not be trifled with.

Anyone who perpetrates the offence will be dealt with in a tough

way.   Again, as I said, it has played a part in helping to keep

Singapore safe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time the Penal Code was amended in a relatively

bigger  way  to incorporate mandatory minimum sentences  was  in

1984.   In  fact,  I was reading the Hansard  just  now  and  Mr

Jeyaretnam  also participated in the debate.  That  was  already

some  time ago.  Having said this, minimum mandatory sentencing,

quite  contrary to what Mr Jeyaretnam says, does not remove  the

court's  discretion  entirely.  Because beyond  that,  there  is

still  a  maximum  tariff and the court can still  decide    the

sentence to fit the crime.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern of Mr Jeyaretnam is caning. All of us

know  that  caning  is  indeed  an  effective  deterrent.   Even

hardened  criminals  fear  caning.  We  know  this  because,  as

Members  know,  the  Ministry of Home  Affairs  is  planning  to

toughen  the  drug regime to have caning for hard core  addicts.

Our agencies on the ground tell us that this already has had  an

effect on the ground, both anecdotal as well as in numbers.   So

the  point  to note is, what works.  Again, here we do  not  use

caning  willy-nilly.  It is carefully considered whether  caning

is  required,  looking  at the nature of  the  offence  and  the

incidence of occurrence and then caning as an option is put into

the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about other jurisdictions like Europe

and  other places.  In terms of penal philosophy, every  society

has  to decide for itself.  What are the punishments that should

be imposed?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what I am asking.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So I am saying that in the

Singapore context, this is what we have.  We decide what is best

for us and it works.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Can we have a public discussion? That is

what I am asking.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> We are thinking about it all the

time.  The Ministry of Law together with the other Ministries is

always  looking  at  ways  in which  our  legal  system  can  be

improved.  Just now, we heard praises from various Members here.

Assoc.  Prof.  Chin talked about international  praise  for  our

legal  and  judicial  systems and our  laws.   Mr  Kenneth  Chen

praised  the Legal Aid Bureau.   Mr Rai praised the OAPT.   That

is  the mindset that we have.  So we are continually looking  at

how  our  legal  system,  including  our  punishments,  can   be

improved.   This is not something that is cast in  stone.   They

can evolve over time.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. "Guillotine" time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head E of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I have your permission to take the three cuts

together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, we have the most independent,

honest  Judiciary that anyone can talk about in the world.   The

abolition  of the Privy Council has led to the establishment  of

our  own  Supreme Court.  When the Privy Council was  abolished,

there  were a lot of concerns.  I had spoken, in fact, to  Prof.

Jayakumar long before the abolition.  I appealed to him to  have

it  abolished,  and I am happy that after the abolition  of  the

Privy  Council, our Judiciary has come of age.  In fact,  it  is

due to our judicial system that one of the judgments, the famous

Pertamina  case,  that  was  heard  by  Justice  Lai  Kew  Chai,

disagreed with the Privy Council's earlier decision, and it  was

a  very  bold  decision, and the Privy Council was persuaded  by

Justice Lai's decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am suggesting to this House that we should look

afresh  at  our  judicial system especially.  In the  last  five

years,  the  Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts have  achieved

outstanding  results  and  it is to  the  credit  of  the  Chief

Justice,  the  Judges of the High Court, the Registrar  and  his

officials,  as well as the Subordinate Court Judges in  bringing

this  about.   The  Court  is  moving  from  a  long-established

adversarial system, which is the British practice, to one  which

is  keeping  with our Asian tradition - mediation,  conciliation

and  arbitration.  In fact, in the High Court of Singapore, less

and  less  cases go to trial.  Most cases get settled either  by

the court officials or through the intervention of the Singapore

Mediation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>



Centre  set  up  by  the  Singapore Academy  of  Law.   In  many

Commonwealth countries, Sir, the courts are crowded with  cases.

We are very fortunate.  We do not have such a situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the quorum of the Court of Appeal, as it is now, in

most cases, only three Judges sit on the Court of Appeal.  I  am

suggesting  to  the  Minister to consider whether  in  important

cases  - I know that from time to time we have five Judges,  but

that  is  very  rare  -  we could have five  Judges  sitting  in

important  cases,  whether it is criminal law or  constitutional

law.  In this way, Sir, we would have greater participation  and

I  think  the public interest will be served.  I have  discussed

this  matter with senior lawyers and they are supportive of this

move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to another area of concern, and I know I am

going  to touch on a very sensitive issue.  Drug offences, which

now  carry a capital offence, are heard in the High Court whilst

cases  which  carry  20 years' imprisonment  are  heard  in  the

District  Court.   I am suggesting that these  cases  should  be

transferred to a Special Court which could be headed  by  either

Senior District Judges or senior members of the Bar.  I say this

because  it  costs the public immense amounts of money  to  hear

these   cases.    And  after  all,  our  District   Judges   are

interpreting  the  law (Misuse of Drugs  Act)  every  day.   The

principle  of  law is the same.  Unlike murder and  treason  and

other  capital  cases which are heard in High Court,  crimes  of

passion, I call it, you have the mens rea, you have all sorts of

defences, and the Judges have to be experienced.  But I  see  no

reason why the law which is applied in the District Court cannot

be  applied to these cases.  For the benefit of Members, let  me

say  this.  I was in India recently.  In India, for a long time,

murder  cases are heard by District Judges, and a single  Judge.

I  think  this  is, of course, a very radical departure,  but  I

think we ought to look into it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area which I would like the Minister to consider,

Sir,  is this.  We have landlord/tenant cases and accident cases

still  being  heard by the High Court, although the jurisdiction

of the District Court has been increased considerably, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>



$250,000 now.  I think it would be better to have it transferred

to  the  District Court, as we have done in the case  of  family

law.  And I think family law is more important than landlord and

tenant cases.  I urge the Minister to consider this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is running short. Sir, I will just be very brief on

the subject of mediation, since Prof. Chin has touched on it.  I

would  like  to  urge  the Minister, in  private  summons  cases

involving neighbours and family members, we have a different set

of  hearing.   Instead of going to the court, let  us  create  a

Community  Tribunal,  and we could do justice.   Because  in  my

experience as a member of the Maintenance of Parents Tribunal, I

have  found it very conducive to have a hearing where no lawyers

are  involved, no press is involved.  And I think the  Community

Tribunal  could  be a proper forum to hear cases,  and  not  the

District  Court  where  the atmosphere is intimidating  and,  of

course, lawyers are always involved.  As a lawyer, I would  urge

the House and the Minister to reconsider the position and try to

use  mediation  even  on  small-scale  private  summonses  which

involve members of the same family as well as the public.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Rai has correctly

observed  that  our  courts  have been  proactive,  making  many

innovations  to improve the system whenever it has seen  a  need

for  such changes.  Here, in this House, Mr Rai has made several

suggestions for further changes.  The question is whether  there

is a need for these changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, he has suggested setting up Special District Courts

to  hear  certain types of cases, like drug cases, landlord  and

tenant  cases.   Presently, the District and  Magistrate  Courts

already   hear  all  these  cases,  except,  of  course,   those

punishable  by  death  for drug cases, and within  the  monetary

limit  of  $250,000 for the other cases that he  has  mentioned.

Some  are  heard  in  the High Court which,  I  understand,  the

waiting  period, in fact, is very short, just a few weeks.   And

the waiting periods are also constantly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>



monitored by the High Court.  So we feel that there is  no  need

to transfer everything to the Special District Courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The division of jurisdiction and cases between the High

Court  and  Subordinate Courts, in fact, has been  effective  in

adjudicating   these  matters  that  Mr  Rai   mentions.    Case

precedents  have been developed over a period of time  in  these

cases.   Mr  Rai mentions the Family District Court.  Indeed,  a

Special  Court  was  set up in the District  Court,  called  the

Family  District Court, and matters which were originally  heard

in  the  High  Court were transferred down.  But he would  agree

that  family  matters are quite different.  Family,  matrimonial

matters,  with its complexity involve not just legal issues  but

also social issues.  And indeed having a Special Court set up at

a District Court level has allowed the Court to be very creative

in  using  counselling  resources, community  resources  in  the

family justice process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion of Mr Rai is whether or not our Court

of  Appeal could have five Judges hearing the appeals.  In fact,

as  he himself has mentioned, currently under section 30 of  the

Supreme Court of Judicature Act, the provision is already  there

for  the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Court of  Appeal

to  be exercised by three or any greater uneven number of Judges

of  Appeal.  Appeals are generally heard by a three-Judge  Court

in  Singapore, which is adequate.  But there have been cases  in

the  past,  important  cases, where  the Chief  Justice  in  his

discretion  had constituted a five-man Court of Appeal  to  hear

such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the point is that there is no need really to

institutionalise  it,  because then you have  five  Judges,  and

resources are used up in a Court of Appeal hearing just appeals.

So  I  think the current position is good enough where you  have

this  flexibility reposed in the Chief Justice to  constitute  a

five-man Court of Appeal when the need arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that Mr Rai mentions is whether or not

criminal  matters  involving private  summons  and  other  minor

offences  should  not,  in fact, be mediated  at  the  community

level.  With the setting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



up  of  the  Community Mediation Centres, indeed this  is  being

done.   Because  there is one rule, under  the  CMC  Act,  which

spells out the powers of the Community Mediation Centres whereby

in  a suitable case, a Magistrate hearing a complaint of a minor

dispute  involving a criminal nature - it could  be  voluntarily

causing hurt or mischief - could ask the parties to go to a  CMC

to  settle the dispute, but, of course, with their consent.   So

the process is there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CMCs are fairly new. We have just set up our first

Community  Mediation Centre at Marine Parade, which  has  worked

well.   And  10  or so of such cases were, in a sense,  diverted

from  the  Magistrate  Courts to be heard before  the  Community

Mediation Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say a few words about the development of the CMC

which is something of interest to Mr Rai and also to Prof. Chin.

The first centre was set up in Marine Parade CDC in January.  We

are targeting to set up a second centre somewhere in the central

part  of Singapore, probably in the Ang Mo Kio/Cheng San CDC  to

be  operational  by the end of this year.  Thereafter,  we  will

assess. We plan to set up two more centres to serve the northern

and  western regions of Singapore, probably by the  end  of  the

year 2000.  So that is our game plan.  Four centres in the east,

central, north and west.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin talks about the need to have trained mediators.

In  fact, this is the heart of mediation, and much efforts  have

been  expended  by  the  Ministry of Law's  Alternative  Dispute

Resolution  Division in this matter.  As a  foundation,  a  core

group  of  trained  mediators has  been  assembled.   These  are

experienced  mediators who are lawyers and other  professionals,

as  well  as mediators from the Singapore Mediation Centre.   In

addition,  suitable grassroots leaders from diverse  backgrounds

have   been  assembled  and  trained.   They  include  a  school

principal, a retiree, a doctor and two managers.  So  this  core

group  is  the first group that will do mediation at the  Marine

Parade CDC, comprising about 30 in number.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first CMC at Marine Parade has made a good start. So

far, 14 cases have been successfully mediated, and 20 more cases

are  scheduled  to be mediated over the next  few  months.   And

feedback   from   residents  have  shown  they  appreciate   the

opportunity  they  now  have  to have  their  disputes  resolved

amicably  at  the  CMC.   So  as more  CMCs  are  set  up,  more

grassroots  leaders will be identified for  the  task.   As  you

know, the plan is to co-locate CMCs with Small Claims Tribunals.

So over time, Singaporeans will find convenient one-stop centres

where  they  can  have small claims as well  as  minor  disputes

settled at one location.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head B Attorney-General's Chambers. Mr

Jeyaretnam.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head B of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two amendments here. I propose to take them

together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But first I will deal with the second of

those  two  amendments, and that is, the accountability  of  the

Attorney-General  as Public Prosecutor.  I am sure  Members  are

aware  that  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  most  of  the  other

Commonwealth  countries, the Attorney-General  is  a  Member  of

Parliament.   He is appointed from Parliament upon  election  of

the  new government and he holds office for the duration of that

government.  That is not the situation in Singapore, although  I

stand corrected on this, I think the Constitution does allow for

someone from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>



the  elected Members to be appointed as Attorney-General and for

him to vacate his office upon the dissolution of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have an Attorney-General appointed outside

Parliament.   So  the Attorney-General is not in  Parliament  to

answer questions and any questions on his decisions are answered

at second hand by the Minister.  The Attorney-General, as Public

Prosecutor,   serves   a   very  important   function   in   the

administration  of  justice.  He is, no less  than  the  judges,

administering  justice  and ensuring that  justice  is  done  in

Singapore.   And he is therefore accountable in respect  of  his

decisions as Public Prosecutor, just as judges are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said more than once that when judges try a

case,  they themselves are on trial by the public watching  over

the conduct of the case and the reasons that they give for their

decisions.   So should the Public Prosecutor not be  accountable

to  the public through Parliament for any decisions he makes  in

his  capacity as the Public Prosecutor?  It cannot be said  that

because  the  prosecutions are vested in him and it  is  in  his

discretion  that  he  is not therefore accountable  to  anybody.

This was somewhat the answer given by the Minster of State, when

I   asked  about  the  directors  of  Keppel,  that  the  Public

Prosecutor decides in his discretion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two matters lately on which the decision of the

Public  Prosecutor has been called into question.  One of course

was  his  refusing to prosecute the Prime Minister and  the  two

Deputy Prime Ministers and the other Members of the ruling Party

for   having,  what  we  say,  violated  the  section   in   the

Parliamentary Elections Act.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, there are three more

speakers after you.  You have got three more minutes left.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, I will be very brief. I must finish

this.  For me, it is an important subject.  Of course, the other

was  his not prosecuting the directors of Keppel.  In the  first

instance, we had a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>



written  explanation.   But  may I  say  I  found  that  written

explanation  most unsatisfactory.  May I say that a  great  many

members   of   the   public  did  not  find   that   explanation

satisfactory.  In the case of the directors, there was  even  no

written explanation.  All we had was the explanation, as a guess

by  the Minister of State, as to what may have guided the Public

Prosecutor.  May I ask whether we can have the Public Prosecutor

devise  a  system or machinery whereby the Public Prosecutor  is

made  to  explain  in public the reasons for  his  decisions  as

Public Prosecutor where they are called into question?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is the separation of functions. May I

suggest  to  the  Minister that there is a lot to  be  said  for

separating  the  functions of the AG and the Public  Prosecutor.

The AG is the chief legal advisor of the Government.  The Public

Prosecutor has a different role to play.  In the United Kingdom,

we  have  a  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  who  makes  the

decisions.   No  doubt,  he  is made accountable  to  Parliament

through  the  Attorney-General.  Is it not possible  for  us  to

consider now separating the functions of the Attorney-General as

chief  legal advisor from his functions as the Public Prosecutor

by appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am rather surprised that Mr

Jeyaretnam  should  question the right of the Attorney-General's

office.  He himself is a trained lawyer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Are you answering?

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am giving my views. Would you bear

patience with me?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is not much time left, so just proceed

with your speech, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the office of the Attorney-General

is  a  constitutional appointment and he has the sole discretion

to  prosecute or not to prosecute.  And we in this House  should

never question it.  To do so would be to undermine the office of

the  Attorney-General.  The Attorney-General is assisted by  the

Solicitor-General, and I will come to that later.  What I  would

like to say is that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



in  many  countries the office of the Attorney-General has  been

politicised but, here, it is separate from the Executive.  He is

not  accountable  to Parliament and we should  not  in  any  way

question the discretion vested in the office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to the Solicitor-General, Sir. The Solicitor-General is the next senior person in the most important office

of  the  land  and,  regrettably, I see no appointment  to  this

office  after the retirement of the last Solicitor-General.   It

is  indeed  a  sad reflection and I think there is  no  lack  of

challenge either in the legal service or outside.  To have  this

important office vacant for such a long time does not speak well

for our judicial and legal system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other topic I would like to touch on is plea

bargaining.   Sir, whether it is white crime or any crime  under

the  Penal  Code,  the accused person may be prepared  to  plead

guilty  or to plea bargain with the Attorney-General's Chambers.

I  am  suggesting  that we should do away with  our  traditional

British  practice  and  follow the American  practice.   If  the

prosecution  and  the defence can work out a  bargain,  then  it

would be in the interest of the community.  Money could be saved

and  the poor accused will know exactly what he is going to meet

at  the end of the day.  As it now stands, he does not know what

sentence  the judge is going to give to him.  So I am suggesting

that  we  should look afresh.  I know a lot of lawyers, who  are

conservative, are not in favour of this.  But I would urge  that

we should introduce a new system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of mediation, I know the Attorney-General is committed to sending disputes for mediation. But

what I am suggesting is that whenever the Attorney-General is  a

party, either as plaintiff or potential defendant, the Attorney-General's  Chambers should first look at the option of mediation

and  not wait for a writ to be filed in the court and then  talk

terms.  I think it would save a lot of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to touch on is the legal

officers.   It  would be in the interest of the country  if  the

Attorney-General's Chambers pass some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>



of  its  work  to the members of the Bar.  This is practised  in

other  Commonwealth countries.  In this way, we could save  some

funds.  In this way, he could also benefit from seeking opinions

from  members of the Bar on important issues, whether  it  is  a

constitutional issue or other issues.  Once again, Sir, I  think

we  should  be  loath to question the Attorney-General's  office

and,  as I have said earlier, it is a constitutional appointment

and,  as  a  practising member of the Bar,  I  say  let  us  not

undermine the confidence that the Constitution has given him.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I will respond to Mr Jeyaretnam's

points and my colleague, the Minister of State, will respond  to

Mr Shriniwas Rai.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two points raised by Mr Jeyaretnam, let me first

deal with his second point, that is, the point of accountability

of  Attorney-General as Public Prosecutor.  His  proposition  is

that   the  Attorney-General  as  Public  Prosecutor   must   be

accountable and answerable to this House for his decisions  when

his  decisions are queried or called into question with  respect

to  prosecution.  I think I want to make it clear, Sir,  that  I

completely disagree with his proposition and I would say that it

would  be  wholly  wrong  and improper for  us  to  subject  the

Attorney-General's prosecutorial decisions to scrutiny  in  this

Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. First, let us recapitulate the two key

functions  of  the  Attorney-General under  Article  35  of  the

Constitution.   Under Article 35, clause 7, of the Constitution,

he  has  two key functions.  One is to advise the Government  on

such legal matters that are referred to him.  The second is  the

prosecution  function.   The  Attorney-General  shall  have  the

power,  exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct  or

discontinue  any  proceedings  for  any  offence.    What   does

"exercisable at his discretion" mean?  It surely means  what  it

says,  that  he  has,  as holder of that office,  discretion  to

conduct  or  discontinue any proceedings, whether  to  charge  a

person for an offence, under what provision of the Penal Code or

some other Act of Parliament for a lesser offence, for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



more  serious  offence, and when the trial is on, if  convicted,

what  kind  of  punishment to press the courts.  These  are  all

prosecutorial  decisions exercisable in his discretion.   He  is

not subject to requirements of acting on advice or consultation.

Does he mean that he must give an explanation?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> On a point of clarification.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> He can clarify later.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, will you resume your seat?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Does the Member mean that after the AG has

taken  a  decision, he is answerable to this Chamber  about  his

decisions, why he prosecutes in one case and not the other,  why

he  appeals in one case and not the other?  I think it  will  be

wholly   wrong  and  improper  to  proceed  along   the   course

recommended by Mr Jeyaretnam.  And  I think we can cite  several

other reasons.  Apart from the fact that it will be contrary  to

the  express provision of Article 35, because we cannot  say  in

one  breath  that the Attorney-General has power exercisable  in

his  discretion  and, in the same breath, ask him  to  have  his

decisions subject to legislative scrutiny, questioning or debate

in this Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that it is in the public interest that

the  Attorney-General should make his decisions on such  matters

unencumbered, without any fear or worry that the matter will  be

subject to scrutiny in this Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, let us recall that when the Attorney-General

decides to prosecute in any particular matter, he does so on two

main  principles:  (a) whether there is sufficient  evidence  to

proceed;   (b)  whether  there  is  a  prima  facie   case   for

prosecution.   If  there is a prima facie case for  prosecution,

whether there is some public interest element against it.  These

are two considerations that are generally



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>



recognised    in    Commonwealth   jurisdictions.     In    both

considerations, there is a host of factors which he has to  take

into  consideration and evaluate.  He has to make  judgments  on

each of these factors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, because of these considerations, the Constitution

has  placed  the  office of the Attorney-General  on  a  special

footing.   I would say on a footing analogous with the  position

of  Judges.  For example, the Attorney-General's appointment  is

subject  to  the safeguard of the President's  veto.   It  is  a

safeguarded appointment.  Then Article 35 also has safeguards to

ensure  that he cannot be removed arbitrarily.  The  grounds  on

which  he  can be removed are narrowly framed and the  procedure

for  his removal calls for a tribunal of judges, chaired by  the

Chief Justice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, it is not surprising, therefore, that it is an

established  practice in all common law jurisdictions  that  the

Attorney-General will not publish his detailed reasons  for  any

prosecutorial decisions.  There are very good reasons  for  this

practice, because if reasons are given in detail, surely it must

lead to public debate in this House and outside this House about

the  case and on the guilt or innocence of the suspect.  It must

result  in that.  And it is best that such questions be  decided

in  the courts and not be subject for trial by public debate  in

this  Chamber just because a Member of the House or a Member  of

the  Opposition  is  unable to agree with the  legal  advice  or

decision of the Attorney-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have followed this practice in Singapore for the

past  30 years, and I think this system has worked well.  If the

prosecutorial  system  in Singapore is not  to  break  down,  we

should continue with this practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point made by Mr Jeyaretnam is that we should

separate the functions of the Attorney-General as legal  adviser

and  Attorney-General as public prosecutor.  I would commend  to

Mr  Jeyaretnam  to  read  a paper called "Emerging  Problems  in

Defining  the  Modern Role of the Office of Attorney-General  in

Commonwealth Countries",



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



a  memorandum prepared for the Commonwealth Secretariat by Prof.

Edwards  of  Canada,  where he surveyed  Commonwealth  practice.

There is no lack of models for us to follow.  In some countries,

the  model  is  that the Attorney-General is distinct  from  the

public  prosecutor.  In some cases, the public prosecutor  is  a

public  officer  and the Attorney-General is  a  member  of  the

Cabinet  or  member of the Legislature.   Where it is  distinct,

the  public  prosecutor  is answerable to the  Attorney-General.

Indeed,  in  most  of the Commonwealth jurisdictions  where  the

officers  are  different,  the  public  prosecutor's  role   and

function are answerable to the Attorney-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have this system where the Attorney-General has two functions, but this is a system we have had ever

since we were independent, and even before independence.  It was

as  a result of a recommendation, and I have been advised by the

Attorney-General,  which finds its roots in the  Report  of  the

Reid Commission, 1957.  The Reid Commission then recommended  as

follows and I quote from paragraph 127:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`. Some Commonwealth countries, the Attorney-General holds

a political office.  In others, the political functions normally

exercised by a political Attorney-General exercised by  Minister

of  Justice  or  Minister for Law.  While  the  Attorney-General

exercises  the more professional functions of giving independent

legal  advice to the government, representing the government  in

the  courts  and  perhaps  assuming  responsibility  for  public

prosecution.  On the whole, we prefer the latter.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a system we have had since independence and before

independence.   It has worked well and I see no  reason  why  we

should change it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that, ultimately, it boils down to the strength

of  character and personal integrity of the holder of the office

that is of paramount importance when we look at the position  of

the Attorney-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean that there is no accountability. The

Attorney-General  is  a constitutional  office.   I  reject  the

notion  of Mr Jeyaretnam that his individual decisions  must  be

subject  to  scrutiny  in this Parliament.   But  the  Attorney-General  is  accountable to the Government  in  discharging  the

functions of his office,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>



because  the  Constitution provides that he may be removed  from

office by the President if he, acting in his discretion, concurs

with the advice of the Prime Minister.  Under Article 35 of  the

Constitution,  there are grounds for removal  of  the  Attorney-General.  And as I have mentioned, he may be removed from office

only  on  narrow  grounds and similar to  the  grounds  and  the

procedure provided for Judges of the Supreme Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add that the office of the Attorney-General

carries with it very important functions and powers which cannot

be  abused.  If there is any abuse and any infraction, it  will,

of   course,  carry  with  it  consequences  if  allegations  of

impropriety are substantiated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members have forgotten, in 1988, the example to drive

home   the  point  that  holders  of  public  office  will  have

allegations of impropriety examined has been firmly established.

Because in January 1988, the then Prime Minister, in respect  of

rumours and allegations of impropriety of the previous Attorney-General, categorically stated and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every allegation made against any official of corrupt,

illegal or improper conduct or action will be investigated.  The

fact  that  the  official complained against  is  the  Attorney-General,  the highest legal officer in charge of investigations,

will not prevent such investigations.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The allegations in that particular case had been

investigated and they were unfounded.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add what the then Prime Minister said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If they had been substantiated, the Attorney-General would

have had to face the consequences.'

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

The point I am making, Sir, is that the holder of the office  of

Attorney-General  has important functions  and  duties.   If  he

exercises  his functions and duties in a manner that amounts  to

abuse  or impropriety, there will be a proper investigation  and

consequences.  But that is separate from the point  made  by  Mr

Jeyaretnam  that  just  because  he  disagrees  with  individual

decisions of the Attorney-General on particular cases that  that

decision must then be subject to scrutiny



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>



in  this Chamber, and the Attorney-General has to be accountable

and answerable and to give reasons for his decision.  As I said,

that  will be wholly improper and unwise to do so.  We have  not

done  it  for some 30 years and I commend to the House  that  we

continue to stay that course.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Ho.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I, by way of clarification

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let us give other Members a chance to have

their answers first.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think I should respond to

Mr  Rai  who has made a few points.  His first point is on  plea

bargaining.  Plea bargaining or charge bargaining involving  the

prosecution  is well established in Singapore.  But  as  Mr  Rai

explained,  what  he has in mind is the American  form  of  plea

bargaining which involves not only the prosecution but the judge

as  well.  The procedure is for the parties to appear before the

judge  and  seek his views on the type or spectrum of  sentences

that  the judge will impose if the accused person were to  plead

guilty  on   a  set  of facts given to the judge.   The  accused

person  will then decide whether or not to plead guilty  on  the

basis of the judge's indication.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have studied this alternative approach carefully

but have concluded that there is no need for plea bargaining  of

this  nature.  It is not superior to the present system.   There

are  advantages and disadvantages.  As Mr Rai has mentioned, the

main advantage is that it may save the State time and effort, in

having to prepare for the case only to find out that the accused

person  would have pleaded guilty much earlier if  he  had  been

told  what  the  sentence  would be.  However,  there  are  also

disadvantages which, in our view, outweigh this advantage.   The

main  one  is that the whole process can go to waste  where  the

accused  person  does  not accept the indication  given  by  the

judge,  resulting  in the case having to be postponed,  so  that

another judge can take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>



over the case.  In Singapore, it may not be possible to insulate

other  judges  from knowing that the accused person  had  sought

plea  bargaining.  So this could prejudice the accused if he  is

tried before another judge who is aware of the failed attempt at

plea bargaining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that Mr Rai mentions is mediation. The

Attorney-General is, by law, the nominal defendant in all  civil

suits  against  the Government.  Not all actions,  however,  are

suitable for mediation.  If they are, the AG's intention  is  to

advise Ministries concerned to proceed to mediation first before

trial.   In  addition, the AG's Chambers support the initiatives

presently under way to expand mediation.  As a general rule, the

Chambers will propose mediation in all disputes where  it  is  a

party.   In  fact,  the  Chambers advise Ministries  to  include

mediation clauses in all Government contracts where mediation is

appropriate.  These clauses provide for parties to first attempt

to  resolve  their differences in accordance with the procedures

of the Singapore Mediation Centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point Mr Rai raises is why not AG farm out work to

private  practitioners.   The AG's Chambers  have  a  system  of

employing legal officers on contract when there is a need.   For

example, if the expertise

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore dollar has encountered some volatility

in  recent months due to the regional currency turmoil.  In  the

last  one  year, the Singapore dollar exchange rate has weakened

from  about 1.42 to the US dollar in mid-1997 to a low of nearly

1.8  towards the end of 1997.  Now, it is hovering at about 1.62

to  1.65.  The Singapore dollar has depreciated some 13% against

the US dollar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Singapore dollar has weakened against the US

dollar,  it  has  strengthened against the regional  currencies.

Compared  to  the  Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit  and  Indonesian

rupiah, the Singapore dollar has appreciated by between 20%  and

50%.   My  question to the Minister is: what is the Government's

short to medium term strategy for the Singapore dollar?  On  the

one  hand,  a  strong  Singapore dollar  will  enable  Singapore

companies to purchase foreign goods at low prices.  It will help

to  keep  domestic inflation low.  On the other hand,  a  strong

Singapore dollar will cost Singapore to lose its competitiveness

against  the  neighbouring countries.   Our  manufacturers  will

suffer  a disadvantage.  Their products will now be dearer  than

products in the neighbouring countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period of great volatility, it may be difficult

for  the Government to stabilise the Singapore dollar.  However,

in  view  of  the  sudden shifts in the exchange  rates  of  the

various  currencies against the Singapore dollar, the Government

may need to do a review of its exchange rate policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister enlighten the House on how the

Government  intend  to balance the conflicting  effects  of  the

strength of the Singapore dollar?

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, one year ago, the

Singapore dollar was strengthening against the US dollar and  to

some  extent  against  the regional currencies  and  this  badly

impacted the cost of doing business in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>



Today,  the  regional  currencies  have  devalued  substantially

against the US dollar and against the Singapore dollar while our

dollar remains relatively strong against most OECD countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister the following

questions:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, just as Mr Leong has asked, can the Singapore

dollar  remain  strong at the current level for our  economy  to

continue   to   be   competitive  or   will   this   erode   our

competitiveness  against our neighbours  and  also  against  the

countries in North Asia?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent report in the Business Times, it was argued

that  the  Singapore dollar needed to be around $1.83  (at  that

time   comparing  against  the  value  of  other   North   Asian

currencies)  for our exports to the west to remain  competitive.

In   fact,  the  report  suggested  the  sensitivity  of  export

competitiveness  to  the  value of the  North  Asian  currencies

against  the  Singapore dollar and should these currencies  fall

some more, the Singapore dollar will have to devalue accordingly

to  remain  competitive.  I would  like to  ask  the  Minister's

opinion on this report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what can the Monetary Authority of Singapore or

the  Ministry of Finance do to moderate interest rate  increases

which have risen three times in the past six months?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe that the Ministry or the MAS should set a

strategic  direction  for  both  the  dollar  strength  and  the

interest  rates while it minimises interferences in other  areas

by  letting  market forces rule.  Of course, certain fundamental

parameters of the economy must still be the instruments that the

Government can handle, to turn the knobs to set the general long

term of the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I feel that the strength of the dollar and the

interest rates are something that the Minister should moderate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, my two other colleagues, Mr Leong

and  Mr  Inderjit Singh, have already spoken on this matter.   I

would  like  to ask the Minister two questions.  First  of  all,

whether  he is happy with the present arrangement in our  basket

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



currencies  or  whether we should change the  composition.   The

other  concern  is that lots of Singaporeans have  this  nagging

question:  what  would  be the exchange rate  of  the  Singapore

dollar in months to come?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike other countries, Singaporeans have faith in their

currency.  They have not gone to the money changers to change or

put  their  money  in fixed deposits.  This shows  the  inherent

strength  of  the Singapore dollar.  But, as Mr  Inderjit  Singh

pointed  out  earlier, we have to also look at the  exports  and

since the regional currencies have actually fluctuated and  gone

down  considerably, what are the Minister's options in case  the

regional currencies go further down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like the Minister to answer is:

what  would MAS do to see that the interest rate does not go  on

rising?   In fact, we have three increases within the  last  few

months.   It  is important that doing business does  not  become

expensive,  and  mortgage loan does not become expensive,  which

will affect the man at large.  Even a quarter point increase  is

going  to  be  quite painful.  So I would urge the  Minister  to

address these issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim Swee Say is not speaking. Mr Sin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the Companies Act presently seeks to

protect members of the public by requiring any public invitation

to  apply  for  shares or similar instruments to be  distributed

together  with  the  prospectus, a  copy  of  which  has  to  be

registered with the Registrar. The prospectus referred to in the

Act  is  a statement containing very detailed disclosures  about

the  company. These are matters which directors are required  by

statute to be disclosed.  These disclosures range, for instance,

from a description of the directors of the company, its property

transactions to the interest of the directors in a property that

the company may have an interest in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my intention to go into a complete

description  of  the  requirements of  a  prospectus  under  the

Companies  Act.  Suffice it to note that doing a  due  diligence

with  the  company  directors  to ensure  the  accuracy  of  the

statements  in  the prospectus is a tedious and  time  consuming

exercise.  However, the effort put to the exercise provides  the

investors  some  assurance  that the statements  are  reasonably

accurate  and it helps the investors to make informed  decisions

about  their  investments.   For the directors  who  make  false

statements  or statements which they do not have  any  basis  to

believe  in,  they  face  the prospect of criminal  prosecution.

This   is  sufficient  deterrent  to  most  directors  who   may

contemplate such acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the standard of protection which the

law  affords  to  members of the public does not  appear  to  be

uniform.  In the interest of time, let me just cite one example.

While  a promoter who invites members of the public to subscribe

for  shares  in his company is required, among other things,  to

file  a  prospectus giving a detailed account about the company,

its  accounts and its directors, the same standard of disclosure

is  not  applied  to  property developers.   Presently,  foreign

developers  promoting properties overseas in  Singapore  do  not

come under the same regime of regulation as would a promoter  of

shares.   As far as I am aware, the property developer, once  he

registers  his  business,  is practically  free  to  launch  his

project  and  sells such developments to members of the  public.

If  a  foreign promoter seeks the assistance of a local property

agent, the Inland Revenue Authority places the responsibility on

the  property  agent to check the credentials of the  developer.

Even  then  such checks may be publicly qualified  and  it  then

becomes caveat emptor for the buyer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens then is that the foreign developers of

different shades of honesty sell projects in Singapore.   Unwary

Singapore buyers who have not done their due diligence may  well

end  up buying a property which is a lemon of an investment, and

with limited recourse against the promoter who probably by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>



then  has either disappeared or is insolvent.  We have seen such

failures  in recent months with respect to property projects  in

China.    Singaporeans  who  have  invested  in  some  of  these

developments  have been sent on a wild goose  chase  to  recover

their  investments.  Property purchasers are just  one  example.

In  recent years, some other forms of investments have surfaced,

which raise basic questions of adequacy of regulations under our

present   system  of  laws.   I  refer  to  time-share  schemes,

investments in ostrich farms and other soft commodities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems strange to me that the law should provide one

standard  of  protection for one type of investors  and  another

standard or an absence thereof for another type of investor.   I

would  like  to  ask the Minister whether the  Government  would

consider  bringing the regulatory standards for such  investment

promotions  to  be in line with or surpass that which  presently

apply  to  the offer of shares to members of the public.   I  am

aware  that  the Government is looking at regulating  time-share

schemes.   I wonder if the Minister can at the same time  hasten

the review.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the Minister for Trade and Industry

recently  announced that the future twin engines  of  growth  of

Singapore's  economy will be the manufacturing  sector  and  the

services sector.  I support this strategy.  A major component of

the  services  sector is the banking industry.  The Government's

desire  is  to  firmly establish Singapore as a  financial  hub.

Therefore, the financial and business sector now contributes  to

about  30.9%  of  the total GDP, as compared to  24.3%  for  the

manufacturing sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional turmoil shows the frailty of the smaller banks

in Singapore.  When hit by bad or doubtful loans, the provisions

made  by  them  have a heavy impact on their profits  and  total

assets base.  The larger banks are better placed to weather  the

impact.   Hence,  I would like to ask the Minister  whether  the

Government intends to foster the mergers of local banks.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table shows a comparison of the sizes of

local  banks as compared to the major international banks.   For

example,  our  big four banks, DBS, OCBC, UOB and  OUB,  have  a

total  shareholders' fund of between $3 billion and $7  billion.

The  big  banks  around the world, for example,  HSBC  has  S$47

billion, Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi has S$46 billion, Group Credit

Agricole has S$37 billion, Chase Manhattan has S$34 billion  and

Citicorp  has S$33.5 billion.  The above comparison  shows  that

our  largest local banks are only about one-fifth to one-seventh

of  the  size  of the world's largest foreign banks.   If  local

banks  were  to  merge, they will be better  placed  to  compete

internationally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another topic, Sir, the Government has announced the

reduction  of  the  total  qualifying non-resident  funds  under

management for preferential tax treatment from $10 billion to $5

billion.   I understand that most local banks  are not  able  to

qualify  because they do not manage offshore funds  of  over  $5

billion. I would like to ask the Minister to consider whether it

could  adopt a two-tier approach.  For example, to keep  the  $5

billion   qualifying  level  for  foreign  banks  and  a   lower

qualifying level of, say, $2.5 billion for local fund managers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the banking sector is an important

part of our GDP.  Our banking sector has growth potentiality. Mr

Leong  has urged for mergers of local banks and DPM had  earlier

indicated to this House that he would encourage mergers.  But  I

think  the   Government may have to take a  lead  in  persuading

these  banks  to merge earlier than planned so that  they  could

take  advantage  of the regional opportunities  that  are  being

offered,  like  what DBS has done by going into Thailand,  which

other banks may want to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other points which I would like to make is this. Banks

are  an important part of our institution. They should regularly

publish  their results and I would urge that they should  do  so

every three months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>



This  would be very transparent and transparency will help  both

the  shareholders  as  well as the public  in  knowing  how  the

particular bank is doing.

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern which I would like to raise is this. In

the past, the banks in Singapore have been also allowed to trade

in  shares.   In view of the opening of fund management  to  the

outside  world,  should  we also encourage  and  give  different

criteria  to  our  banks, but not as high as required  for  fund

managers?   I  think  the banks should also seriously  think  of

these  areas  if  they want to compete with other  international

banks.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I will answer the points on the

Singapore  dollar  and  the  banking  issues,  and  the  Finance

Minister  will  take the point from Mr Sin Boon  Ann  concerning

investment disclosure rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the Singapore dollar. As Members know, we manage

it  flexibly  against  a  trade-weighted basket  of  currencies,

comprising  Singapore's major trading partners.  We  revise  the

basket from time to time.  We believe it is reasonable, in  line

with  our  trade  patterns now.  We have no immediate  plans  to

change  it.   We have strengthened against the ASEAN  currencies

significantly but, as you know, we have weakened against the  US

dollar  and other major currencies.  So on a trade-weight basis,

the  Singapore dollar has been relatively stable.  In  fact,  it

has  appreciated slightly since July last year when the  trouble

started.   It has enabled Singapore to maintain price  stability

while  protecting  the  overall competitiveness  of  the  export

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen if our neighbouring currencies go down

further?   Will  we drive down, do we need to go down  to  match

their competitiveness?  As I have explained, I think in the last

sitting, the countries whose currencies have depreciated against

us,  we  expect  will experience high inflation, and  this  will

erode their competitiveness over time.  We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>



are  already  seeing this in Indonesia - very high inflation  in

January, even higher in February.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is the real effective exchange rate which matters and

not  the nominal effective exchange rate.  Therefore, I  do  not

see  us  having  to make major adjustments to our  policy  as  a

result of regional currency movements.  As we have said, in MAS,

our  policy is not on auto-pilot.  There is a trade weight which

we  monitor, but we exercise judgment in deciding how closely to

follow it over the short term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for interest rates, both Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Rai

expressed concern over high interest rates.  Interest rates have

to  follow  market  trends, market forces and reflect  liquidity

conditions  in  the  market and risks, and also  interest  rates

overseas.   We are a very open economy.  So we do not  have  the

luxury  of  setting  our own independent interest  rate  policy,

apart from what happens overseas and apart from what happens  to

our   exchange   rate  policy.   They  are  inter-related.    If

conditions  are tight and banks judge that they  need  a  higher

interest  rate  to compensate for the risk of lending,  interest

rates  will  go up, and the banks will hold more cash.   If  the

banks feel more confident of economic circumstances and they are

prepared to accept a lower margin, then interest rates will tend

to  be  lower, other things being equal.  So it is not something

which  MAS has a luxury of directly manipulating or influencing.

I  think we have to accept that.  As I have said, many countries

have  got  into  serious trouble because they try  to  influence

their  interest rates one way and their exchange  rates  another

way.  And when the two policies were incompatible, they crashed,

and they took a long time to unwind the pieces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in Singapore, the interest rates are not very high.

They went up to 14% briefly, short-term rates, went down back to

4+%.   Now they are 6+%.  I can understand that companies  which

have  borrowed  will worry about every quarter  point  in  their

interest  payments.  But we have to accept that.  For the  small

companies,  we have the Local Enterprises Financing Scheme,  and

the Finance Minister has announced we are improving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>



the Scheme and expanding it and putting more capital into it, so

that we can lend more to the local companies.  I think that will

make a difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for banking mergers, as I explained on14th January in

this  House  soon after Keppel Bank and Tat Lee  Bank  announced

their  intention  to  merge, the Government will  encourage  our

local  banks to merge and will support them bringing in  foreign

minority  partners  if  they can add technology  and  expertise.

Each of the banks is financially sound and indeed they are among

the soundest in Asia, according to Moody's and according to many

other  assessment  agencies.  But they add to their  competitive

strength  by  merging, as Members have pointed  out.   And  also

there  is a question of POSBank and what its role should  be  in

the banking system.  That is a policy, but whether they merge or

they do not merge, I think the shareholders have to decide.  And

you have seen some of the statements made by two of the banks, I

think,  in  yesterday's Business Times.  So I believe that  they

understand the imperatives but they want to judge the best time.

So we will continue to encourage them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for fund management incentives, Mr Leong asked about the

$5  billion offshore management incentive and whether we  should

make it lower.  I think, if I remember rightly, when the Finance

Minister  announced this incentive, $5 billion  is  not  a  hard

lower bound.  In other words, even if you do not have $5 billion

to  manage, you have less, but you are going to do substantially

more  than  you  did  before, you can come to  MAS  and  MAS  is

prepared  to consider giving you tax-free status on your  income

from managing these funds, perhaps not for five years but for  a

shorter  period.  So the door is not completely closed, even  if

you  have  not reached $5 billion.  We know that it is  quite  a

high  target, but I think psychologically that is  not  what  we

want to aim for, and it is achievable over a period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for having two tiers, one tier for local fund managers

and the other for foreign companies managing funds in Singapore,

I do not think that is desirable.  I think we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>



should  have  an  even playing field and the same  rules  should

apply, whether you are a local company or a foreign company.  We

operated  like that with manufacturing.  I think that is  right.

And we should operate it similarly, increasingly, in the case of

the finance industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for publishing banks' results quarterly and having more

transparency, I think the banks have a Committee under Elizabeth

Sam  now  working on disclosure standards.  I am not  sure  that

they  are looking into the question of quarterly publication  of

results.   But  it is something which we will  put  to  them  to

consider.   There are pros and cons.  The Americans do  it.   It

used  to  be  thought  that this is too  much  of  a  short-term

approach  because  everybody  was watching  the  share  pricing.

Every wiggle up or down causes great anxiety amongst managements

who  have  share options.  So you may have a fixation  with  the

short  term rather than the long term.  But since the countries,

which  have  a long term view, ran into some difficulties,  like

Japan,  this criticism has not been heard so often.  I think  we

have  not  been working on quarterly results, but we  have  been

reasonably  successful.   I would be hesitant  to  change  in  a

hurry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for banks doing fund management and being encouraged to

do so, they already do, not in a very big scale but they do, and

there  is  potential for them to build up further.   It  depends

mainly  on their finding the right team to do this.  It  is  not

the  same  sort  of skill or mindset as managing other  people's

money,  deposits, loans.  You need a different set of  instincts

and  aptitudes, but it is something which we can build  up  over

time.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir, Mr

Sin  Boon  Ann  has  expressed  concern  over  the  variety   of

investment  schemes which have been promoted to the  public  and

whether  sufficient protection can be offered  to  them.   As  a

general  rule,  investment schemes offered by  banks,  insurance

companies   and  other  financial  institutions  are   regulated

directly  or  indirectly by the Monetary Authority of  Singapore

(MAS) which licenses the institutions.  MAS



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>



ensures  that  the  institutions  are  financially  sound,  that

investors' rights are protected under the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other investment schemes which fall outside the purview of

MAS are subject to the basic anti-fraud provisions contained  in

the Companies Act and the Penal Code.  Members of the public who

suspect  fraudulent activity of purveyors of these  schemes  can

get  in  touch  with  the Commercial Affairs Department  or  the

Police.   In  addition, the Consumers Association  of  Singapore

helps aggrieved members of the public to seek redress over false

or misleading advertising and marketing practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is re-examining legislation in certain

areas.  For example, time-share schemes and schemes run by  soft

commodity  brokers.   Relevant  Government  bodies  and   agency

practitioners  will  be consulted and comparable  provisions  in

other  countries' legislation will be adopted if they are  found

appropriate.   This  would  include  the  promotion  of  foreign

properties.  And we are now considering the establishment of  an

Estate Agents Bill which will regulate the sale and promotion of

foreign properties, although this particular problem is probably

no longer an issue now that the market is very quiet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress, however, that no regulatory system

can  completely  protect  investors  from  making  losses.   And

Singaporeans  are  advised  to stay  away  from  any  investment

schemes   which   are  dubious,  particularly  if   they   offer

unrealistically  high  returns.   That  is  probably  the   best

protection  that I can offer.  Any scheme which  offers  returns

which are unreasonable or even absurd cannot be safe.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I go on to my next cut. In

Singapore, the tax authorities do not allow the group offsetting

and  relief  of losses incurred by subsidiaries of  a  group  of

companies.  I understand that the group offsetting of losses  is

not  allowed because of concerns on tax loopholes being created.

However, group



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>



offsetting is now allowed in some developed countries,  such  as

the  United  Kingdom.   In  recent years,  many  companies  have

answered the Government's call to venture out regionally.   They

have  invested  heavily in the region.  Some of  them  could  be

encountering  losses because of the regional  knock-down.   They

are  facing problems of higher overheads, higher manpower costs,

lower selling prices and larger bad debts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he could consider

group  offsetting  of  losses as a short-term  measure  to  help

companies  tide over their difficult period.  To  alleviate  the

risk  of large tax loopholes, perhaps partial offsetting of  50%

of their losses could be considered.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Sir, in this year's Budget, the

financial sector seems to get the giant share of the incentives.

In  a  time of tight credit and falling business volume,  it  is

only  fair that some of those tax incentives given to the  banks

will  also be given to the non-bank taxpayers.  For example,  an

administrative  incentive  has  been  given  to  the  banks   to

effectively allow tax deductions for unrealised foreign exchange

losses  and  tax  unrealised  foreign  exchange  gains.   In  my

opinion,  a similar concession can also be given to the non-bank

taxpayers  such as manufacturers.  Also, the Thai and Indonesian

governments had recently announced changes to their tax  law  to

even   allow  a  five-year  amortisation  of  exchange   losses.

Therefore, in this regard, Sir, I hope the Minister for  Finance

can look into such incentives to help Singapore companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I wish to bring up is similar to what Mr

Leong  has  just  pointed out, and that is, on  the  group  loss

relief.  At this point, I would like to add that not only UK has

this  provision, USA and Australia also have this provision  for

group  loss relief, and it is commercially sound for a group  of

companies  to  be  set  up  for whatever  reasons,  usually  for

commercial  and  strategic reasons so  that  they  can  position

themselves in the best position to do business.  But  with  this

currency crisis, some companies would be in a loss position  and

other companies would be in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>



a  tax-paying position.  With this group loss relief, it removes

the  unnecessary tax burden on the other members of  the  group.

And  I  hope the Minister for Finance would seriously look  into

the possibility of offering such relief to the companies.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the point I wish to

raise  has  somewhat  been covered by Mr Leong  and  Mr  Chuang.

However, it pertains more to SMEs who have gone regional.   Many

local  SMEs were encouraged by the Government in the  course  of

the  last  five  years or so to regionalise, to help  create  an

external wing for our economy as a means to sustain growth.  The

Minister  for  Finance  has over the  years  also  introduced  a

variety  of  tax  measures, such as unilateral  tax  credit  for

dividend  income, tax exemption schemes for venture capital  and

regional funds to encourage investments in the Asia Pacific  and

also    the    overseas   enterprise   incentive   to    promote

regionalisation.   The  Government's active  promotion,  coupled

with  a  host  of attractive incentives, motivated many  of  our

local SMEs to jump on the bandwagon and set up operations in our

neighbouring  countries.  Unfortunately,  as  a  result  of  the

unforeseen  currency  crisis, they are  now  finding  themselves

exposed  and  are  incurring heavy losses  due  to  the  drastic

exchange rate depreciation, particularly that of the rupiah  and

the Thai baht and, to some extent, the Malaysian ringgit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of this fact, I would like to ask the Minister

for  Finance to consider the feasibility of allowing  a  one-off

tax   deduction  or  offset  strictly  arising  from  unrealised

exchange  losses  for  Singapore  companies  operating  in   the

countries  affected  by  the currency  crisis.   The  unrealised

deduction  allowed  could  be  monitored  perhaps  by  the   tax

authorities and whatever gains, if any, realised at the time the

transactions  mature could be recovered back by the  authorities

in  the  next  accounting period.  Such allowances  will  enable

companies  exposed  to  the region to improve  their  cash  flow

during the period of the financial crisis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, many Members in the last few days

have  spoken  about  the critical cash flow problems  that  many

businesses are facing due to the overall slowdown in the region.

While  I  can  understand the Minister's  reluctance  to  reduce

corporate  tax by 1% to 2% because we cannot change the  overall

long-term  strategy due to transient problems, we therefore  are

not  asking  for such changes but rather a one-off extraordinary

action  like some of the Members have already proposed  for  the

next two to three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to propose the following measures.

The  first  one is not new, a one-off 10% to 15% tax rebate  for

the  next two years for our businesses.  The second proposal  is

related  to tax deductibility on a group level.  And  the  third

one, to ease cash flow problems, is the allowance for businesses

in  Singapore  to pay their income tax in instalments  over  the

next  two years.  So hopefully, we can have some short-term cash

flow problems resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I take the second cut now?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> While I know there have been calls by

some  quarters and some Members in this House to reduce the  GST

by  about 1 or 2 percentage points, I disagree with this because

there  are no clear reasons for this at this stage and also  the

3% that was set some years ago is a realistic level.  My request

is a very specific one for the purpose of helping the very small

businesses  that cannot afford the resources needed  to  process

and  keep track of GST collections.  This then becomes a  hassle

for  them.   While the $1 million level set as a  threshold  for

businesses that have to apply the GST ruling some four years ago

might have been all right, but now, as our economy has grown,  I

believe we can review this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in mind, I would like to propose the following

two suggestions:  First of all, can the threshold be raised from

$1 million to $2 million?  For companies that do sales less than

$2 million per year, I suggest that we no longer need to process

GST.  This will help them reduce the processing and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



manpower  cost, especially for the smaller companies,  and  also

hopefully  result in lower cost which will be passed on  to  the

consumers in the long term.  Secondly, can the GST collection be

delayed by about one to two quarters so that the short-term cash

flow problems can be resolved?

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, over the past few years, the

Government  has been reducing the property tax rates from  about

16%  to  12%.   These  reductions  have  helped  those  who  own

commercial properties and residential properties which are  held

as investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, about 90% of Singaporeans own their own homes and

live in them.  They pay a lower owner-occupied property tax rate

of 4%.  This 4% concession has not been reduced for a long time.

The  effect  then  is that while people who own  properties  for

investments  have benefited from the reduction of  property  tax

rate  over  the  years,  the majority of  Singaporeans  are  not

enjoying  any  property tax reduction for  their  owner-occupied

properties.  On the other hand, they are actually paying  higher

property taxes due to higher property tax assessments made  over

the  years.   I  would like to ask the Government  whether  they

would wish to consider reducing the owner-occupied property  tax

concession  by, say, even �% to 1% so as to give some concession

to property owners who are owner-occupied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I would like to ask the Finance Minister

as  to  why the Government has, for this year's Budget, given  a

15%  rebate to commercial and industrial properties  only.   Why

has  he not decided to include residential properties, at  least

for  residential  properties which are held as investments,  for

example,  apartments  for lease, rented  apartments  or  service

apartments?  For that matter, why is the rebate of 15% not given

to   residential  properties  which  are  owner-occupied?    The

Minister may wish to explain the rationale.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Chuang

Shaw  Peng  have  asked for group relief for  companies.   I  am

afraid  that we are not in favour of the idea of allowing  group

relief for companies as it will have grave implications for  our

tax  revenue.   Under group relief, profitable companies  within

the  group  will not have to pay tax on their profits  if  these

could  be offset by the losses of other companies in the  group.

This means that group relief will open up opportunities for  tax

planning and abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of other tax administrations which allow

group relief has been that complex tax rules have to be drawn up

to   prevent   abuse,  thus  creating  complications   for   tax

administration.  This has been the experience of countries  like

the US, UK and Australia who allow group relief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tax regime in Singapore is such that losses incurred by

a  company  can  be carried forward indefinitely  to  be  offset

against  future  profits  earned and we  believe  that  this  is

sufficient.  The majority of countries in the region do  not  in

fact  allow  group  relief, for example,  Hong  Kong  does  not,

neither  does  Malaysia,  nor Japan,  or  Canada.  Outside  this

region, Italy and Belgium do not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Chuang Shaw Peng

have asked whether we could provide relief or tax deduction  for

losses  suffered by companies arising from the regional currency

turmoil.   Mr  Chuang has further suggested that the  Government

should  extend  tax deduction given to banks for  their  foreign

exchange  losses to companies as well.  I should point out  that

foreign exchange losses incurred by companies could be either on

the  capital account or on the revenue account.  For items under

capital account, such as loans or equity investments in overseas

operations,  we  do  not allow tax deduction  for  such  losses,

whether realised or unrealised, as we do not tax capital  gains.

In  the  case  of items on the revenue account,  such  as  trade

receivable from foreign customers, tax deduction is allowed  for

realised  foreign exchange losses.  Paper losses or  translation

losses, whether due



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



to  exchange  rate  differences or for other  reasons,  are  not

allowed  for tax deduction as they are not realised  losses  and

may be reversed at any time prior to disposal of the assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang has also suggested that the administrative

concession for banks in respect of their foreign exchange losses

be  extended to companies in general.  Under this administrative

concession,  banks  are  allowed tax  deduction  for  unrealised

foreign   exchange  losses  on  their  trading   account.    The

concession  was granted  mainly to facilitate tax compliance  by

the banks in view of the nature of their operations and the mark

to  market  basis commonly used by them to recognise profits  or

losses  in  their books.  Under this administrative  concession,

unrealised  losses  may be allowed but unrealised  profits  will

also  be  subject to tax.  The operations of other companies  do

not require a similar administrative concession.  Companies also

may not want to have their unrealised profits subject to tax  as

in the case of the administrative concession for banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has asked for corporate tax rebate of 10%

to  15%  over  the  next two years to assist companies  who  are

facing problems in this difficult period.  I would like to point

out   that  Singapore's  tax  regime  currently  is  still  very

competitive and I believe, based on what I said yesterday,  that

a tax rebate of this size is not really necessary at this stage.

Our  corporate income tax was recently reduced from 27%  to  26%

and  took effect from Year of Assessment 1997.  We also  have  a

wide  variety of tax incentives targeted at selected  industries

and  activities  which  we want to promote.   This  means  that,

effectively, our tax rate is lower than the corporate  tax  rate

of  26%.   We also have a comprehensive network of tax treaties,

numbering 36 at the moment, which helps to reduce the tax burden

of  companies in Singapore.  Nevertheless, I recognise that  the

economic  outlook  is uncertain and if developments require,  we

will be prepared to take further action to help companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also asked that companies be allowed

to  pay their tax by instalment over the next two years to  help

ease cash flow.  Currently, companies are already allowed to pay

their income tax by instalments if they arrange for the payments

to  be made through GIRO.  The instalment plan is interest-free.

If necessary, IRAS is prepared to, on a case-by-case basis, look

into  further  adjustments  to  this  instalment  plan  to  help

companies  which face particular cash flow problems in arranging

their tax schedules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also suggested that we change the GST

threshold  for  companies which register from $1 million  to  $2

million  and to delay collection of GST by one quarter  to  help

companies  in  their cash flow problems.  We  believe  that  the

current  GST  annual  turnover limit of $1  million  is  already

sufficiently  high to exclude most, if not, all small  business.

With  this high turnover threshold, almost all small businesses,

such  as  provision  shops, market and coffeeshop  stallholders,

hawkers, HDB shopkeepers are already exempt from GST.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is 6.45 pm.
