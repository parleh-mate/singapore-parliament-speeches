<br><br>2.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on Head 0901 and at the

Moment of Interruption last night, Madam Chan Choy

Siong  was moving amendment (9) under this  Head. Madam Chan.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (9), standing in the names of Mr. P. Selvadurai, Madam Chan Choy Siong, and Mr. Ho See Beng, reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0901 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0901 -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I was saying

yesterday  that in 1959 the People's Action  Party

announced  its  policy in a booklet  entitled  The

Tasks  Ahead. One of the main principles  was  the

interests of the people. So I would like to  touch

on  the  labour  policy of the Government  to  see

whether the balance in the interests of labour  is

maintained. At that time it was announced  in  the

booklet  that the P.A.P. was the workers' movement

and  it  had  always received the support  of  the

workers. The P.A.P. Government is a government  on

the  workers'  side.  Although  we  recognize  the

limitations of our entrepot trade, our economy and

the  necessity  for  private capital  and  private

enterprise, it is our duty to see that the workers

get  a fair return for their labour, without which

capital  would  be barren and fruitless,  and  the

wealth and prosperity which labour produces ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> On a point of order,

Sir,I think this is now the time for consideration of Head 0902, and

I hear the Member for Delta speaking on -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, Mr Tang. Under

the revised times, we are still on the Ministry of

Labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am sorry.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was saying that the workers

should  get  a reasonable share for their  effort.

Without this basic condition, even if we have  the

capital, entrepot trade and other facilities,  the

labouring class who produces the wealth  will  not

get equal benefit, and there will not be a balance

of  interests.  So  if we want  to  be  prosperous

through  industrialisation, hut we cannot succeed,

it  is  because good working conditions and  other

benefits  to  the workers cannot be procured,  and

the  workers  will not get their rightful  reward.

The present situation, however, very clearly tells

the people of Singapore that the P.A.P. Government

is  looking  after them well. Ever  since  we  the

P.A.P. came to power, we have all along abided  by

these tenets or promises which we have made to our

electorate up to now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we re-examine our present declared policy, we

will  find that perhaps the Government thinks that

because Singapore has achieved independence it can

lose  sight of this declaration that was made some

time   ago.  Some  workers  have  been  neglected,

especially workers in the Jurong industrial  site.

True,  Singapore must industrialise  in  order  to

maintain the livelihood of its two million people,

but  very  clearly we have this policy which  says

that  we  must achieve a balance of interests,  in

other  words, we must look after the interests  of

capital as well as the interests of labour. If  we

examine  the actual conditions of the  workers  in

the Jurong industrial site, we will find that they

have  been  exploited in their  wages.  The  money

given to them can be regarded only as an allowance

and  not  as actual wages, because they, who  have

been producing goods for their employers, are only

given  meagre  allowances, not even  amounting  to

wages, if I can call it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also touched on this matter of wages

earlier. Normally a worker gets $2.50 per day. But

the  answer  given by the Minister  is  that  this

$2.50 is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



regarded  as  wages  but as an allowance,  because

most  of the workers are unmarried and this  is  a

sort   of  allowance  given  to  them.  But  after

investigation, I found that it is not actually so.

This sort of policy therefore actually contradicts

the announced policy of the P.A.P. Government.  If

you  regard these workers as apprentices, then  it

is  not right. In the past I have tried to rectify

this abnormal situation, but we can still find  it

going  on  in the Jurong industrial site.  I  have

found  that  many of the workers who  are  getting

$2.50  per day are actually married. The  Minister

has  said  that they are unmarried, but  after  my

investigations, I have found that they are married

with  children.  So this policy, in  actual  fact,

contradicts the P.A.P. announced policy on labour.

I  feel  that an erroneous conception has been  so

formed so that the employer looks down upon  women

labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that when we say that we want

to  help  the  workers, we mean that the  workers'

unions  concerned will look after  their  members.

But  many of the workers in Jurong do not join any

union. Firstly, they get very low wages. They have

to  spend  more than $1 a day when they travel  to

and from their places of work. For lunch they have

to spend about $1 per day so that when they return

home  they  have nothing left for their family  if

their  wages  are only $2.50 per day.  Because  of

this,  the  workers do not join any  trade  union.

Because  of  this, the employers exploit  them  so

that   all   their  claims  have   been   ignored,

especially  the  claims  of  women  workers,  like

maternity benefit and medical care.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, the Minister will have

only two minutes to reply.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Yes, I will close as soon

as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: Sir, I do not know whether the

Labour  Ministry's so-called pro-labour policy  is

still  in  practice.  Although  the  Ministry  has

achieved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



something for the welfare of labour, I hope it can

proceed  with  the  spirit of  revolution  without

causing  detriment to the workers  but  rather  to

benefit them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, I thought you were not

speaking?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> I have changed my

mind, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: Mr Speaker, Sir, having heard

what  the Member for Delta has said, I feel  that I  must  share my sentiments with her on some  of

the  points  that  she has touched  upon.  First,

perhaps  she  does not understand very  well  the

actual   reason  why  workers  in   the   pioneer

industries  do not join the unions. This  is  not

an  error  on the part of Government's policy.  I

think  the reason why they do not -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Ho,

perhaps you will give the Minister the opportunity

to reply now. Mr Jek.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jek.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to reply to the main

complaint  of  the  Member for Delta  that  female

workers  in Jurong get a very low pay. I think  it

is  not  quite true to say that female workers  in

factories  in Jurong are getting a very  low  pay.

According to the Sample Household Survey conducted

in  July  1966,  the average monthly  earnings  of

female  workers  of  18  years  or  above  in  all

manufacturing  industries  were  $100.80  cents  a

month.  There may be workers who get more or  less

than  this  amount. But the problem  is  that  the

wages  they  earn  are closely  related  to  their

skills.  The higher the skill, the more they  will

earn. Take, for instance, a worker in a shirt  and

garment       industry.      If       she       is ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Madam Chan.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

fact that the  Minister has  not replied to my satisfaction,

I would  like to put my amendment to the vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I have had no chance to

reply!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. In view of the assertion of

the  Member  for Delta that the Minister  has  not

replied  to  her  satisfaction,  I  will  put  the

amendment to the vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,088,970 for Head 0901 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0902 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0902

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I touch on the point I wish to raise

on  the Industrial Arbitration Courts, let me make

it  very clear that whatever I say in relation  to

the  Industrial Arbitration Courts does not  refer

to  the  President, the Deputy  President  or  any

official   of  the  First  and  Second  Industrial

Arbitration Courts. In fact, I would like  to  pay

my  tribute to the President and Deputy  President

of  the Courts for their past work in handling the

multifarious cases that have been presented in the

First  and  Second  Courts. But whatever  point  I

raise to indicate the present state of affairs the

parties concerned are now in, may I emphasise that

it  is  not the fault of the courts but it is  the

fault  of  the system in operation that is  to  be

blamed? The present method of having panel members

from employee and employer groups does undoubtedly

cause  unwanted and unnecessary delay not only  in

hearings but also in the making of awards. Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



the  Industrial Relations Ordinance lays down that

the  award  shall be handed down within two  weeks

after  the parties concerned have presented  their

arguments. The fact that no one in the Ministry of

Labour  or  the  Advocate-General's  Chambers  has

queried  why  the Ordinance has not been  followed

indicates that all have accepted that this is  not

possible. Under the circumstances, I would like to

ask  the Minister if we are not defeating the very

purpose   for  which  the  Industrial  Arbitration

Courts  were set up. The policy of the  Government

was  and,  I hope, still is industrial peace  with

justice.  But I ask, can we have industrial  peace

with  justice if there are delays in handing  down

the  awards  which sometimes last for  months  and

even  more  than a year after the cases have  been

heard?   Of  course,  both  the  unions  and   the

management  may admit that they do  have  justice,

but a rather belated justice. Meanwhile, there  is

frustration among the workers and this frustration

must  necessarily affect production, a matter with

which, I am sure, all of us are concerned. I  feel

that  something  must be done  to  accelerate  the

hearings and the making of the awards of the cases

by the courts. Have the Minister and his officials

given  thought to this matter? They  may  be  very

busily   occupied   with   other   matters.   But,

nevertheless, I would like to suggest this for the

Minister's consideration and sincerely ask him  to

give  his  urgent  attention  to  this  matter.  I

suggest  that  the  courts should  have  permanent

panel  members. In other words, either the members

of  the  management  and the employees  should  be

engaged on a full-time basis, or do away with them

completely  and  let all the  cases  be  heard  by

either the President or the Deputy President only.

My  other suggestion is that the Minister appoints

only  panel  members who can afford to  spare  the

time. If a member, having been nominated to sit on

the  cases,  finds himself unable  to  attend  the

hearings on, say, three consecutive occasions,  he

automatically  disqualifies himself  from  hearing

any                 further                 cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, if you stop now, the

Minister will have three minutes to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I think, in short, the

Member  for  Bras Basah has suggested that  we  do

away with the panel members. I am not sure whether

this   is  feasible  because  the  panel  members,

whether they are employers or employees, are there

to   assist   the  President  of  the   Industrial

Arbitration Court to weigh the pros and cons in  a

given case and together they form the court. If we

were  to do away with the panel members, then  the

President  would  be  left  alone  to   make   the

decision, and since the decisions on the awards of

the courts are not subject to appeal to any higher

court,  it  may  appear that  the  burden  of  the

President in making his decision is too  heavy  as

to be unbearable and at times he may be accused of

bias or being arbitrary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the suggestion on the setting up of

permanent  panel  members, I do not  think  it  is

possible  because, firstly, it is not possible  to

get  enough suitable persons from the trade unions

and  the  employers'  side to serve  as  permanent

members  in the panel, and, secondly, the cost  of

maintaining such a permanent panel would be  quite

prohibitive  and, in some cases,  it  may  not  be

economical  to do so because for some  periods  of

the year there may not be any case for the members

to hear at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion put forward by the Member

is  that  the Minister should appoint  only  panel

members who cart afford to spare the time. If that

is the case, I do not think this would be workable

because  nobody  actually worth  appointing  as  a

panel  member can actually spare the time, and  in

that  case we would not have any panel members  at

all.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Mr Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not very

satisfied with the reply by the Minister. Although

he has

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1001 -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Let me say that there

are four Members who have put down six amendments.

There is a total of 25 minutes. With that reminder

I call Mr Tay Boon Too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1001 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1051.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the building of a rugged and brave next

generation is one of the national policies of

Singapore. This shows the farsightedness and the

deep thought given by the Government of the Republic of Singapore. This policy is in keeping with

the principles of nation building, that is, in

order to build a strong nation, we must first have

a strong and healthy people. However, there is a

certain amount of dissatisfaction among sports

circles in Singapore today with certain members in

the National Sports Control Board. Mismanagement

and the erroneous views of certain members on this

Board have produced some bad consequences. The

Government has been trying to promote sports in

recent years. Towards that end, it has been trying

to reorganise the sports organisations. However,

certain members holding responsible positions in

the Sports Control Board have behaved in a

prejudicial manner. I feel that this behaviour

should be corrected. In the past, the sporting

activities in our country were under the

management of the Singapore Olympic Council. But

this year, as a successor to the Singapore Olympic

Sports Council, there has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



been  established  a  body called  the  Singapore

National  Sports Control Board which manages  all

matters pertaining to sports. However, there  are

no  experts on the Board who are conversant  with

the   technique  of  volleyball  and   basketball

matches.   Sir,  I  would  like  to  recount   an

incident. The recent SEAP Games were meant mainly

to  raise  the  standard  of  sports  of  certain

countries in this region where the standards  are

low.   Compared  with  some  other  international

sports  meets,  the SEAP Games  standard  is  the

lowest.  It is the lowest among all international

sports meets.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what kind of standard did we use to select

our team members? Did we base our standard on the

Olympic Games or the Asian Games? In what  events

of  the Olympic Games did Singapore's contingents

ever win any gold medals? If our sports teams are

not  sent  abroad  to  compete  in  international

games,  how  do  we expect them  to  raise  their

sports  standard?  We will be  just  closing  our

eyes. The relevant authorities have said that the

selections were based on quality and not on  quan

tity.  Of course, I agree with this. But what  is

the  quality  required? Is it  that  the  members

selected  should be up to the standard that  they

can  expect  to win gold medals? If that  is  so,

then  the selectors must have been very sure that

the  members selected for the SEAP Games must  be

people  who  had already reached the  gold  medal

standard.  But  there were many members  who  got

only  zero  back from the SEAP Games,  especially

the men's table tennis team. Since it was claimed

that  selection was based on quality and  not  on

quantity,  what happened to those teams  selected

to  represent us at the SEAP Games who  got  zero

marks  back for Singapore? Were they affected  by

Thailand's sunny weather so that there  was  some

sort  of  chemical reaction which  changed  their

quality  and which was different from  what  they

had  expected  it to be? There is some  suspicion

that  there  was bias in selecting our contingent

members.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our volleyball team under the able

leadership of our Minister of State of Defence

had made much progress. They had been training

since June last year. There were four collective

training periods per week. There had been 200

such occasions totalling some 400 hours. This

volleyball team can be said to be one of the most

hard-working teams among our sports

organisations. The women's team also improved

greatly its standard. Recently at the match with

the Malaysian women's volleyball team, the

Singapore team defeated them 3 - 0. At the recent

SEAP Games, the Malaysian women's volleyball team

got the bronze medal. The Burmese team got the

silver medal. The Burmese team defeated the

Malaysian team 3 - 1. So judging from the

standard of our team in April, our women's

volleyball team's standard was not only higher

than that of the Malaysian team, but was also

higher than that of the Burmese team. They can be

said to be a match for Thailand's women's

volleyball team. Yet the selection committee said

that our volleyball team -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the

Member that he has already spoken for ten

minutes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Thank  you, Sir, for your reminder. I have almost

come  to  the end of my speech. Yet the selection

committee  said that the women's volleyball  team

had  not reached the standard required. I  should

say  that  the  committee concerned was  actually

behaving like a blind man groping for the tail of

the elephant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are 15 organisations under the

Singapore   Olympic  Sports   Council   and   the

Secretary of the Council had very close relations

with seven of the organisations. Recently, out of

the  11  organisations which had members  in  the

Singapore  contingent to the  SEAP  Games,  seven

organisations were under him. I would like to ask

how  many  gold,  silver or  bronze  medals  were

gained by these seven organisations? How many got

zero  marks  back? The idea of holding  the  SEAP

Games, other than enabling all countries in South-east Asia to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



take part in competition and raising the standard

of   sports,   is  also  meant  to  improve   the

relationship among the participating countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sponsor country recently sent a delegation

here  specially  to persuade our  authorities  to

allow   our  volleyball  team,  basketball  team,

football team and rugby team to take part in  the

SEAP  Games. Yet its request was rejected.  Would

it  affect the relationship between Singapore and

Thailand, especially in rugby? Rugby was proposed

by our country to be added as an item in the SEAP

Games  and yet we did not send any rugby team  to

take  part.  What  is past is past  but  for  the

future, we can still do something to rectify  the

situation.  I  hope the Minister  can  take  some

measures towards this end without fear or favour.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the SEAP Games are  over  and,  in

fact, there is no need for me to answer the  hon.

Member for Paya Lebar.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> In that case, shall I call the next

amendment, Inche Othman?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> No, Sir. But as the Minister

in  charge  of  sports, I feel it  would  be  bad

sportsmanship if I did not clarify our  stand  on

the matter. I hope the hon. Member will accept my

clarification  in  the  true  spirit  of   sports

manship.  I know why he is so interested  in  the

reason  why the basketball team was left  out  of

the  contingent. He is interested because  he  is

the vice-president of the team.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Are you prepared to give

way, Inche Othman?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> There is no time and the

Member took 13 minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please proceed, Inche Othman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> I thought I had

made  myself  very clear when the Sports  Control

Board  announced  its  decision  to  exclude  the

volleyball   team  and,  for  that  matter,   the

basketball  team  and two other  teams  from  the

Singapore SEAP Games contingent some time ago. As

far  back  as  August last year, I warned  sports

organisations  in  Singapore  that  unless   they

reorganised  themselves  and  trained   hard   to

achieve  the  standard required for inclusion  in

our   contingent  taking  part  in  international

sports meets, they would not be included.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> You have not set any standard

at all.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> We have set a minimum

standard for that. In the past, there was never a

standard set by the S.O.S.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> On what criterion?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Only a few

sports  organisations took heed of that  warning.

The  rest did not care less. Even up to one month

before   the  SEAP  Games,  the  National  Sports

Control  Board  found that  a  number  of  sports

organisations had not started training or had not

trained  seriously. The National  Sports  Control

Board  had decided on a certain required standard

and  sports organisations which wanted to  be  in

cluded  in  our  contingent  should  attain  that

standard. If they did not, then it was their  own

fault.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us see what the basketball standard

was. In the record that I have here, the standard

of volleyball was generally very low. In the last

SEAP  Games  in Kuala Lumpur in 1965,  the  men's

team  was placed seventh out of seven teams which

took part. This means that they were the last  in

the  competition. Burma beat them 3 - 0.  Vietnam

beat  them  3  - 1. Cambodia beat  them  3  -  0.

Malaysia beat them 3 - 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Othman, this may all be

very  well. But we have ten minutes more for this

Head  and  there  are  three very  anxious  Back-benchers      who      desire      to      speak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> The speaker

himself took 13 minutes, Sir. So you must give me

a chance to reply, but I will cut it short.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Inche Othman, the

Speaker is seated here. It was the Member who took

13 minutes.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> I am sorry,

Sir. The Member who spoke, Sir, I would like to

assure this House that there was absolutely no

bias or prejudice affecting the selection by the

National Sports Control Board. There was no

manipulation. To charge the Board of bias or

prejudice is most unworthy of the critics. Even

the organising council of the SEAP Games very

sportingly accepted the decision of the Board

after I had explained to them the reasons why our

contingent was short of four teams. They commented

that we had done the right thing, and one of the

countries taking part in the Games was very

interested in what we are doing to improve our

standard and they asked us to send them all the

information regarding the steps that we are

taking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that if the

volleyball team want to be included in our next

contingent to the SEAP Games or, for that matter,

the Asian Games, they must improve their standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> I hope the mistake will not be

repeated.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> I will see that

the mistake is not repeated. But they must improve

their standard.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Although the Minister has given his explanation, I

am not satisfied. First, the Minister does not

know to which organisation I belong. I am not the

vice-president of the basketball team. I am the

president of the Volleyball Association. I speak

as the Member for Paya Lebar and not as president

of the Volleyball Association. Secondly, he said

the volleyball team did not have much training. As

I said earlier, the team had been training four

times a week from June last year. Up to now, the

team has had 400 hours of practice.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



Which sports organisation has exceeded this period

of training? The Minister has said that there is

no bias in the selection. Perhaps it may be due to

the swimming team.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Sir, is there any time

for me to move my amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I cannot, at this point, silence

the Member for Paya Lebar. He will no doubt

appreciate the difficulties of Madam Chan Choy

Siong who has one amendment, Inche Mohd.

Ariff who has three amendments, and Mr Ng Kah

Ting who has one amendment. All these amendments

have to be disposed of in five minutes from now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I sympathise with the Member for Delta.

Yesterday I was scheduled to speak on two items,

and yet the Member for Delta took all the time and

so I had no chance to speak. Today I must allow

her to get a taste of what I tasted yesterday.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I want to clarify is this. I did not

blame the Minister. I did not

say that he had made any errors. But I blame some

of the members on the

National Sports Control Board. They should be

removed from the Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay, I take it that you are

withdrawing your amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, in view of the fact that the Minister has not

given a clear explanation to satisfy me, I would

like to put it to a vote.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Administration of Muslim

Law  Bill was introduced in Parliament in 1960 and

re-introduced  in  1965. Then it  went  to  Select

Committee  which  received  representations   from

members  of the public. Thereafter, it was brought

back  to  Parliament  for Third  Reading  and  was

passed  in August 1966. It was assented to by  the

President in 1966.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now six years since this Bill was

introduced,  but up to today it has not  been  put

into  operation although it has been  passed.  The

Bill  provides for the setting up of  the  Majlis  us

Ugama islam, Sin gapura, and the appointments of a

Mufti  and a Secretary of the Mais. I  wish  to

know  whether  both these appointments  have  been

filled  and  whether the Majlis Ugama  islam,  Sin

gapura, has been constituted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to a question I put to the Minister for

Culture  and  Social  Affairs  which  appears   in

Hansard,  Vol.  26,  No. 3, dated  8th  September,

1967, at col.

201,  as  to  whether there would be an additional

Kathi,  he  replied that a third  Kathi  would  be

appointed, bringing the total number of Kathis  to

three.  But in the Estimates, I notice that  there

is provision for only two Kathis.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Administration of Muslim Law



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



Bill,  though approved by this House more  than  a

year  ago and assented to by the President, cannot

be implemented now because there are certain parts

in the law which have to be implemented first. For

instance,  the  formation of the Muslim  Religious

Council  is  held  up because  we  cannot  find  a

suitable person to be the Chairman. We have looked

around  and,  in fact, scraped the bottom  of  the

barrel  to  find  a suitable Muslim  to  head  the

Council.  But  up  to  today  we  have  not   been

successful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post of Mufti is still vacant. By section 30

of the Administration of Muslim Law Act, 1966, the

President  of  Singapore may,  after  consultation

with  the Maftis, appoint a fit and proper person

to  be  the Mufti of Singapore. As the Majlis  has

not  been  constituted yet, the appointment  of  a

Mu/ti  is  still vacant. The post of Secretary  is

also  still  vacant. For the time being,  we  have

Tuan  Haji  Jamil Bin Dzafir, who was  formerly  a

Division  I  officer  of the  Ministry  of  Social

Affairs and is ex-officio to the Secretary of  the

Muslim  Advisory Board. He is now doing  the  work

and is dealing with Muslim matters in the Ministry

until  such time as the post of Secretary  of  the

Majlis is substantively filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now three Kathis appointed by the

Government.  There is no vacancy for  any  further

Kathi. One of the three, that is Tuan Haji Salleh,

was  appointed  in 1960 and he is  now  acting  as

Chief  Kathi. The other two Kathis are  Tuan  Haji

Ismail,  appointed as Kathi in 1961, and Tuan  Abu

Bakar Hashim appointed as Kathi in 1967.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my complaint put very shortly

is that there are too many advertisements over the

radio  and  on T.V. and that they come on  at  the

most  unnatural  of  times, for  example,  in  the

middle   of   a   sequence.  If   we   must   have

advertisements, perhaps we can have  them  at  the

appropriate time, for example, at what is known as

a natural break.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister must decide once and for

all  whether  we are going to run the Broadcasting

Division on a commercial basis or on a social  and

cultural basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> If it is run on a commercial

basis, why must we vote for this sum of money?  If

it  is run on a social and cultural basis, why all

these advertisements?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no definite

evidence that there has been an over-saturation of

advertisements in our T.V. programmes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> You do not watch T.V.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> That is the job I am paid to

do!  Most advertisement agencies conduct their own

surveys.  If  they ftnd the T.V, programmes  over-saturated with advertisements which do not achieve

the  desired  effect, they will  make  adjustments

accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of whether television is

operated on a commercial or a cultural basis,  the

policy  of the Broadcasting Department  is  to  be

self-sufficient and that is to collect  sufficient

revenue  from its commercial services to meet  its

recurrent  expenditure. This  objective  is  being

achieved,  and  the  commercial  service  of   the

Broadcasting  Department collected  a  revenue  of

$5.23  million in the first 11 months of  1967  in

comparison  with $4.53 million in the same  period

of   1966  - an  increase  of  almost  $700,000.  At

present, Television Singapura includes 12  minutes

of  advertisements in every one hour of programme.

The normal percentage of advertisements

for  a station operating a commercial service  is

much  higher,  as in the case of stations  running

commercial  services in Japan, the United  States,

Australia,  and  so  on.  In  the  case  of   T.V.

Malaysia, there are less advertisements, which  is

probably  due  to  the fact that their  commercial

service cannot get the same amount of business  as

T.V. Singapura.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



I  will  not  go  into  the  statistics  of  adver

tisements  and  collections. But  I  will  end  by

saying this: somebody complained to me when I  was

away    that    While   he   was   enjoying    the

advertisements, there had to be "Ben Casey" coming

along!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Exactly! I think the

Government has fallen between two stools. I am not

satisfied. I want a vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to spend more  time  on

this  subhead so that I will not bring up my other

amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1002 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1351.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to bring up a few

points about T.V. Singapura programmes and news. I

feel that there is an unfair distribution of news.

For example, some Members of Parliament appear  on

T.V. when  they take part in celebrations,  while

other  Members  do not appear on  T.V.  There  are

others who always appear on T.V. For example,  the

Member for Sembawang always appears on T.V.  I  do

not know whether it is because ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan is not

giving way.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Is it

because  the  Member for Sembawang always  praises

the Government that he appears on T.V.?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I raise this point not only

for myself but also for other Members. Whenever we

hold  functions,  the leaders of  my  constituency

spend



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



money  and  put in a lot of time and  effort.  But

when we send for the T.V. crew, sometimes they  do

not  come.  And even when they do come, the  films

that they take do not appear on T.V. After all the

efforts  put in by the leaders of my constituency,

there is nothing to show in return. Of course,  it

is not because they always want to appear on T.V.,

but  we  should at least be fair to them  and  not

disappoint them. I hope the Minister will give  me

a satisfactory reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I must first clarify one point.

The  activities in Sembawang are not telecast very

often.  Therefore, the Member for Delta had better

go there and make investigations before saying ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Teong. Perhaps the

Parliamentary  Secretary is  the  best  person  to

reply to that criticism. Mr Fong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I really cannot understand

the  logic of some hon. Members. In spite of  what

the  Minister for Finance said yesterday that news

coverage entails a lot of expenses and that  there

is  wastage  of  public funds, hon. Members  still

bring up this matter today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the policy is to provide an objective and

intelligent coverage including local news, news of

our  immediate  neighbours, and of  the  world  at

large.  Usually,  local events  which  take  place

before  six  p.m. are reported the  same  evening,

whereas foreign news usually comes in late and  is

included in the following morning's programme. The

Director of Broadcasting normally decides  whether

an  event is to be covered. His decision is  based

on  the  news-worthiness of the events in relation

to  the  efforts required to cover  them  and  the

availability of facilities. In this connection, he

has classified events into four categories:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) events which must be covered even if

stringer cameramen have to be engaged;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) events which must be covered with the normal

staff;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) events which may be covered for the sake of

variety where facilities can be spared; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) events which should not be covered.



<br><br>Normally, Ministers are given preference in

coverage, but this is not always the case. The

Director of Broadcasting sometimes gives

preference to Members of Parliament if he

considers that such coverage will give variety to

the news programmes and will eliminate monotony.

For example, community centre programmes are

usually monotonous, more so if dinners are

involved which so frequently take place in some

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than two and a half years, the News

Division has been run with only 60 per cent of the

approved establishment and this is bound to affect

the quality of newsreels produced. For example,

out of 11 very important posts of Epglish editors,

only 5 posts have been filled, while the rest have

remained vacant due to the Public Service Com

mission not being able to recruit suitable

candidates. And again for the posts of reporters,

only four are filled by experienced officers and

six by new recruits. There are still vacant posts.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are 12 reporters, they can work in

pairs to cover six local regions. At present, due

to the shortage of experienced staff, it is

extremely difficult to cover all events that take

place in Singapore. However, if advance notice is

given, it can be arranged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to bring up one point, Mr

Speaker, Sir, and that is we must give

consideration to the question of cost in the

coverage of news. I quote an example. For one

minute of usable film material - raw film - the

cost, including processing and printing, is $10.

And the cost of employing stringers (if Members do

understand this term) together with transport is

$55. For the total expenditure of $65, 40 to 50

seconds of news will appear for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



event. In other words, we spend $65 or more for

perhaps 40 seconds' running on the T.V. screen. It

is because of the high cost of employing stringer

cameramen that we have to weigh the importance of

the news before such stringers are sent to cover

the event.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to supplement my answer

further, since both Members appear to be very keen

on T.V. coverage. I will not quote any statistics,

Sir. The coverage for the Member for Delta in the

last 12 months is only one appearance short of

that for the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Health. Next, for coverage of Members

of Parliament, the Member for Sembawang came in

second.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, do you wish to say

anything on this amendment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I would like to say a few words. Regarding

the programmes on T.V, or over the radio, I feel

that the authorities have exercised fair judgment.

This is within their discretion, and I do not like

to comment on it. But I would like to clarify that

it is not because I praise the Government so much

that I had more appearances on T.V. In actual

fact, I had very little chance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I sympathise with what the

Member for Delta has said. Very often I notice

that when she made up herself, she did not appear

on TV!



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I feel

the Member for Bukit Merah perhaps might have

swallowed something wrong. I think the Parlia

mentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture was

perhaps using this opportunity to give some other

answers, because he did not reply to the points I

raised. When I raised them just now, I did not do so for

my own sake. I only said that the authorities

should be fair in their TV coverage of certain

activities in some other constituencies. So

obviously certain matters have not been quite

fairly treated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those times when I appeared on TV, it was

because   the  Ministers  were  around,   and   so

naturally I also appeared. When I invited  the  TV

"kings"  to come and get some plctures,  they  did

not  turn up. I am therefore not satisfied, and  I

would like to put my amendment to a vote.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I appreciate the

dilemma  you are in, Sir, with regard to the  time

allotted  for the speakers, but maybe I could  add

just one point?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Fong, may I

suggest that at a subsequent sitting, you get your

Minister to make a Ministerial statement on  this.

If you do that, you will not make inroads into the

Backbenchers' time on the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> No, Sir, I shall be very

brief.  There  are two considerations.  First,  if

Members  are not active, there is no coverage  for

them.  Second,  I must congratulate some  Members,

particularly the Member for Sembawang who makes it

a  point  to  be  present every time  there  is  a

function  in  which a Minister is  there.  And  if

Members  can take the same initiative,  they  will

get  coverage.  Of course. I will not  be  popular

among the Ministers in suggesting that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the sum to be allocated for

Head  1002 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, community listening sets are usually placed

in  the rural areas so that the rural people  who

do  not  have any radio sets have the opportunity

to  listen to news, current affairs, etc.  But  a

more  important  purpose  is  the  countering  of

subversive   propaganda  by   the   anti-national

elements.  I would like to draw the attention  of

the  Minister to the fact that when  a  community

listening  set is out of order, it usually  takes

months   to   repair  it.  Sir,  with   such   an

inefficient state of affairs still existing, this

House  is  asked to approve a sum of $31,300  for

the  maintenance  of  public listening  sets  and

public address equipment. Is this worth while?

<br><br>3.50 p.m.

reason that the hon. Member has just raised  that

listening   sets  is  being  provided  for.   The

Ministry   of   Culture  maintains   about   193

community listening sets in the Southern Islands

and  in the rural areas of Singapore. These sets

are  installed for the benefit of the people  in

areas with limited communication facilities  and

recreational opportunities. Apart from  being  a

source  of  entertainment, these sets are  there

also to enable residents in this area to receive

news   and  information  broadcast  over   Radio

Singapura.  Of  the 193 sets,  26  of  them  are

installed  on the various islands off  Singapore

and  167  in the rural areas on the main island.

That  these sets are essentially located in  the

rural areas is evident from the fact that 149 of

these  sets  are battery-operated,  because  the

areas  in which they are sited are without  ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Order. Mr Fong, I think you are going

a little too fast and the interpreters are

having difficulty. Would you mind going

a little slower?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Thank you for

your  guidance, Sir,I was racing against  time.

The   normal   practice  is  to  have   community

listening   sets  gradually  withdrawn   wherever

community   centres  are  built  in   the   areas

concerned.   These  sets  are  meant   to   serve

residents  in  areas where social  amenities  are

limited.   It   should  also  be  stressed   that

community   listening  sets  can  serve   as   an

important   medium  of  mass  communication   for

residents  in the rural areas during  periods  of

tension and national emergency, though we do  not

anticipate   any, ln   June   this   year,   on

instructions  from  the Ministry,  a  survey  was

carried  out as to the desirability of  retaining

these  sets at the various points. The result  of

the survey was that there appears to be a need to

withdraw  the  community listening sets.  But  in

areas  where the people are poor and there is  no

electricity and they do not possess the  economic

means  to purchase transistor radios, we  decided

that these sets should be allowed to continue  to

be   used  and  to  be  withdrawn  as  and   when

necessary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the field section of the Ministry of

Culture  is in charge of these community listening

sets  and the maintenance is by a contractor on  a

tender basis, including even the tendering for the

batteries  to be supplied to those sets which  are

battery-operated.  I agree  and,  in  fact,  I  am

grateful to the Member for Changi for bringing  to

my  attention the delay in the maintenance. But  I

would  like to state that sometimes the delay  was

due  to  the non-availability of some spare  parts

for  those  sets, because, as Members know,  these

sets are fairly old. But in most cases I think  it

is  due  to the difficulty of transport in getting

across  the  islands. But I do  not  rule  out  al

together  negligence on the part of the contractor

in maintaining these sets, and I shall instruct my

field  section to be more vigilant and to  keep  a

closer watch on the contractor to see that he  dis

charges  his obligations as stated in the contract

awarded to him.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this head, I shall touch only on a

few  points.  The  first is the "Eat  more  wheat"

campaign  organised by the Broadcasting  Division.

While  I congratulate Radio and T.V. Singapura  on

their efforts in this campaign, I am disturbed  to

note  the  apparent ignorance on the part  of  the

civil servants in appreciating the thinking behind

the Government's intention in this matter. To whom

are  we to beam this campaign? To the rich  or  to

the  poor?  I  have  seen film  shorts  and  heard

announcements on T.V. and over the radio.  Members

will  agree that the campaign seems to be directed

at  the  rich who ironically are already consumers

of wheat and who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



could  afford  to pay for rice at  ten  times  its

present price. In the last campaign listeners  and

viewers were urged to participate in this campaign

and  to submit a recipe, say, for breakfast  at  a

cost  of not more than $3 for four persons. A  few

days  ago  I  heard the same announcement  of  the

second  "Eat  more  wheat"  campaign.  This   time

members  of  the  public are asked  to  prepare  a

breakfast  for  $2. You will agree with  me,  Sir,

that we never spend that much money for breakfast.

In  fact, $3 or, for that matter, $2 is what  some

working family spend for the whole day's meals for

the family. I am not criticising the campaign. But

I am not happy at the way it is being handled. For

instance,  pau. Do you know how much  we  have  to

spend  on  the meat, chicken, prawns,  eggs,  etc.

before  we  can make a pau? Do we really  have  to

exhort  the  poor  people to save  more  money  by

eating  wheat and then mislead them into  spending

several  times  more on meat?  Does  the  Minister

sincerely believe that the poor people can  really

afford this? Of course, if every citizen draws the

same salary as the Director of Broadcasting, we do

not need this campaign at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Madam Chan.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I only

wish  to ask about the campaign to eat more wheat.

Do  the flour mills pay for the advertising  cost,

because  this campaign is beneficial to the  flour

manufacturers? I want to know how  much  they  are

subsidising  the running cost of the advertisement

over T.V.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Tang See Chim):</b>

If no other Member wishes to speak, I will call on

the Minister to reply. Mr Lee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Culture (Mr Lee Khoon

Choy):  Sir, I would like to thank the Member  for

Aljunied for his suggestion and criticism.  But  I

would  like to point out that the $2 eat-more wheat

competition      is      meant      for       five



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



persons. That means each person will pay  only  40

cents. If it is meant for the rich, I do not think

a rich man will have a breakfast costing 40 cents.

In any case, if the Member for Aljunied has got  a

better  recipe, or if any other person can have  a

better recipe to bring

down  the cost, we are only too willing to  accept

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question raised by the Member for

Delta,  my  information is that we do not  collect

any advertisement fee from any wheat firm. But  if

any particular firm or producer of wheat wishes to

advertise his brand of wheat, then he has  to  pay

for the advertisement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1003 -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1959, the Government announced that

it  would  be building as many creches as possible

in  order  to  reduce the burden of working  class

women  so  that  they could concentrate  on  their

jobs.  However, up to now only a few creches  have

been built.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the staff at these creches

should change their attitude. The reason is that I

have been told by many parents, whose children are

in these creches, that the people in

charge are very proud and the treatment they  give

to  the little children leaves much to be desired.

This  attitude is not suitable to our  custom  and

environment, because what they learn is  from  the

Western  countries. Many of our  customs  are  not

practised in these creches. As a result, from  the

Asian  point of view, this causes a great deal  of

inconvenience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



I  wish  the Minister can pay some attention  to

this  matter.  I would also like to  know  whether

creches  will  be  established  in  other   areas,

especially the industrial areas, e.g., the  Jurong

industrial site.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir,  just  now the Member for Delta has mentioned

that  in 1959 we said that we wanted to build many

creches  but  she did not specify the  number.  At

present,  we  have ten creches. I agree  with  her

that  we  should have more. The reason is that  we

have  a  lot  of workers in Singapore who  have  a

large number of children. At home they cannot look

after the children properly. Therefore, they  have

to  put  them  in  their relative's  house  or  in

creches  if  there are any. This will  bring  some

convenience to the families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta also wants to know whether

it  is possible to build creches in the industrial

sites.  If  there  are suitable  sites,  then,  of

course, our department will consider this problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member claims that the attitude of the

people  in  charge  of  these  creches  and  their

educational background are not suitable to our way

of life. We are the first to oppose the problem of

haughtiness.  In  recruiting  the  staff  for  the

creches,  we subject them to a course of  courtesy

training  to see if they are suitable in  handling

children and their parents. However, perhaps there

are  some  people in charge of these  creches  who

make  mistakes in their dealings with other people

because  of the many problems they have to tackle.

If  the  Member for Delta can point out the people

who  are guilty in this respect, then I would like

to  take steps to rectify this matter. Our country

does not permit this sort of attitude.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Western habits or customs, I think there

may he some misunderstanding. As far as the people

working in these creches are concerned, out of ten

members  of  the  staff, about  five  are  Chinese

educated.  There are 12 assistant instructors  who

are  Chinese educated. As our country is a  multi-racial one, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



use  a  number of languages in these creches,  and

the   activities  in  these  creches  involve  the

customs of other races. This is unavoidable. Since

our  country is multi-racial, we carry out  multi-racial programmes in these creches. Similarly,  if

the Member for Delta has some good suggestions, we

will, of course, consider them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1003 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1152.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concerns the investigators in the Public

Assistance Section. We all know that if  a  person

is  not  really desperate and completely  helpless

and  cannot go on living, he will not  go  to  the

Public  Assistance Section. Every  self-respecting

person  who goes to that section realises that  it

is  a very humiliating experience. So unless he is

completely  helpless, he will not take this  step.

As  a  result, he will register as a recipient  of

public  assistance if there is a need  for  it.  I

want  to  point  out  that  recipients  of  public

assistance get more if some members in the  family

have T.B. If she is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



widow with a few dependent children, then she gets

$35 plus $5 for each child a month. So at the most

she gets about $50 or $60 a month. Under these circumstances, there is not enough to eat. Of course,

the  family will not die of starvation.  But  this

sum is really not enough and, therefore, the widow

washes  clothes for other people in order to  earn

about $10 or $15 a month. But if the investigators

in the Public Assistance Section find out that she

washes clothes for people, they will reduce or cut

off  this  public assistance saying that  she  has

already found work. Actually what she gets is only

$10  or  $15 a month for washing clothes.  Out  of

this  $15, she has to spend a few dollars on  soap

and  other things. What she is left with  is  only

very  little. Actually it is doubtful whether  she

has  a  job or not. I think we should have a clear

definition of what is work and what is not work. I

think  when a person earns about $15 a  month,  it

should  not  affect her chances of getting  public

assistance. In fact, it is a good thing that  such

people do some work. Since they do not really  get

enough  from  public assistance, the supplementary

income that they earn will come in very useful.  I

think   this   is   a   good  thing.   But   these

investigators are too rigid in their  approach  to

this  problem and they just carry out their duties

inflexibly.  As  a  result,  these  recipients  of

public assistance are adversely affected and  they

often come and complain to me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my constituency this problem is

very  common. After the Bukit Ho Swee  fire,  many

families  did not have enough income and  many  of

them  were  jobless. So they had to  approach  the

Public  Assistance  Section for  relief.  But  the

conditions  are  just as what I  have  said.  Very

often  we  come across this problem.  I  hope  the

investigators  in  the Public  Assistance  Section

from   now   on   will  not  be  too   strict   or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



too rigid in their approach to this problem. If

they find out that these people have some sort of

work and if they have proof that they are earning

$100 per month, then, of course, they can completely stop or reduce the assistance. But if the

recipients of public assistance only wash clothes

and earn a bit of money. I do not think the Public

Assistance Section should be too strict on them. I

hope the Minister will give me a satisfactory

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, just now I have already said that public

assistance is given only to needy cases. When we

do so, we must take into consideration that the

applicants are really poor and in actual need of

the assistance. There are some people who become

dependent on public assistance if they are given a

large sum and they do not want to go and look for

work to maintain themselves. These are the

principles that the Public Assistance Section has

to bear in mind. I agree with the Member for

Delta. There have been such instances mentioned by

the Member not only in her constituency but also

in other constituencies as well. We have found

that some of the members of the public that we

meet in our "Meet the people sessions" can

actually work and the wages they receive are

actually higher than what they have told us.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in September, we reinvestigated 44

cases and found that many of them were not true

because they continued to receive public assist

ance even after being employed. If we did not re-investigate these cases, large sums of money would

have been paid out to these recipients of public

assistance under false pretences. In November, 37

cases were re-investigated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has said that

we should consider the cases of some poor people

who have to wash clothes in order to supplement

their income. If these cases are true, of course,

we will consider them. But if after investigating,

we find that they are actually drawing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



a higher income, we will reduce their public

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has also complained that the department

concerned has been too rigid in going about its

business. I hope she can give us details so that

we can investigate whether or not such an allega

tion is true. Of course, we will take appropriate

action to deal with each case. Normally, the

people report false figures to us.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every effort has been made by the

Government to make Singapore a garden city by the

planting of trees and flowers and the building of

fountains, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to bring up is that ihere is

lack of co-ordination and no proper planning

between the Parks Division and the P.W.D.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that more trees should be planted

in the town areas and not in the rural areas like

Changi, Choa Chu Kang and Jalan Kayu. In fact, the

people of Choa Chu Kang ask for water,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



but they get trees instead! All these con

stituencies are supposed to be semi-jungle and the

trees have not been properly planted. For example,

a small tree is planted about 1� yards away from a

lamp-post. Within a year, the tree grows up and it

engulfs the lamp-post or blocks out the light.

What is worse is this. The Parks Division plants a

tree today. But one week later, the P.W.D., on a

programme of widening the roads, pull it out and

throw it away and carry on with their work. This

wastage of money is, shall I say, unpardonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to pay serious

attention to all these things and I hope that

steps will be taken to put them right.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree very much

with what the Member for Changi has said. But I

would like to speak on the planting of flowers and

plants and the building of small parks. I feel

that they should reflect an Eastern colour and

tone in order that Singapore should be the garden

city of Asia. But at present, the small parks and

the planting of flowers, and so on, follow Western

lines. So when tourists come here for a visit,

they do not enjoy the scenery as it will appear

too westernised. So I feel that we must introduce

an Eastern colour to the scenery. Singapore is in

Asia and therefore we should put up things that

are typical of this part of the world in order to

attract more tourists. The Chief Parks Officer has

learnt a lot from the West and may have acquired a

Western outlook. Perhaps we can encourage him to

go to some Asian countries to acquire an artistic

taste so that he can add more Asian colour to our

trees and flowers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has also said that the

trees are planted haphazardly. I do not know

whether this is an inheritance from the colonial

era: more plants and flowers are planted in areas

where there are more rich people staying. The

flowers are very well planted and looked after at

road circuses or junctions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



in areas where the rich people stay. But in areas

where the poor people stay, the circuses are not

planted with beautiful flowers. Sir, this is not

an exaggeration on my part. If we go round the

island, we can see for ourselves that better

flowers are planted in areas occupied by the

middle class than in areas occupied by the poor

people. For example, Delta Circus is in one such

area occupied by the poor people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will direct his attention to

these matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b>

Sir, some time last year, while driving along

Collyer Quay, one could see beautiful white boxes

of flowers. This added more beauty to the city,

particularly to the nerve centre of our economy -

Raffles Place and Collyer Quay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They all died!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> May I know

what has caused the disappearance of these white

boxes? On the other hand, while driving along

Alexandra Road, one can also see flower boxes made

of bricks, but, to my mind, they do not look

beautiful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> They look like

coffins!



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, let me first reply to the Member

for Mountbatten who has complained that flowers

along Collyer Quay have disappeared. The Member

for Changi thinks that perhaps they might have

wilted away. All these complaints are not correct.

In the past, the flowers planted in pots were

grown as an experiment. Now that the experiment

has proved successful, we realise that flowers can

be planted in pots and beds. But we also realise

that if flowers or trees are planted along the

centre of a road, many motorists will be

inconvenienced as their vision will be affected

and this might cause accidents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta has said that our flowers

and trees should have more Eastern colour or tone.

It is really very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



difficult to distinguish between what is Eastern

and what is Western. In fact, many of the trees

and flowers that are planted are of Singapore

origin. How can we say how many are from the

Botanic Gardens or how many are from elsewhere?

Sir, we may know the origins of plants and

seedlings, but I think it is very difficult to

distinguish between whether they are of Eastern or

Western origins.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the planting of more trees and flowers in

areas occupied by rich people, I think there is

some misunderstanding. Many tourists coming here

have described Singapore as a green city with

flowers and plants everywhere. In recent years, we

have planted innumerable trees and flowers. We did

this without taking into consideration whether an

area is occupied by rich or poor people. Most hon.

Members, including myself, do not come from rich

families. We do not concentrate the planting of

trees and flowers only in areas occupied by rich

people and neglect those areas occupied by poor

people. This is not in accordance with our policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has complained that some

trees are planted near lamp-posts. I would like to

point out that thousands of plants are sometimes

planted at a time. As a result of development, the

residents of certain areas ask for lamp-posts to

be put up. But in the meantime, the plants have

grown into small trees. I think that is the actual

situation. I will be very glad if the hon. Member

can pin-point any such case and give me more

details.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has complained that in

certain areas we do not provide the people with

water but with trees. I should say that although

water is very important, trees are also important.

Our lives would be monotonous without trees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has also said that at

times the trees planted have to be removed due to

road widening. This is necessary because of road

and other developments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Member will

give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b> remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, I am afraid you will have

to wait.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

As a result of road expansion and so on, sometimes

there is a need to remove the trees which had been

planted.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if there are new houses coming up in Bukit Ho

Swee, Alexandra, very soon we will plant trees

there. And it is inevitable that in the course of

our development in certain areas, the trees that

have already been planted might have to be

removed. In actual fact, many Members of

Parliament have helped our Ministry to carry out

tree-planting campaigns. I remember in one

constituency the campaign has been very active. So

it is not quite correct to bring this matter up in

this House. It would be better for us to go out

and see for ourselves the lamp posts and trees. If

the Member for Changi can pin-point the particular

incidents that have happened, we will, of course,

go there and investigate and put matters right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I think the

Parliamentary Secretary has misunderstood what I

have said just now. I stated that today you plant

a tree and about a week later in the widening of

the road the P.W.D, move in and pull it out and

chuck it away. There is no co-ordination between

the Parks Division and the P.W.D. If money is to

be spent in planting a tree and then pulling it

out again for the purpose of widening the roads,

what is the use of spending the money?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In places like Coronation Road, the

Parliamentary Secretary can take a car and drive

down there immediately. In Swan Lake Avenue, where

I live, you can see that the lamp posts in just

about three months are totally covered by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



trees. That is what I have seen. The Member for

Thomson has informed me that the same thing

happens in Choa Chu Kang, and he can substantiate

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Parliamentary

Secretary can make this point very clear. I am not

against such form of development, but I do not

feel that at this time we should make some

sacrifice in the midst of development of our

country, What I am against is the fact that trees

planted today are removed about a week later;

there must be some dislocation somewhere.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak

on the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary

that there is no difference between a rich man's

area and a poor man's area. I think there is a

difference. Just look at Tanglin Road. Look at all

the trees and flowers planted there, and compare

them with the trees and flowers planted along

Bukit Ho Swee. They are not quite the same. The

flowers in Tanglin are expensive, beautiful, and

of a better type. I cannot describe them, but I

can at least see an aesthetic difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the trees and flowers in Tanglin,

there are also a few rocks and stones, piled up in

the shape of a man, and on top there is a little

fountain. It is a beautiful thing. However, we in

the poor man's area do not get such things but

only a few trees with leaves, grass, and that is

all-very poor types of flowers and plants. I think

the Minister himself should go there and have a

look. If I were a cameraman, I would take some

photographs and show them to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, if you look at this problem in

terms of this area or that area, or in terms of

constituencies, it is not right. You should look

at it from the point of view of Singapore as a

whole. We cannot have a national theatre in every

part of Singapore. We cannot have in every

constituency a very good fountain. For example, in

my constituency,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



there is the Jalan Besar Stadium. But

it is very old and dilapidated. We should look at

it from the point of view of the whole country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of principle, if the Government has

discriminated against the poor man's areas in

favour of the rich man's areas, then this is

definitely a mistake. But from the point of view

of the whole of Singapore, if you want to beautify

the areas you cannot actually consider where this

development should take place. Take, for example,

Thomson. In the past there were many attap huts

there, but now it is quite a beautiful area. There

is a reservoir; there is a beautiful roundabout

with lots of flowers and plants; and there are

trees. All this was done by the Government. We do

not consider whether this is a poor man's area or

not, or that if it is a poor man's area, then we

will plant less there. There has never been such

an idea from the beginning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. The Member for Changi has

pointed out the lack of co-ordination between the

Departments.

I agree with him that in some instances

it is so. But the situation is this. If we have to

plant some thousands of trees, of course, we are

liable to make some mistakes. We cannot be 100 per

cent perfect in everything we do. This niistake

has occurred in two or three places only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In many places.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Now we have more than 10,000 trees planted. So a

few mistakes are unavoidable. However, the work of

planting trees is being transferred to the

Ministry of National Development, because the

Ministry is in charge of housing. The P.W.D, is in

charge of engineering, and engineering and plant

ing do not come under the same work group.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, there are roadside trees

which are not planted by the Parks and Recreation

Department. They are planted by the P.W.D. If they

plant a tree today the next week they pull it out,

I have no answer for that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the town centre

in Raffles Quay, Collyer Quay and the surrounding

areas, can the Minister for Social Affairs

encourage the firms and banks in this area to put

some flowers and plants at their entrances so that

these could beautify their buildings somewhat?

Tourists from overseas, including businessmen,

will be glad to see this, and it will at the same

time create a good impression. This is a small

suggestion that I wish to make.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, that is a very good

suggestion. But the question is: who is going to

maintain all those plants? If the Minister for

Finance can give me more money to recruit more

labourers, I can do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I say that we encourage

them to place flower boxes in front of their

buildings, as the banks and commercial houses do,

on their own account. We just give the

encouragement!



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> We will do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> By a combination of circumstances,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1006 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1006 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to bring up three points.

Firstly, I understand that the Director of the

Botanic Gardens is an expatriate officer. Can the

Minister inform this House whether there is a

contract of service for the post of the Director

of the Botanic Gardens? And, if so, when is the

contract due to expire? Moreover, can the Minister

also enlighten us



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



whether any of our local men of this calibre can

be found to substitute the expatriate officer when

his contract of service expires?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I wish to touch on the useful purposes

of the Botanic Gardens. As far as I know, the

Botanic Gardens is being used as a recreational

ground with its aesthetic virtues of beauty and

peace, and it also keeps a herbarium of a good

collection of specimen plants with facilities

available to students from other countries to

study and to do research work. What I wish to know

from the Minister is that, in terms of public

expenditure, what benefit can Singapore derive

from the results of the research?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that the knowledge of the research is

useful, cannot this work be undertaken by the

University of Singapore and Nanyang University

where there are Botany Departments doing similar

research? is it, therefore, not possible for the

Botanic Gardens to be placed under our own

institutions of higher studies so that the

knowledge from research studies of flora can be

best disseminated to students of botany?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is now a dollar-earning industry

in orchids which can bring extra income. The

cultivation and research work in orchids are also

being undertaken by the Botanic Gardens. In my

opinion, this type of research work should be

handed over to the Primary Production Department

which has scientists and research stations in Sem

bawang and also has the facilities to train

extension officers to teach the local farmers to

grow orchids on a commercial basis.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If orchid growing could be commercialised, it

would increase our export trade. To illustrate my

point, if rubber or Hevea Braziliensis is still

today confined to the Botanic Gardens, there would

be no rubber industry today. Similarly, orchid

growing and breeding should be widely

commercialised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope, Sir, that our Minister will

consider these matters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in reply to the hon. Member for Mountbatten,

1 have to advise that the Director of the Botanic

Gardens is an expatriate officer on the permanent

establishment. Under the terms of Retirement from

the Public Service Compensation Ordinance, 1956,

he was offered a full career prospect till normal

retirement. He will reach the age of 55 years in

December 1969. I wish to add that the Director is

a biologist of international recognition. He is a

member of several international scientific

societies. He is wholly dedicated to the

maintenance of the highest standard of research

and the advancement of the international

reputation of our Botanic Gardens and the position

of public esteem and utility of our Republic. He

has not taken any Malayanisation compensation that

was optionally available to him under the

Retirement from the Public Service Compensation

Ordinance, unlike so many others who have done. He

has steered the Botanic Gardens through a very

difficult time of staff transition from expatriate

to local officers in senior posts. As a result of

the overseas training he has arranged for the

senior staff, there is a highly qualified succession available on his retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The professional contact of the Botanic Gardens

has been expanded not only within the Republic but

also with botanical institutions in almost every

country of the world. This is an aspect of the

Republic's international collaboration and is

contributory to our prestige and international

image.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point of the motion, I have to

state that the Singapore herbarium holds the

second largest collection of plant specimens in

the tropics. It is unique as a store-house of

knowledge of the plant resources of South-east

Asia. It provides an advisory and educational

service on plants and plant products. This service

is made use of by innumerable local residents such

as school children and school teachers, university

undergraduates, post-graduates and lecturers,

doctors, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



police, businessmen and hundreds of members of the

general public, with an interest in plants. The

many overseas students who come to the Singapore

herbarium do so because it has unrivalled

facilities for study but they only come under

Singapore Government sponsorship. This is an

aspect of our Republic's contribution to regional

mutual aid and developnient under the Colombo Plan

and other international agreements. The acceptance

of foreign students has never been to the

exclusion of any local students. The transfer of

the herbarium to one of the universities in

Singapore is impracticable on two grounds.

Firstly, the living collection in the gardens and

the dry collectons in the herbarium are ipter-related and should not be separated, if they were

separated, both would lose their value. Secondly,

the Botanic Gardens, being a Government depart

nient, directly serves the public. Both

universities are exclusive bodies with

responsibility principally towards themselves and

the students. The public demand for the Botanic

Gardens service increases yearly, and with the

regular rise in the standard of living this trend

will continue. A denial of this service by putting

the facilities out of public control would be

indefensible. It is Government's policy to see

that this service is maintained by retaining the

facilities in a Government department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third point of the motion, it must be

pointed out that all the basic research into

orchid cultivation in Singapore was done by the

Botanic Gardens. The first species collection was

begun a century ago and hybridising and laboratory

culture have been carried on since 1928. It is

this work which has been the sole foundation for

the present day thriving of the orchid nursery

industry. Essentially in this aspect of their work

the Botanic Gardens are engaged on (1) the

establishment and expansion of the living

collection of orchid species, since it is only the

natural species that the first hybridising can be

done; (2) the introduction of exotic species, one

reason for which the Botanic Gardens' worldwide

connections were developed; (3)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



acclimatisation; (4) methods of cultivation; (5)

hybridisation; and (6) selection. All these stages

must be gone through before desirable and

commercially exploitable strains can be produced.

This is basic research work which has a clearly

economic end and it is being carried out with

increasing tempo and success by the Botanic

Gardens. In this connection, the function of the

Primary Production Department is to assist the

farmers by the provision of materials for planting

on a large scale, not on a small scale, and with

an advisory service. This is applied technology

and not basic research, and it is a cashing in on

the pioneering done by the Botanic Gardens. This

is a perfectly correct process. And there is no

overlap by these two departments in their

essential activities. In this connection, the

Botanic Gardens undertakes identification,

description of new species and new hybrids in

accordance with the requirements of the

international code of nomenclature and the

registration of new hybrid names with the

international registration authority. This is both

an essential part of the Botanic Gardens research

procedure and public service. Since it is freely

available to and constantly used by the public and

orchid nurseries, the Primary Production

Department employs no botanist or horticulturist

and it has neither expertise nor experience to do

these things. Since there is no overlap of

functions and there would be a definite loss of

research efficiency and the loss of public

amenities by transferring the Botanic Gardens

orchid research to the Primary Production

Department, there is no intention to alter the

present existing arrangement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second and third points raised by the hon.

Member seem to me to iniply a lack of

understanding of the importance of the Singapore

Botanic Gardens. I wish to take this opportunity

to state that the activities are directed towards

meeting the demands of the public in the following

service:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) by a botanical service, educational or research;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) by a horticultural service, educational or research;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) by a skilled supply of advisory service; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) by the provision of recreational grounds of a higher status than that of an ordinary park in the city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Botanic Gardens be split, the

herbarium to one of the universities, and

horticultural research to the Primary Production

Department, or the functions materially change,

then these four avenues of service which the

public at present enjoy would cease to exist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

quite satisfied with the answer given by

Parliamentary Secretary. First of all, he has not

answered my first point. That is, whether we can

get a man of suitable calibre to take over from

the Director since his services are about to

expire in 1969. The second point is, for the

moment, I am not saying that the herbarium should

be separated from the Botanic Gardens. I say that

the herbarium itself inside the Botanic Gardens

should be placed at the disposal of the university

which has a Department of Botany so that students

can study it. At the present moment, very few

people are making use of this herbarium, let alone

those people going down to the park to enjoy the

quiet atmosphere. Those are park goers. I also go

to the park and enjoy looking at the life plant,

as the Parliamentary Secretary has said. But, on

the other hand, who is interested in the

herbarium? How many people are making use of it?

The point is this. I am only suggesting that this

herbarium should be placed at the disposal of the

university so that students will benefit from the

research. That is all I want to clarify.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I have answered his

questions very well, Sir. First, he says that the

herbarium is closed to outsiders and that only few

persons are using it. I say that if you are a

layman, you will not know how to use it. If you

are interested and you are either an undergraduate

in a university or an expert in plant life and all

that, definitely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



the herbarium is open to them. In fact, it has

been serving thousands of people. People from all

over the world are using our facilities. They can

write in. Some people pay a special visit. And the

Member says I did not answer him concerning our

Director. I have already answered him. We have a

very capable person understudying his work at the

moment. When the Director retires, we will, in

fact, lose a very capable man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1105 -



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1105

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to take too much time on

this matter. I merely like to ask the Minister for

Law and National Development why many areas of

Crown land are still vacant and not put to any

use. The residents in these areas are badly in

need of these pieces of land. But the Government

wants to requisition such pieces of land. It seems

to be quite contrary to the desire of the people

and also it is not quite proper because there are

so many pieces of vacant land the Government can

make use of.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we

all know that the P.A.P. Government is a clean, honest and effective

government. We have been elected by the people to

run the government because of our qualities which

I have already mentioned. But I understand there

are still many cases in the Land Office on which

decision has been pending for quite a long time.

For instance, in my constituency there is a

resident who has a piece of private land. He wants

to exchange it for Crown land with the Government.

But the matter has been delayed for two years

without any reply given to him. There are also

cases where people apply to rebuild their houses

but consideration of their applications has also

been delayed for a very long time. Where is the

efficiency we are talking about? I would like to

know whether the Land Office are under-staffed. Or

perhaps they are deliberately delaying their work

in order to get some benefit out of certain

quarters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about unlawful :structures.

We know that the general standard of education of

the people in the rural areas is low and they do

not quite understand or realise Government's

policies or administration. When they find that

the roofs of their houses leak, they will repair

them themselves, if the inspectors of the Land

Office find this out, the persons concerned will

be ordered to dismantle what they have done, or

else a fine will be imposed on them. We know that

the rural people have been struggling hard to make

a living out of the land and have spent their hard-earned money on repairing their houses. So if you

ask them to dismantle or demolish what they have

already repaired, it would cause them a great

loss. Why are the inspectors not required to give

them notices in advance? Only when adequate

notices have been given can the inspectors fine

the offenders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is about complaints made by the

rural people against land inspectors who very

often come in close contact with the rural people.

Very often they lack courtesy. In my constituency,

I have received several complaints against the

attitude of land inspectors. I hope the Minister

can give me a satisfactory reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, the Land Office is in charge of Crown land in

the State. This is an important task, no doubt. In

the rural areas there are also pieces of Crown

land. The Government has already made its plan in

regard to these areas of land. Some pieces of land

are meant for future development. Some marshy

lands are not meant for any use. I remember last

year I had occasion to raise this question,

namely, the department concerned should realise

that Singapore is developing. So the situation is

entirely different from what was obtained 10 or 15

years ago. Singapore's Master Plan will be

reviewed every five years. Whenever there is a

review, changes will be made to it. These changes

should not only take into consideration major

projects but consideration should also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



be given to minor projects. Many areas which were

not meant for development have recently been

developed into housing estates by the Housing

Board, and other social amenities have also been

built. We are also facing the same problems. There

are many cases of residents applying for public

utility services such as the supply of

electricity, water, house numbers and so on, but

without getting replies to their requests. I hope

the Minister can give us a satisfactory reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> First, may I deal with the

Member for Delta? Somehow I have a feeling that

she did not really have much to say. She was

merely moving an amendment in her name to give

other Back-benchers an opportunity to say what

they wanted to. She said that we were acquiring

vacant pieces of land and yet there were many

pieces of land not occupied in Singapore which

belong to the Government. This must be as it is.

Certain lands are reserved for future development,

and on some, development is not even allowed,

maybe because it is agricultural land or a green

belt. We cannot have buildings on every acre of

land in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may come to the Member for Jurong. He

referred to an honest P.A.P. Government and said

that there were many cases pending. I do not know

what cases he is referring to. But he mentioned

one in particular about a resident who desired to

exchange his piece of land with Crown land. Well,

it is not the usual practice of Government to

exchange Crown land for private pieces of land.

But we sometimes do this to accommodate the

private owner. He said that this particular case

has been pending for two years, and he thought

that delay might mean corruption. Mr Speaker,

Sir, I said many a time in this House that making

general allegations of corruption in this House

gets us nowhere. If you have a specific complaint,

make it and the C.P.I.B. will investigate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also referred to many other cases of owners

wishing to rebuild their houses and referred to

delay. According to him, this delay was purposely

imposed so that perhaps the staff of the Land

Office could get some benefit. Here again if he

has any specific instances, let my Ministry know.

We can investigate. He referred not only to the

rebuilding of houses but repairs of buildings and

1 assume, as we are discussing Head 1105 - Land

Office - that he refers to structures on State

land; otherwise he would be out of order. When

State land is occupied, it is usually occupied on

what is called a temporary occupation licence for

which a fee is payable and for which certain

conditions are laid down. If the licensee desires

to repair his house or to extend it, then he has

to get the pernhission of the owner, the Land

Office. We are not against poor tenants or poor

licensees rebuilding or repairing their houses.

But licensees are usually compensated when they

are ejected, and the bigger the house, the greater

the compensation. It is for this reason that these

conditions are imposed so that the Land Office

knows what is happening to the particular piece of

land which is let out on licence.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious allegation by the Member for

Jurong is that no notices are given when officers

of the Land Office move in to demolish buildings

and that there is a lack of courtesy on the part

of land officers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):



On a point of clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Perhaps the Minister has misunderstood what I

said. I did not actually say that no notices were

given. What I actually meant was that as the

general education of the population in the rural

areas is of a low standard, they are not very

conversant with Government procedure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



relating to applications for structural changes to

their houses. When such structural changes have

been made and are discovered by the land officers,

the occupants are fined, although they may have

received notices pertaining to their applications.

What I really want to know is, why cannot the Land

Office send out more inspectors to enlighten the

rural people on the procedure to be followed

before making any structural changes to their

houses? If the Ministry can do this, the rural

people will not suffer financially.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad at least

that the Member has clarified this and made it

clear that the Land Office does not demolish

structures without adequate notices, in fact, many

an application for extension is given provided the

circumstances warrant it. But to plead ignorance

on the part of rural dwellers is, I think, not the

basic cause. Anyone who is a licensee of

Government land is issued with a piece of paper

called a "Temporary Occupation Licence" and on

this licence are recorded the terms and

conditions. Surely, however ignorant a licensee

may be, he can enquire from the Land Office when

he gets his licence as to what these conditions

mean, or he can enquire from the Member for Jurong

as to what these terms mean. But it is usual in

Singapore for anyone who breaches the law to plead

ignorance. So many pieces of land are let out on

T.O.L.s. So many unauthorised houses are built.

The usual answer is ignorance. The sending out of

land officers to educate the rural folks is not,

in my view, the answer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may deal with the Member for Sembawang, he

made a rather general statement that the Land

Office should realise that Singapore is

developing. I can assure him that we do realise

that Singapore is developing. He talked about

electricity and house numbers. Electricity is a

matter for the P.U.B. and the allocation of house

numbers is a matter for the Property Tax

Department. It is not my habit to hide under the

skirt of another Minister ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I would also like to clarify. I did not

mention anything about property tax. I am afraid

the Minister has perhaps misunderstood me. I said

that Singapore's Master Plan provides that certain

areas should be green zones and that marshy land

should not be developed for the construction of

buildings. But I never mentioned anything about

property tax.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Perhaps I heard the translation

wrongly, Sir. But the Member for Sembawang talked

about certain areas being marked out as zoned

areas under the Master Plan. It has still got

nothing to do with the Land Office. I am merely

saying that if you are interested in electricity,

it is the P.U.B, who deals with it, and that if

you are interested in house numbers, it is the

Property Tax Department who handles this matter.

These amendments should have been moved when the

relevant Ministry was being discussed. But please

do not think that I do not have the answers to the

questions and that, therefore, I am shifting the

blame on to another Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a developing

country which is not behind in modern technology,

so much so that the central abattoirs are using

modern equipment. I wish to know whether the

slaughtering of cattle, cows, goats and sheep is

carried out according to Muslim rites.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can

assure the Member for Kampong Kernbangan that the

slaughtering of cattle, cows, goats and sheep is

carried out in accordance with Muslim rites for

the benefit of the Muslim population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim Advisory Board was consulted on the

operation of the Jurong Abattoir to ensure that

Muslim requirements are complied with. In fact,

one of the requirements is that workers carrying

out the slaughtering of animals eaten by Muslims

must be approved persons. The slaughtering of pigs

is completely separated from that of cattle, cows,

goats and sheep to satisfy religious requirements.

In fact, the Muslim Advisory Board has been

frequently consulted on various aspects of the

slaughter-house.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objectives of the construction of

the new abattoir are to improve the hygienic

standard of slaughter and to promote the canning

and processing of meat and meat products for

export. The Member can rest assured that in the

attainment of these objectives, we have not

forgotten Muslim rites and wishes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2188.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this subhead, I see that a sum of

$1.7 million is sought to provide free water

supply at public standpipes. As far as I know  - I

have the privilege of being a member of the U.R.S.C. - I understand that about 150 public standpipes

have been removed, sometimes without the knowledge

of Members of Parliament. I think the Minister

himself is also faced with the same problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he explain why a sum of $1.7 million is

still provided for next year, although about 150

standpipes have already been removed?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2188."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I call upon the Minister to reply, may I

just say that if you ask for trees in the future,

Mr Sim, the standpipes may be removed! Mr

Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think

the Member for Changi is well aware of the

Government's policy, which is to cut down

consumption of water at public standpipes. At the

moment, it has been raining so heavily in

Singapore and South Johore that we are in the

happy position of having all our reservoirs in

Johore full to the brim, and in Singapore, both

MacRitchie and Peirce Reservoirs have about 90 per

cent of water capacity.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have decided to cut down the number of

standpipes - not to take water away from the

population, but to remove the standpipes and

instead supply water direct to houses. So that if

in the future - this is a big "if" - we have to impose water rationing, there will

be less confusion at stand-pipes and it will be

easier to impose a fair method of water rationing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is right when he says

that 150 standpipes have been removed this year.

In fact, the correct figure is 154. But before action is taken to remove public

standpipes, circulars are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



issued by the Secretary of the Urban and Rural

Services Committee informing Members of

Parliament, and through them the Citizens'

Consultative Committees of various constituencies,

that certain standpipes will have to be removed.

The circular points out that representations

should be made to the ad hoc committee which is

looking after this matter, that these

representations will be considered, and that no

stand-pipes will be removed until further notice

is given to the effect that any representation has

been accepted or rejected. But I can assure the

hon. Member for Changi that the policy is to

remove a standpipe only if it serves very few

people or, if it serves many people, not to remove

it until these people have alternative supplies of

water. If any standpipe has been removed without a

notice, or removed after a notice had been served

and representations made, then the standpipe was

removed by mistake. And all the M.P. has to do is

to point out that mistake and the standpipe will

be restored. It is quite easy to seal and then

unseal a standpipe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end, the Member may he interested

to know that I am not in charge of standpipes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, I

would like the Minister to elaborate further. If

154 standpipes have been removed this year, why

should the same amount of $1.7 million still

appear in the Estimates? Since we have cut down

the number of standpipes, we should cut down the

amount.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As the Minister refuses to hide

behind the skirts of other Ministers, I am sure he

will be willing to answer that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> In removing standpipes, it does not

mean that we are not putting up new ones. Many

hawkers who sell food at their stalls require

standpipes. And it is our policy, if possible, to

have clean food. The Member for Changi knows the

hawker situation in Singapore

-  all he has to do is to take a trip round the

town at night and he will see



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



hundreds of hawkers. Car parks used as

car parks during the day are used by hawkers at

night. These hawkers need standpipes, and certain

kampongs do need standpipes, as they have no alter

native sources of water supply. Hence,

the same figure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1108

be reduced by $l00*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Teong Eng Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main points that I want to raise.

First, we all know that our urban renewal scheme

is something that we all look forward to in the

future. Actually at the moment we can see very

clearly that Singapore has many tall buildings and

we are continuing to build blocks of tall

buildings. This goes to show that the Singapore

Qovernment is achieving a great deal. It also goes

to show that the Ministry of National Development

has achieved great success in this direction. Not

one of us can criticise what has been going

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few questions which perhaps

have been neglected. When we want to carry out

urban renewal, we have to resettle the people

affected, and this problem of resettlement has

been solved quite successfully and satisfactorily

in the past. As a rule, most people are quite

satisfied. However, in the last year or so this

matter has been neglected. I do not know what is

the reason for this neglect, and whether the

Minister is aware of the causes. I do not think I

need to point it out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the officials in charge of resettlement

have a different attitude nowadays. They seem to

treat the people affected in a very harsh and

demanding way. They just tell them to move out and

to resettle. They give them a period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



of one month or so to move, and these people have

to move away. Usually the people would like to

have suitable alternative accommodation, but these

resettlement officials usually cast aside their

complaints and carry out their course of action.

Of course, sometimes the people are wrong to

complain, but sometimes their grievances are

legitimate. However, the officials do not consider

their grievances. What happens is this, in

the old days we used to have an Opposition Party.

However, now we are all in the same Party. Those

Members sitting opposite are all in our Party.

Perhaps because of this, the resettlement officers

are not afraid to carry out any harsh measures.

And because of this, our Government has received a

great deal of unnecessary criticism. Of course,

the aim of the Government is good. It is to

provide accommodation for them. But unfortunately

the attitude of the officials in charge has given

rise to a lot of criticism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that in the course of

resettlement the people incur a loss. It is like

this. There are two different conditions of

resettlement. First, when Government requisitions

a piece of land, the people who live on it have,

according to the time given to them in the notice,

to leave and go elsewhere. Second, suppose the

land belongs to the Housing Board and suppose at

the time of the construction of the new buildings

they find that a lot of houses have been built on

it, as a result of which a lot of land is taken

up, and they find it is necessary to demolish

these buildings. Of course, if we want to demolish

these buildings, we have to move the people away

and to resettle them elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is this: if the people who are

resettled were to live in Housing Board flats,

they would pay a very low rent at present, and

communications and transport are usually very

convenient. So in this respect their expenditure

has been reduced correspondingly. But if we

demolish these houses and resettle the people

elsewhere - we probably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



would put them somewhere far away and farther than

their present places

-  then as a result they would have to pay more

for their transport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is rent. If we resettle them, the

new rent will be higher than the present rent. For

example, if the present rent is $40 for two rooms

and one hall, then in the new place which has one

hall and one room, the rent is $46. So this

unavoidably brings about a greater burden on these

people. The difference in the rent is $20 or more,

and the burden is correspondingly higher.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the problem of removal. When these

people move out, they have to get a lorry with two

or three labourers to carry the furniture. But the

Housing Board does not seem to think it necessary

to give them any allowance for removal expenses.

They do not consider it at all necessary to grant

them any allowance for removal. I think this is

most improper. I think this is a great burden on

them, as on removal they have to spend more money.

If we do not consider these points and continue to

neglect these problems and let the people just

suffer in silence, then the problem will be

aggravated as time goes by.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now about the land which is required by the

Government for development. We all know that many

shops in Chinatown pay very low rents and, as a re

sult, their businesses can carry on. But as a

result of resettlement, these people are moved to

flats or shops which are built by the Housing

Board. Of course, this is good. The new flats are

quite pretty and well constructed. But their rent

is about four times the rent paid by these shops

in Chinatown. The Housing Board rent would be

about $400. This is about four times higher than

the old rent, which is about $100. Moreover, in

the new environment, whether the business will be

as good as before remains to be seen. In many

instances   -    there are some in my constituency



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



-    the problem of resettlement is a very serious

one. Many businessmen in my constituency have

complained to me that after moving in to their new

place, it will take them a few years before their

business can pick up and reach the level of their

former business. I hope the Minister will consider

the points I have raised. The people who are being

resettled should be given some sort of

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as far as the shops are con-cerned,

they should be given some subsidy for the rent. Of

course, this subsidy does exist now, but it is not

given to everybody. The system is by tender. If

the tender is for $800, then the shop' will have

to pay $800. Three years' concession is given. If

the basic value of this building is $400, they

have to pay $400 in the first year. In the second

year, they have to pay 50 per cent of the tender

value, which is $600. In the third year they have

to pay $800. As far as the small businessmen are

concerned, this is a heavy blow. I hope the

Minister will pay attention to this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I know that the Ministry of National

Development is in charge of many matters. It is in

charge, for example, of the Primary Production

Department, Urban and Rural Services, Car Parks

and so on.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tasks, which are in the interest of our

economy, have been carried out very efficiently.

But as far as the Primary Production Department is

concerned, there are some aspects to which proper

attention has not been given. For example, last

year, there were two outbreaks of swine fever.

This not only caused a great loss to the farmers

but also reduced the consumption of pork by the

people. This is due to the neglect of the Primary

Production Department. I hope the authorities will

pay more attention to this matter. The Primary

Production Department should look after the

interests of the farmers,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



whether they are rearing pigs, chickens, goats,

cattle, ducks or other animals. They should plan

beforehand and take preventive measures so that our

farmers will not suffer further financial losses.

Another point is that the officers in the Primary

Production Department should explain to the farmers

the desirability of their services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as car parks are concerned, a

problem remains to be solved. We know that the

construction of car parks has three objectives.

First, to create more employment opportunities for

the people.

Second, to increase revenue for Government. Third.

to improve the traffic system. These objectives are

sound. However, the Department is building car-parking spaces almost everywhere. This has caused a

great deal of inconvenience to the people. For

example, the business of the shop-keepers has been

affected. Taxi drivers have complained that their

former taxi stands have been converted into car-parking spaces. This has caused some inconvenience

to them. Therefore. I hope when the relevant

departments are drawing up lots for parking, they

will consider the businesses around those places.

They should also consider the welfare of the taxi

drivers. All these people pay taxes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I hope the Minister will

consider and which I hope he will not misunderstand

me is this. Arab Street is usually the place where

I catch my taxi to go to Sembawang. The taxi

drivers there have complained to me that there are

no taxi stands in Arab Street and they are often

booked by traffic policemen. At one time the Taxi

Drivers' Association made a request to have a taxi

stand in Arab Street, but the relevant department

said that the streets were too narrow and not

suitable for the construction of taxi stands.

Therefore, their request was turned down. Not long

after that, car-parking lots were drawn up at the

same spot for the use of private cars. If private

cars can be parked there, taxis can also be parked

there. However, when the policemen see the taxi

drivers parking there, they will charge them for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



parking their cars there. Is this not inconsistent?

I hope the Minister will explain to me this

contradiction. If he wishes to shift the

responsibility to the Ministry of Defence, I hope

the Minister of Defence will give a satisfactory

answer because his Ministry is in charge of traffic

policemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to urban and rural services, I have

nothing but praise. But sometimes there has been

delay in carrying out certain projects. I suggest

that we should have a supervisory projects

committee with two objectives. First, to increase

the speed in carrying out the projects. Second, to

supervise the contractors in carrying out the work

in order to prevent any malpractices on the part of

the contractors. What the Member for Delta has

raised just now is very correct. We often receive a

lot of complaints. I admit that our Minister is a

capable and upright man. Maybe he does not have the

time to hear, the complaints that we receive. So I

would like the relevant department to take note of

this problem. I personally know that some shop-keepers have been evicted and have great difficulty

in finding alternative location. The department

tells them that they cannot find other

accommodation for them because other shop-keepers

have been given accommodation. At the same time,

the Land Office will go on collecting rent from

them. How can the small businessmen maintain their

livelihood when the Land Office continues to

collect rent from them? I hope the Minister will

consider all these points.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I have only one point to bring to

the notice of the Minister. I was told that the

number -of pigs slaughtered at the new Jurong

central abattoir is not satisfactory. For example,

I understand that in one hour at the present

abattoir in French Road they slaughter about 100

pigs, whereas at Jurong they only slaughter about

ten for the same length of time. If this is true,

will the Minister make a statement and, at the same

time, consider changing the mechanised system into

a manual system as at present?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sir, I have a point to ask the Minister. In his

answer to the previous question, he said that it

was a good thing that it rained, because our

reservoirs are now full. But when it rains,

certain things happen. For the past few days we

have seen that after a heavy rain many places have

been flooded, whether in the rural or city area,

and also in the new housing estates. For example,

in Queenstown Estate, whenever it rains, the

Queensway Circus is flooded. We know that the

flood water causes a lot of inconvenience to the

people. This is especially so -after classes when

the students find it difficult to go home. At the

same time, we see that the places which have been

flooded are the scenes of many obstructions. After

each flood the Government will lose a lot of money

in repairing -roads which have been damaged by the

floods. I wish to ask whether the Minister has an

island-wide anti-flood project in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I have a complaint about

the abattoir, a complaint similar to that of the

Member for Aljunied. I am told that the modern

abattoir at Jurong is not designed for locally-reared pigs, and that Ihere are some defects

somewhere in the system itself. I am not well

versed in machinery and therefore cannot describe

the defects.

The device - I use the word "device"

-    in the abattoir is not big enough for our

pigs to go in. It is too small for our local pigs

to he slaughtered.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the abattoir has been installed

on a Danish design. Whether it is right or wrong,

I stand to be corrected. Nevertheless, I wish to

know from the Minister what action he proposes to

take to rectify the defects in the abattoir.

Otherwise the capital expenditure on this abattoir

is a wastage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, if I can deal with the question

of the abattoir', according to the Member for

Aljunied, the number of pigs that can be

slaughtered at the abattoir at French Road is 100

pigs an hour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Manual slaughtering?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, by manual slaughtering. And you

give me the credit of knowing the difference

between the ahattoir at French Road and the

abattoir at Jurong. I am not conversant with the

facts that both Members allege. In fact, as far as

I am aware, before the swine fever epidemic. 3,000

pigs a day were being slaughtered. Assuming the

Member for Aljunied's figures are correct, 100

pigs per hour working 24 hours =

2,400 pigs. This is still less than the number of

pigs slaughtered before. But after the swine fever

epidemic had started and after rumours about

eating vaccinated pork went round Singapore,

people were afraid to consume pork and the number

of pigs slaughtered dropped from 3,000 to 100. No

pigs were slaughtered, not because the abattoirs

had not the means, hut because butchers could not

sell their pork and farmers were not interested in

having their pigs slaughtered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b>

If the Minister will give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If I have finished with

the Member for Mountbatten on the question of

pigs, I am prepared to give way for clarification.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten alleges that the

Danish design of the abattoir does not suit local

pigs. This I find it difficult to understand. I am

sure the shape of the pigs here is the sanie as

that in Denmark, and I am not sure that our pigs

are bigger than the Danish pigs. I thought it was

the other way round. I will now listen to the

Member for Aljunied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> The information that I have got only

two days ago is that 100 pigs were slaughtered and

not at the period when there was swine fever.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> If 3,000 pigs were slaughtered

before the swine fever, I cannot understand why

suddenly the abattoirs cannot cope with the same

number of pigs that were slaughtered before. The

Member for Aljunied says that he only got this

information two days ago. I have not even heard

about it. I suggest he send my Ministry the facts

and probably ask me another question in Parliament

so that I will be in a better position to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other four Members, we heard two

election speeches and two complaints. Both the

Member for Delta and the Member for Sembawang had

occasion to praise the Government's efforts at

urban renewal. But they raised complaints about

resettlement and enhanced rentals for Housing

Board shops.

I hope both Members will realise that

it is not possible to satisfy everyone's needs. To

give you an example, when Queenstown was first

built, no one wanted to go there. Now everyone

wants to go to Queenstown. Of course, you cannot

get there because the flats are occupied. At the

moment, few are happy to go to Toa Payoh. Tenants

are very choosy. They not only want the particular

area, but they also want a particular floor, not

too high, not too low. Sometimes they want the

corner flat. As far as is possible, we accommodate

them. But someone has to go to the top, someone to

the bottom, someone in the middle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised to hear the Member for Delta

saying that resettlement went well until a year or

so ago when resettlement officials adopted a

different attitude. They were rather harsh and

demanding, she alleges. And perhaps she says it is

because there is no Opposition that these things

are happening. I can assure the Member for Delta

that the officials of my Ministry were not afraid

of the Barisan Sosialis. Either we have urban

renewal or we do not. In the process of urban

renewal, people must be inconvenienced.

Shopkeepers have to move out. Residents have to

move out. We cannot satisfy everybody. Otherwise

we will never evict the occupiers and, in fact, it

takes a very, very long time before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



complete vacant possession of any property is

obtained. Shopkeepers, as the Member for Delta has

pointed out, pay cheaper rents than the shops they

occupy in Housing Board accommodation. They always

grumble. But this tender system appears to be the

fairest system and the best way to get at an

economic rent. When tenders are called for, there

are no allegations of corruption. The Government

is already subsidising, and subsidising heavily,

Housing Board flats. What you are asking the

Government now to do is also to subsidise

businesses. This I am afraid my Ministry will not

recommend to the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang blames the Primary

Production Department of the Ministry of National

Development for the outbreak of swine fever in

Singapore. He says this was due to the neglect of

the Department particularly in not taking

preventive measures. I have stated in this House

before and I will state it again. The swine fever

spread from Thailand to the north of Malaya. From

northern Malaya it made its way down to Kuala

Lumpur, then into Johore Bahru, and then across

the Causeway into Singapore. It did not start

here. It came in. What could we do? Prevent pigs

from conhing into Singapore! We could have imposed

a ban but then there would have been smuggling of

pigs. All sorts of things are smuggled into Singa

pore, not only pigs but human beings too. This is

a good place. Everyone wants to come here. To have

imposed a ban on pigs at the time would have meant

that infected pigs would have been smuggled in. We

therefore did not impose a ban in order to keep an

eye on the pigs across the Causeway. And when we

discovered a lorry load of pigs

- pigs that were actually suffering from the

disease - we had to impose a ban, which we did.

But I can assure you that the swine fever in

Singapore has not been caused by any neglect in

the Primary Production Department. In fact, the

officials of the Department should be praised for

the preventive measures that they have taken

since. It was difficult explaining to the farmers

the necessity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



for vaccination, and at first they could not be

convinced. They were only convinced after the

disease reached their farms. But officials of the

Department had been working overtime on Saturdays

and Sundays not only in vaccinating the pigs but

also in explaining the disease and its results and

effects to the farmers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang, dealing with car

parks, complains that parking places are all over

the town - or is it all over the island? If it is

all over the island, perhaps he will tell me

whether there are any in Sembawang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose and spoke in Mandarin.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I am afraid I am at a disadvantage,

Sir, because I do not have my earphone and I do

not understand Mandarin.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He refers to one case, Arab Street, from where

he takes his taxi to Sembawang, and there is a

demand for taxi-stands there. I assume he has been

going to Arab Street for a long time. I am

surprised that he has just had occasion to raise

this complaint in Parliament. He praises me and my

Ministry for the work done and at the same time he

says that probably I have not got the time to deal

with all these little matters. I can assure him

that I have plenty of time to deal with every

little matter which he wishes to put on my desk. I

will certainly go into this. I am only sorry that

it was not raised earlier. Hundreds of complaints

and grouses come up to my Ministry and all are

investigated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also suggested a supervisory committee in

respect of the Urban and Rural Services Committee.

We already have one committee, the U.R.S.C. We now

have another committe called the Projects Committe

to look into requests approved or disapproved by

the U.R.S.C.   There was an adjournment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



debate in this House running down the Projects

Committee. "Two committees were too much." And now

he wants a third committee called the Supervisory

Committee to look after contractors and

complaints. Complaints can always be sent to the

U.R.S.C., whether in respect of contractors or

otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will be brief in dealing with the Member

for Jurong who, in my view, was out of order when

he spoke on floods. Many questions have been asked

in this House about floods and flooded areas and

the schemes and measures we have to alleviate

these floods. I do not propose to go into the

details again. The reason that has been put

forward for flooding is a high tide accompanied by

very heavy rain. But it is significant that in

Singapore we do not have the floods that Malaysia

has, unfortunately, to undergo. At present, there

are floods in Kota Tinggi which were caused by

heavy rain over a fortnight. In Singapore, we are

inconvenienced more than anything else. But we

have measures and schemes which are being put into

operation. But I doubt very much whether we can

reach the happy position where there will be no

flooding in any street in Singapore. All you have

to have is a high spring tide and you will have

floods in Telok Ayer. After all, we are a small

island and it is difficult to keep the tides out.

When the high tide comes in and the rain pours, we

are in trouble. But a major scheme is being

undertaken along Bukit Timah Road where, as I have

stated in the House before, we are cutting two

canals - one to Ulu Pandan and the other to

Kallang - to divert the flood waters from the

Bukit Timah area into Ulu Pandan and Kallang, so

that if the floods are not completely eliminated

in the more seriously affected areas like the

University area, at least the severity of the

floods will be considerably reduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1111 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1111 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead

1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am concerned about small

industries, workshops and warehouses which have

been displaced as a result of the "Golden Mile"

Project. A lot of these trades have found their

own accommodation either because they refused to

be re-located to the rural areas or no suitable

alternative acconhmodation could be offered by the

Housing and Development Board. Under these

circumstances, they had no alternative but to

carry on their businesses in whatever

accommodation they could obtain. A problem now

arises from their applications to the C.B.S.'s

Department for a change of use of their present

premises to suit their trades or to build

warehouses for their stock-in-trade. More often

than not, their applications are usually not

favourably considered. What is worse is that

subsequently they are served with notices of

demolition of the present structures into which

they have moved and are carrying on their

businesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to relax

certain regulations governing the change of use of

premises or building by-laws if the applicants are

displaced as a result of urban renewal with a view

to allowing them to carry on their trades for a

temporary period. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do agree

that there must be a certain amount of control

over the use of land or its development to comply

with the Master Plan, but special consideration

surely can be given to these displaced industries.

Surely, it is not the intention of the Government

to see a complete stoppage of operations of the

existing small trades or industries. On the

contrary, they should be allowed to carry on in

order to adapt themselves to the changing

circumstances and should be given technical or

financial assistance to expand their businesses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

amendment (2)*  stands in my name. It is actually

the same as amendment (1) except for the sum to be

reduced.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (2) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1111 be reduced by the whole sum in respect of subhead 1001.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to dwell on amendment (I) which

was moved by the Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this concerns the Building Survey Division

which is headed by the Chief Building Surveyor. I

wish to bring the following matters to the

attention of the Minister for Law and National

Development. One is with regard to the issue of

temporary permits by the Department concerned at a

fee of $12 per year. Originally, this fee was $2

in respect of any temporary structure put up, but

it appears to me that from 1966 onwards it has

been increased to $12 - a very, very high increase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I wish to point out is this.

A temporary permit is issued for the erection of a

dwelling-house of a temporary nature, a pigsty and

a bangsal. But what I am more concerned with is

the increase of fees from $2 to $12 especially

with regard to pigsties.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you build two pigsties, you pay $24. If you

build three, you pay $36. I hope the Minister will

consider that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, along that line, as I pointed out when

I was debating on the Property Tax Division

yesterday. I said that to obtain a house number,

much time is taken up and the applicant has to

wait for months before he ultimately gets a house

number. But before that, he must obtain a

temporary permit for which he has to pay $12, and

which has to be renewed every year. In addition to

paying for a temporary permit for a dwelling

house, the property tax has also to be considered.

I am not talking about property tax now. I am

dwelling on the fee for temporary permits, which I

hope will be reduced.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point pertains to the application for

the necessary permit to reconstruct an existing

building, i.e., a numbered building. I am afraid I

have to spend a little time on details, and I hope

the House will bear with me.. First of all, the

applicant fills in a prescribed form issued by the

Chief Building Surveyor's Department. In addition

to it, he has to purchase from the Planning

Department some site plans. On top of that, he has

to make out a couple of layouts of the building

plan, not forgetting that he has to obtain the

landowner's permission if he wishes to extend his

house. And if the landowner refuses to sign, the

applicant will not be able to make the necessary

application. I will deal with this a little later,

Sir, but first the application for reconstruction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been brought to my notice that there has

been much delay in the processing of these

applications. A number of applicants have seen me

on this and have appealed for a more simplified

method whereby the rural folk will not be too much

inconvenienced in having to wait for three or six

months before they get the necessary permission to

reconstruct their houses. And if they were to do

it without the necessary permit, Sir - it is a

well-known fact that the reconstruction will be un

authorised - the Chief Building Surveyor's

Department would step in and issue the necessary

notice, and subsequently a summons, stating that

such unauthorised structures should be demolished

within a certain time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the other point where the

landowner's permission is required. A number of

landowners have been reluctant to agree to

reconstruction, and especially extensions, with

the result that the rural folk have nowhere to

appeal for a reconsideration of their cases. They

would find extreme difficulty in getting a permit

to reconstruct their houses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask the Minister for Law and

National Development to look into this matter.

Indeed it is no use to pretend that there has been

no delay. I

have raised this matter with the department

concerned on quite a number of occasions, and I

mention it again in this House; sometimes I get a

very blunt reply, if not none at all. And this

centres on the difficulties faced by an applicant -

his house is in a state of near collapse and he is

unable to obtain the necessary permit to

reconstruct it. And he cannot reconstruct it

without proper permission. And whoever contravenes

the Local Government Integration Ordinance, 1963 -

I believe it is section 52 - will be charged in

court for putting up an unauthorised structure. I

sincerely hope the Minister will look into this

matter with a view to solving the difficulties

encountered by those who apply for such permits.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are on amendments (1) and (2) in

respect of subhead 1001. Mr Barker.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, before I reply, perhaps we can

take amendment (3)* together?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (3), standing in the names of Inche Mohd. Ariff bin Suradi, Mr. Tang See Chim, and Madam Chan Choy Siong, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 1111 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes. Amendment (3). Inche Mohd. Ariff is not here. Mr Tang See Chim is not here. Madam Chan.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not moving.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong, do you want to

speak?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, if I may deal with the

Member for Mountbatten first. Various problems have

arisen when owners of industries, workshops and

warehouses affected by the "Golden Mile"

development have had to be resited. As I stated in

answer to a question by the hon. Member some time

ago, most of those affected by the "Golden Mile"

scheme have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



accommodated to their satisfaction. But there are

still cases outstanding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Point of clarification, Sir,I

am not talking about those outstanding cases. I am

talking about those who found their own alternative

accommodation elsewhere, and they had difficulty in

getting their applications approved for a change in

the use of the land to build a warehouse.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That is the point I am getting to,

Sir,I mentioned that most of the cases have been

satisfactorily solved and a few have not. And these

few cases have not been settled because, having

left the "Golden Mile", they sought other

accommodation and occupied other pieces of land

without consulting the relevant department. If they

had consulted the proper authority, they would have

been advised what land they could occupy and for

what purpose. Buying a piece of residential land,

setting up a factory, and then running to the

Planning Chief and saying, "Please give me

permission to change the zone from residential to

industrial," after the event as it were, has led to

all these problems. In fact, these people do not

deserve sympathy. But every consideration is being

given by the relevant department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the Member for

Mountbatten, besides areas which are presently

zoned as industrial land on the Master Plan, there

are areas which can allow for industries and ware

houses. The Planning Department in the Ministry

have designated three other large areas for the

resettlement of industries affected by the Urban Re

newal Scheme. These three large areas are Kampong

Chai Chee (7th mile Changi), Teck Hock Village (8th

mile Tampines Road), and the South-east portion of

Bukit Panjang Town Map Area, which adjoins the

existing industrial zone. But if the Member's con

stituents choose to go into other areas and then

decide to apply for rezoning, I say they are

looking for trouble. Each



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



application for a change of use of premises is

considered on its own merits. This must be so,

having regard to the nature of the proposed use

and the existing surrounding development. But the

Development Control Committee of the Ministry of

National Development has, in fact, relaxed its

control in many cases to allow industries on a

temporary basis in an area strictly prohibited

under the Master Plan zoning. But there are some

cases, where, because of the previous history of

the premises and the nature of the industry, the

applications have had to be refused.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now deal with the Member for Punggol

who has raised two or three points. The first is

the increase of fees from $2 to $12 for temporary

structures; second, he complains about delays;

and, thirdly, he complains about landowners

refusing to sign applications either to build or

rebuild the premises. If I can deal with

landowners first. Under our building by-laws,

landowners have to give their consent and, if the

landowners refuse to give their consent, surely

you cannot blame the Chief Building Surveyor.

Blame the landowner, blame our laws, but not the

Chief Building Surveyor. But we happen to be

discussing the Chief Building Surveyor's

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I can go on to the delays which the

Member alleges. He says it is no use pretending

that there are no delays. I am instructed that it

is not true that applications are delayed for six

months or more as alleged. What usually happens is

that the applicants have not put up their

applications properly. Sometimes certain details

have been left out, and when the application is

flung back, so to speak, to the applicant, nothing

comes back. And one common reason for the delays

is the fact that many applicants cannot get the

approval of the landowner to carry out whatever

they want to do. If I may say so, to complicate

matters, Members of Parliament are often

misinformed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



when they try to intervene on behalf of the

applicants. But here the Member for Punggol is

speaking generally and I am replying generally. I

cannot do otherwise until he gives me the facts

and the specific cases. I say once again in this

House, if you have a case of delay or if you have

dozens of cases of delay, fling them at the

Minister for National Development. He will look into them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point which was raised by the Member

for Punggol is the increase of fees from $2 to

$12. The facts are as follows. Prior to the coming

into force of the Local Government Building Re

gulations, 1966, the temporary permit fee charged

for the rural areas by the Rural Board was $5 per

annum for the permit and $2 per annum for

renewals. This was the previous position. In the

city area the Chief Building Surveyor charged a

fee of $6 per annum for each permit for renewal.

So for the rural areas, $5 per permit, $2 for

renewal. For the city area $6 for the permit. $6

for renewal, So it has not gone up six times, as

the Member's speech may have indicated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the

Minister. It is clearly stated that the fee for

the temporary permit is $12 per year for renewal.

Formerly it was $2 in the rural areas. Now it is

$12 per year. There is an increase.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Yes, there is. But it was $6 for

renewal in the urban area. That is admitted. But I

think we are wasting our time over these figures.

With the integration of the two and in view of the

increase in administrative costs, the fees were

changed with a flat rate of $12 per annum for a

temporary permit for renewal. On this, I am some

what inclined to agree with the Member for Punggol

that the present fee appears to be rather high and

I promise him that I will look into it. I make no

promise of any decrease. But I promise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



him that I will look into it with a view to

meeting his request. I think that winds up the

session.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> I withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,130,190 for Head 1111 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.
